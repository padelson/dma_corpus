submissions and base its determination solely on such submissions. In

value to any item greater than the maximum value for such item claimed by
either party or less than the minimum value for such item claimed by either
party. The decision of the Independent Accountant shall be deemed final
and binding upon the parties and enforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction and the Independent Accountants final calculation of the Sponsor
Transaction Expenses shall be deemed the " _Final Sponsor Transaction
Expenses_ " and the Independent Accountants final calculation of the Company
Transaction Expenses shall be deemed the " _Final Company Transaction
Expenses._ " The fees and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be
allocated to be paid by the Sponsor, on the one hand, and the Company, on the
other, based upon the percentage that the portion of the contested amount not
awarded to each Party bears to the amount actually contested by such Party, as

Adjustment Amount _divided by_ (y) ten dollars ($10), (B) the Buyer shall

number of Company Units and shares of Buyer Class V Voting Stock equal to the
_quotient of_ (x) the absolute value of the Net Company Enterprise Value
Adjustment Amount divided by (y) ten dollars ($10), and (B) the Company and
the Buyer shall automatically cancel and retire such Company Units and shares
of Buyer Class V Voting Stock, respectively, with no further action by any
other Person. The Parties agree to treat the issuance or forfeiture of any

(d) Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.16(d)_ of the Company and

benefit or compensation otherwise payable or required to be provided to any
current or former officer, employee, director or individual independent

(f) Neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement could reasonably be
expected to, either alone or in conjunction with any other event, result in
the payment of any amount that could, individually or in combination with any
other payment, constitute a "parachute payment" (as defined in Section
280G(b)(2) of the Code). Except as set forth on _Section_ __ _ 3.16(f)_ of
the Company and Sellers Disclosure Letter, no RSI Company has agreed to
pay, gross-up, reimburse or otherwise indemnify any Person for any Tax

of coverage as are customary for companies of a similar nature and size
operating in the industries in which the RSI Companies operate (the "

Insurance Policies or of any material changes that are required in the
conduct of the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a

under, nor has it taken any action or failed to take any

 



62

    

 action which, with notice or the lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
material breach or material default under, or permit a material increase in
premium, cancellation, material reduction in coverage, material denial or
non-renewal with respect to any Insurance Policy. Except as set forth on
_Section_ __ _ 3.17_ of the Company and Sellers Disclosure Letter, during

terms and conditions of such Permits. All of such Permits are valid and in
full force and effect and none of such Permits will be terminated as a result
of, or in connection with, the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. No RSI Company is in material default under any such
Permit and to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that, with
the giving of notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a material
default under such Permit, and no Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge
of the Company, threatened, to suspend, revoke, withdraw, modify or limit any
such Permit in a manner that has had or would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the ability of the applicable RSI Company to use

as of the date hereof, Buyer does not know of any facts or circumstances that
may reasonably be expected to result in any of the conditions set forth in any
Subscription Agreement not being satisfied, or the PIPE Investment Amount not
being available to Buyer, on the Closing Date. No event has occurred that,
with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a default or
breach on the part of Buyer under any material term or condition of any such
Subscription Agreement and, as of the date hereof, Buyer has no reason to
believe that it will be unable to satisfy in all material respects on a
timely basis any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it contained

of the conditions precedent (other than the conditions contained in the other
Transaction Agreements) to the obligations of the Equity Financing Sources to

to a Pre-Closing Tax Period:

(i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed for a

multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the
portion of the taxable period ending on and including the Closing Date and the
denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period;

 

(ii) in the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including Taxes
based on or measured by income, receipts, payments, or payroll (to the extent
not covered by clauses (i)-(ii) above)), the amount allocable to the Pre-

(iii) in the case of Taxes in the form of interest, penalties or additions,
all such Taxes shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period

accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the Closing Date.

diligently and in good faith and consult with the Buyer in good faith

applicable, state and local) income Tax purposes, they intend that (i) the
transaction contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)(A)_ be treated as a
contribution of the Contribution Amount and an amount equal to the Transaction
Expenses by the Buyer to the Company governed by Section 721 of the Code,
(ii) the transaction contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(i)(B)_ be treated
as sale as of the Closing Date of the Purchased Closing Company Units by
Sellers to the Buyer in exchange for the Purchased Company Unit Closing Cash
Consideration and certain rights provided under the Tax Receivable Agreement,
which sale is a taxable transaction under Section 741 of the Code and gives
rise to an adjustment to the Buyers tax basis in the direct and indirect
assets of the Company pursuant to Section 743(b) of the Code, and (iii) the
transaction contemplated by _Section 2.1(b)(ii)_ and _Section 2.1(b)(iii)_
be treated as a sale of the Redeemed Post-Closing Company Units by the
Sellers to the Buyer in exchange for the amount of cash distributed pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(iii)_ and certain rights provided

 



107

    

 under the Tax Receivable Agreement, which sale is a taxable transaction
under Section 741 of the Code and gives rise to an adjustment to the Buyers
tax basis in the direct and indirect assets of the Company pursuant to
Section 743(b) of the Code (the " _Post-Closing Sale_ ") (collectively, the "
_Intended Tax Treatment_ ").

 

(g) Within one hundred eighty (180) days following the final determination of
the Final Sponsor Transaction Expenses and the Final Company Transaction
Expenses, the Buyer will prepare, and deliver (or cause to be prepared and
delivered) to Sellers Representative, (i) an allocation statement allocating
the Purchased Company Unit Closing Cash Consideration and the amount of cash
distributed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)(iii)_, and any other amounts
treated as consideration for U.S. federal income Tax purposes with respect to
the Sale and the Post-Closing Sale among the assets of the RSI Companies that
are classified as entities that are disregarded as separate from the Company
for U.S. federal income Tax purposes (the " _Allocation_ ") and (ii) a balance
sheet, as of the Closing Date, that sets out the Tax basis of the assets then
owned by the RSI Companies that are classified as entities that are
disregarded as separate from the Company for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
on the Closing Date and the amount of the liabilities of the Company and such
Company Subsidiaries on the Closing Date (the " _Tax Basis Balance Sheet_ ").
The Allocation shall contain sufficient detail to permit the Parties to make
the computations and adjustments required under Sections 734(b), 743(b), 751
and 755 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within thirty
(30) days after the receipt of the Tax Basis Balance Sheet and Allocation, the
Sellers Representative will propose any changes or will indicate its
concurrence therewith. If the Buyer and Sellers Representative do not agree
with the Tax Basis Balance Sheet or Allocation, then the Buyer and Sellers
Representative shall attempt in good faith to reach agreement on the Tax
Basis Balance Sheet or the Allocation, as applicable, in a manner consistent
with applicable income Tax Law. If the Buyer and Sellers Representative
cannot reach agreement on the Tax Basis Balance Sheet or the Allocation within
fifteen (15) days after receipt of the Sellers Representatives proposed
changes, then the Buyer and Sellers Representative shall submit the dispute
to a nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to the Buyer
and Sellers Representative (the " _Tax Accounting Firm_ ") for resolution,
acting as an accounting expert (and not as an arbitrator). For this purpose,
(x) the Tax Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any disputed
item greater than the greatest value for such disputed item claimed by any
party or less than the lowest value for such disputed item claimed by any
party and (y) all fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be
performed by the Tax Accounting Firm will be allocated between the Buyer on
the one hand, and Sellers Representative, on the other hand, in the same
proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed items so submitted to the
Tax Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such Party (as
finally determined by the Tax Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of
such disputed items so submitted. The Tax Basis Balance Sheet and the
Allocation, as agreed to by the Buyer and Sellers Representative or as
finally determined by the Tax Accounting Firm, as the case may be, shall be
binding on all Parties (the " _Final Tax Basis Balance Sheet_ " and the "
_Final Allocation,_ " respectively). Within thirty (30) days following each
of the Sale and the Post-Closing Sale, the Buyer shall deliver a Section 743
notification to the Company in accordance with Treasury Regulation Section
1.743-1(k)(2). The Parties also agree that no value shall be allocated to the
Buyer Class V Voting

 



108

    

 Stock and shall report consistently with such determination for U.S. federal
(and applicable state and local) income Tax purposes.

 

(h) The Parties shall, and shall cause each of their respective applicable
Affiliates to: (1) prepare and file all Tax Returns consistent with the Final
Tax Basis Balance Sheet, Final Allocation and Intended Tax Treatment
(collectively, the " _Tax Positions_ "); (2) take no position in any
communication (whether written or unwritten) with any Governmental Entity or
any other action inconsistent with the Tax Positions; (3) promptly inform each
other of any challenge by any Governmental Entity to any portion of the Tax
Positions; (4) consult with and keep one another informed with respect to the
status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with respect to, any
such challenge to any portion of the Tax Positions; and (5) use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to defend the Tax Positions in
any Tax Proceeding.

(i) Without the prior written consent of the Buyer, Sellers and the Company
shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates not to, make or cause
to be made any election under Treasury Regulation Section 301.9100-22 (or any
similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Laws) with respect to any RSI
Company. With respect to any Tax Proceeding of any RSI Company treated as a
partnership for federal income Tax purposes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
any Straddle Period and for which the election provided for in Section 6226 of
the Code (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S. Laws) is
available (such election a " _Section_ __ _ 6226 Election_"), the Company
shall (and Buyer shall cause the Company to), and shall cause their respective
eligible Subsidiaries to, timely make such Section 6226 Election in
accordance with applicable Laws (and Sellers expressly consent to, and shall
reasonably cooperate to the extent requested by Buyer in, the making of all
such available elections). The Company shall (and Buyer shall cause the
Company to), and shall cause all of its respective eligible Subsidiaries, if
any, to, make or cause to remain in effect, as applicable, a valid election
under Section 754 of the Code (and any similar provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Law) for any taxable period that includes the Closing Date (and, with
respect to the Company and its eligible Subsidiaries, if any, for any taxable
period that includes the date of any Exchange (as defined in the Company AandR
LPA)).

material respect any of its representations or warranties contained in this

shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and assigns; _provided_ that neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder may be assigned or

not permitted under this _Section_ __ _ 11.5_ shall be null and void.

 

Section 11.6 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this
Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid
under applicable Law, but if any provision of this Agreement or the
application of any such provision to any Person or circumstance shall be held
to be prohibited by or invalid, illegal or unenforceable under applicable Law
in any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction, such provision shall be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, illegality
or unenforceability, without invalidating the remainder of such provision or
the remaining provisions of this Agreement. Furthermore, in lieu of such
illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision, there shall be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a legal, valid and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such illegal, invalid, or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

Section 11.7 _Interpretation_. The headings and captions used in this
Agreement and the table of contents to this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Any capitalized terms used in any Disclosure Letter, Schedule
or Exhibit attached hereto or delivered at the same time and not otherwise
defined therein shall have the meanings set forth in this Agreement. The use
of the word "including" herein shall mean "including without limitation." The
words "hereof," "herein," and "hereunder" and words of similar import, when
used in this Agreement, shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to
any particular provision of this Agreement. References herein to a specific

or Exhibit shall refer, respectively, to Sections, Subsections, Clauses,
Recitals, Sections of a Disclosure Letter, Schedules or Exhibits of this
Agreement. Terms defined in the singular shall have a comparable meaning when
used in the plural, and vice versa. References herein to any gender shall

the context clearly requires the selection of one (1) (but not more than one
(1)) of a number of items. References to "written" or "in writing" include in
electronic form. References herein to any Person shall include such Persons
heirs, executors, personal representatives, administrators, successors and
permitted assigns; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this

otherwise permitted by this Agreement. References herein to a Person in a
particular capacity or capacities shall exclude such Person in any other
capacity. Any reference to "days" shall mean calendar days unless Business

including" and the words "to" and "until" each means "to but excluding."
References herein to any Law shall be deemed also to refer to such Law, as

has breached any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement in any respect, the fact that there exists another
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement relating to the same subject
matter (regardless of the relative levels of specificity) which the Party has
not breached shall not detract from or mitigate the fact that the Party is in
breach of the first representation, warranty, covenant or agreement. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" (or similar phrases) shall mean the
degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase shall not
mean simply "if." An accounting term not otherwise defined in this Agreement
has the meaning assigned to it in accordance with GAAP. Except where otherwise
provided, all amounts in this Agreement are stated and shall be paid in
United States dollars. The Parties and their respective counsel have reviewed
and negotiated this Agreement as the joint agreement and understanding of the
Parties, and the language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the
language chosen by the Parties to express their mutual intent, and no rule of
strict construction shall be applied against any Person. Any information or
materials shall be deemed provided, made available or delivered to the Buyer

Agreement (the " _Data Room_ ") or otherwise provided to the Buyers
representatives (including counsel) via electronic mail, in each case, prior

discussions (including that certain non-binding letter of intent among the
Buyer, the Sponsor, the Company and Neil Bluhm, dated as of June 19, 2020 (the
" _LOI_ ")), whether written or oral, relating to such subject matter in any
way. The Parties have voluntarily agreed to define their rights and
Liabilities with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
exclusively pursuant to the express terms and provisions of this Agreement,
and the Parties disclaim that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any
remedies not set forth in this Agreement. Furthermore, this Agreement embodies
the justifiable expectations of sophisticated parties derived from
arms-length negotiations and no Person has any special relationship with
another Person that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction.

Section 11.9 _Counterparts; Electronic Delivery_. This Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the other agreements, certificates, instruments and
documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement may be executed and delivered
in one or more counterparts and by fax, email or other electronic
transmission, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement. No Party shall raise the use of a
fax machine or email to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature
or agreement or instrument was transmitted or

 



116

    

 communicated through the use of a fax machine or email as a defense to the
formation or enforceability of a Contract and each Party forever waives any
such defense.

 

Section 11.10 _Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction_. The Law of
the State of Delaware shall govern (a) all claims or matters related to or
arising from this Agreement (including any tort or non-contractual claims) and
(b) any questions concerning the construction, interpretation, validity
and enforceability of this Agreement, and the performance of the obligations
imposed by this Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-
of-law or conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Law of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES
(WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED
WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES UNDER
THIS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH
HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND
VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL
COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of first,
the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or if such court declines
jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for the District of Delaware,
in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement, agrees that
all claims in respect of the Proceeding shall be heard and determined in any
such court and agrees not to bring any Proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 11.10_,
however, shall affect the right of any Party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by Law or at equity. Each Party agrees that a final
judgment in any Proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be enforced
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law or at equity.

Section 11.11 _Trust Account Waiver_. Each of the Company and the Sellers
acknowledges that the Buyer has established the Trust Account for the benefit
of its public Buyer Stockholders, which holds proceeds of its initial public
offering. For and in consideration of the Buyer entering into this Agreement
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is hereby acknowledged, each of the Company and the Sellers, for itself
and the Affiliates it has the authority to bind, hereby agrees it does not now
and shall not at any time hereafter have any right, title, interest or claim
of any kind in or to any assets in the Trust Account (or distributions
therefrom to (i) the public Buyer Stockholders upon the redemption of their
shares and (ii) the underwriters of Buyers initial public offering in
respect of their deferred underwriting commissions held in the Trust Account,
in each case as set forth in the Trust Agreement (collectively, the " _Trust
Distributions_ ")), and hereby waives any claims it has or may have at any
time solely against the Trust Account (including the Trust Distributions) as a
result of, or arising out of, any discussions, contracts or agreements
(including this Agreement and the Subscription Agreements) among the Buyer,
the Sellers and the Company and will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account (including the Trust Distributions) for any reason whatsoever. Each of
the Company and the Sellers agree and acknowledge that such irrevocable waiver
is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Buyer and
the Sponsor to induce Buyer and the

 



117

    

 Sponsor to enter in this Agreement, and the Company and the Sellers further
intend and understand such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against
the Company and the Sellers and each of their respective Affiliates that they
have the authority to bind under applicable Law. To the extent the Company or
any Seller or any of their respective Affiliates that the Company or such
Seller, as applicable, has the authority to bind commences any action or
proceeding against the Buyer or any of its Affiliates based upon, in
connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the
Buyer, its Affiliates or its representatives, which Proceeding seeks, in whole
or in part, monetary relief against the Buyer, its Affiliates or its
representatives, each of the Company and the Sellers hereby acknowledge and
agree that the Companys and the Sellers and such Affiliates sole remedy
shall be against assets of the Buyer or such Affiliate or representatives not
in the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit the Company, the
Sellers or such Affiliates (or any Person claiming on any of their behalves)
to have any claim against the Trust Account (including the Trust
Distributions) or any amounts contained in the Trust Account while in the
Trust Account.

 

Section 11.12 _Specific Performance_. Each Party acknowledges that the rights
of each Party to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event any of the provisions of
this Agreement are not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
otherwise are breached, money damages would be inadequate (and therefore the
non-breaching Party would have no adequate remedy at Law) and the non-
breaching Party would be irreparably damaged. Accordingly, each Party agrees
that each other Party shall be entitled to specific performance, an injunction
or other equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security or
needing to prove irreparable harm) to prevent breaches of the provisions of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically this Agreement and the terms and
provisions hereof in any Proceeding, in addition to any other remedy to which
such Person may be entitled. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of specific performance and other equitable relief on the basis that
the other Parties have an adequate remedy at Law or that an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. The
Parties acknowledge and agree that any Party seeking an injunction to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 11.12_
shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in connection
with any such injunction. Without limiting the Companys rights under any
Subscription Agreement to which the Company is a party, with respect to any
Subscription Agreement to which the Company is not a party, the Company shall
be entitled, upon written notice to the Buyer, to (I) require the Buyer to
enforce its rights under such Subscription Agreement through the initiation
and pursuit of litigation (including seeking, or seek or obtain a court order
against the counterparty(ies) to such Subscription Agreement for, injunctive
relief, specific performance, or other equitable relief with respect to such
Subscription Agreement) in the event the counterparty under such Subscription
Agreement is in breach of its obligations thereunder, (II) have approval
rights over Buyers selection of counsel for any such litigation (such
approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (III)
select a separate counsel, which may be or include KandE, to participate
alongside the Buyers counsel in any such litigation (at the expense of the
Company), (IV) fund any such litigation, and (V) require the Buyer to promptly
execute, and the Buyer hereby agrees to execute and comply with, any and all
documents designed to implement or facilitate the execution of the rights
contemplated in this sentence.

 

Section 11.13 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole
benefit of the Parties and their permitted assigns and nothing herein
expressed or implied shall give or be

 



118

    

 construed to give any Person, other than the Parties and such permitted
assigns, any legal or equitable rights hereunder (other than in respect of the
RSI Indemnified Persons and Non-Party Affiliates, each of whom is an express
third-party beneficiary hereunder to the specific provisions in which such
Person is referenced and entitled to enforce only such obligations hereunder).

 

Section 11.14 _Disclosure Letters and Exhibits_. The Disclosure Letters and
Exhibits attached hereto or referred to in this Agreement are (a) each hereby
incorporated in and made a part of this Agreement as if set forth in full
herein and (b) qualified in their entirety by reference to specific provisions
of this Agreement. Any fact or item disclosed in any Section of a Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed disclosed in each other Section of the applicable
Disclosure Letter to which such fact or item may apply so long as (i) such
other Section is referenced by applicable cross-reference or (ii) it is
reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure that such disclosure is
applicable to such other Section or portion of the Disclosure Letter. The
headings contained in the Disclosure Letters are for convenience of reference
only and shall not be deemed to modify or influence the interpretation of the
information contained in the Disclosure Letters or this Agreement. The
Disclosure Letters are not intended to constitute, and shall not be construed
as, an admission or indication that any such fact or item is required to be
disclosed. The Disclosure Letters shall not be deemed to expand in any way the
scope or effect of any representations, warranties or covenants described in
this Agreement. Any fact or item, including the specification of any dollar
amount, disclosed in the Disclosure Letters shall not by reason only of such
inclusion be deemed to be material, to establish any standard of materiality
or to define further the meaning of such terms for purposes of this
Agreement, and matters reflected in the Disclosure Letters are not necessarily
limited to matters required by this Agreement to be reflected herein and may
be included solely for information purposes; and no Party shall use the
fact of the setting of the amounts or the fact of the inclusion of any item
in the Disclosure Letters in any dispute or controversy between the Parties as
to whether any obligation, item or matter not described or included in the
Disclosure Letters is or is not required to be disclosed (including whether
the amount or items are required to be disclosed as material or threatened) or
is within or outside of the Ordinary Course of Business. No disclosure in the
Disclosure Letters relating to any possible breach or violation of any
Contract, Law or Order shall be construed as an admission or indication that
any such breach or violation exists or has actually occurred. Moreover, in
disclosing the information in the Disclosure Letters, Sellers do not waive
any attorney-client privilege associated with such information or any
protection afforded by the work-product doctrine with respect to any of the
matters disclosed or discussed therein. The information contained in the
Disclosure Letters shall be kept strictly confidential by the Parties and no
third party may rely on any information disclosed or set forth therein.

 

Section 11.15 _No Recourse_. Notwithstanding anything that may be expressed or
implied in this Agreement (except in the case of the immediately succeeding
sentence) or any document, agreement, or instrument delivered
contemporaneously herewith, and notwithstanding the fact that any Party may be
a corporation, partnership or limited liability company, each Party hereto,
by its acceptance of the benefits of this Agreement, covenants, agrees and
acknowledges that no Persons other than the Parties shall have any obligation
hereunder and that it has no rights of recovery hereunder against, and no
recourse hereunder or under any documents, agreements, or instruments
delivered contemporaneously herewith or in respect of any oral representations
made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith shall be had
against, any former, current or future director, officer, agent, Affiliate,
manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person, fiduciary,

 



119

    

 representative or employee of any Party (or any of their successors or
permitted assignees), against any former, current, or future general or
limited partner, manager, stockholder or member of any Party (or any of their
successors or permitted assignees) or any Affiliate thereof or against any
former, current or future director, officer, agent, employee, Affiliate,
manager, assignee, incorporator, controlling Person,
fiduciary, representative, general or limited partner, stockholder, manager
or member of any of the foregoing, but in each case not including the Parties
(each, but excluding for the avoidance of doubt, the Parties, a " _Non-Party
Affiliate_"), whether by or through attempted piercing of the corporate veil,
by or through a claim (whether in tort, Contract or otherwise) by or on behalf
of such Party against the Non-Party Affiliates, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any Proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or
other applicable Law, or otherwise; it being agreed and acknowledged that no
personal Liability whatsoever shall attach to, be imposed on, or otherwise be
incurred by any Non-Party Affiliate, as such, for any obligations of the
applicable Party under this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, under any documents or instruments delivered contemporaneously
herewith, in respect of any oral representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, or for any claim (whether in tort, Contract
or otherwise) based on, in respect of, or by reason of, such obligations or
their creation. Notwithstanding the forgoing, a Non-Party Affiliate may have
obligations under any documents, agreements, or instruments delivered
contemporaneously herewith or otherwise required by this Agreement if such
Non-Party Affiliate is party to such document, agreement or instrument. Except
to the extent otherwise set forth in, and subject in all cases to the terms
and conditions of and limitations herein, this Agreement may only be enforced
against, and any claim or cause of action of any kind based upon, arising out
of, or related to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement, may only be brought against the entities that
are named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein with respect to such Party. Each Non-Party
Affiliate is intended as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section_ __ _
11.15_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no
event shall Sellers, the RSI Companies or any of their respective Affiliates
or representatives (a) seek to enforce this Agreement against, make any claims
for breach of this Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages
from, any Equity Financing Source in connection with this Agreement or (b)
seek to enforce the commitments against, make any claims for breach of any
Subscription Agreement against, or seek to recover monetary damages from, or
otherwise sue, any Equity Financing Source for the Permitted Equity Financing
in connection with (i) this Agreement or (ii) the obligations of the Equity
Financing Sources for the Permitted Equity Financing under the applicable
Subscription Agreement. Nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 11.15_ shall in any
way limit or qualify the rights and obligations of the Equity Financing
Sources for the applicable Permitted Equity Financing, the Buyer and the other
parties to the Subscription Agreement to each other thereunder or in
connection therewith.

Section 11.16 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) _Sellers_.

 

(i) Each Party hereby agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its
directors, managers, officers, owners, employees and Affiliates and each of
their successors and assigns (all such parties, the " _Waiving Parties_ "),
that Kirkland and Ellis LLP (or any successor thereto) (" _K andE_") may represent
any RSI Company or any direct or indirect director, manager, officer, owner,
employee or Affiliate

 



120

    

 thereof, in connection with any dispute, claim, Proceeding or Liability
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (any such representation, the "
_Company Post-Closing Representation_ ") notwithstanding its representation
(or any continued representation) of the RSI Companies in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and each Party on behalf of
itself and the Waiving Parties hereby consents thereto and irrevocably waives
(and will not assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising
therefrom or relating thereto, even though the interests of the Company Post-
Closing Representation may be directly adverse to the Waiving Parties.

(ii) Each of the Sellers, the Buyer, the Sponsor and the Company acknowledges
that the foregoing provision applies whether or not KandE provides legal
services to the RSI Companies after the Closing Date. Each of the Sellers, the
Buyer, the Sponsor and the Company, for itself and the Waiving Parties,
hereby irrevocably acknowledges and agrees that all communications among KandE,
the RSI Companies and/or any director, manager, officer, owner, employee or
representative of any of the foregoing made in connection with
the negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or
any dispute, claim, Proceeding or Liability arising out of or relating to,
this Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are
privileged communications and the attorney-client privilege and the
expectation of client confidence belongs solely to the RSI Companies and is
exclusively controlled by the RSI Companies and shall not pass to or be
claimed by the Sellers, the Sellers Representative, Buyer or the Sponsor.
From and after the Closing, none of the Buyer, the Sponsor, any Seller or any
Person purporting to act on behalf of or through the Buyer, the Sponsor,
any Seller or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek to obtain the same by any
process. From and after the Closing, each of the Buyer, the Sponsor and the
Sellers, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties, irrevocably waives and
will not assert any attorney-client privilege with respect to any
communication among KandE, any RSI Company and/or any director, manager,
officer, owner, employee or representative of any of the foregoing occurring
prior to the Closing in connection with any Company Post-Closing
Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a dispute
arises between the Buyer, the Sponsor or any Seller, on the one hand, and a
third party other than an RSI Company, on the other hand, the Buyer, the
Sponsor and any Seller may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications to such third party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither the Buyer nor the Sponsor nor any Seller may waive
such privilege without the prior written consent of an RSI Company.

(b) _Buyer_.

 

(i) Each Waiving Party hereby agrees that White and Case LLP (or any successor
thereto) (" _W andC_") may represent Buyer or Sponsor or any direct or indirect
director, manager, officer, owner, employee or Affiliate of Buyer or Sponsor
(including the RSI Companies and Sponsor), in connection with any 

 



121

    

 dispute, claim, Proceeding or Liability arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby (any such representation, the " _Buyer Post-Closing Representation_
") notwithstanding its representation (or any continued representation) of the
Buyer or Sponsor in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and the Sellers and the Company, on behalf of themselves and the
Waiving Parties, hereby consent thereto and irrevocably waive (and will not
assert) any conflict of interest or any objection arising therefrom or
relating thereto, even though the interests of the Buyer Post-
Closing Representation may be directly adverse to the Waiving Parties.

(ii) Each of the Buyer, the Sellers and the Company acknowledges that the
foregoing provision applies whether or not WandC provides legal services to the
Buyer or Sponsor after the Closing Date. Each of the Buyer, the Company and
each Seller, for itself and the Waiving Parties, hereby irrevocably
acknowledges and agrees that all communications among WandC, the Buyer, the
Sponsor and/or any director, manager, officer, owner, employee or
representative of any of the foregoing made in connection with the
negotiation, preparation, execution, delivery and performance under, or any
dispute, claim, Proceeding or Liability arising out of or relating to, this
Agreement, any Ancillary Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any matter relating to any of the foregoing, are privileged
communications and the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belongs solely to the Sponsor and is exclusively controlled by the
Sponsor and shall not pass to or be claimed by the Buyer, any Seller or any
of the RSI Companies. From and after the Closing, none of the Buyer, the
Company, the Sellers nor any Person purporting to act on behalf of or through
the Buyer, the Company, any Seller or any of the Waiving Parties, will seek
to obtain the same by any process. From and after the Closing, each of the
Buyer, the Company, each Seller, on behalf of itself and the Waiving Parties,
irrevocably waives and will not assert any attorney-client privilege with
respect to any communication among WandC, the Buyer, the Sponsor and/or any
director, manager, officer, owner, employee or representative of any of the
foregoing occurring prior to the Closing in connection with any Buyer Post-
Closing Representation. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that a
dispute arises between the Buyer, the Company, any of the Sellers, on the one
hand, and a third party other than the Sponsor, on the other hand, the Buyer,
the Company, and any Seller may assert the attorney-client privilege to
prevent disclosure of confidential communications to such third party;
_provided_ , _however_ , that none of the Buyer, the Company or any Seller may
waive such privilege without the prior written consent of the Sponsor.

Section 11.17 _Acknowledgement_ _s_.

 

(a) _Sellers_. Each of the RSI Companies and the Sellers specifically
acknowledges and agrees to Buyers disclaimer of any representations or
warranties other than those set forth in _Article V_ and any Ancillary
Agreement or certificate delivered by Buyer or Sponsor pursuant to this
Agreement, whether made by Buyer, Sponsor or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives, and of all Liability and responsibility for any
representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement, or information
made,

 



122

    

 communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to the RSI Companies, the
Sellers Representative and the Sellers, their Affiliates or representatives
(including any opinion, information, projection, or advice that may have been
or may be provided to Buyer, the Sponsor, their Affiliates or representatives
by either Buyer or the Sponsor or any of their respective Affiliates or
representatives), other than those set forth in _Article V_ and any Ancillary
Agreement or certificate delivered by Buyer or Sponsor pursuant to this
Agreement. Buyer specifically acknowledges and agrees that, without limiting
the generality of this _Section_ __ _ 11.17_, no Seller or RSI Company nor
any of their respective Affiliates or representatives has made any
representation or warranty with respect to any projections or other future
forecasts. Buyer specifically acknowledges and agrees that except for the
representations and warranties set forth in _Article V_ and any Ancillary
Agreement or certificate delivered by Buyer or Sponsor pursuant to this
Agreement, neither Buyer nor Sponsor makes, nor has Buyer or Sponsor made, any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to Buyer or
Sponsor, their assets or Liabilities, the businesses of Buyer or Sponsor or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

 

(b) _Buyer_. Buyer specifically acknowledges and agrees to Sellers disclaimer
of any representations or warranties other than those set forth in _Article
III_ , _Article IV_ and any Ancillary Agreement or certificate delivered by
any RSI Company, the Sellers Representative or the Sellers pursuant to this
Agreement, whether made by any Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives, and of all Liability and responsibility for any
representation, warranty, projection, forecast, statement, or information
made, communicated, or furnished (orally or in writing) to Buyer, the
Sponsor, their Affiliates or representatives (including any opinion,
information, projection, or advice that may have been or may be provided to
Buyer, the Sponsor, their Affiliates or representatives by either Seller,
any RSI Company or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives),
other than those set forth in _Article III_ , _Article IV_ and any Ancillary
Agreement or certificate delivered by any RSI Company, the Sellers
Representative or the Sellers pursuant to this Agreement. Buyer specifically
acknowledges and agrees that, without limiting the generality of this
_Section_ __ _ 11.17_, no Seller or RSI Company nor any of their respective
Affiliates or representatives has made any representation or warranty with
respect to any projections or other future forecasts. Buyer specifically
acknowledges and agrees that except for the representations and warranties set
forth in _Article III_ ,  _Article IV_ and any Ancillary Agreement or
certificate delivered by any RSI Company, the Sellers Representative or the
Sellers pursuant to this Agreement, neither the Company nor any Seller makes,
nor has the Company or any Seller made, any other express or implied
representation or warranty with respect to Sellers, the RSI Companies, their
assets or Liabilities, the businesses of Sellers or the RSI Companies or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements.

Section 11.18 _Equitable Adjustments_. If, during the Pre-Closing Period, the
outstanding shares of Buyer Capital Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, with the prior written
consent of the Sellers Representative to the extent required by this
Agreement, by reason of any stock dividend, share capitalization, subdivision,
reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, consolidation or
exchange of shares, or any similar event shall have occurred, then any number
or amount contained in this Agreement which

 



123

    

 is based upon the number of shares of Buyer Capital Stock will be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Sellers and the Buyer Stockholders the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

other liabilities of the Corporation and of the preferential and other
amounts, if any, to which the holders of Preferred Stock or any class or
series of stock having a preference over the Class A Common Stock as to
distributions upon dissolution or liquidation or winding up shall
be entitled, the holders of all outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock
shall be entitled to receive the remaining assets of the Corporation available
for distribution ratably in proportion to the number of shares held by each

entitled to receive any assets of the Corporation in the event of any

Common Stock be transferred to the Corporation and cancelled for no
consideration. The Corporation shall not issue additional shares of Class V
Common Stock after the closing date (such date, the " _Closing Date_ ") of the
transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement, other than in
connection with the valid issuance of Common Units in accordance with the RSI
AandR LPA.

may be amended from time to time, the " _By-Laws_ ") without the consent or
vote of the stockholders in any manner not inconsistent with the laws of the

ARTICLE VI

 

BOARD OF DIRECTORS

 

Section 6.1 _Board of Directors_.

 

(a) _Board Powers_. Except as otherwise provided in this Second AandR
Certificate of Incorporation or the DGCL, the business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board.

 

(b) _Number, Election and Term_.

 

(i) Without limiting the rights of any party to the Investor Rights
Agreement with respect thereto or except as otherwise provided for or fixed
in any certificate of designation with respect to any series of Preferred
Stock, the total number of directors constituting the whole Board shall be
determined from time to time by resolution adopted by the Board.

(ii) Without limiting the rights of any party pursuant to the Investor
Rights Agreement, the directors (other than those directors elected by the
holders of any series of Preferred Stock, voting separately as a series or
together with one or more other such series, as the case may be) shall
be divided into three classes designated Class I, Class II and Class III.
Each class shall consist, as nearly as possible, of one-third of the total
number of such directors. Class I directors shall initially serve for a term
expiring at the first annual meeting of stockholders for the calendar year
ended December 31, 2021, Class II directors shall initially serve for a term
expiring at the second annual meeting of stockholders for

   

 the calendar year ended December 31, 2022 and Class III directors shall
initially serve for a term expiring at the third annual meeting of
stockholders for the calendar year ended December 31, 2023. At each annual
meeting following the annual meeting of the stockholders for the calendar year
ended December 31, 2021, successors to the class of directors whose term
expires at that annual meeting shall be elected for a term expiring at the
third succeeding annual meeting of stockholders. If the number of such
directors is changed, any increase or decrease shall be apportioned among the
classes so as to maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly
equal as possible, and any such additional director of any class elected to
fill a newly created directorship resulting from an increase in such class
shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the remaining term of
that class, but in no case shall a decrease in the number of directors
remove, or shorten the term of, any incumbent director. Subject to the rights
granted to the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock then
outstanding and without limiting the rights of any party pursuant to the
Investor Rights Agreement, the election of directors shall be determined by a
plurality of the votes cast by the stockholders present in person or
represented by proxy at the meeting and entitled to vote thereon. The Board
is authorized to assign members of the Board already in office to their
respective class in accordance with the Investor Rights Agreement.

 

(iii) Any such director shall hold office until the annual meeting at which
his or her term expires and until his or her successor shall be elected and
qualified, or his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal from office.

 

(iv) Directors of the Corporation need not be elected by written ballot
unless the By-Laws shall so provide.

 

Section 6.2 _Newly-Created Directorships and Vacancies_. Subject to the
rights granted to the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock
then outstanding and without limiting the rights of any party granted pursuant
to the Investor Rights Agreement, any newly-created directorship on the Board
that results from an increase in the number of directors and any vacancy
occurring in the Board (whether by death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification, removal or other cause) shall be filled by the affirmative
vote of a majority of the directors then in office, although less than a
quorum, or by a sole remaining director (and not by the stockholders). Any
director elected to fill a vacancy or newly created directorship shall hold
office until the next election of the class for which such director shall
have been chosen and until his or her successor shall be elected and
qualified, or until his or her earlier death, resignation, retirement,
disqualification or removal.

 

Section 6.3 _Resignation and Removal_. Any director may resign at any
time upon notice to the Corporation given in writing or by any electronic
transmission permitted by the By-Laws. Without limiting the rights of any
party pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, any or all of the directors
(other than the directors elected by the holders of any series of Preferred
Stock of the Corporation, voting separately as a series or together with one
or more other such series, as the case may be) may be removed only for cause
and only upon the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority in voting
power of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the Corporation entitled
to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class;  _provided_ that any director may be removed from office upon a good
faith finding of the Board that such director is an Unsuitable Person pursuant
to the terms of _Article XIV_. Without limiting the rights of any party
pursuant to the Investor Rights Agreement, in case the Board or any one or
more directors should be so removed, new directors may be elected pursuant to
_Section 6.2_.

 

Section 6.4 _Preferred Stock Directors_. Whenever the holders of any one
or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the Corporation shall have the
right, voting separately as a series or separately as

   

 a class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual
or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal and
other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of this
Second AandR Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of
designations relating to any series of Preferred Stock) applicable thereto.
Notwithstanding _Section 6.1(b)_, the number of directors that may be
elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be in
addition to the number fixed pursuant to _Section 6.1(b)_ hereof, and the
total number of directors constituting the whole Board shall be automatically
adjusted accordingly.

Section 6.5 _Quorum_. A quorum for the transaction of business by the
directors shall be set forth in the By-Laws.

 

ARTICLE VII

CONSENT OF STOCKHOLDERS IN LIEU OF MEETING, ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS OF
STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 7.1 _Consent of Stockholders in Lieu of Meeting_. At any time
when the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees beneficially own, in the
aggregate, 40% or more of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, any action required
or permitted to be taken at any annual or special meeting of stockholders of
the Corporation may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and
without a vote, if a consent or consents in writing, setting forth the action
so taken, shall be signed by the holders of outstanding stock having not less
than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take
such action at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were
present and voted and shall be delivered to the Corporation by delivery to
its registered office in the State of Delaware, its principal place of
business, or an officer or agent of the Corporation having custody of the
books in which proceedings of meetings of stockholders are recorded. Delivery
made to the Corporations registered office shall be made by hand, or by
certified or registered mail, return receipt requested. At any time when the
Sellers and their Permitted Transferees beneficially own, in the aggregate,
less than 40% of the voting power of the stock of the Corporation entitled to
vote generally in the election of directors, any action required or permitted
to be taken by the stockholders of the Corporation must be effected at a duly
called annual or special meeting of such holders and may not be effected by
any consent in writing by such holders; _provided, however,_ that any action
required or permitted to be taken by the holders of Preferred Stock, voting
separately as a series or separately as a class with one or more other such
series, may be taken without a meeting, without prior notice and without a
vote, to the extent expressly so provided by the applicable certificate of
designation relating to such series of Preferred Stock.

 

Section 7.2 _Meetings of Stockholders_. Except as otherwise required by
law and subject to the rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock,
special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation for any purpose or
purposes may be called only by or at the direction of the Board, the Chairman
of the Board or as otherwise provided in the By-Laws. An annual meeting of
stockholders for the election of directors to succeed those whose terms expire
and for the transaction of such other business as may properly come before
the meeting, shall be held at such place, if any, on such date, and at such
time as shall be fixed exclusively by resolution of the Board or a duly
authorized committee thereof.

 

ARTICLE VIII

LIMITED LIABILITY; INDEMNIFICATION

Section 8.1 _Limited Liability of Directors_. To the fullest extent
permitted by law, no director of the Corporation will have any personal
liability to the Corporation or its stockholders for monetary damages for any
breach of fiduciary duty as a director. If the DGCL is amended to authorize
corporate action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of
directors, then the liability of a director of the

   

 Corporation shall be eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted
by the DGCL, as so amended. Neither the amendment nor the repeal of this
_Article VIII_ shall eliminate, reduce or otherwise adversely affect any
limitation on the personal liability of a director of the Corporation existing
prior to such amendment or repeal.

 

Section 8.2 _Indemnification and Advancement of Expenses_.

 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, as the same exists
or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless each person who is or was made a party or is threatened to be made a
party to or is otherwise involved in any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (for purposes of this _Section 8.02_, a " _Proceeding_ ") by
reason of the fact that he or she is or was a director or officer of the
Corporation or, while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was
serving at the request of the Corporation as a director, manager, officer,
employee or agent of another corporation or of a partnership, limited
liability company, joint venture, trust, other enterprise or nonprofit
entity, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan (an "
_Indemnitee_ "), whether the basis of such Proceeding is alleged action in an
official capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent, or in any other
capacity while serving as a director, officer, employee or agent, against all
liability and loss suffered and expenses (including, without limitation,
attorneys fees, judgments, fines, Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974 (" _ERISA_ ") excise taxes and penalties and amounts paid in settlement)
reasonably incurred by such Indemnitee in connection with such Proceeding. The
Corporation shall to the fullest extent not prohibited by applicable law pay
the expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by an Indemnitee in
defending or otherwise participating in any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent required by
applicable law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition
of the Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking, by or on
behalf of the Indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall
ultimately be determined that the Indemnitee is not entitled to be
indemnified under this _Section 8.02_ or otherwise. The rights to
indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred by this _Section 8.02_
shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an Indemnitee
who has ceased to be a director, officer, employee or agent and shall inure to
the benefit of his or her heirs, executors and administrators. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of this _Section 8.02(a)_, except for Proceedings
to enforce rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses, the
Corporation shall indemnify and advance expenses to an Indemnitee in
connection with a Proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Indemnitee
only if such Proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

(b) The rights to indemnification and advancement of expenses conferred on
any Indemnitee by this _Section 8.02_ shall not be exclusive of any other
rights that any Indemnitee may have or hereafter acquire under law, this
Second AandR Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws, an agreement, vote of
stockholders or disinterested directors, or otherwise.

 

(c) Any repeal or amendment of this _Section 8.02_ by the stockholders of
the Corporation or by changes in law, or the adoption of any other provision
of this Second AandR Certificate of Incorporation inconsistent with this
_Section 8.02_, shall, unless otherwise required by law, be prospective only
(except to the extent such amendment or change in law permits the Corporation
to provide broader indemnification rights on a retroactive basis than
permitted prior thereto), and shall not in any way diminish or adversely
affect any right or protection existing at the time of such repeal or
amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision in respect of any
Proceeding (regardless of when such Proceeding is first threatened, commenced
or completed) arising out of, or related to, any act or omission occurring
prior to such repeal or amendment or adoption of such inconsistent provision.

(d) This  _Section 8.02_ shall not limit the right of the Corporation, to
the extent and in the manner authorized or permitted by law, to indemnify and
to advance expenses to persons other than Indemnitees.

   

ARTICLE IX

 

DGCL SECTION 203

 

The Corporation hereby expressly elects not to be governed by Section 203 of

Corporation for breach of any fiduciary duty solely by reason of the fact that
such Identified Person engages in any such activities. To the fullest extent
permitted from time to time by the laws of the State of Delaware,
the Corporation hereby renounces any interest or expectancy in, or right to
be offered an opportunity to participate in, any business opportunity which

permitted by law, have no duty (fiduciary, contractual or otherwise) to
communicate, present or offer such transaction or other business opportunity
or matter to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or any stockholder, as
the case may be, and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, shall not
be liable to the Corporation or its stockholders or to any subsidiary of the
Corporation for breach of any duty (fiduciary, contractual or otherwise) as a
stockholder, director or officer of the Corporation solely by reason of the
fact that such Identified Person pursues or acquires such corporate
opportunity for itself, herself or himself, or offers or directs such
corporate opportunity to another Person or does not present such opportunity
to the Corporation or any of its subsidiaries or stockholders.

(c) The Corporation does not renounce its interest in any
corporate opportunity offered to any Non-Employee Director if such
opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely and expressly in his or
her capacity as a director or officer of the Corporation, such opportunity is
one the Corporation is legally permitted to undertake and would otherwise be
reasonable for the Corporation to pursue, in which case, the provisions of
_Section 10.1(b)_ shall not apply to any such corporate opportunity. 

(d) In addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this
_Article X_ , a corporate opportunity shall not be deemed to be a potential
corporate opportunity for the Corporation if it is a business opportunity that
(i) the Corporation is neither financially or legally able, nor contractually
permitted to undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the line of the
Corporations business or is of no practical advantage to the Corporation,
(iii) is one in which the Corporation has no interest or reasonable
expectancy, or (iv) is one presented to any account for the benefit of a
member of the Board or such members Affiliate over which such member of the
Board has no direct or indirect influence or control, including, but not
limited to, a blind trust.

 

(e) For purposes of this _Article X_ , (i) "Affiliate" shall mean (A) in
respect of a Seller or the Sponsor, any Person that, directly or indirectly,
is controlled by such Seller or the Sponsor (as applicable), controls such
Seller or the Sponsor (as applicable) or is under common control with such
Seller or the Sponsor (as applicable) and shall include any principal,
member, director, partner, stockholder, officer, employee or other
representative of any of the foregoing (other than the Corporation and any
entity that is controlled by the Corporation), (B) in respect of a Non-
Employee Director, any Person that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by
such Non-Employee Director (other than the Corporation and any entity that is
controlled by the Corporation) and (C) in respect of the Corporation, any
Person that, directly or indirectly, is controlled by the Corporation; (ii)
"Affiliated Entity" shall mean (A) any Person of which a Non-Employee Director
serves as an officer, director, employee, agent or other representative (other
than the Corporation and any entity that is controlled by the Corporation),
(B) any direct or indirect partner, stockholder, member, manager or other
representative of such Person or (C) any Affiliate of any of the foregoing;
and (iii) "Person" shall mean any individual, corporation, general or limited
partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust, association or
any other entity.

(f) To the fullest extent permitted by law, any Person purchasing or
otherwise acquiring any interest in any shares of capital stock of the
Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of and to have consented to the
provisions of this _Article X_.

shall require the affirmative vote of at least 80% of the total voting power
of all the then outstanding shares of stock of the

   

 Corporation entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting
together as a single class. Neither the alteration, amendment, addition to or
repeal of this _Article X_ , nor the adoption of any provision of this Second
AandR Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designations
relating to any series of Preferred Stock) inconsistent with this _Article X_
, shall eliminate or reduce the effect of this  _Article X_ in respect of any
business opportunity first identified or any other matter occurring, or any
cause of action, suit or claim that, but for this _Article X_ , would accrue
or arise, prior to such alteration, amendment, addition, repeal or adoption.
This _Article X_ shall not limit any protections or defenses available to, or
indemnification or advancement rights of, any director or officer of the
Corporation under this Second AandR Certificate of Incorporation, the By-Laws or
applicable law.

SEVERABILITY

 

Section 11.1 _Severability_. If any provision of this Second AandR
Certificate of Incorporation shall be held to be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable as applied to any circumstance for any reason whatsoever, the
validity, legality and enforceability of such provision in any other
circumstance and of the remaining provisions of this Second AandR Certificate
of Incorporation (including, without limitation, each portion of any paragraph

ARTICLE XII

FORUM 

Section 12.1 _Forum_. Unless the Corporation consents in writing to the
selection of an alternative forum, (a) any derivative action or proceeding
brought on behalf of the Corporation, (b) any action asserting a claim of
breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any current or former director,
officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation to the Corporation
or the Corporations stockholders, or any claim for aiding and abetting such
alleged breach, (c) any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or
any director, officer, other employee or stockholder of the Corporation (i)
arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL, this Second AandR Certificate of
Incorporation (as it may be amended or restated) or the By-Laws or (ii) as to
which the DGCL confers jurisdiction on the Delaware Court of Chancery or (d)
any action asserting a claim against the Corporation or any current or former
officer or director or other employee or stockholder of the Corporation
governed by the internal affairs doctrine of the law of the State of Delaware
shall, in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by law, be solely and
exclusively brought in the Delaware Court of Chancery; _provided_ , _however_
, that, in the event that the Delaware Court of Chancery lacks subject matter
jurisdiction over any such action or proceeding, the sole and exclusive forum
for such action or proceeding shall be another state or federal court located
within the State of Delaware, in each such case, unless the Court of Chancery
(or such other state or federal court located within the State of Delaware, as
applicable) has dismissed a prior action by the same plaintiff asserting the
same claims because such court lacked personal jurisdiction over an
indispensable party named as a defendant therein. Unless the Corporation
consents in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal
district courts of the United States of America shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, be the sole and exclusive forum for the resolution of any
complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. Failure to enforce the foregoing provisions would cause the
Corporation irreparable harm and the Corporation shall be entitled to
equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, to
enforce the foregoing provisions. To the fullest extent permitted by law, any
person or entity purchasing or otherwise acquiring or holding any interest in
shares of capital stock of the Corporation shall be deemed to have notice of
and consented to the provisions of this _Article XII_.

Affiliate of an Unsuitable Person (as applicable) shall be subject to
mandatory sale and transfer on the terms and conditions set forth herein on
the Transfer Date to either the Corporation or one or more Third Party
Transferees and in such number and class(es)/series of Equity Interests as
determined by the Board in good faith (following consultation with reputable
outside and independent gaming regulatory counsel) pursuant to a resolution
adopted by a majority of the directors of the Board;  _provided_ that any
such sale or transfer shall occur subject to the following and shall not occur
(and a Transfer Notice shall not be sent, and the Transfer Date shall be
extended accordingly) until the later to occur of: (i) the delivery to such
Person of a copy of a resolution duly adopted by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the directors of the Board at a meeting thereof called and held
for the purpose (after providing reasonable notice to such Person and a
reasonable opportunity for such Person, together with the counsel of such
Person, to be heard before the Board at such meeting and to provide documents
and written arguments to the Board a reasonable length of time in advance of
such meeting), finding that the Board has determined in good faith (following
consultation with reputable outside and independent gaming regulatory counsel)
that (A) such Person is an Unsuitable Person, and (B) it is necessary for such
Person to sell and transfer such number and class(es)/series of Equity
Interests in order for the Corporation or any Affiliated Company to: (1)
obtain, renew, maintain or prevent the loss, rejection, rescission,
suspension, revocation or non-renewal of a material Gaming License; (2)
comply in any material respect with a material Gaming Law; (3) ensure that any
material Gaming License held or desired in good faith to be held by
the Corporation or any Affiliated Company, or the Corporations or any
Affiliated Companys application for, right to the use of, entitlement to, or
ability to obtain or retain, any material Gaming License held or desired in
good faith to be held by the Corporation or any Affiliated Company, is not
precluded, delayed, impeded, impaired, threatened or jeopardized in any
material respect; or (4) prevent the

   

 imposition of any materially burdensome terms or conditions on any material

in reasonable detail and (ii) conclusion of the arbitration process described
below (if applicable); provided further, that in the event that such Person
reasonably believes that any of the above-described determinations by the
Board were not made in good faith and such disagreement cannot be settled
amicably by such Person and the Corporation, and solely to the extent that the
Corporation has not received notice (oral or written) from any
applicable Gaming Authority that an arbitration process or the time required
to resolve such disagreement by arbitration would or is reasonably likely to
materially and adversely affect the Corporations or any Affiliated Companies
ability to (1) obtain, renew, maintain or prevent the loss, rejection,
rescission, suspension, revocation or non-renewal of a material Gaming
License; (2) comply in any material respect with a material Gaming Law; (3)
ensure that any material Gaming License held or desired in good faith to be
held by the Corporation or any Affiliated Company, or the Corporations or any
Affiliated Companys application for, right to the use of, entitlement to, or
ability to obtain or retain, any material Gaming License held or desired in
good faith to be held by the Corporation or any Affiliated Company, is not
precluded, delayed, impeded, impaired, threatened or jeopardized in any
material respect; or (4) prevent the imposition of any materially burdensome
terms or conditions on any material Gaming License held or desired in good
faith to be held by the Corporation or any Affiliated Company, such
disagreement with respect to whether the Boards determination(s) were
correct may be finally, exclusively and conclusively settled by mandatory
arbitration conducted expeditiously in accordance with the American
Arbitration Association (" _AAA_ ") rules, by a single independent arbitrator
(to be chosen by mutual agreement of the Unsuitable Person and the Board, and
if the parties are unable to agree, to be chosen as provided in the AAA rules)
in an arbitration process that shall take place in Chicago, Illinois, with
each party bearing its own legal fees and expenses, unless otherwise
determined by the arbitrator. For the further avoidance of doubt, at the
initial meeting described above with respect to whether a Person is an
Unsuitable Person, the Board may defer making any such determination in order
to conduct further investigation into the matter, but in connection with any
future meeting of the Board regarding the matter, such Person shall be
provided with reasonable notice and a reasonable opportunity for such Person,
together with the counsel of such Person, to be heard before the Board at such
meeting and to provide documents and written arguments to the Board a
reasonable length of time in advance of such meeting. Following (x) the Board
determining in good faith (following consultation with reputable outside and
independent gaming regulatory counsel) and in accordance with the foregoing
(including such determination being made pursuant to a resolution of
the Board adopted by an affirmative vote of a majority of the directors of
the Board), that such Person is an Unsuitable Person and it is necessary for
such Person to sell and transfer a certain number and class(es)/series of
Equity Interests for any of the reasons set forth above, and (y) if
applicable, the arbitrator determining that such determinations were correctly
made by the Board, the Corporation shall deliver a Transfer Notice to the
Unsuitable Person or its Affiliate(s) (as applicable) and shall purchase
and/or cause one or more Third Party Transferees to purchase such number and
class(es)/series of Equity Interests determined in good faith by the Board in
accordance with the foregoing and specified in the Transfer Notice on the
Transfer Date and for the Purchase Price set forth in the Transfer Notice
(which Purchase Price shall be determined in accordance with the definition of
the Purchase Price set forth in this _Article XIV_ ); _provided_ that
an Unsuitable Person or its Affiliate(s) (as applicable) shall be permitted,
during the forty five (45) day period commencing on the date of the Transfer
Notice (or before a Transfer Notice is formally delivered), to effect and
close a disposition of the number and class(es)/series of Equity Interests
specified in the Transfer Notice (or a portion of them) to a Person that the
Board determines in good faith (following consultation with reputable outside
and independent gaming regulatory counsel) is not an Unsuitable Person, on
terms agreed between the Unsuitable Person and such Person (an " _Alternate
Private Transaction_ "), it being agreed that in the event that the Board
fails to make a 

   

 determination in good faith that such Person is not an Unsuitable Person
within fifteen (15) days from the date on which the Corporation was presented
in writing with the identity of such Person and materials reasonably
sufficient to make such determination, then the Unsuitable Person shall be
entitled to consummate the Alternate Private Transaction with such Person;
_provided_ _further_ that, no Unsuitable Person or its Affiliate(s) (as
applicable) shall be permitted to consummate an Alternative Private
Transaction to the extent any Gaming Authority has provided oral or written
notice to the Corporation or any other Person prohibiting such Alternative
Private Transaction. In the case of a sale and transfer to the Corporation,
from and after the Transfer Date and subject only to the right to receive the
Purchase Price for such Equity Interests, such Equity Interests shall, be
deemed no longer outstanding and such Unsuitable Person or any Affiliate of
such Unsuitable Person shall cease to be a stockholder with respect to such
Equity Interests, and all rights of such Unsuitable Person or any Affiliate of
such Unsuitable Person therein, other than the right to receive the Purchase
Price, shall cease.

(b) In the case of an Alternate Private Transaction or a transfer to one
or more Third Party Transferees otherwise determined by the Board above, from
and after the earlier to occur of: (i) the Transfer Date, in the case of a
transfer to one or more such Third Party Transferees, or (ii) consummation of
an Alternate Private Transaction, subject only to the right to receive the
Purchase Price for such Unsuitable Persons Equity Securities, all rights and
entitlements of the Unsuitable Person or any such Affiliates of an Unsuitable
Person as a stockholder of the Corporation shall be terminated, including
without limitation any such Person shall from such date no longer be entitled
to: (i) receive any dividend, payment, distribution or interest with regard
to the applicable Equity Interests which has been declared following such date
or of which the due payment date according to the applicable declaration is
following such date, other than the right to receive the Purchase Price,
or (ii) to exercise, directly or indirectly or through any proxy, trustee, or
nominee, any voting or other right (including without limitation observer and
information rights) conferred by the underlying Equity Interests.

 

(c) The closing of a sale and transfer contemplated by clauses (a) and (b)
above in this _Article XIV_ other than an Alternate Private Transaction (the
" _Closing_ ") shall take place at the principal office of the Corporation or
via electronic exchange of documents on the Transfer Date. At the
Closing: (i) the Corporation or Third Party Transferee(s) (as applicable),
shall deliver the aggregate applicable Purchase Price for the Equity Interests
being purchased by each of the foregoing by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account specified in writing by the Unsuitable Person
and (ii) the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as
applicable) shall deliver to the Corporation or each such Third Party
Transferee (if applicable), such stock powers, assignment instruments and
other agreement as are necessary or appropriate to fully convey all right,
title and interest in and to the Equity Interests being purchased by each of
the foregoing, free and clear of all liens and other encumbrances (other than
restrictions on transfer under this Second AandR Certificate of Incorporation,
the By-laws of the Corporation, the Investor Rights Agreement and applicable
federal and state securities laws). Such stock powers, assignment instruments
and other agreements shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Corporation and shall include no representations and warranties other than
such representations and warranties as to title and ownership of the Equity
Interests being sold, due authorization, execution and delivery of reasonably
requested documents by the Unsuitable Person or any such Affiliates of such
Unsuitable Person (as applicable), and the enforceability of relevant
obligations of such party under the relevant documents). The sale and
transfer of the applicable Equity Interests shall be effected at the Closing
upon delivery of the Purchase Price described in this _Section_ __ _ 14.1(c)_
without regard to the provision by the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such
Unsuitable Person (as applicable) of the stock powers, assignment instruments
and other agreements described above (and subject to their terms described
above) and the Corporation may in its sole and absolute discretion execute
and

   

 deliver such instruments or other documents described above necessary to
effect such transfer under such terms (including any stock powers, assignment
instruments and other agreements) and deemed by the Corporation in its sole
and absolute discretion (acting in good faith) to be necessary or advisable in
its name or in the name and on behalf of the Unsuitable Person or any
Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (as applicable) to effect the sale and
transfer; provided, however, that the Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of such
Unsuitable Person (as applicable) shall continue to have the obligation to the
Corporation and the Third Party Transferees, as applicable, to provide such
stock powers, assignment instruments and other agreements.

(d) To the extent that a sale and transfer to one or more Third Party
Transferees is determined to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason, the
Corporation shall be permitted to redeem or repurchase the Equity Interests
owned or controlled by an Unsuitable Person or an Affiliate of an Unsuitable
Person (as applicable) for the price and under the terms contemplated by this
Article XIV promptly following any such determination.

 

Section 14.2 _Indemnification_. Any Unsuitable Person and any Affiliate
of an Unsuitable Person that owns or controls Equity Interests shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Corporation and its Affiliated Companies for any and all
losses, costs and expenses, including attorneys costs, fees and
expenses reasonably incurred by the Corporation and its Affiliated Companies
as a result of, or arising out of, such Unsuitable Persons or Affiliates
continuing ownership or control of Equity Interests following the Transfer
Date in breach of this _Article XIV_ , the neglect, refusal or other failure
to comply in any material respect with the provisions of this _Article XIV_,
or failure to divest itself of any Equity Interests when and in the specific
manner required by the Gaming Laws or this _Article XIV_ and by acceptance of
its Equity Interests any such Unsuitable Person or Affiliate of an Unsuitable
Person shall be deemed to have agreed to so indemnify the Corporation.
Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section 14.2_ to the contrary, neither
the Corporation nor any of its Affiliated Companies shall have any right to
offset against any amount payable or otherwise owed by the Corporation or any
of its Affiliated Companies to such Unsuitable Person or its Affiliates under
this _Article XIV_ (including, without limitation, the Purchase Price payable
or otherwise owed in the event of a transaction contemplated by _Section
14.1_), any amounts of losses, costs or expenses for which the Corporation or
any of its Affiliated Companies are entitled to indemnification under this
_Section 14.2_.

 

Section 14.3 _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The right of the Corporation to
purchase or cause to be purchased Equity Interests pursuant to this _Article
XIV_ shall not be exclusive of any other rights the Corporation may have or
hereafter acquire under any agreement, provision of this Second AandR
Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the Corporation or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this _Article XIV_ , the Corporation, the
Unsuitable Person and any of their Affiliates shall have the right to propose
that the parties, immediately upon or following the delivery of the Transfer
Notice (subject to the outcome of any applicable arbitration proceeding
pursuant to  _Section 14.1(a)_), enter into an agreement or other
arrangement (including based on any agreement that may be reached between the
applicable Gaming Authority and an Unsuitable Person or its Affiliates in this
regard), including, without limitation, a divestiture trust or divestiture
plan, which will reduce or terminate an Unsuitable Persons ownership or
control of all or a portion of its Equity Interests over time (and, if such an
agreement or arrangement is reached), the terms of such agreement or
arrangement as agreed by the Corporation and such Unsuitable Person or
Affiliate of such Unsuitable Person (including, without limitation, as to the
purchase price at which the Equity Interests can be sold) shall apply
and prevail over the terms of this _Article XIV_ ).

 

Section 14.4 _Further Actions_. Nothing contained in this  _Article XIV_
shall limit the authority of the Corporation to take such other action, to the
extent permitted by law, as it deems necessary or advisable (including with
consultation with reputable outside and independent gaming
regulatory counsel) to protect the Corporation or its Affiliated Companies
from the denial or threatened denial, loss or

   

 threatened loss or delayed issuance or threatened delayed issuance of any
material Gaming License of the Corporation or any of its Affiliated Companies,
provided that any forced disposal of Equity Interests shall be effected only
in accordance with the terms of this _Article XIV_. In addition, the
Corporation may, to the extent permitted by law, from time to time establish,
modify, amend or rescind bylaws, regulations, and procedures of the
Corporation to the extent they are not inconsistent with the express
provisions of this _Article XIV_ for the purpose of determining whether any
Person is an Unsuitable Person and for the orderly application,
administration and implementation of the provisions of this _Article XIV_ ,
provided that the provisions of any such bylaws, regulations and procedures
shall not be more adverse in any material respect to the stockholders of the
Corporation than the provisions of this _Article XIV_. Such procedures and
regulations shall be kept on file with the Secretary of the Corporation, the
secretary of its Affiliated Companies and with the transfer agent, if any, of
the Corporation and any Affiliated Companies, and shall be made available for
inspection and, upon reasonable request, mailed to any record holder of Equity
Interests. The Board shall have exclusive authority and power to administer
this _Article XIV_ and to exercise all rights and powers specifically granted
to the Board or the Corporation, or as may be necessary or advisable in the
administration of this _Article XIV_. Subject to the arbitration provisions
set forth in _Section 14.1(a)_, all such actions which are done or made by
the Board in compliance with the provisions of this _Article XIV_ shall be
final, conclusive and binding on the Corporation and all other Persons;
provided, however, the Board may delegate all or any portion of its duties
and powers under this _Article XIV_ to a committee of the Board as it deems
necessary or advisable.

 

Section 14.5 _Legend_. The restrictions set forth in this  _Article XIV_

Gaming Licenses held or desired to be held by the Corporation or any
Affiliated Companies, subject to any rights that such Persons may have under

ARTICLE II

 

STOCKHOLDERS

 

Section 2.1 Annual Meetings. The annual meeting of the stockholders of the
Corporation for the purpose of electing directors and for the transaction of
such other business as may properly be brought before the meeting shall be
held on such date, and at such time and place, if any, within or without the
State of Delaware, or by means of remote communications, including by webcast,
pursuant to Section 2.12(c)(ii), as may be designated from time to time by the
Board. The Board may postpone, reschedule or cancel any annual meeting of
stockholders previously scheduled.

Section 2.2 Special Meetings. Except as otherwise required by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL") or required or permitted
by the certificate of incorporation of the Corporation (as amended, restated,
modified or supplemented from time to time, the "Certificate of
Incorporation"), and subject to the rights of the holders of any class or
series of Preferred Stock (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation),
special meetings of the stockholders of the Corporation may be called only by
or at the direction of the Board, the Chairman of the Board or the Chief
Executive Officer. Special meetings may be held either at a place, within or
without the State of Delaware, or by means of remote communications,
including by webcast, pursuant to Section 2.12(c)(ii) as the Board may
determine. The Board may postpone, reschedule or cancel any special meeting
of stockholders previously scheduled.

Section 2.3 Notice of Meetings. Except as otherwise provided by the DGCL, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, notice of the date, time, place
(if any), the means of remote communications, if any, by which stockholders
and proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at
such meeting, the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting (if such date is different from the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting) and, in the case of a special
meeting, the purpose or purposes of the meeting of stockholders shall be
given not more than sixty (60), nor less than ten (10), days previous thereto
(unless a different time is specified by law), to

 

each stockholder entitled to vote at the meeting as of the record date for
determining stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting. If mailed, such
notice shall be deemed to be given when deposited in the United States mail,
postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at such stockholder\'s address
as it appears on the records of the Corporation. Without limiting the manner
by which notices of meetings otherwise may be given effectively to
stockholders, any such notice may be given by electronic transmission in the
manner provided in Section 232 of the DGCL.

Section 2.4 Quorum; Adjournments. The holders of a majority in voting power
of the stock issued and outstanding and entitled to vote thereat, present in
person or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum at all meetings of
the stockholders for the transaction of business, except as otherwise
provided herein, by applicable law or by the Certificate of Incorporation;
but if at any meeting of stockholders there shall be less than a quorum
present, the chairman of the meeting or, by a majority in voting power
thereof, the stockholders present (either in person or by proxy) may, to the
extent permitted by law, adjourn the meeting from time to time without further
notice other than announcement at the meeting of the date, time and place, if
any, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which stockholders may
be deemed present in person and vote at such adjourned meeting, until a quorum
shall be present or represented. Notwithstanding the foregoing, where a
separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required, a
majority in voting power of the outstanding shares of such class or series or
classes or series, present in person or represented by proxy, shall constitute
a quorum entitled to take action with respect to that vote on that matter.
At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum shall be present or represented by
proxy, any business may be transacted which might have been transacted at the
original meeting. Notice need not be given of any adjourned meeting if the
time, date and place, if any, and the means of remote communication, if any,
by which stockholders may be deemed present in person and vote at such
adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken; provided, however, that if the adjournment is for more than sixty (60)
days, a notice of the adjourned meeting shall be given to each stockholder of
record entitled to vote at the meeting. If after the adjournment a new record
date for stockholders entitled to vote is fixed for the adjourned meeting, the
Board shall fix a new record date for notice of such adjourned meeting,
and shall give notice of the adjourned meeting to each stockholder of record
entitled to vote at such adjourned meeting as of the record date for notice of
such adjourned meeting.

 

Section 2.5 Organization of Meetings. The Chairman of the Board, or in the
absence of the Chairman of the Board, or at the Chairman of the Board\'s
discretion, the Chief Executive Officer, or in the Chief Executive Officer\'s
absence or at the Chief Executive Officer\'s discretion, any officer of the
Corporation, shall call all meetings of the stockholders to order and shall
act as chairman of any such meetings. The Secretary of the Corporation or, in
such officer\'s absence, an Assistant Secretary, shall act as secretary of the
meeting. If neither the Secretary nor an Assistant Secretary is present, the
chairman of the meeting shall appoint a secretary of the meeting. The Board
may adopt such rules and regulations for the conduct of the meeting of
stockholders as it shall deem appropriate. Unless otherwise determined by the
Board prior to the meeting, the chairman of the meeting shall determine
the order of business and shall have the authority in his or her discretion
to regulate the conduct of any such meeting, including, without limitation,
convening the meeting and adjourning the meeting (whether or not a quorum is
present), announcing the date and time of the opening and the closing of the
polls for each matter upon which the stockholders will vote, imposing
restrictions on the persons (other than stockholders of record of the
Corporation or their duly appointed proxies) who may attend any such meeting,
establishing procedures for the transaction of business at the meeting
(including the dismissal of business not properly presented), maintaining
order at the meeting and safety of those present, restricting entry to
the meeting after the time fixed for commencement thereof and limiting the
circumstances in which any person may make a statement or ask questions at any
meeting of stockholders. Unless and to the extent determined by the Board or
the

 

2

 

chairman over the meeting, meetings of stockholders shall not be required to
be held in accordance with the rules of parliamentary procedure.

   

Section 2.6

 |

Proxies . 

---|--- 

(i)At all meetings of stockholders, any stockholder entitled to vote thereat
shall be entitled to vote in person or by proxy, subject to applicable law.
Without limiting the manner in which a stockholder may authorize another
person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy pursuant to the DGCL,
the following shall constitute a valid means by which a stockholder may grant
such authority: (1) a stockholder may execute a writing authorizing another
person or persons to act for the stockholder as proxy, and execution of the
writing may be accomplished by the stockholder or the
stockholder\'s authorized officer, director, employee or agent signing such
writing or causing his or her signature to be affixed to such writing by any
reasonable means including, but not limited to, by facsimile signature; or (2)
a stockholder may authorize another person or persons to act for the
stockholder as proxy by transmitting or authorizing by means of electronic
transmission to the person who will be the holder of the proxy or to a proxy
solicitation firm, proxy support service organization or like agent duly
authorized by the person who will be the holder of the proxy to receive such
transmission but no such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years
from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period; provided that
any such means of electronic transmission must either set forth or be
submitted with information from which it can be determined that the
electronic transmission was authorized by the stockholder. If it is
determined that such electronic transmissions are valid, the inspector or
inspectors of stockholder votes or, if there are no such inspectors, such
other persons making that determination shall specify the information upon
which they relied.

(b)A proxy shall be irrevocable if it states that it is irrevocable and if,
and only as long as, it is coupled with an interest sufficient in law to
support an irrevocable power. A stockholder may revoke any proxy which is not
irrevocable by attending the meeting and voting in person or by delivering to
the Secretary of the Corporation a revocation of the proxy or a new proxy
bearing a later date.

(c)Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reliable reproduction of the
writing or transmission created pursuant to the preceding paragraphs of this
Section 2.6 (including any electronic transmission) may be substituted or used
in lieu of the original writing or transmission for any and all purposes for
which the original writing or transmission could be used, provided that such
copy, facsimile telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete
reproduction of the entire original writing or transmission.

(d)Proxies shall be filed with the secretary of the meeting prior to or at the
commencement of the meeting to which they relate.

 

Section 2.7 Voting. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the vote of the
holders of a majority of the voting power of the outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Corporation present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting and entitled to vote on the subject matter shall decide any question
brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express
provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Investor Rights Agreement
(as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation), these By- Laws or the DGCL a
different vote is required, in which case such express provision shall govern
and control the decision of such question. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
where a separate vote by a class or series or classes or series is required
and a quorum is present, the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes

 

3

 

cast by shares of such class or series or classes or series shall be the act
of such class or series or classes or series, unless the question is one upon
which by express provision of the Certificate of Incorporation, the Investor
Rights Agreement, these By-Laws or the DGCL a different vote is required, in
which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of
such question.

Section 2.8 Fixing Record Date.

(a)In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
notice of any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment thereof, the Board
may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which
the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which
record date shall, unless otherwise required by law, not be more than sixty

(60)nor less than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If the Board
so fixes a date, such date shall also be the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting unless the Board determines, at
the time it fixes such record date, that a later date on or before the date of
the meeting shall be the date for making such determination. If no record date
is fixed by the Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled
to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall be at the close of
business on the day next preceding the day on which notice is given, or, if
notice is waived, at the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the meeting is held. A determination of stockholders of record
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders shall apply to
any adjournment of the meeting; provided, however, that the Board may fix a
new record date for determination of stockholders entitled to vote at the
adjourned meeting, and in such case shall also fix as the record date for
stockholders entitled to notice of such adjourned meeting the same or an
earlier date as that fixed for determination of stockholders entitled to vote
in accordance herewith at the adjourned meeting.

(b)In order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to
receive payment of any dividend or other distribution or allotment of any
rights, or entitled to exercise any rights in respect of any change or
conversion or for the purpose of any other lawful action, the Board may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted, and which record date shall not
be more than sixty (60) days prior to such action. If no such record date is
fixed, the record date for determining stockholders for any such purpose shall
be at the close of business on the day on which the Board adopts the
resolution relating thereto.

 

(c)Unless otherwise restricted by the Certificate of Incorporation, in order
that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to express
consent to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a
record date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which record
date shall not be more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the
resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date
for determining stockholders entitled to express consent to corporate action
in writing without a meeting is fixed by the Board, (i) when no prior action
of the Board is required by law, the record date for such purpose shall be
the first date on which a signed written consent setting forth the action
taken or proposed to be taken is delivered to the Corporation in accordance
with applicable law, and (ii) if prior action by the Board is required by
law, the record date for such purpose shall be at the close of business on the
day on which the Board adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

 

Section 2.9 Consents in Lieu of Meeting. At any time when action by one or
more classes or series of stockholders of the Corporation is permitted to be
taken by written consent pursuant to the terms and limitations set forth in
the Certificate of Incorporation, the provisions of this section shall apply.
All consents properly delivered in accordance with the Certificate of
Incorporation and the DGCL shall be

4

 

deemed to be recorded when so delivered. No written consent shall be
effective to take the corporate action referred to therein unless, within
sixty (60) days of the earliest dated consent delivered to the Corporation as
required by the DGCL, written consents signed by the holders of a sufficient
number of shares to take such corporate action are so delivered to the
Corporation in accordance with the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Prompt
notice of the taking of the corporate action without a meeting by less than
unanimous written consent shall be given to those stockholders who have not
consented in writing and who, if the action had been taken at a meeting, would
have been entitled to notice of the meeting if the record date for notice of
such meeting had been the date that written consents signed by a sufficient
number of holders to take the action were delivered to the Corporation as
provided in the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Any action taken pursuant
to such written consent or consents of the stockholders shall have the same
force and effect as if taken by the stockholders at a meeting thereof. In
order that the Corporation may determine the stockholders entitled to consent
to corporate action in writing without a meeting, the Board may fix a record
date, which record date shall not precede the date upon which the resolution
fixing the record date is adopted by the Board, and which date shall not be
more than ten (10) days after the date upon which the resolution fixing the
record date is adopted by the Board. If no record date has been fixed by the
Board, the record date for determining stockholders entitled to consent to
corporate action in writing without a meeting, when no prior action by the
Board is required by the DGCL, shall be the first date on which a signed
written consent setting forth the action taken or proposed to be taken is
delivered to the Corporation by delivery to its registered office in the State
of Delaware, its principal place of business, or an officer or agent of the
Corporation having custody of the book in which proceedings of meetings of
stockholders are recorded. Delivery made to the Corporation\'s registered
office shall be by hand or by certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested. If no record date has been fixed by the Board and prior
action by the Board is required by the DGCL, the record date for determining
stockholders entitled to consent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting shall be at the close of business on the day on which the Board
adopts the resolution taking such prior action.

Section 2.10 List of Stockholders Entitled to Vote. The Corporation shall
prepare, at least ten

(10)days before every meeting of stockholders, a complete list of the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting (provided, however, if the record
date for determining the stockholders entitled to vote is less than ten (10)
days before the date of the meeting, the list shall reflect the stockholders
entitled to vote as of the tenth day before the meeting date), arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and
the number of shares registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list
shall be open to the examination of any stockholder for any purpose germane to
the meeting for a period of at least ten

 

(10)days  prior to the meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic
network, provided that the information required to gain access to such list is
provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business
hours, at the principal place of business of the Corporation. In the event
that the Corporation determines to make the list available on an electronic
network, the Corporation may take reasonable steps to ensure that such
information is available only to stockholders of the Corporation. If the
meeting is to be held at a place, then a list of stockholders entitled to vote
at the meeting shall be produced and kept at the time and place of the
meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be inspected by any stockholder
who is present. If the meeting is to be held solely by means of remote
communication, then the list shall also be open to the examination of any
stockholder during the whole time of the meeting on a reasonably accessible
electronic network, and the information required to access such list shall be
provided with the notice of the meeting.

 

Section 2.11 Inspectors. The Board, in advance of all meetings of the
stockholders, may, and shall if required by law, appoint one or more
inspectors of stockholder votes, who may be employees or agents of the
Corporation or stockholders or their proxies, but who shall not be directors
of the Corporation or candidates for election as directors. In the event that
one or more inspectors of stockholder votes previously designated by the
Board fails to appear or act at the meeting of stockholders, the chairman of

5

 

the meeting may appoint one or more inspectors of stockholder votes to fill
such vacancy or vacancies. Inspectors of stockholder votes appointed to act at
any meeting of the stockholders, before entering upon the discharge of their
duties, shall take and sign an oath to faithfully execute the duties of
inspector of stockholder votes with strict impartiality and according to the
best of their ability and the oath so taken shall be subscribed by them. The
inspector or inspectors so appointed or designated shall (i) ascertain the
number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation outstanding and the
voting power of each such share, (ii) determine the shares of capital stock of
the Corporation represented at the meeting and the validity of proxies and
ballots, (iii) count all votes and ballots, (iv) determine and retain for a
reasonable period a record of the disposition of any challenges made to any
determination by the inspectors, and (v) certify their determination of the
number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation represented at the
meeting and such inspectors\' count of all votes and ballots. Such
certification and report shall specify such other information as may be
required by law. In determining the validity and counting of proxies and
ballots cast at any meeting of stockholders of the Corporation, the inspectors
may consider such information as is permitted by applicable law.

 

Section 2.12 Conduct of Meetings

(a)Annual Meetings of Stockholders.

 

(i)Nominations of persons for election to the Board and the proposal of other
business to be considered by the stockholders may be made at an annual meeting
of stockholders only (a) as provided in the Investor Rights Agreement, (b)
pursuant to the Corporation\'s notice of meeting (or any supplement thereto)
delivered pursuant to Section 2.3, (c) by or at the direction of the Board or
any authorized committee thereof or (d) by any stockholder of the Corporation
who is entitled to vote on such election or such other business at the
meeting, who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in
subparagraphs (ii) and (iii) of this Section 2.12(a) and who was a stockholder
of record at the time such notice was delivered to the Secretary of the
Corporation.

 

(ii)(A) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before an
annual meeting by a stockholder pursuant to clause (d) of Section 2.12(a)(i),
the stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in writing to the
Secretary of the Corporation (even if such matter is already the subject of
any notice to the stockholders or a public announcement from the Board), and,
in the case of business other than nominations of persons for election to
the Board, such other business must be a proper matter for stockholder
action. To be timely, a stockholder\'s notice shall be delivered to the
Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Corporation not less than
ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to the
first anniversary of the preceding year\'s annual meeting; provided, however,
that in the event that the date of the annual meeting is scheduled for more
than thirty (30) days before, or more than seventy (70) days following, such
anniversary date, or if no annual meeting was held in the preceding year,
notice by the stockholder to be timely must be so delivered not later than the
tenth day following the day on which public announcement of the date of such
meeting is first made. For purposes of the application of Rule 14a-4(c) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") (or
any successor provision), the date for notice specified in this Section
2.12(a)(iii) shall be the earlier of the date calculated as hereinbefore
provided or the date specified in paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 14a-4. For
purposes of the first annual meeting of stockholders following the adoption of
these By-Laws, the date of the preceding year\'s annual meeting shall be
deemed to be [•] of the preceding calendar year. In no event shall the public
announcement of an adjournment or postponement of an annual meeting commence a
new time period (or extend any time period) for the giving of a

 

6

 

stockholder\'s notice as described above. For the avoidance of doubt, a
stockholder shall not be entitled to make additional or substitute nominations
following the expiration of the time periods set forth in these By-Laws.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 2.12(a)(iii) to the contrary, in the
event that the number of directors to be elected to the Board at an annual
meeting is increased and there is no public announcement by the Corporation
naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of the
increased Board at least 100 calendar days prior to the first anniversary of
the preceding year\'s annual meeting of stockholders, then a stockholder\'s
notice required by this Section 2.12 shall be considered timely, but only with
respect to nominees for any new positions created by such increase, if it is
received by the Secretary of the Corporation not later than the close of
business on the tenth calendar day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the Corporation.

 

(iii)Such stockholder\'s notice shall set forth (a) as to each person whom the
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a director all
information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in
solicitations of proxies for election of directors, or is otherwise required,
in each case pursuant to Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, including such person\'s written consent
to being named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a
director if elected; (b) as to any other business that the stockholder
proposes to bring before the meeting, a brief description of the business
desired to be brought before the meeting, the text of the proposal or
business (including the text of any resolutions proposed for consideration
and, in the event that such business includes a proposal to amend these By-
Laws, the language of the proposed amendment), the reasons for conducting
such business at the meeting and any substantial interest (within the meaning
of Item 5 of Schedule 14A under the Exchange Act) in such business of such
stockholder and the beneficial owner (within the meaning of Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act), if any, on whose behalf the proposal is
made; (c) as to the stockholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made (i) the name
and address of such stockholder, as they appear on the Corporation\'s books
and records, and of such beneficial owner, (ii) the class or series and number
of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned directly or
indirectly, beneficially and of record by such stockholder and such
beneficial owner, (iii) a representation that the stockholder is a holder of
record of the stock of the Corporation at the time of the giving of the
notice, will be entitled to vote at such meeting and will appear in person or
by proxy at the meeting to propose such business or nomination, (iv) a
representation whether the stockholder or the beneficial owner, if any, will
be or is part of a group which will (A) deliver a proxy statement and/or form
of proxy to holders of at least the percentage of the voting power of the
Corporation\'s outstanding capital stock required to approve or adopt the
proposal or elect the nominee and/or (B) otherwise solicit proxies or votes
from stockholders in support of such proposal or nomination, (v) a
certification regarding whether such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any,
have complied with all applicable federal, state and other legal requirements
in connection with the stockholder\'s and/or beneficial owner\'s acquisition
of shares of capital stock or other securities of the Corporation and/or the
stockholder\'s and/or beneficial owner\'s acts or omissions as a stockholder
of the Corporation and (vi) any other information relating to
such stockholder and beneficial owner, if any, required to be disclosed in a
proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with
solicitations of proxies for, as applicable, the proposal and/or for the
election of directors in an election contest pursuant to and in accordance
with Section 14(a) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder; (d) a description of any

 

7

 

agreement, arrangement or understanding with respect to the nomination or
proposal and/or the voting of shares of any class or series of stock of the
Corporation between or among the stockholder giving the notice, the beneficial
owner, if any, on whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, any of
their respective affiliates or associates and/or any others acting in concert
with any of the foregoing (collectively, "proponent persons"); and

 

(e)a description of any agreement, arrangement or understanding (including
without limitation any contract to purchase or sell, acquisition or grant of
any option, right or warrant to purchase or sell, swap or other instrument)
the intent or effect of which may be

(i)to transfer to or from any proponent person, in whole or in part, any of
the economic consequences of ownership of any security of the Corporation,
(ii) to increase or decrease the voting power of any proponent person with
respect to shares of any class or series of stock of the Corporation and/or
(iii) to provide any proponent person, directly or indirectly, with the
opportunity to profit or share in any profit derived from, or to otherwise
benefit economically from, any increase or decrease in the value of any
security of the Corporation. A stockholder providing notice of a proposed
nomination for election to the Board or other business proposed to be brought
before a meeting (whether given pursuant to this Section 2.12(a)(iii) or
Section 2.12(b)) shall update and supplement such notice from time to time to
the extent necessary so that the information provided or required to be
provided in such notice shall be true and correct as of the record date for
determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the meeting and as of the
date that is fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting or any adjournment or
postponement thereof, provided that if the record date for determining the
stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting is less than fifteen (15) days
prior to the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof, the
information shall be supplemented and updated as of such later date. Any such
update and supplement shall be delivered in writing to the Secretary at the
principal executive offices of the Corporation not later than five (5) days
after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of
the meeting (in the case of any update or supplement required to be made as
of the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to notice of the
meeting), not later than ten (10) days prior to the date for the meeting or
any adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of any update or
supplement required to be made as of fifteen (15) days prior to the meeting
or any adjournment or postponement thereof) and not later than five

 

(5) days after the record date for determining the stockholders entitled to
vote at the meeting, but no later than the date prior to the meeting or any
adjournment or postponement thereof (in the case of any update and supplement
required to be made as of a date less than fifteen (15) days prior the date of
the meeting or any adjournment or postponement thereof). The Corporation may
require any proposed nominee to furnish such other information as it may
reasonably require to determine the eligibility of such proposed nominee to
serve as a director of the Corporation and to determine the independence of
such director under the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder and
applicable stock exchange rules.

 

(A)The foregoing notice requirements of this Section 2.12(a)(iii) shall be
deemed satisfied by a stockholder as to any proposal (other than nominations)
if the stockholder has notified the Corporation of such stockholder\'s
intention to present such proposal at an annual meeting in compliance with
Rule 14a-8 (or any successor thereof) of the Exchange Act, and such
stockholder has complied with the requirements of such Rule for inclusion of
such proposal in a proxy statement prepared by the Corporation to solicit
proxies for such annual meeting. Nothing in this Section 2.12(a)(iii) shall be
deemed to affect any rights of stockholders to

 

8

 

request inclusion of proposals in the Corporation\'s proxy statement pursuant
to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act.

(iv)Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of Section 2.12(a)(iii)(A)
to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors to be elected to
the Board is increased, effective after the time period for which nominations
would otherwise be due under Section 2.12(a)(ii), and there is no public
announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size
of the increased Board made by the Corporation at least one hundred (100)
days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding year\'s annual meeting, a
stockholder\'s notice required by this Section 2.12 shall also be considered
timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new positions created by
such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal
executive offices of the Corporation not later than the close of business on
the tenth day following the day on which a public announcement of such
increase is first made by the Corporation.

 

(b)Special Meetings of Stockholders. Only such business shall be conducted at
a special meeting of stockholders as shall have been brought before the
meeting pursuant to the Corporation\'s notice of meeting pursuant to Section
2.3. At any time that the stockholders are not prohibited from filling
vacancies or newly created directorships on the Board, nominations of persons
for election to the Board may be made at a special meeting of stockholders at
which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Corporation\'s notice of
meeting (a) by or at the direction of the Board or a committee thereof, (b)
as provided in the Investor Rights Agreement or (c) provided that the Board
has determined that directors shall be elected at such meeting, by any
stockholder of the Corporation who is entitled to vote on such election at the
meeting, who has complied with the notice procedures set forth in this
Section 2.12 and who is a stockholder of record at the time such notice is
delivered to the Secretary of the Corporation. In the event the Corporation
calls a special meeting of stockholders for the purpose of electing one or
more directors to the Board, any such stockholder entitled to vote in such
election of directors may nominate a person or persons (as the case may be)
for election to such position(s) as specified in the Corporation\'s notice of
meeting if the stockholder\'s notice as required by Section 2.12(a)(ii) is
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation not earlier than the close of business on the 120th day prior to
such special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of
the 90th day prior to such special meeting or the tenth day following the day
on which public announcement is first made of the date of the special meeting
and of the nominees proposed by the Board to be elected at such meeting.

 

(c)General.

 

(i)(A) Only persons who are nominated in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this Section 2.12 shall be eligible to be elected to serve as
directors and only such business shall be conducted at a meeting of
stockholders as shall have been brought before the meeting in accordance with
the procedures set forth in this Section 2.12. Except as otherwise provided by
law, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the chairman of the
meeting shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination or
any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 2.12 and, if any proposed
nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section 2.12, to declare
that such defective nomination shall be disregarded or that such
proposed business shall not be transacted.

(B)Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12, if the
stockholder (or a qualified representative of the stockholder) does not appear

 

9

 

at the annual or special meeting of stockholders of the Corporation to
present a nomination or business, such nomination shall be disregarded and
such proposed business shall not be transacted, notwithstanding that proxies
in respect of such vote may have been received by the Corporation. For
purposes of this Section 2.12, to be considered a qualified representative of
the stockholder, a person must be a duly authorized officer, manager or
partner of such stockholder or must be authorized by a writing executed by
such stockholder or an electronic transmission delivered by such stockholder
to act for such stockholder as proxy at the meeting of stockholders and such
person must produce such writing or electronic transmission, or a reliable
reproduction of the writing or electronic transmission, at the meeting of
stockholders.

 

(ii)If authorized by the Board in its sole discretion, and subject to such
rules, regulations and procedures as the Board may adopt, stockholders of the
Corporation and proxyholders not physically present at a meeting of
stockholders of the Corporation may, by means of remote communication
participate in a meeting of stockholders of the Corporation and be deemed
present in person and vote at a meeting of stockholders of the Corporation
whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by means of
remote communication; provided, however, that (i) the Corporation shall
implement reasonable measures to verify that each person deemed present and
permitted to vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a
stockholder of the Corporation or proxyholder; (ii) the Corporation shall
implement reasonable measures to provide such stockholders of the Corporation
and proxyholders a reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and
to vote on matters submitted to the stockholders of the Corporation,
including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the meeting
substantially concurrently with such proceedings; and (iii) if any stockholder
of the Corporation or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting
by means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall
be maintained by the Corporation.

 

(iii)For purposes of this Section 2.12, "public announcement" shall mean
disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
Associated Press or comparable national news service, in a document publicly
filed or furnished by the Corporation with the Securities and Exchange
Commission pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act or
otherwise disseminated in a manner constituting "public disclosure" under
Regulation FD promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission.

 

(iv)No adjournment or postponement or notice of adjournment or postponement of
any meeting shall be deemed to constitute a new notice (or extend any notice
time period) of such meeting for purposes of this Section 2.12, and in order
for any notification required to be delivered by a stockholder pursuant to
this Section 2.12 to be timely, such notification must be delivered within the
periods set forth above with respect to the originally scheduled meeting.

 

(v)Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 2.12, a
stockholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section 2.12; provided, however, that, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, any references in these By-Laws to the
Exchange Act or the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder are not
intended to and shall not limit any requirements applicable to nominations or
proposals as to any other business to be considered pursuant to this Section
2.12 (including clause (d)

 

10

 

of Section 2.12(a)(i) and Section 2.12(b) hereof), and compliance with clause
(d) of Section 2.12(a)(i) and Section 2.12(b) shall be the exclusive means for
a stockholder to make nominations or submit other business. Nothing in this
Section 2.12 shall apply to the right, if any, of the holders of any series of
Preferred Stock to elect directors pursuant to any applicable provisions of
the Certificate of Incorporation.

 

(vi)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, for as long as
the Investor Rights Agreement (as defined in the Certificate of Incorporation)
remains in effect with respect to the Parties (as defined in the Certificate
of Incorporation) (the "Investor Rights Agreement Parties"), the Investor
Rights Agreement Parties (to the extent then subject to the Investor Rights
Agreement) shall not be subject to the notice procedures set forth in Section
2.12(a)(ii), Section 2.12(a)(iii) or Section 2.12(b) with respect to any
annual or special meeting of stockholders to the extent necessary to effect
the transactions and rights set forth in the Investor Rights Agreement.

provided for the filling of vacancies and newly created directorships and
except as otherwise expressly provided in the Certificate of Incorporation or
the Investor Rights Agreement) be elected by the holders of a plurality of the
votes cast by the holders of shares present in person or represented by proxy

Section 3.2 Vacancies. Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and the
Investor Rights Agreement, unless otherwise required by the DGCL or Section
3.4, any newly created directorship on the Board that results from an increase

death, resignation, removal (including pursuant to the terms of the
Certificate of Incorporation), retirement, disqualification or otherwise)
shall be filled only by a majority of the directors then in office, although
less than a quorum, by any authorized committee of the Board or by a sole
remaining director.

Section 3.3 Meetings of the Board. Meetings of the Board shall be held at
such place, if any, within or without the State of Delaware as may from time
to time be fixed by resolution of the Board or as may be specified in the
notice of any meeting. Regular meetings of the Board shall be held at such
times as may from time to time be fixed by resolution of the Board and
special meetings may be held at any time upon the call of the Chairman of the
Board, the Chief Executive Officer, or by a majority of the total number of

notice may be given by the officer who called the meeting or the directors who
requested the meeting. The notice of any meeting need not specify the purposes
thereof. A meeting of the Board may be held without notice immediately after
the annual meeting of stockholders at the same place, if any, at which such
meeting is held. Notice need not be given of regular meetings of the Board
held at times fixed by resolution of the Board. Notice of any meeting need
not be given to any director who shall attend such meeting (except when the
director attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting at the
beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business because the
meeting is not lawfully called or convened), or who shall waive notice
thereof, before or after such meeting, in writing (including by electronic
transmission).

 

Section 3.4 Preferred Stock Directors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever
the holders of any one or more series of Preferred Stock issued by the
Corporation shall have the right, voting separately as a series or separately
as a class with one or more such other series, to elect directors at an annual
or special meeting of stockholders, the election, term of office, removal, and
other features of such directorships shall be governed by the terms of the
Certificate of Incorporation (including any certificate of designation
relating to any series of Preferred Stock) applicable thereto. The number of
directors that may be elected by the holders of any such series of Preferred
Stock shall be in addition to the total number of directors fixed by the Board
pursuant to the Certificate of Incorporation and these By-Laws. Except as
otherwise expressly provided in the terms of such series, the number of
directors that may be so elected by the holders of any such series of stock
shall be elected for terms expiring at the next annual meeting of
stockholders, and vacancies among directors so elected by the separate vote of
the holders of any such series of Preferred Stock shall be filled by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the remaining directors elected by such
series, or, if there are no such remaining directors, by the holders of such
series in the same manner in which such series initially elected a director.

Section 3.5 Committees. The Board may from time to time establish one or more
committees of the Board to serve at the pleasure of the Board, which shall be
comprised of such members of the Board, subject to the Investor Rights
Agreement, and have such duties as the Board shall from time to time
determine. Any director may belong to any number of committees of the Board.
Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and the Investor Rights Agreement,
the Board may designate one or more directors as alternate members of any
committee, who may replace any absent or disqualified member at any meeting
of the committee. In the absence or disqualification of a member of a
committee, the member or members present at any meeting and not disqualified
from voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in the
place of any such absent or disqualified member, subject to the Investor
Rights Agreement. Subject to the Certificate of Incorporation and
the Investor Rights Agreement, unless otherwise provided in the Certificate
of Incorporation, these By-Laws or the resolution of the Board designating the

to consist of one or more members of the committee, and may delegate to a
subcommittee any or all of the powers and authority of the committee. Any such
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board establishing
such committee, shall have and may exercise all the powers and authority of
the Board in the management of the business and affairs of the Corporation,
and may authorize the seal of the Corporation to be affixed to all papers
which may require it; but no such committee shall have the power or authority
in reference to the following matters:

(a)approving or adopting, or recommending to the stockholders, any action or
matter (other than the election or removal of directors) expressly required by
the DGCL to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (b) adopting,
amending or repealing any By-Law of the Corporation. Each committee of the
Board may fix its own rules of procedure and shall hold its meetings as
provided by such rules, except as may otherwise be provided by a resolution
of the Board designating such committee. Unless otherwise provided in such a
resolution, the presence of at least a majority of the members of the
committee shall be necessary to constitute a quorum unless the
committee shall consist of one or two members, in which event

12

 

one member shall constitute a quorum; and all matters shall be determined by
a majority vote of the members present at a meeting of the committee at which
a quorum is present. Unless otherwise provided in such a resolution, in the
event that a member and that member\'s alternate, if alternates are
designated by the Board, of such committee is or are absent or disqualified,
the member or members thereof present at any meeting and not disqualified from
voting, whether or not such member or members constitute a quorum, may
unanimously appoint another member of the Board to act at the meeting in
place of any such absent or disqualified member.

 

Section 3.6 Consent in Lieu of Meeting. Unless otherwise restricted by the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of the Board or of any committee thereof
may be taken without a meeting if all members of the Board or committee, as
the case may be, consent thereto in writing (including by electronic
transmission), and the writing or writings (including any electronic
transmission or transmissions) are filed with the minutes of proceedings of
the Board.

 

Section 3.7 Telephonic Meetings. The members of the Board or any committee
thereof may participate in a meeting of such Board or committee, as the case
may be, by means of conference telephone or other communications equipment by
means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other,
and participation in a meeting pursuant to this subsection shall constitute
presence in person at such a meeting.

compensation of directors and for the reimbursement of the expenses of
directors, in each case, in connection with services provided by directors to
the Corporation.

INDEMNIFICATION AND ADVANCEMENT OF EXPENSES

 

Section 5.1 Right to Indemnification. Each person who was or is made a party
or is threatened to be made a party to or is otherwise involved in any
threatened, pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative or any other type whatsoever
(hereinafter a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that he or she is or was
a director or an officer of the Corporation or, while a director or officer of
the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the Corporation as a
director, manager, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another corporation
or of a partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or other
enterprise, including service with respect to an employee benefit plan
(hereinafter an "indemnitee"), whether the basis of such proceeding is alleged
action in an official capacity as a director, officer, employee, agent or
trustee or in any other capacity while serving as a director, officer,
employee, agent or trustee, shall be indemnified and held harmless by the
Corporation to the fullest extent permitted by Delaware law, as the same
exists or may hereafter be amended (but, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Corporation to provide
broader indemnification rights than such law permitted the Corporation to
provide prior to such amendment), against all expense, liability and loss
(including attorneys\' fees, judgments, fines, ERISA excise taxes or
penalties and amounts paid in settlement) reasonably incurred or suffered by
such indemnitee in connection therewith; except as provided in Section 5.3
with respect to proceedings to enforce rights to indemnification or
advancement of expenses or with respect to any compulsory counterclaim brought
by such indemnitee, the Corporation shall indemnify any such indemnitee in
connection with a proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such indemnitee
only if such proceeding (or part thereof) was authorized by the Board.

 

Section 5.2 Right to Advancement of Expenses. In addition to the right to
indemnification conferred in Section 5.1, an indemnitee shall also have the
right to be paid by the Corporation the expenses (including attorney\'s fees)
incurred in appearing at, participating in or defending any such proceeding
in advance of its final disposition or in connection with a proceeding brought
to establish or enforce a right to indemnification or advancement of expenses
under this Article V (which shall be governed by Section 5.3) (hereinafter an
"advancement of expenses"); provided, however, that, if (x) the DGCL requires
or (y) in the case of an advance made in a proceeding brought to establish or
enforce a right to indemnification or advancement, an advancement of expenses
incurred by an indemnitee in his or her capacity as a director or officer (and
not in any other capacity in which service was or is rendered by such
indemnitee, including, without limitation, service to an employee
benefit plan) shall be made solely upon delivery to the Corporation of an
undertaking (hereinafter an "undertaking"), by or on behalf of such
indemnitee, to repay all amounts so advanced if it shall ultimately be
determined after final judicial decision from which there is no further right
to appeal (hereinafter a "final adjudication") that such indemnitee is not
entitled to indemnification under this Article V or otherwise.

 

Section 5.3 Right of Indemnitee to Bring Suit. If a claim under Section 5.1 or
Section 5.2 is not paid in full by the Corporation within (i) sixty (60) days
after a written claim for indemnification has been received by the Corporation
or (ii) twenty (20) days after a claim for an advancement of expenses has
been received by the Corporation, the indemnitee may at any time thereafter
bring suit against the

14

 

 

Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim or to obtain advancement
of expenses, as applicable. To the fullest extent permitted by law, if the
indemnitee is successful in whole or in part in any such suit, or in a suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the indemnitee shall be entitled to be paid also
the expense of prosecuting or defending such suit. In (i) any suit brought by
the indemnitee to enforce a right to indemnification hereunder (but not in a
suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right to an advancement of
expenses) it shall be a defense of the Corporation that, and (ii) any suit
brought by the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to
the terms of an undertaking, the Corporation shall be entitled to recover such
expenses upon a final adjudication that, the indemnitee has not met any
applicable standard for indemnification set forth in the DGCL. Neither the
failure of the Corporation (including by its directors who are not parties to
such action, a committee of such directors, independent legal counsel, or
its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of
such suit that indemnification of the indemnitee is proper in the
circumstances because the indemnitee has met the applicable standard of
conduct set forth in the DGCL, nor an actual determination by the Corporation
(including by its directors who are not parties to such action, a committee of
such directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that the
indemnitee has not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall create a
presumption that the indemnitee has not met the applicable standard of conduct
or, in the case of such a suit brought by the indemnitee, be a defense to such
suit. In any suit brought by the indemnitee to enforce a right
to indemnification or to an advancement of expenses hereunder, or brought by
the Corporation to recover an advancement of expenses pursuant to the terms of
an undertaking, the burden of proving that the indemnitee is not entitled to
be indemnified, or to such advancement of expenses, under this Article V or
otherwise shall be on the Corporation.

 

Section 5.4 Non-Exclusivity of Rights; Indemnification by Other Persons.

 

(a)The provision of indemnification to or the advancement of expenses and
costs to any indemnitee under this Article V, or the entitlement of any
indemnitee to indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs under this
Article V, shall not limit or restrict in any way the power of the Corporation
to indemnify or advance expenses and costs to such indemnitee in any other way
permitted by law or be deemed exclusive of, or invalidate, any right to which
any indemnitee seeking indemnification or advancement of expenses and costs
may be entitled under any law, agreement, vote of stockholders or
disinterested directors or otherwise, both as to action in such indemnitee\'s
capacity as an officer, director, employee or agent of the Corporation and as
to action in any other capacity.

 

(b)Given that certain jointly indemnifiable claims (as defined below) may
arise due to the service of the indemnitee as a director and/or officer of the
Corporation or as a director, officer, employee, agent or trustee of another
corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise at
the request of the indemnitee-related entities (as defined below), the
Corporation shall be fully and primarily responsible for the payment to the
indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses in
connection with any such jointly indemnifiable claims, pursuant to and in
accordance with the terms of this Article V, irrespective of any right of
recovery the indemnitee may have from the indemnitee-related entities. Under
no circumstance shall the Corporation be entitled to any right of subrogation
against or contribution by the indemnitee-related entities and no right of
advancement, indemnification or recovery the indemnitee may have from the
indemnitee-related entities shall reduce or otherwise alter the rights of the
indemnitee or the obligations of the Corporation under this Article V. In the
event that any of the indemnitee-related entities shall make any payment to
the indemnitee in respect of indemnification or advancement of expenses with
respect to any jointly indemnifiable claim, the indemnitee-related entity
making such payment shall be subrogated to the extent of such payment to all
of the rights of recovery of the indemnitee against the Corporation, and the
indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall do all
things that may be reasonably necessary to

 

15

 

secure such rights, including the execution of such documents as may be
necessary to enable the indemnitee-related entities effectively to bring suit
to enforce such rights. Each of the indemnitee- related entities shall be
third-party beneficiaries with respect to this Section 5.4(b), entitled to
enforce this Section 5.4(b). For purposes of this Section 5.4(b), the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

 

(i)The term "indemnitee-related entities" means any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise (other than the Corporation or any other corporation,
limited liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan or other enterprise for which the indemnitee has agreed, on behalf of
the Corporation or at the Corporation\'s request, to serve as a director,
officer, employee or agent and which service is covered by the indemnity
described herein) from whom an indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification
or advancement of expenses with respect to which, in whole or in part, the
Corporation may also have an indemnification or advancement obligation.

 

(ii)The term "jointly indemnifiable claims" shall be broadly construed and
shall include, without limitation, any action, suit or proceeding for which
the indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification or advancement of expenses
from both the indemnitee- related entities and the Corporation pursuant to
applicable law, any agreement, certificate of incorporation, by-laws,
partnership agreement, operating agreement, certificate of formation,
certificate of limited partnership or comparable organizational documents of
the Corporation or the indemnitee-related entities, as applicable.

 

Section 5.5 Contract Rights. The rights conferred upon indemnitees in this
Article V shall be contract rights and such rights shall continue as to an
indemnitee who has ceased to be a director or officer and shall inure to the
benefit of the indemnitee\'s heirs, executors and administrators. Any
amendment, alteration or repeal of this Article V that adversely affects any
right of an indemnitee or its successors shall be prospective only and shall
not limit, eliminate, or impair any such right with respect to any proceeding
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal.

 

Section 5.6 Insurance. The Corporation may purchase and maintain insurance, at
its expense, to protect itself and any director, officer, employee or agent of
the Corporation or another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Corporation would have the power to indemnify such person against such
expense, liability or loss under the DGCL.

Section 5.7 Employees and Agents. The Corporation may, to the extent
authorized from time to time by the Board, grant rights to indemnification
and to the advancement of expenses to any employee or agent of the
Corporation to the fullest extent of the provisions of this Article V with
respect to the indemnification and advancement of expenses of directors and
officers of the Corporation.

SHARES AND OTHER SECURITIES OF THE CORPORATION

 

Section 8.1 Certificated and Uncertificated Shares. The shares of the
Corporation may be certificated or uncertificated, subject to the sole
discretion of the Board and the requirements of the DGCL.

Section 8.2 Signatures. Each certificate representing capital stock of the

authorized officers of the Corporation, which authorized officers shall
include, without limitation, the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
Officer, the President, any Vice President, the Chief Financial Officer, the

agent or registrar before such certificate is issued, such certificate may be
issued by the Corporation with the same effect as if such person were such

Section 8.3 Lost, Destroyed or Wrongfully Taken Certificates.

(a)If an owner of a certificate representing shares claims that such
certificate has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Corporation
shall issue a new certificate representing such shares or such shares in
uncertificated form if the owner: (i) requests such a new certificate before
the Corporation has notice that the certificate representing such shares has
been acquired by a protected purchaser; (ii) if requested by the Corporation,
delivers to the Corporation a bond sufficient to indemnify the Corporation
against any claim that may be made against the Corporation on account of the
alleged loss, wrongful taking or destruction of such certificate or the
issuance of such new certificate or uncertificated shares; and (iii) satisfies
other reasonable requirements imposed by the Corporation.

 

(b)If a certificate representing shares has been lost, apparently destroyed or
wrongfully taken, and the owner fails to notify the Corporation of that fact
within a reasonable time after the owner has notice of such loss, apparent
destruction or wrongful taking and the Corporation registers a transfer of
such shares before receiving notification, the owner shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, be precluded from asserting against the Corporation
any claim for registering such transfer or a claim to a new certificate
representing such shares or such shares in uncertificated form.

 

Section 8.4 Transfer of Stock.

 

17

 

(a)Transfers of record of shares of stock of the Corporation shall be made
only upon the books administered by or on behalf of the Corporation and only
upon proper transfer instructions, including by Electronic Transmission,
pursuant to the direction of the registered holder thereof, such person\'s
attorney lawfully constituted in writing, or from an individual presenting
proper evidence of succession, assignment or authority to transfer the shares
of stock; or, in the case of stock represented by certificate(s) upon delivery
of a properly endorsed certificate(s) for a like number of shares or
accompanied by a duly executed stock transfer power.

(b)The Corporation shall have power to enter into and perform any agreement
with any number of stockholders of any one or more classes of stock of the
corporation to restrict the transfer of shares of stock of the Corporation of
any one or more classes owned by such stockholders in any manner not
prohibited by the DGCL.

 

Section 8.5 Registered Stockholders. Before due presentment for registration
of transfer of a certificate representing shares of the Corporation or of an
instruction requesting registration of transfer of uncertificated shares, the
Corporation may treat the registered owner as the person exclusively entitled
to inspect for any proper purpose the stock ledger and the other books and
records of the Corporation, vote such shares, receive dividends or
notifications with respect to such shares and otherwise exercise all the
rights and powers of the owner of such shares, except that a person who is the
beneficial owner of such shares (if held in a voting trust or by a nominee on
behalf of such person) may, upon providing documentary evidence of beneficial
ownership of such shares and satisfying such other conditions as are provided
under applicable law, may also so inspect the books and records of
the Corporation.

Section 8.6 Regulations. The Board shall have power and authority to make
such additional rules and regulations, subject to any applicable requirement
of law, as the Board may deem necessary and appropriate with respect to the
issue, transfer or registration of transfer of shares of stock or certificates
representing shares. The Board may appoint one or more transfer agents
or registrars and may require for the validity thereof that certificates
representing shares bear the signature of any transfer agent or registrar so
appointed.

 

ARTICLE IX

ARTICLE XI

 

GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

Section 11.1 Notice. Whenever notice is required to be given by law or under
any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, notice of
any meeting need not be given to any person who shall attend such meeting
(except when the person attends a meeting for the express purpose of
objecting, at the beginning of the meeting, to the transaction of any business
because the meeting is not

 

18

 

lawfully called or convened), or who shall waive notice thereof, before or
after such meeting, in writing (including by electronic transmission).

Section 11.2 Means of Giving Notice. Except as otherwise set forth in any
applicable law or any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or these
By-Laws, notice of any meeting shall be given by the following means:

 

(a)Notice to Directors. Whenever under applicable law, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws notice is required to be given to any director,
such notice shall be given either (i) in writing and sent by mail, or by a
nationally recognized delivery service, (ii) by means of facsimile
telecommunication or other form of electronic transmission, or (iii) by oral
notice given personally or by telephone. A notice to a director will be
deemed given as follows:

(i)if given by hand delivery, orally, or by telephone, when actually received
by the director, (ii) if sent through the United States mail, when deposited
in the United States mail, with postage and fees thereon prepaid, addressed to
the director at the director\'s address appearing on the records of the
Corporation, (iii) if sent for next day delivery by a nationally
recognized overnight delivery service, when deposited with such service, with
fees thereon prepaid, addressed to the director at the director\'s address
appearing on the records of the Corporation, (iv) if sent by facsimile
telecommunication, when sent to the facsimile transmission number for such
director appearing on the records of the Corporation, (v) if sent by
electronic mail, when sent to the electronic mail address for such director
appearing on the records of the Corporation, or (vi) if sent by any other
form of electronic transmission, when sent to the address, location or number
(as applicable) for such director appearing on the records of the Corporation.

 

(b)Electronic Transmission. "Electronic transmission" means any form
of communication, not directly involving the physical transmission of paper,
that creates a record that may be retained, retrieved and reviewed by a
recipient thereof, and that may be directly reproduced in paper form by such a
recipient through an automated process.

 

(c)Notice to Stockholders Sharing Same Address. Without limiting the manner by
which notice otherwise may be given effectively by the Corporation
to stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the Corporation under
any provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws
shall be effective if given by a single written notice to stockholders who
share an address if consented to by the stockholders at that address to whom
such notice is given. A stockholder may revoke such stockholder\'s consent by
delivering written notice of such revocation to the Corporation. Any
stockholder who fails to object in writing to the Corporation within 60 days
of having been given written notice by the Corporation of its intention to
send such a single written notice shall be deemed to have consented to
receiving such single written notice.

 

(d)Exceptions to Notice Requirements.

 

(i)Whenever notice is required to be given, under the DGCL, the Certificate of
Incorporation or these By-Laws, to any person with whom communication is
unlawful, the giving of such notice to such person shall not be required and
there shall be no duty to apply to any governmental authority or agency for a
license or permit to give such notice to such person. Any action or meeting
that shall be taken or held without notice to any such person with whom
communication is unlawful shall have the same force and effect as if such
notice had been duly given. In the event that the action taken by the
Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate with
the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate shall state, if such is
the fact and if notice is required, that notice was given to

19

 

 

all persons entitled to receive notice except such persons with whom
communication is unlawful.

 

(ii)Whenever notice is required to be given by the Corporation, under any
provision of the DGCL, the Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, to
any stockholder to whom (x) notice of two consecutive annual meetings of
stockholders and all notices of stockholder meetings or of the taking of
action by written consent of stockholders without a meeting to such
stockholder during the period between such two consecutive annual meetings,
or (y) all, and at least two payments (if sent by first-class mail) of
dividends or interest on securities during a 12-month period, have been mailed
addressed to such stockholder at such stockholder\'s address as shown on the
records of the Corporation and have been returned undeliverable, the giving
of such notice to such stockholder shall not be required. Any action or
meeting that shall be taken or held without notice to such stockholder shall
have the same force and effect as if such notice had been duly given. If any
such stockholder shall deliver to the Corporation a written notice setting
forth such stockholder\'s then current address, the requirement that notice be
given to such stockholder shall be reinstated. In the event that the action
taken by the Corporation is such as to require the filing of a certificate
with the Secretary of State of Delaware, the certificate need not state that
notice was not given to persons to whom notice was not required to be
given pursuant to Section 230 (b) of the DGCL. The exception in subsection
(x) of the first sentence of this paragraph to the requirement that notice be
given shall not be applicable to any notice returned as undeliverable if the
notice was given by electronic transmission.

 

Section 11.3 Headings. Section headings in these By-Laws are for convenience
of reference only and shall not be given any substantive effect in limiting or
otherwise construing any provision herein.

Section 11.4 Conflicts. In the event that any provision of these By-Laws is
or becomes inconsistent with any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation
or the DGCL, the provision of these By- laws shall not be given any effect to
the extent of such inconsistency but shall otherwise be given full force
and effect.

Re: Forfeiture of Founder Holders\' Buyer Class A Common Stock

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 

Reference is made to that certain Business Combination Agreement (the
"Combination Agreement"), dated as of July 27, 2020, by and among dMY
Technology Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Buyer"), Rush Street
Interactive, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (the "Company"), dMY Sponsor,
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the "Sponsor"), the sellers set
forth on the signatures pages thereto (collectively, the "Sellers" and each, a
"Seller") and Rush Street Interactive GP, LLC, in its capacity as the
Sellers\' Representative thereunder (in such capacity, the "Sellers\'
Representative"). Capitalized terms used but not otherwise defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Combination Agreement.

In order to induce the Company, the Buyer and the Sellers to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the Combination Agreement, and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Buyer, Sponsor, Darla Anderson ("Anderson"), Francesca Luthi
("Luthi"), Charles E. Wert ("Wert" and together with Sponsor, Anderson and
Luthi, the "Founder Holders"), and the Sellers\' Representative hereby agree
to enter into this letter agreement (this "Letter Agreement"), and hereby
agree as follows:

 

1.Forfeiture by Founder Holders.

 

(a)On the date on which the Company Transaction Expenses are finally
determined in accordance with Section 2.3 of the Combination Agreement, up to
one million two hundred five thousand nine hundred thirty-seven (1,205,937)
shares of Buyer Class A Common Stock held by, or beneficially owned by, the
Founder Holders, consisting of two hundred fifty-four thousand three hundred
sixty-one (254,361) Founder Holders Earnout Shares and nine hundred fifty-one
thousand five hundred seventy-six (951,576) shares of Buyer Class A Common
Stock that are not Founder Holders Earnout Shares (collectively, the "Founder
Holders Forfeiture Shares" and each Founder Holder\'s portion of the Founder
Holders Forfeiture Shares (determined on a Pro Rata Basis), the "Applicable
Founder Holder\'s Forfeiture Shares"), shall be automatically forfeited by the
Founder Holders to the Buyer for no consideration and automatically cancelled
in accordance with Section 1(b) and Section 2.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) any Founder Holders
Forfeiture Shares forfeited pursuant to Section 2 shall be forfeited among
the Founder Holders on a Pro Rata Basis, and (ii) with respect to a given
Founder Holder, (x) 21.09 of the Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares forfeited
pursuant to Section 2 shall be Founder Holders Earnout Shares and (y) the
remainder of the Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares forfeited pursuant to
Section 2 shall be shares of Buyer Class A

 

Common Stock. Any Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares forfeited pursuant to
this Section 1(b) shall be cancelled for no consideration and any
certificates representing such Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares so forfeited
shall be cancelled; provided, that to the extent any such certificate
represents shares in addition to a Founder Holders Forfeiture Share, which
shares are not forfeited pursuant to the terms hereof, the Company shall
reissue such certificate with respect to the shares not so forfeited.

2.Calculation of Forfeited Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares. The number of
Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares to be forfeited by the Founder Holders in
accordance with Section  1(b) shall be calculated as follows:

 

(a)if the sum of (i) Aggregate Available Cash as determined as of 11:59 p.m.
New York time on the Post-Closing Financing End Date plus (ii) the amount, if
any, by which Company Transaction Expenses exceeded the Company Transaction
Expense Cap (as finally determined in accordance with Section 2.3 of the
Combination Agreement) (such sum, the "Total Measureable Cash Amount") is
less than or equal to one hundred sixty million dollars ($160,000,000), then
one hundred percent (100%) of the Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares shall
be automatically forfeited by the Founder Holders (on a Pro Rata Basis in
accordance with Section 1(b)) to the Buyer for no consideration and canceled;

 

(b)if the Total Measureable Cash Amount is greater than one hundred sixty
million dollars ($160,000,000), but less than two hundred forty-five million
dollars ($245,000,000), then that number of Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares
equal to (i) the Total Measureable Cash Forfeiture Percentage multiplied by
(ii) the total number of Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares shall be
automatically forfeited by the Founder Holders (on a Pro Rata Basis in
accordance with Section 1(b)) to the Buyer for no consideration and canceled;
and

(c)if the Total Measureable Cash Amount is equal to or greater than two
hundred forty-five million dollars ($245,000,000), then none of the Founder
Holders Forfeiture Shares shall be forfeited by the Founder Holders.

 

3.Definition of "Total Measurable Cash Forfeiture Percentage." For purposes of
this Letter Agreement, "Total Measureable Cash Forfeiture Percentage" means
quotient of, represented as a percentage, (i) the difference of (x) two
hundred forty-five million dollars ($245,000,000) minus (y) the Total
Measureable Cash Amount divided by (ii) eighty-five million dollars
($85,000,000); provided that in no event may the Total Measureable Cash
Forfeiture Percentage be less than zero percent (0%) or exceed one hundred
percent (100%).

 

4.Transfer. Prior to the final determination of the number of Founder Holders
Forfeiture Shares to be forfeited in accordance with this Agreement (if
any), the Founder Holders shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer or
otherwise dispose of any of the Founder Holders Forfeiture Shares, other than
as may be expressly permitted by the Investor Rights Agreement and the Buyer
AandR Certificate of Incorporation.

5.Founder Holder Representations. Each Founder Holder (as to itself and not
any other Founder Holder), severally and not jointly, hereby represents
and warrants to the Buyer and the Sellers\'

Representative, as of the date hereof, that such Founder Holder owns, and
holds of record, all of such

 

Founder Holder\'s Applicable Founder Holder\'s Forfeiture Shares, free and
clear of all Liens, other than Securities Liens and such Liens and
other obligations imposed by applicable securities Laws, the Combination
Agreement, the Buyer AandR Certificate of Incorporation, the Buyer AandR Bylaws
and the Investor Rights Agreement.

 

2

 

6.Assignment. No party hereto may assign either this Letter Agreement or any
of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
consent of each of the other parties hereto. Any purported assignment in
violation of this Section 6 shall be void and ineffectual and shall not
operate to transfer or assign any interest or title to the purported assignee.
This Letter Agreement shall be binding on the Buyer and the Founder Holders
and their respective successors and assigns.

7.Notices. Any notice, consent, or request to be given in connection with any
of the terms or provisions of this Letter Agreement shall be given to the
Buyer and the Sellers\' Representative in accordance with Section 11.4 of the
Combination Agreement, and to the Founder Holders in accordance with the
notice information set forth on such Founder Holder\'s signature page hereto;
in each case, unless a party otherwise specifies a different address in a
writing delivered to the other parties hereto.

 

8.Amendments. No amendment of any provision of this Letter Agreement shall be
valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by all of the
parties hereto. No waiver of any provision or condition of this Letter
Agreement shall be valid unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the
party against which such waiver is to be enforced. No waiver by any party of
any default, breach of representation or warranty or breach of covenant
hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to extend to any other,
prior or subsequent default or breach or affect in any way any rights arising
by virtue of any other, prior or subsequent such occurrence.

9.Miscellaneous. Section 11.2 (Waiver of Remedies; Survival of Representations
and Warranties), Section 11.8 (Entire Agreement), Section 11.9 (Counterparts;
Electronic Delivery), and Section 11.10 (Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial;
Jurisdiction) of the Combination Agreement are hereby incorporated into this
Letter Agreement, mutatis mutandis, as though set out in their entirety in
this Section 9.

or to other Persons, and to admit such Persons as Additional Limited Partners,
for such consideration and on such terms and conditions as shall be
established by the General Partner, all without the approval of any Limited
Partner or any other Person. Without limiting the foregoing, the General
Partner is expressly authorized to cause the Partnership to issue Partnership
Units (i) upon the conversion, redemption or exchange of any Debt, Partnership
Units, or other securities issued by the Partnership, (ii) for less than fair
market value, (iii) for no consideration, (iv) in connection with any merger

 

17

 

of any other Person into the Partnership, or (v) upon the contribution of
property or assets to the Partnership. A Partnership Interest of any class or
series other than a Class A Common Unit shall not entitle the holder thereof
to vote on, or consent to, any matter. Upon the issuance of any additional
Partnership Interest, the General Partner shall amend the Register and the
books and records of the Partnership as appropriate to reflect such issuance.

 

(b)No Preemptive Rights. Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, no
Person, including any Holder, shall have any preemptive,
preferential, participation or similar right or rights to subscribe for or
acquire any Partnership Interest.

Section 3.3 Additional Funds and Capital Contributions.

 

(a)General. The General Partner may, at any time and from time to time,
determine that the Partnership requires additional funds ("Additional Funds")
for the acquisition or development of additional Assets, for the redemption of
Partnership Units or for such other purposes as the General Partner
may determine. Additional Funds may be obtained by the Partnership, at the
election of the General Partner, in any manner provided in, and in accordance
with, the terms of this Section 3.3 without the approval of any Limited
Partner or any other Person.

 

(b)Loans by Third Parties. The General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership,
may obtain any Additional Funds by causing the Partnership to incur Debt to
any Person (other than, except as contemplated in Section 3.3(c), the General
Partner or the Special Limited Partner) upon such terms as the General Partner
determines appropriate, including making such Debt convertible, redeemable or
exchangeable for Partnership Units; provided, however, that the Partnership
shall not incur any such Debt if any Partner (other than the General Partner
in its capacity as such) would be personally liable for the repayment of such
Debt (unless such Partner otherwise agrees).

(c)General Partner and Special Limited Partner Loans. The General Partner, on
behalf of the Partnership, may obtain any Additional Funds by causing the
Partnership to incur Debt with the Special Limited Partner if (i) such Debt
is, to the extent permitted by law, on substantially the same terms and
conditions (including interest rate, repayment schedule, and conversion,
redemption, repurchase and exchange rights) as Funding Debt incurred by the
Special Limited Partner, the net proceeds of which are loaned to the
Partnership to provide such Additional Funds, or (ii) such Debt is on terms
and conditions no less favorable to the Partnership than would be available to
the Partnership from any third party; provided, however, that the Partnership
shall not incur any such Debt if any Partner would be personally liable for
the repayment of such Debt (unless such Partner otherwise agrees).

Section 3.4 Issuances; Repurchases and Redemptions; Recapitalizations.

 

(a)Issuances by the Special Limited Partner

any other Equity Securities of the Special Limited Partner (other than Class
V Shares), (x) the Partnership shall concurrently issue to the Special Limited
Partner an equal number of Class A Common Units (if the Special Limited
Partner issues Class A Shares), or an equal number of such other
Equity Security of the Partnership corresponding to the Equity Securities
issued by the Special Limited Partner (if the Special Limited Partner issues
Equity Securities other than Class A Shares), and with substantially the same
rights to dividends and distributions (including distributions upon
liquidation) and other economic rights as those of such Equity Securities of

and distribution to holders of Class A Shares or other Equity Securities of
the Special Limited Partner of rights to purchase Equity Securities of the
Special Limited Partner under a "poison pill" or similar shareholder rights
plan (and upon exchange of Class A Common Units for Class A Shares, such Class

or (y) the issuance under the Special Limited Partner\'s employee benefit
plans of any warrants, options, stock appreciation right, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, performance based award or other rights to acquire

Section 3.4(a)(i), and (z) the Special Limited Partner shall concurrently
contribute to the Partnership the net proceeds received by the Special Limited
Partner from any such exercise or conversion.

(b)New Partnership Issuances. Except pursuant to Section 14.1 or as mutually
agreed between the Special Limited Partner and the General Partner (and with
the consent of the Original Limited Partner Representative not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed),, (x) the Partnership may not
issue any additional Class A Common Units or Partnership Units to the Special
Limited Partner or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries) unless substantially simultaneously therewith the Special
Limited Partner or such Subsidiary issues or transfers an equal number of
newly- issued Class A Shares (or relevant Equity Security of such Subsidiary)
to another Person or Persons and contributes the net proceeds therefrom to the
Partnership, and (y) the Partnership may not issue any other Equity
Securities of the Partnership to the Special Limited Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries) unless
substantially simultaneously therewith the Special Limited Partner or

newly-issued shares of Equity Securities of the Special Limited Partner or
such Subsidiary with substantially the same rights to dividends and
distributions (including distributions upon liquidation) and other economic
rights as those of such Equity Securities of the Partnership and contributes
the net proceeds therefrom to the Partnership.

unless substantially simultaneously therewith the Partnership redeems,
repurchases or otherwise acquires from the Special Limited Partner or such
Subsidiary an equal number of Class A Common Units for the same price per
security, if any, or (B) any other Equity Securities of the Special Limited
Partner or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries) pursuant to a Board approved repurchase plan or program (or
otherwise in connection with a transaction approved by the

19

 

Board) unless substantially simultaneously therewith the Partnership redeems,
repurchases or otherwise acquires from the Special Limited Partner or such
Subsidiary an equal number of the corresponding class or series of Equity
Securities of the Partnership with the same rights to dividends and
distributions (including distributions upon liquidation) and other economic
rights as those of such Equity Securities of the Special Limited Partner or
such Subsidiary for the same price per security, if any.

(ii)The Partnership may not redeem, repurchase or otherwise acquire (x) any
Class A Common Units from the Special Limited Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries) unless
substantially simultaneously the Special Limited Partner or such Subsidiary
redeems, repurchases or otherwise acquires pursuant to a Board approved
repurchase plan or program (or otherwise in connection with a
transaction approved by the Board) an equal number of Class A Shares for the
same price per security from holders thereof or (y) any other Partnership
Units of the Partnership from the Special Limited Partner or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries) unless
substantially simultaneously the Special Limited Partner or such Subsidiary

(d)Equity Subdivisions and Combinations. Except in accordance with Section
14.1:

 

(i)The Partnership shall not in any manner effect any subdivision (by any
equity split, equity distribution, reclassification, recapitalization or
otherwise) or combination (by reverse equity split, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the outstanding Partnership Units unless

outstanding Capital Shares or other related class or series of
Equity Security of the Special Limited Partner, with corresponding changes
made with respect to any other exchangeable or convertible Equity Securities
of the Partnership and the Special Limited Partner.

 

(ii)The Special Limited Partner shall not in any manner effect any subdivision
(by any equity split, equity distribution, reclassification, recapitalization
or otherwise) or combination (by reverse equity split, reclassification,
recapitalization or otherwise) of the outstanding Capital Shares or any other
class or series of Equity Security of the Special Limited Partner, unless
accompanied by an identical subdivision or combination, as applicable, of the
outstanding Partnership Units or other related class or series of Equity
Security of the Partnership, with corresponding changes made with respect to
any applicable exchangeable or convertible Equity Securities of
the Partnership and the Special Limited Partner or as otherwise mutually
agreed between the Special Limited Partner and the General Partner (and with
the consent of the Original Limited Partner Representative, not to be
unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed).

(e)General Authority. For the avoidance of doubt, but subject to Section 3.1,
Section 3.2, and Section 3.4, the Partnership, the Special Limited Partner
and the General Partner shall be permitted to undertake all actions, including
an issuance, redemption, reclassification, distribution, division or
recapitalization, with respect to the Class A Common Units as the General
Partner determines (with the approval of the Original Limited Partner
Representative) is necessary to maintain at all times a one-to-one ratio
between (i) the number of Class A Common Units owned by Special Limited
Partner, directly or indirectly, and the number of outstanding Class A
Shares, and (ii) the number of outstanding Class V Shares held by any Person
(other than the Special Limited Partner) and the number of Class A Common
Units held by such Person disregarding, for purposes of maintaining the one-
to-one ratios in clause (i), (A) options, rights or securities of the Special
Limited Partner issued under any plan involving the issuance of any Equity

 

20

 

Securities that are convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable for Class
A Shares, (B) treasury stock, or (C) preferred stock or other debt or equity
securities (including warrants, options or rights) issued by the Special
Limited Partner that are convertible or into or exercisable or exchangeable
for Class A Shares (but in each case prior to such conversion, exercise or
exchange).

Section 3.5 No Interest; No Return. No Partner shall be entitled to interest
on its Capital Contribution or on such Partner\'s Capital Account. Except as
provided herein or by law, no Partner shall have any right to demand or
receive the return of its Capital Contribution from the Partnership.

 

Section 3.6 Capital Accounts.

(a)A Capital Account shall be maintained by the General Partner for each
Partner in accordance with the provisions of Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv) and, to the extent consistent with such regulations, the
other provisions of this Agreement. Each Partner\'s Capital Account balance as
of the date hereof shall be equal to the amount of its respective Closing
Date Capital Account Balance set forth opposite such Partner\'s name on
Exhibit A, which balances shall reflect a revaluation of the Partnership\'s
assets in accordance with clause (6) of the definition of Gross Asset Value.
Thereafter, each Partner\'s Capital Account shall be (a) increased by (i)
allocations to such Partner of Net Income pursuant to Section 5.1 and any
other items of income or gain allocated to such Partner pursuant to
Section 5.2,

(ii)the amount of cash or the initial Gross Asset Value of any asset (net of
any Liabilities assumed by the Partnership and any Liabilities to which the
asset is subject) contributed to the Partnership by such Partner, and (iii)
any other increases allowed or required by Regulations Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), and

(b)decreased by (i) allocations to such Partner of Net Losses pursuant to
Section 5.1 and any other items of deduction or loss allocated to such
Partner pursuant to the provisions of Section 5.2, (ii) the amount of any cash
or the Gross Asset Value of any asset (net of any Liabilities assumed by the
Partner and any Liabilities to which the asset is subject) distributed to such
Partner, and (iii) any other decreases allowed or required by Regulations
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv).

 

(b)In the event of a Transfer of Partnership Units made in accordance with
this Agreement, the Capital Account of the Transferor that is attributable to
the transferred Partnership Units shall carry over to the Transferee Partner
in accordance with the provisions of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(l).

 

(c)This Section 3.6 and other provisions of this Agreement relating to the
maintenance of Capital Accounts are intended to comply with the Regulations
promulgated under Code Section 704(b), including Regulation Section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv), and shall be interpreted and applied in a manner consistent
with such Regulations. In determining the amount of any Liability for
purposes of calculating Capital Accounts, there shall be taken into account
Section 752(c) of the Code and any other applicable provisions of the Code and
Regulations. The Partners\' Capital Accounts will normally be adjusted on an
annual or other periodic basis as determined by the General Partner (with the
approval of the Original Limited Partner Representative), but the Capital
Accounts may be adjusted more often if a new Partner is admitted to the
Company or if circumstances otherwise make it advisable in the judgment of
the General Partner.

ARTICLE IV

 

DISTRIBUTIONS

 

Section 4.1 Distributions Generally. Subject to Section 4.5, the General
Partner may cause the Partnership to distribute all or any portion of
available cash generated by the Partnership to the Holders of Class A Common
Units in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests of Class A
Common Units on the Partnership Record Date with respect to such
distribution. To the extent that any distribution is made

21

 

payable with respect to any Partnership Units for a particular period,
distributions payable with respect to any Partnership Units that were not
outstanding during the entire period in respect of which any distribution is
made shall be prorated based on the portion of the period that
such Partnership Units were outstanding.

 

Section 4.2 Tax Distributions. Prior to making distributions pursuant to
Section 4.1, on or prior to each Tax Distribution Date, the Partnership shall
be required to, subject only to Section 4.5, make pro rata distributions of
cash to the Holders of Class A Common Units (in accordance with their
respective Percentage Interests of Class A Common Units) in an
amount sufficient to ensure that each such Holder receives a distribution at
least equal to such Holder\'s Assumed Tax Liability, if any, with respect to
the relevant taxable period to which the distribution relates. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, distributions pursuant to this Section 4.2, if any, shall be
made to a Partner only to the extent all previous distributions to such
Partner pursuant to Section 4.1 with respect to the taxable period are less
than the distributions such Partner otherwise would have been entitled to
receive with respect to such taxable period pursuant to this Section 4.2.

 

Section 4.3 Distributions in Kind. No Holder may demand to receive property
other than cash as provided in this Agreement. The General Partner may cause
the Partnership to make a distribution in kind of Partnership assets to the
Holders, and such assets shall be distributed in such a fashion as to ensure
that the fair market value is distributed and allocated in accordance with
Articles IV, V and IX.

Section 4.4 Distributions to Reflect Additional Partnership Units. In the
event that the Partnership issues additional Partnership Units pursuant to
the provisions of Article III, the General Partner is hereby authorized to
make such revisions to this Article IV and to Article V as it determines are
necessary or desirable to reflect the issuance of such additional Partnership
Units, including making preferential distributions to certain classes of
Partnership Units (with the approval of the Original Limited Partner
Representative).

 

Section 4.5 Restricted Distributions. Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither the Partnership nor the General
Partner, on behalf of the Partnership, shall make a distribution to any
Holder if such distribution would violate the Act or other applicable law.

 

Section 4.6 Use of Distributions. The Special Limited Partner shall use
distributions received from and other cash of the Partnership for payment of
taxes, liabilities or expenses of the Special Limited Partner, to loan funds
to the Partnership in the accordance with this Agreement, for the payment of
dividends to its shareholders or for other general corporate purposes, in
each case in accordance with a budget approved by, or otherwise approved by,
the Board; provided that the Special Limited Partner may not use such
distributions or other cash of the Partnership to acquire any Partnership
Interests, except as otherwise provided in Section 3.4 hereof.

 

ARTICLE V

 

ALLOCATIONS

 

Section 5.1 General Allocations. After giving effect to the allocations under
Section 5.2 and subject to Section 5.2 and Section 5.4, Net Income and Net
Loss (and, to the extent reasonably determined by the General Partner to be
necessary and appropriate to achieve the resulting Capital Account balances
described below, any allocable items of income, gain, loss, deduction or
credit includable in the computation of Net Income and Net Loss) for each
Fiscal Year or other taxable period shall be allocated among the Partners
during such Fiscal Year or other taxable period in a manner such that, after
giving effect to all distributions through the end of such Fiscal Year or
other taxable period, the Capital Account balance of each Partner, immediately
after making such allocation, is, as nearly as possible, equal to (a) the
amount such Partner would receive pursuant to Section 12.3 if all assets of
the Partnership on hand at the end of

 

22

 

such Fiscal Year or other taxable period were sold for cash equal to their
Gross Asset Values, all liabilities of the Partnership were satisfied in cash
in accordance with their terms (limited with respect to each nonrecourse
liability to the Gross Asset Value of the assets securing such liability),
and all remaining or resulting cash was distributed, in accordance with
Section 12.3 to the Partners immediately after making such allocation, minus
(b) such Partner\'s share of Partnership Minimum Gain and Partner Minimum
Gain, computed immediately prior to the hypothetical sale of assets, and the
amount any such Partner is treated as obligated to contribute to the
Partnership, computed immediately after the hypothetical sale of assets.

 

Section 5.2 Additional Allocation Provisions. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this Article V:

(a)Regulatory Allocations.

 

(i)Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise provided in Regulations
section 1.704-2(f), notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5.1, or any
other provision of this Article V, if there is a net decrease in Partnership
Minimum Gain during any Fiscal Year, each Holder shall be specially allocated
items of Partnership income and gain for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary,
subsequent Fiscal Years) in an amount equal to such Holder\'s share of the
net decrease in Partnership Minimum Gain, as determined under Regulations
section 1.704-2(g)(2). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be
made in proportion to the respective amounts required to be allocated to each
Holder pursuant thereto. The items to be allocated shall be determined in
accordance with Regulations sections 1.704-2(f)(6) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This
Section 5.2(a)(i) is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback
requirement in Regulations section 1.704-2(f) and shall be interpreted
consistently therewith.

 

(ii)Partner Nonrecourse Debt Minimum Gain Chargeback. Except as otherwise
provided in Regulations section 1.704-2(i)(4) or in Section 5.2(a)(i), if
there is a net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain attributable to a Partner
Nonrecourse Debt during any Fiscal Year, each Holder who has a share of
the Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse Debt
(determined in accordance with Regulations section 1.704-2(i)(5)) as of the
beginning of the Fiscal Year shall be specially allocated items of Partnership
income and gain for such Fiscal Year (and, if necessary, subsequent Fiscal
Years) in an amount equal to such Holder\'s respective share of the net
decrease in Partner Minimum Gain attributable to such Partner Nonrecourse
Debt. A Holder\'s share of the net decrease in Partner Minimum Gain shall be
determined in accordance with Regulations section 1.704-2(i)(4); provided that
a Holder shall not be subject to this provision to the extent that an
exception is provided by Regulations section 1.704-2(i)(4) and any IRS
revenue rulings, revenue procedures, or notices issued with respect thereto.
Allocations pursuant to this Section 5.2(a)(ii) shall be made in proportion to
the respective amounts required to be allocated to each Holder pursuant
thereto. The items to be so allocated shall be determined in accordance with
Regulations sections 1.704-2(i)(4) and 1.704-2(j)(2). This Section 5.2(a)(ii)
is intended to comply with the minimum gain chargeback requirement in
Regulations section 1.704-2(i) and shall be interpreted consistently
therewith.

 

(iii)Nonrecourse Deductions and Partner Nonrecourse Deductions. Any
Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be specially allocated to the
Holders in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests. Any Partner
Nonrecourse Deductions for any Fiscal Year shall be specially allocated to the
Holder(s) who bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the Partner
Nonrecourse Debt to which such Partner Nonrecourse Deductions are
attributable, in accordance with Regulations section 1.704-2(i).

 

(iv)Qualified Income Offset. If any Holder unexpectedly receives an
adjustment, allocation or distribution described in Regulations
section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), (5) or (6), items of Partnership income and
gain shall be allocated, in accordance with Regulations section 1.704-

 

23

 

1(b)(2)(ii)(d), to such Holder in an amount and manner sufficient to
eliminate, to the extent required by such Regulations, the Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit of such Holder as quickly as possible, provided that an
allocation pursuant to this Section 5.2(a)(iv) shall be made if and only to
the extent that such Holder would have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit
after all other allocations provided in this Article V have been tentatively
made as if this Section 5.2(a)(iv) were not in the Agreement. It is intended
that this Section 5.2(a)(iv) comply with the qualified income offset
requirement in Regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) and shall
be interpreted consistently therewith.

(v)Gross Income Allocation. In the event that any Holder has a deficit Capital
Account at the end of any Fiscal Year that is in excess of the sum of (1)
the amount (if any) that such Holder is obligated to restore to the
Partnership upon complete liquidation of such Holder\'s Partnership Interest
and (2) the amount that such Holder is deemed to be obligated to restore
pursuant to the penultimate sentences of Regulations sections 1.704-2 (g)(1)
and 1.704-2(i)(5), each such Holder shall be specially allocated items of
Partnership income and gain in the amount of such excess to eliminate such
deficit as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to this
Section 5.2(a)(v) shall be made if and only to the extent that such Holder
would have a deficit Capital Account in excess of such sum after all other
allocations provided in this Article V have been tentatively made as if
this Section 5.2(a)(v) and Section 5.2(a)(iv) were not in the Agreement.

 

(vi)Limitation on Allocation of Net Loss. To the extent that any allocation of
Net Loss (or items of loss) would cause or increase an Adjusted Capital
Account Deficit as to any Holder, such allocation of Net Loss (or items of
loss) shall be reallocated (x) first, among the other Holders of Class A
Common Units in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests, and (y)
thereafter, among the Holders of other Partnership Units, as determined by
the General Partner (with the approval of the Original Limited Partner
Representative), subject to the limitations of this Section 5.2(a)(vi).

(vii)Section 754 Adjustment. To the extent that an adjustment to the adjusted
tax basis of any Partnership asset pursuant to Code section 734(b) or Code
section 743(b) is required, pursuant to Regulations section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or Regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2) (iv)(m)(4), to be
taken into account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a
distribution to a Holder of Class A Common Units in complete liquidation of
its interest in the Partnership, the amount of such adjustment to the Capital
Accounts shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment increases the
basis of the asset) or loss (if the adjustment decreases such basis), and such
gain or loss shall be specially allocated to the Holders of Class A Common
Units in accordance with their respective Percentage Interests in the event
that Regulations section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) applies, or to the Holder(s)
to whom such distribution was made in the event that Regulations section
1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies.

 

(viii)Curative Allocations. The allocations set forth in Sections 5.2(a)(i),
(ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) (the "Regulatory Allocations") are
intended to comply with certain regulatory requirements, including the
requirements of Regulations sections 1.704-1(b) and 1.704-2. Notwithstanding
the provisions of Section 5.1, the Regulatory Allocations shall be taken into
account in allocating other items of income, gain, loss and deduction among
the Holders of Class A Common Units so that to the extent possible without
violating the requirements giving rise to the Regulatory Allocations, the net
amount of such allocations of other items and the Regulatory Allocations to
each Holder of a Class A Common Unit shall be equal to the net amount that
would have been allocated to each such Holder if the Regulatory Allocations
had not occurred.

 

(b)Allocation of Excess Nonrecourse Liabilities. For purposes of determining a
Holder\'s proportional share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of
the Partnership within the meaning of Regulations section 1.752-3(a)(3), each
Holder\'s respective interest in Partnership profits shall be equal to such
Holder\'s Percentage Interest with respect to Class A Common Units.

 

24

 

 

Section 5.3 Tax Allocations.

(a)In General. Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.3, for income
tax purposes under the Code and the Regulations each Partnership item of
income, gain, loss and deduction (collectively, "Tax Items") shall be
allocated among the Holders in the same manner as its correlative item of
"book" income, gain, loss or deduction is allocated pursuant to Sections 5.1
and 0.

(b)Section 704(c) Allocations. Notwithstanding Section 5.3(a), Tax Items with
respect to an Asset that is contributed to the Partnership with a Gross Asset
Value that varies from its basis in the hands of the contributing Partner
immediately preceding the date of contribution shall be allocated among the
Holders for income tax purposes pursuant to Regulations promulgated under Code
section 704(c) so as to take into account such variation. The
Partnership shall account for such variation under the traditional method as
described in Regulations section 1.704-3(b), or such other method determined
by the General Partner and permitted by Regulations (with the approval of the
Original Limited Partner Representative). In the event that the Gross Asset
Value of any partnership asset is adjusted pursuant to subsection (b) of the
definition of "Gross Asset Value" (provided in Section 1.1), subsequent
allocations of Tax Items with respect to such asset shall take account of the
variation, if any, between the adjusted basis of such asset and its Gross
Asset Value in the same manner as under Code section 704(c) and the applicable
Regulations and using the traditional method as described in Regulations
section 1.704-3(b) , or such other method determined by the General Partner
and permitted by Regulations (with the approval of the Original Limited
Partner Representative). If, as a result of an exercise of a noncompensatory
option to acquire an interest in the Partnership, a Capital Account
reallocation is required under Regulations Sections 1.704- 1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3),
the Partnership shall make corrective allocations pursuant to Regulations
Section 1.704- 1(b)(4)(x). If, pursuant to Section 5.2(i), the Managing
Member causes a Capital Account reallocation in accordance with principles
similar to those set forth in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(s)(3), the
Managing Member shall make corrective allocations in accordance with
principles similar to those set forth in Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(4)(x).

 

Section 5.4 Other Allocation Rules. With regard to the Special Limited
Partner\'s acquisition of the Class A Common Units (including the Earnout
Company Units) pursuant to the Business Combination Agreement, Net Income and
Net Loss shall be allocated to the Partners of the Partnership so as to take
into account the varying interests of the Partners in the Partnership using
an "interim closing of the books" method in a manner that complies with the
provisions of Section 706 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder. If
during any Fiscal Year there is any other change in any Partner\'s ownership
of Partnership Units in the Company, the General Partner shall consult in
good faith with the Original Limited Partner Representative) and the tax
advisors to the Partnership and allocate the Net Income or Net Loss to the
Partners of the Partnership so as to take into account the varying interests
of the Partners in the Partnership using an "interim closing of the books"
method in a manner that complies with the provisions of Section 706 of the
Code and the Regulations thereunder; provided however that such allocations
may instead be made in another manner that complies with the provisions of
Section 706 of the Code and the Regulations thereunder and that is selected by
the General Partner (with the prior written consent of the Original Limited
Partner Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

Section 5.5 Earnout Company Units. The Parties intend that, for U.S. federal
income tax purposes, no such Partner be treated as having taxable income or
gain as a result of the receipt of the Earnout Company Units or as a result of
holding the Earnout Company Units at the time the Earnout Company Units have
satisfied the earnout criteria set forth in the Business Combination Agreement
and, if and when the Earnout Company Units are forfeited for failing to have
satisfied the earnout criteria set forth in the Business Combination

Combination Agreement and the Partnership shall (x) make corresponding
adjustments to the initial Capital Accounts of the Partners as necessary or
appropriate

Management.

  
---|--- 

(a)The General Partner shall have full, exclusive and complete discretion to
manage and control the business and affairs of the Partnership, to make all
decisions affecting the business and affairs of the Partnership and to do or
cause to be done any and all acts, at the expense of the Partnership, as it
deems necessary or appropriate to accomplish the purposes and direct the
affairs of the Partnership. The General Partner shall have the exclusive
power and authority to bind the Partnership, except and to the extent that
such power is expressly delegated in writing to any other Person by the
General Partner, and such delegation shall not cause the General Partner to
cease to be a Partner or the General Partner of the Partnership. The General
Partner shall be an agent of the Partnership\'s business, and the actions of
the General Partner taken in such capacity and in accordance with this
Agreement shall bind the Partnership. The General Partner shall at all times
be a Partner of the Partnership. The General Partner shall constitute a
"general partner" under the Act. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, the Partnership, and the General Partner on behalf of the
Partnership, may enter into and perform any document without any vote or
consent of any other Person. No Limited Partner or Assignee (other than in its
separate capacity as the General Partner, any of its Affiliates or any member,
officer or employee of the General Partner, the Partnership or any of their
Affiliates, in their capacity as such) shall take part in the operations,
management or control (within the meaning of the Act) of the Partnership\'s
business, transact any business in the Partnership\'s name or have the power
to sign documents for or otherwise bind the Partnership. The transaction of
any such business by the General Partner, any of its Affiliates or any member,
officer or employee of the General Partner, the Partnership or any of their
Affiliates, in their capacity as such, shall not affect, impair or eliminate
the limitations on the liability of the Limited Partners or Assignees under
this Agreement. The General Partner may not withdraw or be removed from the
Partnership except as set forth in Section 10.2.

 

(b)The determination as to any of the following matters, made by or at the
direction of the General Partner consistent with the Act and this Agreement,
shall be final and conclusive and shall be binding upon the Partnership and
every Limited Partner: (i) the amount of assets at any time available for
distribution or the redemption of Class A Common Units; (ii) the amount and
timing of any distribution;

 

(iii)any  determination to Exchange Class A Common Units; (iv) the amount,
purpose, time of creation, increase or decrease, alteration or cancellation of
any reserves or charges and the propriety thereof (whether or not any
obligation or liability for which such reserves or charges shall have been
created shall have been paid or discharged); (v) the fair value, or any sale,
bid or asked price to be applied in determining the fair value, of any asset
owned or held by the Partnership; (vi) any matter relating to the
acquisition, holding and disposition of any assets by the Partnership; or
(vii) any other matter relating to the business and affairs of the Partnership
or required or permitted by applicable law, this Agreement or otherwise to
be determined by the General Partner.

(c)The General Partner may also, from time to time, appoint such officers and
establish such management and/or advisory boards or committees of the
Partnership as the General Partner deems necessary or advisable, each of
which shall have such powers, authority and responsibilities as are delegated
in writing by the General Partner from time to time, provided that in no event
shall the General Partner or the Board of the General Partner be absolved of
its fiduciary duties pursuant to Section 6.5(c) by virtue of any such
appointment. Each such officer and/or board or committee member shall serve
at the pleasure of the General Partner.

26

 

(d)Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement or required by any
non- waivable provision of the Act or other applicable law, no Partner other
than the General Partner shall (i) have any right to vote on or consent to any
other matter, act, decision or document involving the Partnership or its
business, or (ii) take part in the day-to-day management, or the operation or
control, of the business and affairs of the Partnership. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the General Partner may cause the Partnership,
without the consent or approval of any other Partner, to enter into any
of the following in one or a series of related transactions: (A) any merger,
(B) any acquisition, (C) any consolidation, (D) any sale, lease, division or
other transfer or conveyance of assets, (E) any recapitalization or
reorganization of outstanding securities, (F) any merger, sale, lease, spin-
off, exchange, transfer or other disposition of a subsidiary, division or
other business, (G) any issuance of debt or equity securities (subject to any
limitations expressly provided for herein) or (H) any incurrence of
indebtedness. Except to the extent expressly delegated in writing by the
General Partner, no Limited Partner or Person other than the General Partner
shall be an agent for the Partnership or have any right, power or authority
to transact any business in the name of the Partnership or to act for or on
behalf of or to bind the Partnership.

 

(e)Only the General Partner may commence a voluntary case on behalf of, or an
involuntary case against, the Partnership under a chapter of Title 11 U.S.C.
by the filing of a "petition" (as defined in 11 U.S.C. 101(42)) with the
United States Bankruptcy Court. Any such petition filed by any other Partner,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, shall be deemed an
unauthorized and bad faith filing and all parties to this Agreement shall use
their best efforts to cause such petition to be dismissed.

(f)It is anticipated that the General Partner\'s primary business activities
shall be focused on the operation of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries.
Subject to the foregoing, the Partners acknowledge and agree that, subject to
the terms of any other employment, consulting or similar arrangements or
engagement with the Partnership, the General Partner, or any Affiliate of
either of them:

(i)any Limited Partner and its Affiliates may engage or invest in any other
business, activity or opportunity of any nature, independently or with others;
(ii) neither the Partnership nor any Partner (in its capacity as such) shall
have any right to participate in any manner in such engagement or investment,
or the profits or income earned or derived therefrom; and (iii) the pursuit of
such activities by any such Partner shall not be deemed in violation of
breach of this Agreement or any obligation or duty owed by such Partner to the
Partnership or the other Partners.

 

(g)Subject to Section 6.1(h), the General Partner shall have the power,
without the consent of the Partners or the consent or approval of any Limited
Partner, to amend this Agreement as may be required to facilitate or implement
any of the following purposes:

 

(i)to add to the obligations of the General Partner or surrender any right or
power granted to the General Partner or any Affiliate of the General Partner
for the benefit of the Limited Partners;

(ii)to reflect the admission, substitution or withdrawal of Partners, the
Transfer of any Partnership Interest or the termination of the Partnership in
accordance with this Agreement, and to amend the Register in connection with
such admission, substitution, withdrawal or Transfer;

(iii)to reflect a change that is of an inconsequential nature or does not
adversely affect the Limited Partners in any material respect, or to cure any
ambiguity, correct or supplement any provision in this Agreement not
inconsistent with law or with other provisions, or make other changes with
respect to matters arising under this Agreement that will not be
inconsistent with law or with the provisions of this Agreement;

27

 

(iv)to satisfy any requirements, conditions or guidelines contained in any
order, directive, opinion, ruling or regulation of a federal or state agency
or contained in federal or state law;

(v)to modify either or both of the manner in which items of Net Income or Net
Loss are allocated pursuant to Article V or the manner in which Capital
Accounts are adjusted, computed, or maintained (but in each case only to the
extent set forth in the definition of "Capital Account" or Section 4.4 or as
contemplated by the Code or the Regulations);

 

(vi)to reflect the issuance of additional Partnership Interests in accordance

with Article III;

(vii)to set forth or amend the designations, preferences, conversion or other
rights, voting powers, restrictions, limitations as to distributions,
qualifications or terms or conditions of redemption of any additional
Partnership Units issued pursuant to Article III; and

 

(viii)to reflect any other modification to this Agreement as is reasonably
necessary for the business or operations of the Partnership or the Special
Limited Partner and which does not violate Section 6.1(h).

 

(h)Notwithstanding Article XIII, this Agreement shall not be amended, and no
action may be taken by the General Partner, without the consent of each
Partner adversely affected thereby (if any), if such amendment or action would
(i) convert a Limited Partner into a general partner of the Partnership
(except as a result of the Limited Partner becoming the General Partner
pursuant to Section

 

11.1of this Agreement), (ii) modify the limited liability of a Limited Partner
or increase the obligation of a Limited Partner to make a Capital Contribution
to the Partnership, (iii) adversely alter the rights of any Partner to
receive the distributions to which such Partner is entitled pursuant to
Article IV or Section 12.3(a)(iii), or alter the allocations specified in
Article V (except, in any case, as permitted pursuant to Sections 3.2, 4.4
and 6.1(g)), (iv) alter or modify in a manner that adversely affects any
Partner the Exchange rights, Cash Amount or Class A Shares Amount as set forth
in Section 14.1, or amend or modify any related definitions, (v) would convert
the Partnership into a corporation, or (vi) amend Section 6.3(b) or this
Section 6.1(h); provided, however, that, with respect to clauses (iii), (iv),
(v) and (vi), the consent of any individual Partner adversely affected shall
not be required for any amendment or action that affects all Partners holding
the same class or series of Partnership Units on a uniform or pro rata basis,
if approved by a Majority in Interest of the Partners of such class or series.
Further, no amendment may alter the restrictions on the General Partner\'s
authority set forth elsewhere in this Section 6.1 without the consent
specified therein. Any such amendment or action consented to by any
Partner shall be effective as to that Partner, notwithstanding the absence of
such consent by any other Partner.

Section 6.2 Compensation and Advances.

 

(a)The General Partner shall not receive any fees from the Partnership for its
services in administering the Partnership, except as otherwise provided herein
(including the provisions of Articles IV and V regarding distributions,
payments and allocations to which it may be entitled in its capacity as the
General Partner).

(b)From time to time until such time as the Special Limited Partner owns no
other Person or businesses (other than the General Partner, the Partnership
or any of their Subsidiaries), the Partnership shall be liable for, and shall
reimburse the Special Limited Partner, on a monthly basis, or such other basis
as the Special Limited Partner and the Original Limited
Partner Representative may determine, for sums to the extent expended by the
Special Limited Partner or the General Partner (and specifically

 

28

 

excluding sums paid directly by the Partnership or any of its subsidiaries)
in connection with the Partnership\'s business, including (i) expenses
relating to the ownership of interests in and management and operation of, or
for the benefit of, the Partnership, (ii) compensation of officers
and employees of the Special Limited Partner or the Partnership, (iii)
director fees and expenses, (iv) all costs and expenses of the Special Limited
Partner being a public company, including costs of filings with the SEC, tax
returns, reports and other distributions to its stockholders, and (v) other
costs and expenses incidental to their existence or related to the foregoing
matters; provided that for the avoidance of doubt in no event shall the
expenses payable pursuant to this Section 6.2(b) include any tax liability of
the Special Limited Partner or the General Partner. Such reimbursements shall
be in addition to any reimbursement of the General Partner as a result of
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.6.

(c)To the extent practicable, Partnership expenses shall be billed directly to
and paid by the Partnership and, if and to the extent any reimbursements to
the General Partner, the Special Limited Partner or any of their respective
Affiliates by the Partnership pursuant to this Section 6.2 constitute gross
income to such Person (as opposed to a repayment of advances made by such
Person on behalf of the Partnership), such amounts shall be treated as
"guaranteed payments" within the meaning of Code section 707(c) (unless
otherwise required by the Code and the Regulations) and shall not be treated
as distributions for purposes of computing the Limited Partners\' Capital
Accounts.

 

Section 6.3 Outside Activities.

(a)Neither the General Partner nor the Special Limited Partner shall directly
or indirectly enter into or conduct any business, other than in connection
with and to the extent permitted hereby, (i) the ownership, acquisition and
disposition of Partnership Interests, (ii) with respect to the General
Partner, the management of the business of the Partnership, (iii)
with respect to the Special Limited Partner, its operation as a reporting
company with a class (or classes) of securities registered under the Exchange
Act, (iv) with respect to the Special Limited Partner, the offering, sale,
syndication, private placement or public offering of stock, bonds, securities
or other interests, (v) financing or refinancing of any type related to the
Partnership or its assets or activities, and (vi) such activities as are
incidental thereto. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prohibit the
General Partner from executing guarantees of Partnership debt for which it
would otherwise be liable in its capacity as General Partner. The Special
Limited Partner may, subject to the limitations hereof (including Section 3.4
hereof) acquire Partnership Interests and shall be entitled to exercise all
rights of a Limited Partner relating to such Partnership Interests.

(b)Subject to any agreements entered into pursuant to Section 6.4 and any
other agreements entered into by a Limited Partner or any of its Affiliates
with the General Partner, the Partnership or a Subsidiary (including any
employment agreement), any Limited Partner and any Assignee, officer,
director, employee, agent, trustee, Affiliate, member or stockholder of any
Limited Partner shall be entitled to and may have business interests and
engage in business activities in addition to those relating to the
Partnership, including business interests and activities that are in direct or
indirect competition with the Partnership or that are enhanced by the
activities of the Partnership. Neither the Partnership nor any Partner shall
have any rights by virtue of this Agreement in any business ventures of any
Limited Partner or any Assignee, officer, director, employee, agent, trustee,
Affiliate, member or stockholder of any Limited Partner. Subject to such
agreements, none of the Limited Partners nor any other Person shall have any
rights by virtue of this Agreement or the partnership relationship
established hereby in any business ventures of any other Person (other than
the General Partner or the Special Limited Partner, to the extent expressly
provided herein), and such Person shall have no obligation pursuant to
this Agreement, subject to Section

6.4and any other agreements entered into by a Limited Partner or its
Affiliates with the General Partner, the Partnership or a Subsidiary, to
offer any interest in any such business ventures to the Partnership, any
Limited Partner, or any such other Person, even if such opportunity is of a
character that, if presented to the Partnership, any Limited Partner or such
other Person, could be taken by such Person.

29

 

 

Section 6.4 Transactions with Affiliates.

(a)The Partnership may lend or contribute funds or other assets to the Special
Limited Partner and its Subsidiaries or other Persons in which the Special
Limited Partner has an equity investment, and such Persons may borrow funds
from the Partnership, on terms and conditions no less favorable to the
Partnership in the aggregate than would be available from unaffiliated third
parties as determined by the General Partner and the Original Limited Partner
Representative. The foregoing authority shall not create any right or benefit
in favor of any Partner or any other Person. It is expressly acknowledged and
agreed by each Partner that, to the extent approved by the General Partner
and Original Limited Partner Representative, the Special Limited Partner may
(i) borrow funds from the Partnership in order to redeem, at any time or from
time to time, options or warrants previously or hereafter issued by the
Special Limited Partner, (ii) put to the Partnership, for cash, any rights,
options, warrants or convertible or exchangeable securities that the Special
Limited Partner may desire or be required to purchase or redeem, (iii) borrow
funds from the Partnership to acquire assets that will be contributed to the
Partnership for Partnership Units, or (iv) pay expenses of the Special Limited
Partner, including expenses referred to in Section 6.2(b).

(b)Except as provided in Section 6.3, the Partnership may transfer assets to
joint ventures, limited liability companies, partnerships, corporations,
business trusts or other business entities in which it is or thereby becomes a
participant upon such terms and subject to such conditions consistent with
this Agreement and applicable law.

 

(c)The General Partner, the Special Limited Partner and their respective
Affiliates may sell, transfer or convey any property to the Partnership,
directly or indirectly, on terms and conditions no less favorable to the
Partnership in the aggregate than would be available from unaffiliated third
parties as determined by the General Partner.

 

(d)The General Partner or the Special Limited Partner may propose and adopt on
behalf of the Partnership employee benefit plans funded by the Partnership for
the benefit of employees of the General Partner, the Partnership, the Special
Limited Partner, Subsidiaries of the Partnership or any Affiliate of any of
them in respect of services performed, directly or indirectly, for the benefit
of the General Partner, the Special Limited Partner, the Partnership or any
of the Partnership\'s Subsidiaries.

 

Section 6.5 Liability of Partners; Fiduciary and Other Duties;
Indemnification.

 

(a)Except as otherwise provided by the Act, the debts, expenses, obligations
and liabilities of the Partnership, whether arising in contact, tort or
otherwise, shall be solely the debts, expenses, obligations and liabilities
of the Partnership, and no Partner (including any General Partner) shall be
obligated personally for any such debt, expense, obligation, or liability of
the Partnership solely by reason of being a Partner. All Persons dealing with
the Partnership shall have recourse solely to the Partnership for the payment
of the debts, expenses, obligations or liabilities of the Partnership.

 

(b)To the greatest extent permitted under applicable law, no Partner,
including the General Partner and the Partnership Representative in such
Partner\'s capacity as such, and none of such Person\'s officers, directors,
partners, managers members, shareholders and employees, nor the members of the
Board nor the employees and officers of the Partnership (all such persons
being referred to as "Indemnitees") shall be liable, in damages or otherwise,
to the Partnership or to any Partner for any losses sustained or liabilities
incurred as a result of any act or omission of such Indemnitee.

(c)An Indemnitee acting under this Agreement shall not be liable to the
Partnership or to any other Indemnitee for such Person\'s good-faith reliance
on the provisions of this Agreement. The provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that they restrict or eliminate the duties and liabilities of such

30

 

 

Persons otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the Partners to
replace fully and completely such other duties and liabilities of
such Persons. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or
otherwise applicable provision of law or equity, whenever in this Agreement an
Indemnitee is permitted or required to make a decision or take an action (i)
in its "sole discretion" or "discretion" or under a similar grant of
authority or latitude, in making such decisions, such Person shall be entitled
to take into account its own interests as well as the interests of the
Partners as a whole or (ii) in its "good faith" or under another expressed
standard, such Person shall act under such express standard and shall not be
subject to any other or different standards, provided that the (A) General
Partner acknowledges that it will owe to the Special Limited Partner and
the Class A common stockholders of the Special Limited Partner the same
fiduciary duties as it would owe to the stockholders of a Delaware corporation
if it were a member of the board of directors of such a corporation and the
Special Limited Partner and the Class A common stockholders of the Special
Limited Partner were stockholders of such corporation, and (B) the parties
acknowledge that the General Partner will take action through the Board of the
General Partner and that the members of the Board of the General Partner will
owe comparable fiduciary duties to the Special Limited Partner and the Class A
common stockholders of the Special Limited Partner as described herein;
provided further that with respect to any approval or consent of the General
Partner or the members of the Board of the General Partner, such fiduciary
duties of the General Partner and the Board of the General Partner shall be
deemed irrefutably satisfied and discharged to the extent such matter was
approved or consented to in writing by the board of directors of the Special
Limited Partner (with it being understood and agreed that nothing in this
further proviso shall be deemed to absolve the members of the board of
directors of the Special Limited Partner (in their capacity as such) with
respect to such approval or consent). No Limited Partner, in its capacity as
Limited Partner, shall owe any duty (including fiduciary duty) to the
Partnership or any of its Partners (all such duties being hereby eliminated
to the greatest extent possible).

 

(d)The General Partner may consult with legal counsel, accountants and
financial or other advisors, and any act or omission suffered or taken by the
General Partner on behalf of the Partnership or in furtherance of the
interests of the Partnership in good faith in reliance upon and in accordance
with the advice of such counsel, accountants or financial or other advisors
will be full justification for any such act or omission, and the General
Partner will be fully protected in so acting or omitting to act so long as
such counsel or accountants or financial or other advisors were selected with
reasonable care.

 

Section 6.6 Indemnification.

(a)The Partnership shall indemnify and hold harmless each Indemnitee (and such
person\'s heirs, successors, assigns, executors or administrators) to the
full extent permitted by law from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, expenses (including reasonable attorney\'s fees and
other legal fees and expenses), judgments, fines, settlements and other
amounts of any nature whatsoever, known or unknown, liquid or illiquid
(collectively, "Liabilities") arising from any and any threatened, pending or
completed claims, demands, actions, suits or proceedings, civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, and whether formal or informal, including
appeals ("Actions"), in which such Indemnitee may be involved, or is
threatened to be involved, as a party or otherwise, by reason of any act
performed or omitted to be performed by such Indemnitee on behalf of the
Partnership or by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was serving as
an officer, director, partner, trustee, employee, representative or agent of
the Partnership if (i) the Indemnitee acted in good faith, within the scope of
such Indemnitee\'s authority, and in a manner it believed to be in, or not
contrary to, the best interests of the Partnership, (ii) the Action was not
initiated by the Indemnitee (other than an action to enforce such
Indemnitee\'s rights to indemnification or advance of expenses under this
Section 6.6), (iii) the Indemnitee has not been established by a final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction to be liable to the Partnership,
and (iv) such action or inaction did not constitute fraud or willful
misconduct by the Indemnitee.

31

 

(b)Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in defending any Action, subject to this
Section 6.6 shall be advanced by the Partnership prior to the final
disposition of such Action upon receipt by the Partnership of a written
commitment by or on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay such amount if it shall
be determined that such Indemnitee is not entitled to be indemnified as
authorized in this Section 6.6.

 

(c)Any indemnification obligations of the Partnership arising under this
Section 6.6 shall be satisfied out of any Partnership assets (including any
amounts otherwise currently or subsequently distributable to any Partner(s))
and not from any assets of the Partners.

 

(d)The provisions of this Section 6.6 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees
and shall not be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other
Person.

 

(e)The right to indemnification provided hereby shall not be exclusive of, and
shall not affect, any other rights to which an Indemnitee or any other Person
may be entitled under any agreement, pursuant to any vote of the Partners, as
a matter of law or otherwise, and shall continue as to an Indemnitee who has
ceased to serve in such capacity and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,
successors, assigns, executors and administrators of the Indemnitee unless
otherwise provided in a written agreement with such Indemnitee or in the
writing pursuant to which such Indemnitee is indemnified.

 

(f)To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Partnership may, but
shall not be obligated to, purchase and maintain insurance, on behalf of any
of the Indemnitees and such other Persons as the General Partner shall
determine, against any liability that may be asserted against or expenses that
may be incurred by such Person in connection with the Partnership\'s
activities, regardless of whether the Partnership would have the power to
indemnify such Person against such liability under the provisions of this
Agreement.

(g)An Indemnitee shall not be denied indemnification in whole or in part under
this Section 6.6 because the Indemnitee had an interest in the transaction
with respect to which the indemnification applies if the transaction was
otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement.

(h)The provisions of this Section 6.6 are for the benefit of the Indemnitees,
their heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators and shall not
be deemed to create any rights for the benefit of any other Persons. Any
amendment, modification or repeal of this Section 6.6 or any provision hereof
shall be prospective only and shall not in any way affect the limitations on
the Partnership\'s liability to any Indemnitee under this Section 6.6 as in
effect immediately prior to such amendment, modification or repeal with
respect to claims arising from or relating to matters occurring, in whole or
in part, prior to such amendment, modification or repeal, regardless of when
such claims may arise or be asserted.

 

(i)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
indemnification rights and obligations set forth in this Agreement shall not
apply to any breaches of fiduciary duties set forth in Section 6.5(c), to the
extent (and only to the extent) that it has been finally determined by a court
of competent jurisdiction that, respectively, a director of a Delaware
corporation would be prohibited by the laws of the State of Delaware from
being indemnified with respect to such matter or a Delaware corporation is
prohibited by the laws of the State of Delaware from indemnifying a member
of its board of directors with respect to such matter.

funds for professional services and other expenses reasonably incurred in
connection therewith.

 

(c)Without limiting the foregoing, the Partnership Representative shall give
prompt written notice to the Original Limited Partner Representative of the
commencement of any Audit of the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries (a
"Specified Audit"). The Partnership Representative shall (i) keep the Original
Limited Partner Representative reasonably informed of the material
developments and status of any such Specified Audit, (ii) permit the Original
Limited Partner Representative (or its designee) to participate (including
using separate counsel), in each case at the Original Limited Partners\' sole
cost and expense, in any such Specified Audit, and (iii) promptly notify the
Original Limited Partner Representative of receipt of a notice of a final
partnership adjustment (or equivalent under applicable Laws) or a
final decision of a court or IRS Appeals panel (or equivalent body under
applicable Laws) with respect to such Specified Audit. The Partnership
Representative or the Partnership shall promptly provide the Original Limited
Partner Representative with copies of all material correspondence between the
Partnership Representative or the Partnership (as applicable) and any
Governmental Entity in connection with such Specified Audit and shall give the
Original Limited Partner Representative a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on any material correspondence, submission (including settlement
or compromise offers) or filing in connection with any such Specified Audit.
Additionally, the Partnership Representative shall not (and the Partnership
shall not (and shall not authorize the Partnership Representative to)) settle,
compromise or abandon any Specified Audit in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to have a disproportionate (compared to the Special Limited Partner)
and material adverse effect on the Original Limited Partners without the
Original Limited Partner Representative\'s prior written consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). The
Partnership Representative shall obtain the prior written consent of the
Original Limited Partner Representative (which consent shall not be

34

 

 

unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) before (i) making an election
under Section 6226(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state
or local Law) (a "Push-Out Election") or (ii) taking any material action
under the BBA Rules that would reasonably be expected to have a
disproportionate (compared to the Special Limited Partner) and material
adverse effect on the Original Limited Partners, in the case of clauses

 

(i)and (ii).

(d)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, in
the event of any conflict between Section 9.1 of the Business Combination
Agreement and this Agreement, Section 9.1 of the Business Combination
Agreement shall control. The Partnership, the Partnership Representative, the
General Partner, and the Partners hereby acknowledge and agree to the
foregoing sentence and expressly agree to be bound by the terms of Section
9.1 of the Business Combination Agreement.

 

(e)This Section 9.3 shall be interpreted to apply to Partners and former
Partners and shall survive the Transfer of a Partner\'s Partnership Units and
the termination, dissolution, liquidation and winding up of the Partnership
and, for this purpose to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, the
Partnership shall be treated as continuing in existence.

Section 9.4 Withholding Tax Indemnification.

 

(a)If the Partnership or any other Person in which the Partnership holds an
interest is required by Law to withhold or to make tax payments on behalf of
or with respect to any Partner, or the Partnership is subjected to tax itself
(including any amounts withheld from amounts directly or indirectly payable to
the Partnership or to any other Person in which the Partnership holds an
interest) by reason of the status of any Partner as such or that is
specifically attributable to a Partner (including federal, state, local or
foreign withholding, personal property, unincorporated business or other
taxes, the amount of any taxes arising under the BBA Rules, the amount of any
taxes imposed under Code Section 1446(f), and any interest, penalties,
additions to tax, and expenses related to any such amounts) ("Tax Advances"),
the General Partner may cause the Partnership to withhold such amounts and
cause the Partnership to make such tax payments as so required, and each
Partner hereby authorizes the Partnership to do so. All Tax Advances made on
behalf of a Partner shall be repaid by reducing the amount of the current or
next succeeding distribution pursuant to Section 4.1 of this Agreement and, if
applicable, the proceeds of liquidation that would otherwise have been made
to such Partner under this Agreement. For all purposes of this Agreement, such
Partner shall be treated as having received the amount of the distribution, if
applicable, that is equal to the Tax Advance at the time of such Tax Advance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent that the aggregate amount of Tax
Advances for any period made on behalf of a Partner exceeds the actual
distributions that would have otherwise been made to such Partner pursuant to
Section 4.1 following such Tax Advances, then such Partner shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Partnership for the entire amount of such excess (which has
not offset distributions pursuant to this Section 9.4). For the avoidance of
doubt, any income taxes, penalties, additions to tax and interest payable by
the Partnership or any fiscally transparent entity in which the Partnership
owns an interest shall be treated as specifically attributable to the Partners
and shall be allocated among the Partners such that the burden of (or any
diminution in distributable proceeds resulting from) any such amounts is
borne by those Partners to whom such amounts are specifically attributable
(whether as a result of their status, actions, inactions or otherwise,
including pursuant to an allocation made under Section 9.3(c)), in each case
as reasonably determined by the Partnership Representative. For the avoidance
of doubt, any taxes, penalties, and interest payable under the BBA Rules by
the Partnership or any fiscally transparent entity in which the Partnership
owns an interest shall be treated as specifically attributable to the Partners
of the Partnership, and the Board shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to allocate the burden of (or any diminution in distributable proceeds
resulting from) any such taxes, penalties or interest to those Partners to
whom such amounts are specifically attributable (whether as a result of their
status, actions, inactions or otherwise), as determined by the Board.

35

 

(b)This Section 9.4 shall be interpreted to apply to Partners and former
Partners and shall survive the Transfer of a Partner\'s Partnership Units (and
shall not burden any such Transferred Partnership Units nor the transferee of
such Partnership Units) and the termination, dissolution, liquidation and
winding up of the Partnership and, for this purpose to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, the Partnership shall be treated as continuing
in existence.

PARTNER TRANSFERS AND WITHDRAWALS

   

Section 10.1

 |

Transfer.

  
---|--- 

(a)No part of the interest of a Partner shall be subject to the claims of any
creditor, to any spouse for alimony or support, or to legal process, and may
not be voluntarily or involuntarily alienated or encumbered except as may be
specifically provided for in this Agreement.

(b)No Partnership Interest shall be Transferred, in whole or in part, except
in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this Article X. Any
Transfer or purported Transfer of a Partnership Interest not made in
accordance with this Article X shall be null and void ab initio.

 

Section 10.2 Transfer of General Partner\'s Partnership Interest. Without
limiting the transfer of the General Partnership Interest from the Predecessor
General Partner to the General Partner as provided in the Recapitalization
Agreement, the General Partner may not (i) Transfer all or any portion of its
General Partnership Interest, (ii) voluntarily withdraw as the general partner
of the Partnership, or (iii) be removed from the Partnership, in each case,
without the consent of the Majority in Interest of the Partners and subject to
obtaining any applicable Gaming Authority licensing requirements and
approvals. In the event of the General Partner\'s removal, and subject
to obtaining any applicable Gaming Authority licensing requirements and
approvals, the Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners may appoint a new
general partner to be the General Partner hereunder. Any Transfer of the
General Partnership Interests held by the General Partner shall be contingent
upon the transferee being found suitable by the applicable Gaming Authority
(if so required). For as long as the Original Limited Partners have a
Percentage Interest equal to or greater than 25%, any action taken with the
approval of the Majority in Interest of the Partners shall also require the
prior written consent of the Original Limited Partner Representative.

 

Section 10.3 Limited Partners\' Rights to Transfer.

 

(a)General. Except as provided herein, no Limited Partner shall Transfer all
or any portion of such Partnership Interest to any transferee without
the consent of the General Partner. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
Limited Partner may, at any time, without the consent of the General Partner,
Transfer all or any portion of its Partnership Interest pursuant to a
Permitted Transfer, as long as in the case of a Permitted Transfer of Class A
Common Units, an equivalent number of Class V Shares are transferred to such
Permitted Transferee. In connection with any Transfer (including any Permitted
Transfer), the Partnership, each Limited Partner and each transferee of
Partnership Interests shall cooperate with any applicable Gaming Authority in
respect of any suitability investigation (if so required) and any Transfer of
Partnership Interests shall be contingent upon the transferee being found
suitable by any applicable Gaming Authority (if so required). Any Transfer by
a Limited Partner or an Assignee is subject to Section 10.4 and to
satisfaction of the following conditions:

(i)Qualified Transferee. Any Transfer of a Partnership Interest shall be made
only to a single Qualified Transferee; provided, however, that, for such
purposes, all Qualified Transferees that are Affiliates, or that comprise
investment accounts or funds managed by a single Qualified Transferee and its
Affiliates, shall be considered together to be a single Qualified Transferee.

 

36

 

(ii)Opinion of Counsel. The Transferor shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to the General Partner an opinion of legal counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the General Partner to the effect that the proposed Transfer may be effected
without registration under the Securities Act and will not otherwise violate
the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the regulations
promulgated thereunder or violate any state securities laws or regulations
applicable to the Partnership or the Partnership Interests Transferred;
provided, however, that the General Partner may waive this condition upon the
request of the Transferor. If the General Partner determines, based on the
advice of counsel, that such Transfer would create a material risk of
requiring the filing of a registration statement under the Securities Act or
otherwise violating any federal or state securities laws or regulations
applicable to the Partnership or the Partnership Units, the General Partner
may prohibit any Transfer otherwise permitted under this Section 10.3 by a
Limited Partner of Partnership Interests.

 

(iii)Exception for Permitted Transfers. The condition set forth in
Section 10.3(a)(ii) shall not apply in the case of a Permitted Transfer. It
is a condition to any Transfer otherwise permitted hereunder (whether or not
such Transfer is effected during or after the Restricted Period) that the
transferee assumes by operation of law or express agreement all of the
obligations of the transferor Limited Partner under this Agreement with
respect to such Transferred Partnership Interest, and no such Transfer (other
than pursuant to a statutory merger or consolidation wherein all obligations
and liabilities of the transferor Partner are assumed by a successor
corporation by operation of law) shall relieve the transferor Partner of its
obligations under this Agreement without the approval of the General Partner.
Any transferee, whether or not admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner,
shall take subject to the obligations of the transferor hereunder. Unless
admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner, no transferee, whether by a
voluntary Transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, shall have any rights
hereunder, other than the rights of an Assignee as provided in Section 10.5.

 

(b)Incapacity. If a Limited Partner is subject to Incapacity, the executor,
administrator, trustee, committee, guardian, conservator or receiver of
such Limited Partner\'s estate shall have all the rights of a Limited
Partner, but not more rights than those enjoyed by other Limited Partners, for
the purpose of settling or managing the estate, and such power as the
Incapacitated Limited Partner possessed to Transfer all or any part of its
interest in the Partnership. The Incapacity of a Limited Partner, in and of
itself, shall not dissolve or terminate the Partnership.

 

(c)Adverse Tax Consequences. No Transfer by a Limited Partner of its
Partnership Interests may be made to or by any Person if the General Partner
reasonably determines in good faith, (i) such Transfer would create a
material risk of the Partnership being classified as a "publicly traded
partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code or (ii) result in
the Partnership having more than 100 partners within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h) (determined taking into account the rules of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)); provided that, for such
purposes, the Partnership and the General Partner shall assume that each
Original Limited Partner and the Special Limited Partner is treated as a
single partner within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)
(determined taking into account the rules of Regulations Section
1.7704-1(h)(3)), unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 10.4 Substituted Limited Partners.

 

(a)No Limited Partner shall have the right to substitute a transferee other
than a Permitted Transferee as a Limited Partner in its place. A transferee of
the interest of a Limited Partner may be admitted as a Substituted Limited
Partner only with the consent of the General Partner, subject to and
contingent upon any suitability investigation (if so required) and the
Substituted Limited Partner being found suitable by any applicable Gaming
Authority (if so required); provided, however, that a Permitted Transferee
shall be admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner pursuant to a Permitted
Transfer without the

37

 

 

consent of the General Partner, subject to compliance with the last sentence
of this Section 10.4. The failure or refusal by the General Partner to permit
a transferee of any such interests to become a Substituted Limited Partner
shall not give rise to any cause of action against the Partnership or the
General Partner. Subject to the foregoing, an Assignee shall not be admitted
as a Substituted Limited Partner until and unless it furnishes to the General
Partner (i) evidence of acceptance, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the General Partner, of all the terms, conditions and
applicable obligations of this Agreement and the Investor Rights Agreement,
(ii) a counterpart signature page to this Agreement and the Investor
Rights Agreement executed by such Assignee, (iii) Consent by Spouse and (iv)
such other documents and instruments as the General Partner may reasonably
require to effect such Assignee\'s admission as a Substituted Limited Partner.
For as long as the Original Limited Partners have a Percentage Interest equal
to or greater than 25%, any action taken with the approval of the General
Partner shall also require the prior written consent of the Original Limited
Partner Representative.

 

(b)Concurrently with, and as evidence of, the admission of a Substituted
Limited Partner, the General Partner shall amend the Register and the books
and records of the Partnership to reflect the name, address and number of
Partnership Units of such Substituted Limited Partner and to eliminate or
adjust, if necessary, the name, address and number of Partnership Units of the
predecessor of such Substituted Limited Partner.

 

(c)A transferee who has been admitted as a Substituted Limited Partner in
accordance with this Article X shall have all the rights and powers and be
subject to all the restrictions and liabilities of a Limited Partner under
this Agreement.

 

Section 10.5 Assignees. If the General Partner\'s consent is required for the
admission of any transferee under Section 10.3 as a Substituted Limited
Partner, as described in Section 10.4, and the General Partner withholds such
consent, such transferee shall be considered an Assignee for purposes of this
Agreement, subject to and contingent upon any suitability investigation (if so
required) and the Assignee being found suitable by any applicable Gaming
Authority (if so required). An Assignee shall be entitled to all the rights of
an assignee of a limited partnership interest under the Act, including the
right to receive distributions from the Partnership and the share of
Net Income, Net Losses and other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
credit of the Partnership attributable to the Partnership Units assigned to
such transferee and the rights to Transfer the Partnership Units provided in
this Article X, but shall not be deemed to be a holder of Partnership Units
for any other purpose under this Agreement (other than as expressly provided
in Section 14.1 with respect to a Limited Partner (other than the Special
Limited Partner) that becomes an Exchanging Partner), and shall not be
entitled to effect a consent or vote with respect to such Partnership Units
on any matter presented to the Limited Partners for approval (such right to
consent or vote, to the extent provided in this Agreement or under the Act,
fully remaining with the transferor Limited Partner). In the event that any
such transferee desires to make a further assignment of any such Partnership
Units, such transferee shall be subject to all the provisions of this Article
X to the same extent and in the same manner as any Limited Partner desiring to
make an assignment of Partnership Units.

 

Section 10.6 General Provisions.

(a)No Limited Partner may withdraw from the Partnership other than: (i) as a
result of a permitted Transfer of all of such Limited Partner\'s Partnership
Interest in accordance with this Article X with respect to which the
transferee becomes a Substituted Limited Partner; (ii) pursuant to
a redemption (or acquisition by the Special Limited Partner) of all of its
Partnership Interest pursuant to an Exchange under Section 14.1; or (iii) as a
result of the acquisition by the Special Limited Partner of all of such
Limited Partner\'s Partnership Interest, whether or not pursuant to Section
14.1(b).

 

38

 

(b)Any Limited Partner who shall Transfer all of its Partnership Units in a
Transfer

(i)permitted pursuant to this Article X where such transferee was admitted as
a Substituted Limited Partner,

 

(ii)pursuant  to the exercise of its rights to effect a redemption of all of
its Partnership Units pursuant to a Redemption under Section 14.1 or (iii) to
the Special Limited Partner, whether or not pursuant to Article XIV, shall
cease to be a Limited Partner.

 

(c)If any Partnership Unit is Transferred in compliance with the provisions of
this Article X, or is redeemed by the Partnership, or acquired by the Special
Limited Partner pursuant to Section 14.1, on any day other than the first day
of a Fiscal Year, then Net Income, Net Losses, each item thereof and all
other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit attributable to such
Partnership Unit for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated to the transferor
Partner or the Exchanging Partner (as the case may be) and, in the case of a
Transfer or assignment other than an Exchange, to the transferee Partner, by
taking into account their varying interests during the Fiscal Year in
accordance with Code section 706(d), using the "interim closing of the books"
method or another permissible method or methods selected by the General
Partner. Solely for purposes of making such allocations, unless otherwise
determined by the General Partner, each of such items for the calendar month
in which a Transfer occurs shall be allocated to the transferee Partner and
none of such items for the calendar month in which a Transfer or an Exchange
occurs shall be allocated to the transferor Partner, or the Exchanging Partner
(as the case may be) if such Transfer occurs on or before the fifteenth
(15th) day of the month, otherwise such items shall be allocated to the
transferor. All distributions attributable to such Partnership Unit with
respect to which the Partnership Record Date is before the date of such
Transfer, assignment or Exchange shall be made to the transferor Partner or
the Exchanging Partner (as the case may be) and, in the case of a Transfer
other than a Redemption, all distributions thereafter attributable to such
Partnership Unit shall be made to the transferee Partner.

(d)In addition to any other restrictions on Transfer herein contained, in no
event may any Transfer or assignment of a Partnership Interest by any Partner
(including any Redemption, any acquisition of Partnership Units by the
Special Limited Partner or any other acquisition of Partnership Units by the
Partnership) be made (i) to any person or entity who lacks the legal right,
power or capacity to own a Partnership Interest; (ii) in violation of
applicable law (including Gaming Law); (iii) of any component portion of a
Partnership Interest, such as the Capital Account, or rights to distributions,
separate and apart from all other components of a Partnership Interest; (iv)
if the General Partner determines that such Transfer would create a material
risk that the Partnership would become, with respect to any employee benefit
plan subject to Title I of ERISA, a "party-in-interest" (as defined in ERISA
Section 3(14)) or a "disqualified person" (as defined in Code section
4975(c)); (v) if the General Partner determines, based on the advice of
counsel, that such Transfer would create a material risk that any portion of
the assets of the Partnership would constitute assets of any employee benefit
plan pursuant to Department of Labor Regulations section 2510.2-101; (vi) if
such Transfer requires the registration of such Partnership Interest pursuant
to any applicable federal or state securities laws; (vii) if the General
Partner determines that such Transfer creates a material risk that the
Partnership would become a reporting company under the Exchange Act; or (viii)
if such Transfer subjects the Partnership to regulation under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, the Investment Advisors Act of 1940 or ERISA,
each as amended.

(e)Transfers pursuant to this Article X may only be made on the first day of
a fiscal quarter of the Partnership, unless the General Partner otherwise
agrees.

(f)For the avoidance of doubt, except to the extent expressly incorporated
therein by reference, the provisions of this Article X shall not apply to an
Exchange pursuant to Article XIV.

(g)In the event any transfer is permitted pursuant to this Article X, the
transferring parties shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the General
Partner either that no

39

 

withholding is required in connection with such transfer under applicable
U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. law (including under Section 1445 or
1446 of the Code) or that any amounts required to be withheld in connection
with such transfer under applicable U.S. federal, state, local or non- U.S.
law (including under Section 1446 of the Code, other than by reason of Section
1446(f)(4)) have been so withheld.

 

ARTICLE XI

 

ADMISSION OF PARTNERS

 

Section 11.1 Admission of Successor General Partner. A successor to all or a
portion of the General Partner\'s Partnership Interest pursuant to Section
10.2 who the General Partner has designated to become a successor General
Partner shall, subject to obtaining any applicable Gaming Authority licensing
requirements and approvals, be admitted to the Partnership as the General
Partner, effective immediately upon the Transfer of such Partnership Interest
to it. Upon any such Transfer and the admission of any such transferee as a
successor General Partner in accordance with this Section 11.1, the
transferor General Partner shall be relieved of its obligations under this
Agreement and shall cease to be a general partner of the Partnership without
any separate consent of the Partners or any Partner. Any such successor shall
carry on the business of the Partnership without dissolution. In each case,
the admission shall be subject to the successor General Partner executing and
delivering to the Partnership an acceptance of all of the terms and conditions
of this Agreement and such other documents or instruments as may be required
to effect the admission. In the event that the General Partner withdraws
from the Partnership, or transfers its entire Partnership Interest, in
violation of this Agreement, or otherwise dissolves or terminates or ceases to
be the general partner of the Partnership, a Majority in Interest of the
Partners may elect to continue the Partnership by selecting a successor
General Partner.

Section 11.2 Partners; Admission of Additional Limited Partners.

 

(a)Subject to obtaining any applicable Gaming Authority licensing requirements
and approvals, a Person (other than a then-existing Partner) who makes a
Capital Contribution to the Partnership in exchange for Partnership Units and
in accordance with this Agreement shall be admitted to the Partnership as an
Additional Limited Partner only upon furnishing to the General Partner (i)
evidence of acceptance, in form and substance satisfactory to the General
Partner, of all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
power of attorney granted in Section 15.1, (ii) a counterpart signature page
to this Agreement executed by such Person, (iii) Consent by Spouse and (iv)
such other documents or instruments as may be required by the General Partner
in order to effect such Person\'s admission as an Additional Limited
Partner. Concurrently with, and as evidence of, the admission of an
Additional Limited Partner, the General Partner shall amend the Register and
the books and records of the Partnership to reflect the name, address, number
and type of Partnership Units of such Additional Limited Partner.

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 11.2, no Person
shall be admitted as an Additional Limited Partner without the consent of the
General Partner. The admission of any Person as an Additional Limited Partner
shall become effective on the date upon which the name of such Person is
recorded on the books and records of the Partnership, following the consent
of the General Partner to such admission and the satisfaction of all the
conditions set forth in Section 11.2(a).

 

(c)If any Additional Limited Partner is admitted to the Partnership on any day
other than the first day of a Fiscal Year, then Net Income, Net Losses, each
item thereof and all other items of income, gain, loss, deduction and credit
allocable among Holders for such Fiscal Year shall be allocated among such
Additional Limited Partner and all other Holders by taking into account their
varying interests during the Fiscal Year in accordance with Code section
706(d), using the "interim closing of the books" method or another permissible
method or methods selected by the General Partner. Solely for purposes of

 

40

 

making such allocations, each of such items for the calendar month in which
an admission of any Additional Limited Partner occurs shall be allocated among
all the Holders including such Additional Limited Partner, in accordance with
the principles described in Section 10.6(c). All distributions with respect to
which the Partnership Record Date is before the date of such admission shall
be made solely to Partners and Assignees other than the Additional Limited
Partner, and all distributions thereafter shall be made to all the Partners
and Assignees including such Additional Limited Partner.

 

Section 11.3 Limit on Number of Partners. Unless otherwise permitted by the
General Partner, no Person shall be admitted to the Partnership as an
Additional Limited Partner if the effect of such admission would be to either
(i) cause the Partnership to have a number of Partners (including as Partners
for this purpose those Persons indirectly owning an interest in the
Partnership through another partnership, a limited liability company, a
subchapter S corporation or a grantor trust) that would cause the Partnership
to become a reporting company under the Exchange Act or (ii) result in the
Partnership having more than 100 partners within the meaning of
Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h) (determined taking into account the
rules of Treasury Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)(3)); provided that, for such
purposes, the Partnership and the General Partner shall assume that each
Original Limited Partner and the Special Limited Partner is treated as a
single partner within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)
(determined taking into account the rules of Regulations Section
1.7704-1(h)(3)), unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

 

Section 11.4 Admission. A Person shall be admitted to the Partnership as a
limited partner of the Partnership or a general partner of the Partnership
only upon strict compliance, and not upon substantial compliance, with the
requirements set forth in this Agreement for admission to the Partnership as a
Limited Partner or a General Partner.

 

ARTICLE XII

 

DISSOLUTION, LIQUIDATION AND TERMINATION

 

Section 12.1 No Dissolution. The Partnership shall not be dissolved by the
admission of additional Partners in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. The Partnership may be dissolved, liquidated and terminated only
pursuant to the provisions of this Article XII, and the Partners hereby
irrevocably waive any and all other rights they may have to cause a
dissolution of the Partnership or a sale or partition of any or all of the
Partnership assets.

 

Section 12.2 Events Causing Dissolution. The Partnership shall be dissolved
and its affairs shall be wound up upon the occurrence of any of the following
events (each, a "Liquidating Event"):

 

(a)the sale of all or substantially all of the Partnership\'s assets;

(b)at any time there are no limited partners of the Partnership;

 

(c)an election to dissolve the Partnership made by the General Partner, with
the consent of the Majority in Interest of the Limited Partners; or

 

(d)the entry of a decree of judicial dissolution under Section 17-802 of the
Act. Section 12.3 Distribution upon Dissolution.

 

(a)Upon the dissolution of the Partnership pursuant to Section 12.2, the
General Partner (or, in the event that there is no remaining General Partner
or the General Partner has dissolved, become Bankrupt or ceased to operate,
any Person elected by a Majority in Interest of the Partners (the

 

41

 

General Partner or such other Person being referred to herein as the
"Liquidator")) shall be responsible for overseeing the winding up and
dissolution of the Partnership and shall take full account of
the Partnership\'s liabilities and property, and the Partnership property
shall be liquidated as promptly as is consistent with obtaining the fair value
thereof, and the proceeds therefrom (which may, to the extent determined by
the General Partner, include shares of stock in the Special Limited Partner)
shall be applied and distributed in the following order:

 

(i)First, to the satisfaction of all of the Partnership\'s debts and
liabilities to creditors including Partners who are creditors (other than with
respect to liabilities owed to Partners in satisfaction of liabilities for
distributions), whether by payment or the making of reasonable provision for
payment thereof;

 

(ii)Second, to the satisfaction of all of the Partnership\'s liabilities to
the Partners in satisfaction of liabilities for distributions, whether by
payment or the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof; and

(iii)The balance, if any, to the Holders in accordance with Section 4.1. The
General Partner shall not receive any additional compensation for any services
performed pursuant to this Article XII.

(b)Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 12.3(a) that require liquidation
of the assets of the Partnership, but subject to the order of priorities set
forth therein, if prior to or upon dissolution of the Partnership, the
Liquidator determines that an immediate sale of part or all of the
Partnership\'s assets would be impractical or would cause undue loss to the
Holders, the Liquidator may, in its sole and absolute discretion, defer for a
reasonable time the liquidation of any assets except those necessary to
satisfy liabilities of the Partnership (including to those Holders as
creditors) and/or distribute to the Holders, in lieu of cash, as tenants in
common and in accordance with the provisions of Section 12.3(a), undivided
interests in such Partnership assets as the Liquidator deems not suitable for
liquidation. Any such distributions in kind shall be made only if, in the
good faith judgment of the Liquidator, such distributions in kind are in the
best interest of the Holders, and shall be subject to such conditions relating
to the disposition and management of such properties as the Liquidator
deems reasonable and equitable and to any agreements governing the operation
of such properties at such time. The Liquidator shall determine the fair
market value of any property distributed in kind using such reasonable method
of valuation as it may adopt.

(c)No Partner shall be personally liable for a deficit Capital Account balance
of that Partner, it being expressly understood that the distribution of
liquidation proceeds shall be made solely from existing Partnership assets.
In the sole and absolute discretion of the General Partner or the Liquidator,
a pro rata portion of the distributions that would otherwise be made to the
Holders pursuant to this Article XII may be:

(i)distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the General Partner
and the Holders for the purpose of liquidating Partnership assets, collecting
amounts owed to the Partnership, and paying any contingent or unforeseen
liabilities or obligations of the Partnership or of the General Partner
arising out of or in connection with the Partnership and/or
Partnership activities. The assets of any such trust shall be distributed to
the Holders, from time to time, in the reasonable discretion of the General
Partner, in the same proportions and amounts as would otherwise have been
distributed to the Holders pursuant to this Agreement; or

(ii)withheld or escrowed to provide a reasonable reserve for Partnership
liabilities (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion of
any installment obligations owed

42

 

to the Partnership, provided that such withheld or escrowed amounts shall be
distributed to the Holders in the manner and order of priority set forth in
Section 12.3(a) as soon as practicable.

 

Section 12.4 Rights of Holders. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, (a) each Holder shall look solely to the assets of the Partnership
for the return of its Capital Contribution, (b) no Holder shall have the
right or power to demand or receive property other than cash from the

ARTICLE XIII

 

AMENDMENTS; MEETINGS

 

Section 13.1 Amendments. Except as otherwise required or permitted by this
Agreement (including Section 6.1), amendments, modifications and restatements
of this Agreement must be approved by the consent of the General Partner, the
Original Limited Partner Representative and the Majority in Interest of the
Limited Partners; provided that no modification, amendment or restatement of
any provision of this Agreement that materially and adversely affects the
rights or obligations hereunder of any Holder, in its capacity as such,
without similarly affecting the rights or obligations hereunder of all Holders
shall be effective against such Holder unless approved in writing by such
Holder; provided further that any amendment, modification or restatement of
Section 3.4 or Section 4.7 shall also require the consent of Original Limited
Partners holding a Percentage Interest equal to 67% of the Percentage
Interests held by all Original Limited Partners. Upon obtaining any such
consent, or any other consent required by this Agreement, and without further
action or execution by any other Person, including any Limited Partner, (i)
any amendment to this Agreement may be implemented and reflected in a writing
executed solely by the General Partner, and (ii) the Limited Partners shall be
deemed a party to and bound by such amendment of this Agreement. Within
thirty (30) days after the effectiveness of any amendment to this Agreement
that does not receive the consent of all Partners, the General Partner shall
deliver a copy of such amendment to all Partners that did not consent to
such amendment.

Section 13.2 Procedures for Meetings and Actions of the Partners.

 

(a)No meetings of the Limited Partners are required to be held. Meetings of
the Partners may be called only by the General Partner. The call of any
meeting by the General Partner shall state the nature of the business to be
transacted. Notice of any such meeting shall be given to all Partners entitled
to act at the meeting not less than ten (10) days nor more than ninety (90)
days prior to the date of such meeting. Partners may vote in person or by
proxy at such meeting, in each case, by telephone or video conference call.
Unless approval by a different number or proportion of the Partners is
required by this Agreement, the affirmative vote of a Majority in Interest of
the Partners shall be sufficient to approve any proposal at a meeting of the
Partners. Whenever the consent of any Partners is permitted or required under

 

43

 

this Agreement, such consent may be given at a meeting of Partners or in
accordance with the procedure prescribed in Section 13.2(b).

 

(b)Any action requiring the consent of any Partner or a group of Partners
pursuant to this Agreement, or that is required or permitted to be taken at a
meeting of the Partners may be taken without a meeting if a consent in
writing or by electronic transmission setting forth the action so taken or
consented to is given by Partners whose affirmative vote would be sufficient
to approve such action or provide such consent at a meeting of the Partners.
Such consent may be in one instrument or in several instruments, and shall
have the same force and effect as the affirmative vote of such Partners at a
meeting of the Partners. Such consent shall be filed with the General Partner.
An action so taken shall be deemed to have been taken at a meeting held on
the effective date so certified. For purposes of obtaining a consent in
writing or by electronic transmission, the General Partner may require a
response within a reasonable specified time, but not less than fifteen (15)
days of receipt of notice, and failure to respond in such time period shall
constitute a consent that is consistent with the General Partner\'s
recommendation with respect to the proposal; provided, however, that an action
shall become effective at such time as requisite consents are received even
if prior to such specified time.

(c)Each Partner entitled to act at a meeting of Partners may authorize any
Person or Persons to act for it by proxy on all matters in which a Partner is
entitled to participate, including waiving notice of any meeting, or voting or
participating at a meeting. Each proxy must be signed by the Partner or its
attorney-in-fact. No proxy shall be valid after the expiration of eleven (11)
months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided in the proxy (or there
is receipt of a proxy authorizing a later date). Every proxy shall be
revocable at the pleasure of the Partner executing it, such revocation to be
effective upon the Partnership\'s receipt of written notice of such
revocation from the Partner executing such proxy, unless such proxy states
that it is irrevocable and is coupled with an interest.

 

(d)The General Partner may set, in advance, a record date for the purpose of
determining the Partners (i) entitled to consent to any action, (ii) entitled
to receive notice of or vote at any meeting of the Partners or (iii) in order
to make a determination of Partners for any other proper purpose. Such date,
in any case, shall not be prior to the close of business on the day the record
date is fixed and shall be not more than ninety (90) days and, in the case of
a meeting of the Partners, not less than ten (10) days, before the date on
which the meeting is to be held. If no record date is fixed, the record date
for the determination of Partners entitled to notice of or to vote at a
meeting of the Partners shall be at the close of business on the day on which
the notice of the meeting is sent, and the record date for any other
determination of Partners shall be the effective date of such Partner action,
distribution or other event. When a determination of the Partners entitled to
vote at any meeting of the Partners has been made as provided in this section,
such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

 

(e)Each meeting of Partners shall be conducted by the General Partner or such
other Person as the General Partner may appoint pursuant to such rules for the
conduct of the meeting as the General Partner or such other Person deems
appropriate in its sole and absolute discretion. Without limitation, meetings
of Partners may be conducted in the same manner as meetings of the Special
Limited Partner\'s stockholders and may be held at the same time as, and as
part of, the meetings of the Special Limited Partner\'s stockholders.

ARTICLE XIV

EXCHANGE RIGHTS

Section 14.1 Exchange Rights of the Limited Partners

 

(a)Exchange Procedures.

 

44

 

(i)Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Section
14.1, after the expiration of the Restricted Period and subject to any
contractual limitation under the Investor Rights Agreement or otherwise agreed
to in writing by such Limited Partner, each Limited Partner (other than the
Special Limited Partner) shall be entitled to cause the Partnership to effect
an Exchange up to four (4) times per calendar year plus, if necessary, any
additional number of times as may be necessary to allow such Limited Partner
to participate in a transaction described in the following sentence, in each
case with respect to a number of Class A Common Units at least equal to or
exceeding the Minimum Exchange Amount, by delivering an Exchange Notice to
the Partnership, with a copy to the Special Limited Partner. An Exchange
Notice may specify that the Exchange is to be contingent (including as to
timing) upon the consummation of a purchase by another Person (whether in
a tender or exchange offer, an underwritten offering or otherwise) of the
Class A Shares into which the Class A Common Units are exchangeable, or
contingent (including as to timing) upon the closing of an announced merger,
consolidation or other transaction or event in which such Class A Shares
would be exchanged or converted or become exchangeable for or convertible into
cash or other securities or property. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, if, in connection with an Exchange in accordance
with this Section 14.1, a filing is required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976 ("HSR Act"), then the Exchange Date with
respect to all Exchanged Units which would be exchanged into an equal number
of Class A Shares resulting from such Exchange shall be delayed until the
earlier of (i) such time as the required filing under the HSR Act has been
made and the waiting period applicable to such Exchange under the HSR Act
shall have expired or been terminated or (ii) such filing is no longer
required, at which time such Exchange shall automatically occur without any
further action by the holders of any such Exchange Units. Each of the
Partners, including the Special Limited Partner, agree to promptly take all
actions required to make such filing under the HSR Act and the filing fee for
such filing shall be paid by the Partnership.

(ii)Within three (3) Business Days of the giving of an Exchange Notice, the
General Partner, on behalf of the Partnership, may elect to settle all or a
portion of the Exchange in cash in an amount equal to the Cash Exchange
Payment (in lieu of Class A Shares), exercisable by giving written notice of
such election to the Exchanging Partner within such three (3) Business Day
period (such notice, the "Cash Exchange Notice"). The Cash Exchange Notice
shall set forth the portion of the Class A Common Units subject to the
Exchange which will be exchanged for cash in lieu of Class A Shares. Any
portion of the Exchange not settled for a Cash Exchange Payment shall be
settled for a Stock Exchange Payment.

 

(iii)The Exchanging Partner may elect to retract its Exchange Notice by giving
written notice of such election to the General Partner no later than (1)
Business Day prior to the Exchange Date. The giving of any notice pursuant to
this Section 14.1 shall terminate all of the Exchanging Partner\'s, the
General Partner\'s and the Partnership\'s rights and obligations under this
Section 14.1 arising from such retracted Exchange Notice (but not, for the
avoidance of doubt, from any Exchange Notice not retracted or that may be
delivered in the future).

(iv)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 14.1, the Special
Limited Partner may, in its sole and absolute discretion, elect to effect on
the Exchange Date the Exchange of Exchanged Units for the Cash Exchange
Payment and/or the Stock Exchange Payment, as the case may be (and subject to
the terms of Section 14.1(a)(ii) and (iii)), through a direct exchange of such
Exchanged Units and with such consideration

45

 

between the Exchanging Partner and the Special Limited Partner (a "Direct
Exchange"). Upon such Direct Exchange pursuant to this Section 14.1(a)(iv),
the Special Limited Partner shall acquire the Exchanged Units and shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as the owner of such Units;
provided, that, any such election by the Special Limited Partner shall not
relieve the Partnership of its obligation arising with respect to such
applicable Exchange Notice. The Special Limited Partner may, at any time prior
to an Exchange Date, deliver written notice (an "Direct Exchange Election
Notice") to the Partnership and the Exchanging Partner setting forth its
election to exercise its right to consummate a Direct Exchange; provided that
such Election does not prejudice the ability of the parties to consummate an
Exchange or Direct Exchange on the Exchange Date. A Direct Exchange Election
Notice may be revoked by the Special Limited Partner at any time; provided
that any such revocation does not prejudice the ability of the parties to
consummate an Exchange or Direct Exchange on the Exchange Date. The right to
consummate a Direct Exchange in all events shall be exercisable for all the
Exchanged Units that would otherwise have been subject to an Exchange. Except
as otherwise provided in this Section 14.1(a)(iv), a Direct Exchange shall be
consummated pursuant to the same timeframe and in the same manner as the
relevant Exchange would have been consummated if the Special Limited Partner
had not delivered a Direct Exchange Notice.

 

(v)An Earnout Company Unit is not permitted to be treated as an Exchanged Unit
under this Agreement and in no event shall the Partnership or the Special
Limited Partner effect an Exchange (including a Direct Exchange) of such an
Earnout Company Unit unless and until such Earnout Company Unit has satisfied
the earnout criteria set forth in the Business Combination Agreement.

 

(b)Exchange Payment.

(i)The Exchange (including a Direct Exchange) shall be consummated on the

Exchange Date.

 

(ii)On the Exchange Date (to be effective immediately prior to the close of
business on the Exchange Date), in the case of an Exchange, (i) the Special
Limited Partner shall contribute to the Partnership for delivery to the
Exchanging Partner (x) the Stock Exchange Payment with respect to any
Exchanged Units not subject to a Cash Exchange Notice and (y) the Cash
Exchange Payment with respect to any Exchanged Units subject to a
Cash Exchange Notice, (ii) the Exchanging Partner shall transfer and
surrender the Exchanged Units to the Partnership (provided that the Exchanging
Partner shall surrender the Class V Shares to the Special Limited Partner),
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (iii) the Partnership shall
issue to the Special Limited Partner a number of Class A Common Units equal to
the number of Class A Common Units surrendered pursuant to clause (ii), (iv)
solely to the extent necessary in connection with an Exchange, the Special
Limited Partner shall undertake all actions, including an
issuance, reclassification, distribution, division or recapitalization, with
respect to the Class A Shares to maintain a one-to-one ratio between the
number of Class A Common Units owned by the Special Limited Partner, directly
or indirectly, and the number of outstanding Class A Shares, taking into
account the issuance in clause (iii), any Stock Exchange Payment, and any
other action taken in connection with this Section 14.1, which actions shall
be subject to the approval of the Original Limited Partner Representative (not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), (v) the Partnership
shall (x) cancel the redeemed Class A Common Units which were Exchanged Units
held by the Exchanging Partner and

 

(y)transfer to the Exchanging Partner the Cash Exchange Payment and/or the
Stock

46

 

Exchange Payment, as applicable, and (vi) the Special Limited Partner shall
cancel the surrendered Class V Shares.

(iii)On the Exchange Date (to be effective immediately prior to the close of
business on the Exchange Date), in the case of a Direct Exchange, (i) the
Special Limited Partner shall deliver to the Exchanging Partner (x) the Stock
Exchange Payment with respect to any Exchanged Units not subject to a Cash
Exchange Notice and (y) the Cash Exchange Payment with respect to
any Exchanged Units subject to a Cash Exchange Notice, (ii) the Exchanging
Partner shall transfer to the Special Limited Partner the Exchanged Units,
free and clear of all liens and encumbrances, (iii) solely to the extent
necessary in connection with a Direct Exchange, the Special Limited Partner
shall undertake all actions, including an issuance, reclassification,
distribution, division or recapitalization, with respect to the Class A Shares
to maintain a one-to-one ratio between the number of Class A Common Units
owned by the Special Limited Partner, directly or indirectly, and the number
of outstanding Class A Shares, any Stock Exchange Payment, and any other
action taken in connection with this Section 14.1, which actions shall be
subject to the approval of the Original Limited Partner Representative (not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), and (iv) the Special
Limited Partner shall cancel the surrendered shares of Class V Shares.

 

(iv)Upon the Exchange (including by way of a Direct Exchange) of all of a
Limited Partner\'s Class A Common Units, such Limited Partner shall cease to
be a Limited Partner of the Partnership.

(c)Splits, Distributions and Reclassifications. If there is any
reclassification, reorganization, recapitalization or other similar
transaction in which the Class A Shares are converted or changed into another
security, securities or other property, this Section 14.1 shall continue to
be applicable, mutatis mutandis, with respect to such security or
other property. This Section 14.1(c) is intended to preserve the intended
economic effect of Section 3.4 and this Section 14.1 and to put each Limited
Partner in the same economic position, to the greatest extent possible, with
respect to Exchanges (including Direct Exchanges) as if such reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or other similar transaction had not occurred
and shall be interpreted in a manner consistent with such intent.

(d)PubCo Covenants. The Special Limited Partner shall at all times keep
available, solely for the purpose of issuance upon an Exchange (or Direct
Exchange, as applicable), out of its authorized but unissued Class A Shares,
such number of Class A Shares that shall be issuable upon the Exchange (or
Direct Exchange, as applicable) of all outstanding Class A Common Units,
including the Earnout Company Units (other than those Class A Common Units,
including the Earnout Company Units, held by the Special Limited Partner);
provided that nothing contained in this Agreement shall be construed to
preclude the Special Limited Partner from satisfying its obligations with
respect to an Exchange (or Direct Exchange, as applicable) by delivery of a
Cash Exchange Payment or Class A Shares that are held in treasury of the
Special Limited Partner. The Special Limited Partner covenants that all Class
A Shares that shall be issued upon an Exchange (or Direct Exchange, as
applicable) shall, upon issuance thereof, be validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances. In addition, for
so long as the Class A Shares are listed on a stock exchange or automated or
electronic quotation system, the Special Limited Partner shall cause all Class
A Shares issued upon an Exchange (or Direct Exchange, as applicable) to be
listed on such stock exchange or automated or electronic quotation system at
the time of such issuance. For purposes of this Section 14.1(d), references
to the "Class A Shares" shall be deemed to include any Equity Securities
issued or issuable as a result of any reclassification,

47

 

combination, subdivision or similar transaction of the Class A Shares that
any Limited Partner would be entitled to receive pursuant to Section 14.1(c).

 

(e)Exchange Taxes. The issuance of Class A Shares upon an Exchange (or Direct
Exchange, as applicable) shall be made without charge to the Exchanging
Partner for any stamp or other similar tax in respect of such issuance;
provided, however, that if any such Class A Shares are to be issued in a name
other than that of the Exchanging Partner (subject to the restrictions in
Article X), then the Person or Persons in whose name the shares are to be
issued shall pay to the Special Limited Partner the amount of any additional
tax that may be payable in respect of any Transfer involved in such issuance
in excess of the amount otherwise due if such shares were issued in the name
of the Exchanging Partner or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Special Limited Partner that such additional tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

(f)Distribution Rights. No Exchange (or Direct Exchange) shall impair the
right of the Exchanging Partner to receive any distributions payable on the
Class A Common Units exchanged pursuant to such Exchange (or Direct Exchange,
as applicable) in respect of a Partnership Record Date that occurs prior to
the Exchange Date for such Exchange (or Direct Exchange, as applicable). No
Exchanging Partner, or a Person designated by an Exchanging Partner to
receive Class A Shares, shall be entitled to receive, with respect to such
record date, distributions or dividends both on Class A Common Units redeemed
by the Partnership from such Exchanging Partner and on Class A Shares
received by such Exchanging Partner, or other Person so designated, if
applicable, in such Exchange (or Direct Exchange, as applicable).

 

(g)Exchange Restrictions. The General Partner may impose additional
limitations and restrictions on Exchanges (including limiting Exchanges or
creating priority procedures for Exchanges) to the extent it reasonably
determines in good faith (with the approval of the Original Limited Partner
Representative), which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed) that such limitations and restrictions are necessary
to avoid the Partnership being classified as a "publicly traded partnership"
within the meaning of Section 7704 of the Code; provided that, for such
purposes, the Partnership and the General Partner shall assume that each
Original Limited Partner and the Special Limited Partner is treated as a
single partner within the meaning of Regulations Section 1.7704-1(h)
(determined taking into account the rules of Regulations Section
1.7704-1(h)(3)), unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

(h)Tax Matters.

 

(i)In connection with any Exchange (or Direct Exchange, as applicable), the
Exchanging Partner shall, to the extent it is legally entitled to deliver such
form, deliver to the Special Limited Partner or the Partnership, as
applicable, a certificate, dated as of the Exchange Date, in a form reasonably
acceptable to the Special Limited Partner or the Partnership, as applicable,
certifying as to such Exchanging Partner\'s taxpayer identification number
and that such Exchanging Partner is a not a foreign person for purposes of
Section 1445 and Section 1446(f) of the Code (which certificate may be an
Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 if then sufficient for such purposes under
applicable Law) (such certificate a "Non-Foreign Person Certificate"). If an
Exchanging Partner is unable to provide a Non-Foreign Person Certificate
in connection with an Exchange, then

(i)such Exchanging Partner shall provide a certificate substantially in the
form described in Proposed Regulations Section 1.1446(f)-2(c)(2)(ii)(B) or
(ii) the Partnership shall deliver a certificate substantially in in the form
described in Proposed Regulations Section 1.1446(f)-2(c)(2)(ii)(C), in each
case setting forth the liabilities of the Partnership allocated to the Class A
Common Units subject to the Exchange under Section 752 of the Code, and

48

 

the Special Limited Partner or the Partnership, as applicable, shall be
permitted to withhold on the amount realized by such Exchanging Partner in
respect of such Exchange as provided in Section 1446(f) of the Code and
Proposed Regulations thereunder and consistent with the certificate provided
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this sentence, as applicable.

(ii)For U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes, each
of the Exchanging Partner, the Partnership and the Special Limited Partner
agree to treat each Exchange (and Direct Exchange) as a taxable sale by the
Exchanging Partner of the Exchanging Partner\'s Class A Common Units (together
with an equal number of shares of Class V Common Stock, which shares shall
not be allocated any economic value) to the Special Limited Partner in
exchange for (A) the payment by the Special Limited Partner of the Stock
Exchange Payment, the Cash Exchange Payment, or other applicable consideration
to the Exchanging Partner and (B) corresponding payments under the Tax
Receivables Agreement. Within thirty (30) days following the Exchange Date,
the Special Limited Partner shall deliver a Section 743 notification to the
Partnership in accordance with Regulations Section 1.743-1(k)(2).

 

(i)Representations and Warranties. In connection with any Exchange or Direct
Exchange, as applicable, upon the acceptance of the Class A Shares or an
amount of cash equal to the Cash Exchange Payment, the Exchanging Partner
shall represent and warrant that the Exchanging Partner is the owner of the
number of Exchanged Units the Exchanging Partner is electing to Exchange and
that such Exchanged Units are not subject to any liens or restrictions on
transfer (other than restrictions imposed by this Agreement, the charter and
governing documents of the Special Limited Partner and applicable Law).

recognition of the fact that each of the Limited Partners and Assignees under
this Agreement will be relying upon the power of the General Partner to act as
contemplated by this Agreement in any filing and other action by it on behalf
of the Partnership, shall survive the Incapacity of any Person hereby giving
such power, and the Transfer or assignment of all or any portion of such

and instruments shall have been duly executed, filed and recorded to effect
such substitution.

   

Section 15.3

 |

Arbitration.

  
---|--- 

(a)Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, any dispute, controversy or
claim arising out of or in connection with this Agreement, or the
interpretation, breach, termination or validity thereof ("Dispute") shall be
finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") then in effect (the
"Rules"), except as modified herein and such arbitration shall be
administered by the AAA. The place of arbitration shall be Chicago, Illinois.

(b)There shall be one arbitrator who shall be agreed upon by the parties
within twenty

 

(20)days  of receipt by respondent of a copy of the demand for arbitration.
If any arbitrator is not appointed within the time limit provided herein, such
arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA in accordance with the listing,
striking and ranking procedure in the Rules, with each party being given a
limited number of strikes, except for cause. Any arbitrator appointed by the
AAA shall be a retired judge or a practicing attorney with

 

50

 

no less than fifteen years of experience with corporate and
limited partnership matters and an experienced arbitrator. In rendering an
award, the arbitrator shall be required to follow the laws of the state of
Delaware.

 

(c)The award shall be in writing and shall briefly state the findings of fact
and conclusions of law on which it is based. The arbitrator shall not be
permitted to award punitive, multiple or other non-compensatory damages. The
award shall be final and binding upon the parties and shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy between the parties regarding any claims, counterclaims,
issues or accounting presented to the arbitrator. Judgment upon the award may
be entered in any court having jurisdiction over any party or any of its
assets. Any costs or fees (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) incident
to enforcing the award shall be charged against the party resisting
such enforcement.

(d)All Disputes shall be resolved in a confidential manner. The arbitrator
shall agree to hold any information received during the arbitration in the
strictest of confidence and shall not disclose to any non-party the
existence, contents or results of the arbitration or any other information
about such arbitration. The parties to the arbitration shall not disclose any
information about the evidence adduced or the documents produced by the other
party in the arbitration proceedings or about the existence, contents or
results of the proceeding except as may be required by law, regulatory or
governmental authority or as may be necessary in an action in aid of
arbitration or for enforcement of an arbitral award. Before making any
disclosure permitted by the preceding sentence (other than private disclosure
to financial regulatory authorities), the party intending to make such
disclosure shall use reasonable efforts to give the other party reasonable
written notice of the intended disclosure and afford the other party a
reasonable opportunity to protect its interests.

 

(e)Barring extraordinary circumstances (as determined in the sole discretion
of the arbitrator), discovery shall be limited to pre-hearing disclosure of
documents that each side will present in support of its case, and non-
privileged documents essential to a matter of import in the proceeding for
which a party has demonstrated a substantial need. The parties agree that they
will produce to each other all such requested non-privileged documents,
except documents objected to and with respect to which a ruling has been or
shall be sought from the arbitrator. There will be no depositions.

 

(f)Any claim brought by a Partner must be brought in such Partner\'s
individual capacity and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported
class, collective or representative proceeding.

books of the Partnership shall be kept on such method of accounting for tax
and financial reporting purposes as may be determined by the General Partner.
The fiscal year of the Partnership (the "Fiscal Year") shall be the calendar
year, or, in the case of the first and last Fiscal Years of the Partnership,
the fraction thereof commencing on the date of this Agreement or ending on the
date on which the winding-up of the Partnership is completed, as the case may
be, unless otherwise determined by the General Partner and permitted under
the Code.

Section 15.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter hereof
and fully supersedes any and all prior or contemporaneous agreements or
understandings between the parties hereto pertaining to the subject matter
hereof, including the Original Agreement.

 

Section 15.6 Further Assurances. Each of the parties hereto does hereby
covenant and agree on behalf of itself, its successors, and its assigns,
without further consideration, to prepare, execute, acknowledge, file,
record, publish, and deliver such other instruments, documents and statements,
and to

51

 

take such other action as may be required by law or reasonably necessary to
effectively carry out the purposes of this Agreement.

 

Section 15.7 Notices. Any notice, consent, payment, demand, or communication
required or permitted to be given by any provision of this Agreement shall be

Partner, and that such Partnership information will not become publicly

confidential information, the improper use or disclosure of which could have
a material

52

 

adverse effect upon the Partnership and its Subsidiaries. Each Limited
Partner further acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership information
constitutes a valuable trade secret of the Partnership and agrees to maintain
any Partnership information provided to it in the strictest
confidence. Accordingly, without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(a)Notwithstanding Article VIII, the General Partner shall have the right to
keep confidential from the Limited Partners (and their respective agents and
attorneys) for such period of time as the General Partner deems reasonable,
any information: (i) that the General Partner believes to be in the nature of
trade secrets; or (ii) which the General Partner (or its Affiliates,
employees, officers, directors, members, partners or personnel) is required by
law or by agreement with a third party to keep confidential; provided, that
the General Partner shall make available to a Limited Partner, upon reasonable
request, information required by such Limited Partner to comply
with applicable laws, rules and regulations, as well as any requests from any
federal or state regulatory body having jurisdiction over such Limited
Partner. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding proviso, in no event shall
the General Partner be required to disclose to any Limited Partner the
identity of, or any account details relating to, any other Partner unless it
is required to do so by law applicable to it, as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

 

(b)Except as permitted by this Section 15.12 or as required by applicable law,
each party hereto agrees that the provisions of this Agreement, all of the
information and documents described in Article VIII, all understandings,
agreements and other arrangements between and among the parties (or any of
them), and all other non-public information received from, or otherwise
relating to, the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, any Limited Partners,
the General Partner and/or their respective Affiliates shall be confidential,
and shall not disclose or otherwise release to any other Person (other than
another party hereto) such matters, without the written consent of the General
Partner.

 

(c)The confidentiality obligations of the parties under this Section 15.12
shall not apply: (i) to the disclosure by a Limited Partner of information to
the other Limited Partners or such Limited Partner\'s Affiliates, partners,
officers, agents, board members, trustees, attorneys, auditors, employees,
prospective transferees permitted hereunder, financial advisors and other
professional advisors (provided, that such prospective transferees and other
Persons agree to hold confidential such information substantially in
accordance with this Section 15.12 or are otherwise bound by a duty of
confidentiality to such Limited Partner) solely on a need-to-know basis,
which Persons shall be bound by this Section 15.12 as if they were Limited
Partners, (ii) to information already known to the general public at the time
of disclosure or that became known prior to such disclosure through no act or
omission by any Limited Partner or any Person acting on behalf of any of the
foregoing, (iii) to information received from a source not bound by a duty of
confidentiality to the Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries, any Partner or
any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, (iv) to any party to the extent that
the disclosure by such party of information otherwise determined to be
confidential is required by applicable law (foreign or domestic) or legal
process (including pursuant to an arbitration proceeding), or by any federal,
state, local or foreign regulatory body with jurisdiction over such party, (v)
to disclosures made in connection with any lawsuit initiated to enforce any
rights granted under this Agreement, or (vi) to the disclosure of confidential
information to rating agencies to the extent such disclosure is required by
such rating agencies; provided, that prior to disclosing such
confidential information, a party shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, notify the General Partner thereof, which notice shall include
the basis upon which such party believes the information is required to be
disclosed. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary herein,
in no event shall this Section 15.12(c) permit any Limited Partner to disclose
the identity of, or any account details relating to, any other Partner
without the prior written consent of the General Partner (which may be given
or withheld in the General Partner\'s sole discretion) unless the Limited
Partner delivers to the General Partner a written opinion of counsel to
the Limited Partner (which opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable
to the General Partner) to the effect that such disclosure is required under
applicable law.

 

53

 

(d)To the extent that a Limited Partner is subject to the United States
Freedom of Information Act or any similar public disclosure or public records
act statutes: (i) such Limited Partner acknowledges the General Partner\'s and
the Partnership\'s position that the information intended to be protected by
the provisions of Sections 15.12(a) and 15.12(b) constitutes or includes
sensitive financial data, proprietary data, commercial and financial
information and/or trade secrets that are being provided to and/or entered
into with the Limited Partner with the specific understanding that such
documents and information will remain confidential; (ii) the General Partner
advises each such Limited Partner that the documents and information intended
to be protected by the provisions of Sections 15.12(a) and 15.12(b) would not
be supplied to such Limited Partner without an understanding that such
documents and information will be held and treated by such Limited Partner
as confidential information; and (iii) to the extent that such Limited
Partner is nevertheless required to disclose any such confidential
information, (A) such Limited Partner shall, unless legally prohibited, give
the General Partner prior notice of any such required disclosure and (B) such
Limited Partner shall in any event maintain the confidentiality of the
Partnership\'s information (including this Agreement) to at least the same
extent as, and in a manner no less favorable to the Partnership and the
General Partner than the manner in which, it maintains the confidentiality of
comparable information in respect of any other private investment vehicles in
which such Limited Partner invests (whether such vehicles are focused
on private investments, public investments or otherwise). Notwithstanding the
foregoing or anything to the contrary herein, in no event shall this Section
15.12(d) permit any Limited Partner to disclose the identity of, or any
account details relating to, any other Partner, without the prior written
consent of the General Partner (which may be given or withheld in the General
Partner\'s sole discretion) unless the Limited Partner delivers to the
General Partner a written opinion of counsel to the Limited Partner (which
opinion and counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to the General Partner) to
the effect that such disclosure is required under applicable law.

(e)The Partnership and the General Partner shall be entitled to enforce the
obligations of each Limited Partner under this Section 15.12 to maintain the
confidentiality of the information described herein. The remedies provided for
in this Section 15.12 are in addition to and not in limitation of any other
right or remedy of the Partnership or the General Partner provided by law or
equity, this Agreement or any other agreement entered into by or among one or
more of the Limited Partners and/or the Partnership. Each Limited Partner
expressly acknowledges that the remedy at law for damages resulting from a
breach of this Section 15.12 may be inadequate and that the Partnership and
the General Partner shall be entitled to institute an action for specific
performance of a Limited Partner\'s obligations hereunder. The General
Partner shall be entitled to consider the different circumstances of different
Limited Partners with respect to the restrictions and obligations imposed on
Limited Partners hereunder to the full extent permitted by law, and, to the
full extent permitted by law, the General Partner may, in its good faith
discretion, waive or modify such restrictions and obligations with respect to
a Limited Partner without waiving or modifying such restrictions and
obligations for other Limited Partners.

(f)In addition, to the full extent permitted by law, each Limited Partner
agrees to indemnify the Partnership and each Indemnitee against any claim,
demand, controversy, dispute, cost, loss, damage, expense (including
attorneys\' fees), judgment and/or liability incurred by or imposed upon the
Partnership or any such Indemnitee in connection with any action, suit or
proceeding (including any proceeding before any administrative or legislative
body or agency), to which the Partnership or any such Indemnitee may be made a
party or otherwise involved or with which the Partnership or any such
Indemnitee shall be threatened, by reason of the Limited Partner\'s
obligations (or breach thereof) set forth in this Section 15.12.

 

(g)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement (including this
Section 15.12), the Special Limited Partner may disclose any Confidential
Information otherwise subject to the confidentiality obligations of this
Section 15.12 to any federal, state, local or foreign regulatory or self-
regulatory body or any securities exchange or listing authority to the extent
required or requested by such

54

 

 

body, exchange or authority, or as necessary and appropriate in connection
with filings, or as otherwise legally required.

 

Section 15.13 Consent to Use of Name. Each Partner hereby consents to the use
and inclusion of its name in the Partnership\'s books and records hereto.

 

Section 15.14 Consent by Spouse. Each Limited Partner who is a natural person
and is married (and not formally separated with an agreed-upon division of
assets) and is subject to the community property laws of any state shall
deliver a duly executed Consent by Spouse, in the form prescribed in Exhibit C
attached hereto, and at the time of execution of this Agreement. Each such
Limited Partner shall also have such Consent by Spouse executed by any spouse
married to him or her at any time subsequent thereto while such natural person
is a Limited Partner. Each Limited Partner agrees and acknowledges that
compliance with the requirements of this Section 15.14 by each other Limited
Partner constitutes an essential part of the consideration for his or her
execution of this Agreement.

Section 15.15 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
multiple counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original copy
and all of which shall constitute one agreement, binding on all parties
hereto.

Section 15.16 Survival. The provision of Section 6.5, 6.6, 15.1, 15.2, 15.3,
15.5, 15.6, 15.7, 15.8, 15.12, 15.13 and 15.14 (and this Section 15.16) (and
any other provisions herein necessary for the effectiveness of the foregoing
sections) shall survive the termination of the Partnership and/or
the termination of this Agreement.

Section 15.17 Anti-Money Laundering Representations and Undertakings. Each
Partner acknowledges that it has read the representations and undertakings
contained on Exhibit D attached hereto and hereby confirms they are true and
correct.

 

Section 15.18 Third Party Beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, dMY Sponsor, LLC is an express third party
beneficiary of Section 6.1(c), Section 6.5(c) and Section 6.6(h) of this
Agreement and may directly enforce (including by an action for specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief) each of
the provisions set forth in Section 6.1(c), Section 6.5(c) and Section 6.6(h)
of this Agreement as though directly party hereto.

Schedule shall become final as provided in Section 2.3(a) and may be amended
as provided in Section 2.3(b) (subject to the procedures set forth in Section
2.3(b)).

Section 2.2 Tax Benefit Schedule.

(a)Tax Benefit Schedule. Within one hundred and twenty (120) calendar days
after the due date (including extensions) of IRS Form 1120 (or any successor
form) of the Corporate Taxpayer for any Taxable Year, the Corporate Taxpayer
shall provide to each TRA Party a schedule showing, in reasonable detail, the
calculation of the Tax Benefit Payment (and any Realized Tax Benefit) or the
lack of a Tax Benefit Payment (and any Realized Tax Detriment), as applicable,
Attributable to such TRA Party for such Taxable Year (a "Tax Benefit
Schedule"). Each Tax Benefit Schedule shall become final as provided in
Section 2.3(a) and may be amended as provided in Section 2.3(b) (subject to
the procedures set forth in Section 2.3(b)).

(b)Applicable Principles. Subject to Section 3.3, the Realized Tax Benefit (or
the Realized Tax Detriment) for each Taxable Year is intended to measure the
decrease (or increase) in the actual liability for Covered Taxes of the
Corporate Taxpayer and its Covered Subsidiaries for such Taxable Year
attributable to the Tax Attributes, determined using a "with and without"
methodology. Carryovers or carrybacks of any Tax item attributable to any of
the Tax Attributes shall be considered to be subject to the rules of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations or the appropriate provisions of United States
state and local and foreign income and franchise Tax law, as applicable,
governing the use, limitation and expiration of carryovers or carrybacks of
the relevant type. If a carryover or carryback of any Tax item includes a
portion that is attributable to any Tax Attribute ("TRA Portion") and another
portion that is not ("Non-TRA Portion"), such portions shall be considered to
be used in accordance with the "with and without" methodology so that the
amount of any Non-TRA Portion is deemed utilized, to the extent available,
prior to the amount of any TRA Portion, to the extent available (with the TRA
Portion being applied on a proportionate basis consistent with the provisions
of Section 3.3). The parties agree that (A) (i) the payments made pursuant to
this TRA Agreement in respect of the Purchase and Post-Closing Purchase (to
the extent permitted by applicable law and other than amounts accounted for as
Imputed Interest) are intended to be treated and shall be reported for all
purposes, including Tax purposes, as additional contingent consideration to
the applicable TRA Parties for the sale of Partnership Units at and after the
Closing that has the effect of creating additional Purchase Basis Adjustments
and (ii) the payments made pursuant to this TRA Agreement in respect of an
Exchange are intended to be treated and shall be reported for all purposes,
including Tax purposes, as additional contingent consideration to the
applicable Exchanging Partner for such Exchange that has the effect of
creating additional Exchange Basis Adjustments, in each case, to the Reference
Assets in the Taxable Year of payment, (B) such additional Purchase Basis
Adjustments and Exchange Basis Adjustments shall be incorporated into the
calculation for the Taxable Year of the applicable payment and into the
calculations for subsequent Taxable Years, as appropriate and (C) the Actual
Tax Liability shall take into account the deduction of the portion of the Tax
Benefit Payment that must be accounted for as Imputed Interest under
applicable law; provided, however, that such liability for Covered Taxes and
such taxable income shall be included in the Hypothetical Tax Liability and
the Actual Tax Liability subject to the adjustments and assumptions set forth
in the definitions thereof and, to the extent any such amount is taken into
account on an Amended Schedule, such amount shall adjust a Tax Benefit
Payment, as applicable, in accordance with Section 2.3(b).

 

Section 2.3 Procedures, Amendments.

 

12

 

(a)Procedure. Every time the Corporate Taxpayer delivers to a TRA Party
an applicable Schedule under this TRA Agreement, including any Amended
Schedule delivered pursuant to Section 2.3(b), and any Early Termination
Schedule or amended Early Termination Schedule, the Corporate Taxpayer shall
also (x) deliver to such TRA Party supporting schedules and work papers, as
determined by the Corporate Taxpayer or as reasonably requested by such TRA
Party, providing reasonable detail regarding data and calculations that were
relevant for purposes of preparing the Schedule, (y) indicate which Advisory
Firm prepared the Schedule and will cause such Advisory Firm to prepare an
Advisory Firm Letter with respect to such Schedule, and (z) allow the TRA
Party Representative and its advisors reasonable access to the appropriate
representatives at the Corporate Taxpayer and (at the cost and expense of
OpCo) at the Advisory Firm that prepared the applicable Schedule in connection
with a review of such Schedule. Without limiting the generality of the
preceding sentence, the Corporate Taxpayer shall ensure that any Tax Benefit
Schedule or Early Termination Schedule that is delivered to a TRA Party, along
with any supporting schedules and work papers, provides a reasonably detailed
presentation of the calculation of the Actual Tax Liability (the "with"
calculation) and the Hypothetical Tax Liability (the "without" calculation)
and identifies any material assumptions or operating procedures or principles
that were used for purposes of such calculations. An applicable Schedule or
amendment thereto shall become final and binding on all parties thirty (30)
calendar days from the date on which all relevant TRA Parties have received
the applicable Schedule or amendment thereto under Section 7.1 unless the TRA
Party Representative (i) prior to such date, gives the Corporate Taxpayer
written notice of a material objection to such Schedule or amendment thereto
made in good faith ("Objection Notice"), or (ii) provides a written waiver of
its right to give an Objection Notice within the period described in clause
(i) above, in which case such Schedule or amendment thereto becomes binding
on the date such waiver is given by the TRA Party Representative. If the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative, for any reason, are
unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in any Objection Notice
within thirty (30) calendar days after the TRA Party Representative gives the
Corporate Taxpayer such Objection Notice, the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA
Party Representative shall employ the reconciliation procedures described in
Section

 

7.9(the "Reconciliation Procedures"), in which case such Schedule or Amended
Schedule shall become binding in accordance with Section 7.9.

 

(b)Amended Schedule. The applicable Schedule for any Taxable Year may be
amended from time to time by the Corporate Taxpayer (i) in connection with
a Determination affecting such Schedule, (ii) to correct material
inaccuracies in the Schedule, including those identified as a result of the
receipt of additional factual information relating to a Taxable Year after the
date the Schedule was provided to a TRA Party, (iii) to comply with an
Expert\'s determination under the Reconciliation Procedures, (iv) to reflect a
change in the Realized Tax Benefit or the Realized Tax Detriment for such
Taxable Year attributable to a carryback or carryforward of a loss or other
Tax item to such Taxable Year, (v) to reflect a change in the Realized Tax
Benefit or the Realized Tax Detriment for such Taxable Year attributable to an
amended Tax Return filed for such Taxable Year or (vi) to adjust
an applicable TRA Party\'s Basis Schedule to take into account payments made
pursuant to this TRA Agreement (any such Schedule, an "Amended
Schedule"). The Corporate Taxpayer shall provide an Amended Schedule to each
TRA Party when the Corporate Taxpayer delivers the Basis Schedule for the
following Taxable Year. In the event a Schedule is amended after such Schedule
becomes final pursuant to Section 2.3(a) or, if applicable, Section 7.9, (A)
the Amended Schedule shall not be taken into account in calculating any Tax
Benefit Payment in the Taxable Year to which the amendment relates but instead
shall be taken

 

13

 

into account in calculating the Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit for the
Taxable Year in which the amendment actually occurs, and (B) as a result of
the foregoing, any increase of the Net Tax Benefit attributable to an Amended
Schedule shall not accrue the Interest Amount (or any other interest
hereunder) until after the due date (without extensions) for filing IRS Form
1120 (or any successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer with respect to Covered
Taxes for the Taxable Year in which the amendment actually occurs.

 

Section 2.4 Section 754 Election. The Corporate Taxpayer shall ensure that,
for the Taxable Year that includes the date hereof and for each Taxable Year
in which an Exchange occurs and with respect to which the Corporate Taxpayer
has obligations under this TRA Agreement, OpCo and each of its direct and
indirect Subsidiaries that is treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income
Tax purposes will have in effect an election under Section 754 of the Code
(and under any similar provisions of applicable U.S. state or local law) for
each such Taxable Year.

 

ARTICLE III

 

TAX BENEFIT PAYMENTS

 

Section 3.1 Payments.

 

(a)Payments. Within five (5) Business Days after a Tax Benefit Schedule
delivered to a TRA Party becomes final in accordance with Section 2.3(a) or,
if applicable, Section 7.9, the Corporate Taxpayer (or the Corporate Taxpayer
on behalf of the Covered Subsidiary) shall pay such TRA Party for such Taxable
Year the Tax Benefit Payment determined pursuant to Section 3.1(b) that is
Attributable to such TRA Party. Each such Tax Benefit Payment shall be made
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the bank account previously
designated by such TRA Party to the Corporate Taxpayer or as otherwise agreed
by the Corporate Taxpayer and such TRA Party. The payments provided for
pursuant to the above sentence shall be computed separately for each TRA
Party. Without limiting the Corporate Taxpayer\'s ability to make offsets
against Tax Benefit Payments to the extent permitted by Section 3.5, no TRA
Party shall be required under any circumstances to make a payment or return a
payment to the Corporate Taxpayer in respect of any portion of any Tax Benefit
Payment previously paid by the Corporate Taxpayer to such TRA Party
(including any portion of any Early Termination Payment).

(b)For purposes of this TRA Agreement:

 

(i)A "Tax Benefit Payment" in respect of a TRA Party for a Taxable Year means
an amount, not less than zero, equal to the sum of (i) Net Tax Benefit that
is Attributable to such TRA Party and (ii) the Interest Amount with respect
thereto.

 

(ii)Subject to Section 3.3, the "Net Tax Benefit" for a Taxable Year shall be
an amount equal to the excess, if any, of eighty-five percent (85%) of the
Cumulative Net Realized Tax Benefit as of the end of such Taxable Year, over
the total amount of payments previously made under the first sentence of
Section 3.1(a) (excluding payments attributable to Interest Amounts);
provided, that if there is no such excess (or if a deficit exists), no TRA
Party shall be required to make a payment (or return a payment) to the
Corporate Taxpayer in respect of any portion

14

 

of any Tax Benefit Payment previously paid by the Corporate Taxpayer to such
TRA Party.

(iii)The "Interest Amount" shall equal the interest on the Net Tax Benefit
calculated at the Agreed Rate from the due date (without extensions)
for filing IRS Form 1120 (or any successor form) of the Corporate Taxpayer
with respect to Covered Taxes for the applicable Taxable Year until the
payment date under Section 3.1(a); provided that such interest shall not
accrue on the amount of any Net Tax Benefit after the date on which such
amount is actually paid to the applicable TRA Party, regardless of whether
such payment is made prior to the due date for such payment under Section
3.1(a) and regardless of whether the amount of any unpaid Net Tax Benefit has
yet become final in accordance with Section 2.3(a) or, if applicable, Section
7.9.

Section 3.2 No Duplicative Payments. It is intended that the provisions of
this TRA Agreement will not result in duplicative payment of any
amount (including interest) required under this TRA Agreement. It is also
intended that the provisions of this TRA Agreement will result in 85% of the
Corporate Taxpayer\'s or its Covered Subsidiaries\' Cumulative Net Realized
Tax Benefits, and the Interest Amounts thereon, being paid to the TRA Parties
pursuant to this TRA Agreement. The provisions of this TRA Agreement shall be
construed in the appropriate manner so that these fundamental results are
achieved. For purposes of this TRA Agreement, and also for the avoidance of
doubt, no Tax Benefit Payment shall be required to be calculated or made in
respect of any estimated tax payments, including, without limitation, any
estimated U.S. federal income tax payments.

 

Section 3.3 Pro Rata Payments. Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.1 to the
contrary, to the extent that the aggregate Realized Tax Benefit of the
Corporate Taxpayer or its Covered Subsidiaries with respect to the Tax
Attributes is limited in a particular Taxable Year because the Corporate
Taxpayer or its Covered Subsidiaries do not have sufficient taxable income,
the Net Tax Benefit for the Corporate Taxpayer or the its Covered
Subsidiaries shall be allocated among all parties eligible for Tax Benefit
Payments under this TRA Agreement in proportion to the amounts of Net Tax
Benefit, respectively, that would have been Attributable to each TRA Party if
the Corporate Taxpayer or the its Covered Subsidiaries had sufficient taxable
income so that there were no such limitation.

 

Section 3.4 Payment Ordering. If for any reason the Corporate Taxpayer does
not fully satisfy its payment obligations to make all Tax Benefit Payments due
under this TRA Agreement in respect of a particular Taxable Year, then the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties agree that (i) Tax Benefit Payments for
such Taxable Year shall be allocated to all parties eligible for Tax Benefit
Payments under this TRA Agreement in proportion to the amounts of Net Tax
Benefit, respectively, that would have been Attributable to each TRA Party if
the Corporate Taxpayer had sufficient cash available to make such Tax Benefit
Payments and (ii) no Tax Benefit Payments shall be made in respect of any
Taxable Year until all Tax Benefit Payments to all TRA Parties in respect of
all prior Taxable Years have been made in full.

 

Section 3.5 Overpayments. To the extent the Corporate Taxpayer makes a payment
to a TRA Party in respect of a particular Taxable Year under Section 3.1(a) in
an amount in excess

15

 

of the amount of such payment that should have been made to such TRA Party in
respect of such Taxable Year (taking into account Section 3.3 and Section 3.4)
under the terms of this TRA Agreement, then such TRA Party shall not receive
further payments under Section 3.1(a) until such TRA Party has foregone an
amount of payments equal to such excess.

ARTICLE IV

 

TERMINATION

Section 4.1 Early Termination of Agreement; Breach of Agreement.

(a)Corporate Taxpayer\'s Early Termination Right. The Corporate Taxpayer may,
with the prior written consent of the TRA Disinterested Majority, terminate
this TRA Agreement (including with respect to all amounts payable to the TRA
Parties and with respect to all of the Partnership Units held by the TRA
Parties, subject to the immediately succeeding sentence) at any time by
paying to each TRA Party the Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA
Party; provided, however, that this TRA Agreement shall terminate only upon
the receipt by each TRA Party of its respective Early Termination Payment and
payments described in the next sentence, if any, and provided, further, that
the Corporate Taxpayer may withdraw any notice to execute its termination
rights under this Section 4.1(a) prior to the time at which any Early
Termination Payment has been paid. Upon payment of the Early Termination
Payment by the Corporate Taxpayer, none of the TRA Parties or the Corporate
Taxpayer shall have any further payment obligations under this TRA Agreement,
other than with respect to (i) any Tax Benefit Payments due and payable and
that remain unpaid as of the Early Termination Date (which Tax Benefit
Payments shall not be included in the Early Termination Payments) and as of
the date of payment of the Early Termination Payment and (ii) any Tax Benefit
Payments due for the Taxable Year ending immediately prior to or including the
Early Termination Date (except to the extent that the amounts described in
this clause (ii) are included in the calculation of the Early Termination
Payments (at the option of the Corporate Taxpayer) or are included in clause
(i)); provided that upon payment of all amounts, to the extent applicable and
without duplication, described in this sentence, this TRA Agreement shall
terminate. For the avoidance of doubt, if an Exchange occurs after the
Corporate Taxpayer makes all of the required Early Termination Payments, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall have no obligations under this TRA Agreement with
respect to such Exchange.

 

(b)Acceleration Upon Change of Control. In the event of a Change of Control,
the TRA Party Representative shall have the option, by written notice to
the Corporate Taxpayer, to cause the acceleration of the unpaid payment
obligations as calculated in accordance with this Section 4.1(b), and such
payment obligations shall be calculated as if an Early Termination Notice had
been delivered on the date of such Change of Control and shall include,
without duplication:

 

(i)the Early Termination Payments calculated with respect to such TRA Parties
as if the Early Termination Date is the date of such Change of Control, (ii)
any Tax Benefit Payments due and payable and that remain unpaid as of the date
of such Change of Control (which Tax Benefit Payments shall not be included
in the Early Termination Payments described in clause (i)); and

 

(iii)any Tax Benefit Payments due for the Taxable Year ending immediately
prior to or including the date of such Change of Control (except to the extent
that the amounts described in this clause

(iii)are included in the calculation of Early Termination Payments described
in clause (i) (at the option of the Corporate Taxpayer) or are included in
clause (ii)); provided, that the procedures of

16

 

 

Section 4.2 (and Section 2.3, to the extent applicable) and Section 4.3 shall
apply mutatis mutandis with respect to the determination of the amount
payable by the Corporate Taxpayer pursuant to this sentence and the payment
thereof, except that such amount shall not be due and payable until five (5)
Business Days after such amount has become final pursuant to Section 4.2 or,
if applicable, Section 7.9. In the event of an acceleration following a Change
of Control, any Early Termination Payment described in the preceding sentence
shall be calculated utilizing the Valuation Assumptions, substituting in each
case the terms "date of a Change of Control" for an "Early Termination Date,"
and if an Exchange occurs after the Corporate Taxpayer makes all such required
Early Termination Payments and other payments described in this Section
4.1(b), the Corporate Taxpayer shall have no obligations under this TRA
Agreement with respect to such Exchange.

 

(c)Acceleration Upon Material Breach of TRA Agreement. In the event that the
Corporate Taxpayer materially breaches any of its material obligations
under this TRA Agreement, whether as a result of a failure to make a payment
required to be made pursuant to this TRA Agreement by the Final Payment Date
therefor (except for all or a portion of such payment that is being validly
disputed in good faith under this TRA Agreement, and then only with respect
to the amount in dispute), failure to honor any other material obligations
under this TRA Agreement to the extent not cured within thirty (30) calendar
days following receipt by the Corporate Taxpayer of written notice of such
failure from the TRA Party Representative following such failure, or by
operation of law as a result of the rejection of this TRA Agreement in a case
commenced under bankruptcy laws then all obligations hereunder shall
automatically accelerate and such obligations shall be calculated as if an
Early Termination Notice had been delivered on the date of such breach and
shall include, but not be limited to, (1) an Early Termination Payment
calculated pursuant to Section 4.1(a) as if an Early Termination Notice had
been delivered on the date of the breach, (2) any Tax Benefit Payment that is
due and payable but unpaid as of the date of the breach and (3) any Tax
Benefit Payment due for the Taxable Year ending with or including the date of
the breach. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Corporate Taxpayer
breaches this TRA Agreement with respect to one or more TRA Parties, such TRA
Parties shall be entitled to elect to receive the amounts set forth in
clauses (1), (2) and (3) above or to seek specific performance of the terms
hereof. For purposes of this Section 4.1(c), and subject to the following
sentence, the Parties agree that the failure to make any payment due
pursuant to this TRA Agreement within thirty (30) calendar days of the
relevant Final Payment Date shall be deemed to be a material breach of a
material obligation under this TRA Agreement for all purposes of this TRA
Agreement, and that it will not be considered to be a material breach of a
material obligation under this TRA Agreement to make a payment due pursuant to
this TRA Agreement within thirty (30) calendar days of the relevant Final
Payment Date. Notwithstanding anything in this TRA Agreement to the contrary,
it shall not be a material breach of a material obligation of this TRA
Agreement if the Corporate Taxpayer fails to make any Tax Benefit Payment
within thirty (30) calendar days of the relevant Final Payment Date to
the extent that the Corporate Taxpayer has insufficient funds or cannot make
such payment as a result of obligations imposed in connection with the Senior
Obligations or under applicable law, and cannot obtain sufficient funds
despite using reasonable best efforts to obtain funds to make such payment
(including by causing Subsidiaries to distribute or lend funds for such
payment and access any sources of available credit to fund such
payment); provided that the interest provisions of Section 5.2 shall apply to
such late payment; and further provided that such payment obligation shall
nonetheless

17

 

accrue for the benefit of the TRA Parties and the Corporate Taxpayer shall
make such payment at the first opportunity that it has sufficient funds and is
otherwise able to make such payment.

 

Section 4.2 Early Termination Notice. If the Corporate Taxpayer chooses to
exercise its right of early termination in accordance with Section 4.1 above,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall deliver to each TRA Party written notice of such
decision to exercise such right ("Early Termination Notice") and a schedule
(the "Early Termination Schedule") specifying the Corporate Taxpayer\'s
decision to exercise such right and showing in reasonable detail the
calculation of the Early Termination Payment(s) due for each TRA Party. Each
Early Termination Schedule shall become final and binding on all parties
thirty (30) calendar days from the first date on which all TRA Parties have
been given such Schedule under Section 7.1 unless the TRA Party
Representative (i) within thirty (30) calendar days after such date gives the
Corporate Taxpayer written notice of a material objection to such Schedule
made in good faith ("Material Objection Notice") or (ii) provides a written
waiver of its right to give a Material Objection Notice within the period
described in clause (i) above, in which case such Schedule becomes binding on
the date such waiver is given by the TRA Party Representative to the Corporate
Taxpayer. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative, for any
reason, are unable to successfully resolve the issues raised in such Material
Objection Notice within thirty (30) calendar days after the TRA Party
Representative gives the Corporate Taxpayer the Material Objection Notice, the
Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative shall employ the
Reconciliation Procedures in which case such Schedule becomes binding in
accordance with Section 7.9. The TRA Party Representative will represent the
interests of each of the TRA Parties and shall raise and pursue, in accordance
with this Section 4.2, any objection to an Early Termination Schedule timely
given in writing to the TRA Party Representative by a TRA Party.

Section 4.3 Payment upon Early Termination.

(a)Within five (5) Business Days after an Early Termination Effective Date,
the Corporate Taxpayer shall pay to each TRA Party an amount equal to the
Early Termination Payment in respect of such TRA Party. Such payment shall be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account or
accounts designated by such TRA Party or as otherwise agreed by the Corporate
Taxpayer and such TRA Party or, in the absence of such designation or
agreement, by check mailed to the last mailing address provided by such TRA
Party to the Corporate Taxpayer.

 

(b)"Early Termination Payment" in respect of a TRA Party shall equal the
present value, discounted at the Early Termination Rate as of and starting
from the applicable Early Termination Date, of all Tax Benefit Payments
(excluding the Interest Amount) in respect of such TRA Party that would be
required to be paid by the Corporate Taxpayer beginning from the Early
Termination Date (but which have not been previously paid as of such date),
and assuming that the Valuation Assumptions in respect of such TRA Party are
applied and that each such Tax Benefit Payment for each relevant Taxable Year
would be paid on the due date (including extensions) under applicable law as
of the Early Termination Date for filing of IRS Form 1120 (or any successor
form) of the Corporate Taxpayer for each such Taxable Year. For the avoidance
of doubt, an Early Termination Payment shall be made to each applicable TRA
Party regardless of whether such TRA Party has exchanged all of its
Partnership Units as of the Early Termination Date.

 

18

 

ARTICLE V

 

SUBORDINATION AND LATE PAYMENTS

 

Section 5.1 Subordination. Notwithstanding any other provision of this TRA
Agreement to the contrary, any Tax Benefit Payment, Early Termination Payment
or any other payment required to be made by the Corporate Taxpayer to any TRA
Party under this TRA Agreement shall rank subordinate and junior in right of
payment to any principal, interest or other amounts due and payable in respect
of any obligations in respect of indebtedness for borrowed money of the
Corporate Taxpayer and its Subsidiaries (the "Senior Obligations") and shall
rank pari passu in right of payment with all current or future unsecured
obligations of the Corporate Taxpayer that are not Senior Obligations. To the
extent that any payment under this TRA Agreement is not permitted to be made
at the time payment is due as a result of this Section 5.1 and the terms of
the agreements governing Senior Obligations, such payment obligation
nevertheless shall accrue for the benefit of the TRA Parties and the
Corporate Taxpayer shall make such payments at the first opportunity that such
payments are permitted to be made in accordance with the terms of the Senior
Obligations and Section 5.2 shall apply to such payment. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this TRA Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the
Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates enters into future Tax receivable
or other similar agreements ("Future TRAs"), the Corporate Taxpayer shall
ensure that the terms of any such Future TRA shall provide that the Tax
Attributes subject to this TRA Agreement shall be senior in priority in all
respects to any Tax attributes subject to any such Future TRA for purposes of
calculating the amount and timing of payments under any such Future TRA. To
the extent the Corporate Taxpayer or its Subsidiaries (including OpCo and its
Subsidiaries) incur, create or assume any Senior Obligations after the date
hereof, the Corporate Taxpayer shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
make reasonable efforts to ensure that such indebtedness permits the amounts
payable hereunder to be paid.

Section 5.2 Late Payments by the Corporate Taxpayer. The amount of all or any
portion of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment not made to
the TRA Parties when due under the terms of this TRA Agreement, whether as a
result of Section 5.1 or otherwise, shall be payable together with any
interest thereon, computed at the Default Rate commencing from the Final
Payment Date therefor accruing to the date of actual payment.

 

ARTICLE VI

 

NO DISPUTES; CONSISTENCY; COOPERATION

 

Section 6.1 Participation in the Corporate Taxpayer\'s and OpCo\'s Tax
Matters. Except as otherwise provided in this TRA Agreement, the Business
Combination Agreement or the Limited Partnership Agreement, the Corporate
Taxpayer shall have full responsibility for, and sole discretion over, all Tax
matters concerning the Corporate Taxpayer and its Covered Subsidiaries and
OpCo, including the preparation, filing or amending of any Tax Return and
defending, contesting or settling any issue pertaining to Covered Taxes.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Corporate Taxpayer shall notify the TRA
Party Representative in writing of the commencement of, and keep the TRA
Party Representative reasonably informed with respect to, the portion of any
audit of the Corporate Taxpayer and its Covered Subsidiaries and OpCo or any
of OpCo\'s Subsidiaries by a Taxing Authority the outcome of which would
reasonably be expected to affect the rights and obligations of a TRA Party
under this TRA Agreement, including the Tax

 

19

 

Benefit Payments payable to TRA Parties, and shall provide to the TRA Party
Representative reasonable opportunity (at the cost and expense of the TRA
Parties) to participate in or provide information and other input to the
Corporate Taxpayer and its Covered Subsidiaries and OpCo and its Subsidiaries
and their respective advisors concerning the conduct of any such portion of
such audit; provided, however, that the Corporate Taxpayer and its Covered
Subsidiaries and OpCo and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to take any
action that is inconsistent with any provision of the Limited Partnership
Agreement or the Business Combination Agreement; provided further, that the
Corporate Taxpayer shall not settle or fail to contest any issue pertaining to
Covered Taxes that is reasonable expected to materially adversely affect the
TRA Parties\' rights and obligations under this TRA Agreement without the
consent of the TRA Party Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

 

Section 6.2 Consistency. The Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Parties agree to
report and cause their respective Affiliates to report for all purposes,
including United States federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes and
financial reporting purposes, all Tax-related items (including the Basis
Adjustments and each Tax Benefit Payment) in a manner consistent with that set
forth in this TRA Agreement or specified by the Corporate Taxpayer in any
Schedule (or Amended Schedule, as applicable) provided by or on behalf of the
Corporate Taxpayer under this TRA Agreement that is final and binding on the
parties unless otherwise required by applicable law. The Corporate Taxpayer
shall (and shall cause OpCo and its other Subsidiaries to) use commercially
reasonable efforts (for the avoidance of doubt, taking into account the
interests and entitlements of all TRA Parties under this TRA Agreement) to
defend the Tax treatment contemplated by this TRA Agreement and any Schedule
(or Amended Schedule, as applicable) in any audit, contest or similar
proceeding with any Taxing Authority.

 

Section 6.3 Cooperation. Each of the TRA Parties shall (a) furnish to the
Corporate Taxpayer in a timely manner such information, documents and other
materials as the Corporate Taxpayer may reasonably request for purposes of
making any determination or computation necessary or appropriate under this
TRA Agreement, preparing any Tax Return or contesting or defending any audit,
examination or controversy with any Taxing Authority, (b) make itself
available to the Corporate Taxpayer and its representatives to provide
explanations of documents and materials and such other information as the
Corporate Taxpayer or its representatives may reasonably request
in connection with any of the matters described in clause (a) above, and (c)
reasonably cooperate in connection with any such matter. OpCo shall reimburse
the TRA Parties for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and
expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 6.3. The Corporate Taxpayer shall
not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to not, without the prior
written consent of the TRA Party Representative, take any actions that has the
primary purpose of avoiding, reducing or preventing the achievement or
attainment of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early Termination Payment under this
TRA Agreement.

Section 7.2 Counterparts. This TRA Agreement may be executed and delivered in
one or more counterparts and by fax, email or other electronic transmission,
each of which shall be

21

 

deemed an original and all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement. No party shall raise the use of a fax machine or email to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a fax machine or email as a
defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract and each party
forever waives any such defense.

 

Section 7.3 Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries. This TRA Agreement
(together with all Exhibits and Schedules to this TRA Agreement), the
Business Combination Agreement (together with the Disclosure Letters and
Exhibits thereto), the Limited Partnership Agreement, and the Confidentiality
Agreement, contain the entire agreement and understanding among the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, whether written or oral, relating to such
subject matter in any way. Nothing in this TRA Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any right, benefit or
remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this TRA Agreement.

 

Section 7.4 Governing Law. The law of the State of Delaware shall govern (a)
all claims or matters related to or arising from this TRA Agreement (including
any tort or non- contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the
construction, interpretation, validity and enforceability of this TRA
Agreement, and the performance of the obligations imposed by this TRA
Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice-of-law or
conflict-of-law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or any
other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

Section 7.5 Severability. If any provision of this TRA Agreement is determined
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable by any governmental entity, all
other provisions of this TRA Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect. Upon such determination that any provision is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this TRA Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

 

Section 7.6 Successors; Assignment; Amendments; Waivers.

 

(a)No TRA Party may assign all or any portion of its rights or obligations
under this TRA Agreement to any Person without the prior written approval of
the TRA Disinterested Majority, except that, to the extent that a TRA Party
Transfers Partnership Units to any of such TRA Party\'s Permitted Transferees
in accordance with the terms of the Limited Partnership Agreement, the
Transferring TRA Party shall have the option to assign, without the approval
of the Board or TRA Disinterested Majority, to the Transferee of such
Partnership Units the Transferring TRA Party\'s rights and obligations under
this TRA Agreement with respect to such Transferred Partnership Units. As a
condition to any such assignment, each Transferee which is a Permitted
Transferee or approved by the TRA Disinterested Majority and the Corporate
Taxpayer shall execute and deliver a joinder to this TRA Agreement, in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit A, agreeing to become a TRA Party for all
purposes of this TRA Agreement, except as otherwise provided in such joinder.
If a TRA Party Transfers Partnership Units in accordance with the terms of
the Limited Partnership Agreement but does not assign to the Transferee of
such Partnership

 

22

 

Units its rights and obligations under this TRA Agreement with respect to
such Transferred Partnership Units, (i) such TRA Party shall remain a TRA
Party under this TRA Agreement for all purposes, including with respect to the
receipt of Tax Benefit Payments to the extent payable hereunder (including
any Tax Benefit Payments in respect of the Exchanges of such Transferred
Partnership Units by such Transferee), and (ii) the Transferee of such
Partnership Units shall not be a TRA Party. The Corporate Taxpayer may not
assign any of its rights or obligations under this TRA Agreement to any
Person (other than in connection with a Mandatory Assignment) without the
prior written consent of the TRA Party Representative (not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Any purported assignment in violation of
the terms of this Section 7.6 shall be null and void. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, once an Exchange has occurred, any and all payments that may become
payable to a TRA Party pursuant to this TRA Agreement with respect to such
Exchange may be assigned to any Person or Persons, as long as any such Person
has executed and delivered, or, in connection with such assignment, executes
and delivers, a joinder to this TRA Agreement, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Corporate Taxpayer, agreeing to be
bound by Section 7.12.

(b)No provision of this TRA Agreement may be amended unless such amendment is
approved in writing by each of the Corporate Taxpayer and by the TRA Parties
who would be entitled to receive at least two-thirds of the total amount of
the Early Termination Payments payable to all TRA Parties under this TRA
Agreement if the Corporate Taxpayer had exercised its right of early
termination on the date of the most recent Exchange prior to such amendment
(excluding, for purposes of this sentence, all payments made to any TRA Party
pursuant to this TRA Agreement since the date of such most recent
Exchange); provided, that no such amendment shall be effective if such
amendment will have a disproportionate effect on the payments one or more TRA
Parties will be entitled to receive under this TRA Agreement unless such
amendment is consented to in writing by such TRA Parties disproportionately
affected. No provision of this TRA Agreement may be waived unless such waiver
is in writing and signed by the party against whom the waiver is to be
effective.

(c)All of the terms and provisions of this TRA Agreement shall be binding
upon, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors, permitted assigns, heirs, executors,
administrators and legal representatives. The Corporate Taxpayer shall require
and cause any direct or indirect successor (whether by purchase, merger,
consolidation or otherwise) to all or substantially all of the business or
assets of the Corporate Taxpayer, by written agreement, expressly to assume
and agree to perform this TRA Agreement in the same manner and to the same
extent that the Corporate Taxpayer would be required to perform if no
such succession had taken place (any such assignment, a "Mandatory
Assignment").

counsel have reviewed and negotiated this TRA Agreement as the joint
agreement and understanding of such parties, and the language used in this TRA
Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen by such parties to express
their mutual intent, and no rule of strict construction shall be applied

Section 7.8 Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction.

 

(a)EACH PARTY TO THIS TRA AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR
AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES (WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS TRA AGREEMENT,
THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS TRA AGREEMENT AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS
ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER. THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WARRANT
AND REPRESENT THAT EACH HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH ITS LEGAL COUNSEL, AND
THAT EACH KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES ITS JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING
CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL.

 

(b)Subject to Section 7.9, each of the parties hereto submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or if such
court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for the
District of Delaware, in any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this TRA Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of such
action, suit or proceeding shall be heard and determined in any such court
and agrees not to

24

 

bring any action, suit or proceeding arising out of or relating to this TRA
Agreement in any other courts. Nothing in this Section 7.8, however, shall
affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any other manner
permitted by law or at equity. Each party hereto agrees that a final judgment
in any action, suit or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and may be
enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law or at
equity.

 

Section 7.9 Reconciliation. In the event that the Corporate Taxpayer and the
TRA Party Representative are unable to resolve a disagreement with respect to
the calculation of amounts owed pursuant to this TRA Agreement within the
relevant period designated in this TRA Agreement ("Reconciliation
Dispute"), the Reconciliation Dispute shall be submitted for determination to
a nationally recognized expert in the particular area of disagreement, acting
as an expert and not as an arbitrator (the "Expert"), mutually acceptable to
the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party Representative. The Expert shall be a
partner or principal of PricewaterhouseCoopers, Ernst and Young, Deloitte, KPMG
or RSM US LLP, and unless the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative agree in writing otherwise, the Expert shall not, and the firm
that employs the Expert shall not, have any material relationship with any
party to this TRA Agreement or any Affiliate of any such parties or any other
actual or potential conflict of interest. If the Corporate Taxpayer and the
TRA Party Representative are unable to agree on an Expert within fifteen (15)
calendar days of receipt by the respondent(s) of written notice of a
Reconciliation Dispute, then the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative shall cause the Expert to be selected by the International
Chamber of Commerce Centre for Expertise (the "ICC") in accordance with the
criteria set forth above in this Section 7.9. The Expert shall resolve any
matter relating to the Basis Schedule or an amendment thereto or the Early
Termination Schedule or an amendment thereto within thirty (30) calendar days
and shall resolve any matter relating to a Tax Benefit Schedule or an
amendment thereto within fifteen (15) calendar days or, in each case, as soon
thereafter as is reasonably practicable, in each case after the matter has
been submitted to the Expert for resolution. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, if the matter is not resolved before any payment that is the
subject of a disagreement would be due (in the absence of such disagreement)
or any Tax Return reflecting the subject of a disagreement is due, the
undisputed amount shall be paid on the date prescribed by this TRA Agreement
and such Tax Return may be filed as prepared by the Corporate Taxpayer,
subject to adjustment or amendment upon resolution. The sum of (a) the costs
and expenses relating to (i) the engagement (and, if applicable, selection by
the ICC) of such Expert and (ii) if applicable, amending any Tax Return in
connection with the decision of such Expert and (b) the reasonable out-of-
pocket costs and expenses of the Corporate Taxpayer and the TRA Party
Representative incurred in the conduct of such proceeding shall be allocated
between the Corporate Taxpayer, on the one hand, and the TRA Parties, on the
other hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of the disputed
items so submitted to the Expert that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such
party (as finally determined by the Expert) bears to the total amount of such
disputed items so submitted, and each such party shall promptly reimburse the
other party for the excess that such other party has paid in respect of such
costs and expenses over the amount it has been so allocated. The Corporate
Taxpayer may withhold payments under this TRA Agreement to collect amounts due
under the preceding sentence. Any dispute as to whether a dispute is a
Reconciliation Dispute within the meaning of this Section 7.9 shall be
decided by the Expert. The Expert shall finally determine any Reconciliation
Dispute and the determinations of the Expert pursuant to this Section 7.9
shall be binding on the Corporate Taxpayer and each of the TRA Parties and
may be entered and enforced in any court having jurisdiction.

25

 

Section 7.10 Withholding. The Corporate Taxpayer shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from any payment payable pursuant to this TRA Agreement such
amounts as the Corporate Taxpayer is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local, foreign or other Tax law; provided, however, that the Corporate
Taxpayer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to notify and shall
reasonably cooperate with the applicable TRA Party prior to the making of such
deductions and withholding payments to determine whether any such deductions
or withholding payments (other than any deduction or withholding required by
reason of such TRA Party\'s failure to comply with the last sentence of this
Section 7.10) are required under applicable law and in obtaining any
available exemption or reduction of, or otherwise minimizing to the extent
permitted by applicable law, such deduction and withholding. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
Taxing Authority by the Corporate Taxpayer, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this TRA Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of whom such withholding was made. Each TRA Party shall
promptly provide the Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo or other applicable withholding
agent with any applicable Tax forms and certifications (including IRS Form W-9
or the applicable version of IRS Form W-8) reasonably requested and shall
promptly provide an update of any such Tax form or certificate previously
delivered if the same has become incorrect or has expired.

Section 7.11 Admission of the Corporate Taxpayer into a Consolidated Group;
Transfers of Corporate Assets.

(a)If the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Covered Subsidiaries is or becomes
a member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group of
corporations that files a consolidated, combined or unitary income Tax Return
pursuant to Sections 1501 et seq. of the Code or any corresponding provisions
of state, local or foreign Tax law, then: (i) the provisions of this TRA
Agreement shall be applied with respect to the group as a whole; and (ii) Tax
Benefit Payments, Early Termination Payments and other applicable items
hereunder shall be computed with reference to the consolidated, combined
or unitary taxable income of the group as a whole.

(b)If any Person the income of which is included in the income of the
Corporate Taxpayer or its Covered Subsidiaries or the Corporate Taxpayer\'s
or its Covered Subsidiaries\' affiliated or consolidated group transfers
transfers one or more assets to a corporation (or a Person classified as a
corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes) with which such entity does
not file a consolidated Tax Return pursuant to Section 1501 of the Code or any
corresponding provisions of state, local or foreign Tax law, such entity, for
purposes of calculating the amount of any Tax Benefit Payment or Early
Termination Payment due hereunder, shall be treated as having disposed of
such asset in a fully taxable transaction on the date of such contribution.
The consideration deemed to be received in a transaction contemplated in the
prior sentence shall be equal to the fair market value of the deemed
transferred asset, plus (i) the amount of debt to which such asset is subject,
in the case of a transfer of an encumbered asset or (ii) the amount of debt
allocated to such asset, in the case of a transfer of a partnership interest.
The transactions described in this Section 7.11(b) shall be taken into account
in determining the Realized Tax Benefit or Realized Tax Detriment, as
applicable, for such Taxable Year based on the income, gain or loss
deemed allocated to the Corporate Taxpayer and its Covered Subsidiaries using
the Non-Adjusted Tax Basis of the Referenced Assets in calculating its
Hypothetical Tax Liability for such Taxable Year and using the actual Tax
basis of the Reference Assets in

26

 

calculating its Actual Tax Liability, determined using the "with and without"
methodology. Thus, for example, in determining the Hypothetical Tax Liability
of the Corporate Taxpayer or its Covered Subsidiaries the taxable income of
the Corporate Taxpayer or its Covered Subsidiaries shall be determined by
treating OpCo as having sold the applicable Reference Asset for its fair
market value, recovering any basis applicable to such Reference Asset (using
the Non-Adjusted Tax Basis), while the Actual Tax Liability of the
Corporate Taxpayer or its Covered Subsidiaries would be determined by
recovering the actual Tax basis of the Reference Asset that reflects any Basis
Adjustments. For purposes of this Section 7.11, a transfer of a partnership
interest shall be treated as a transfer of the transferring partner\'s share
of each of the assets and liabilities of that partnership.

Section 7.12 Confidentiality.

(a)Subject to Section 6.3, each TRA Party acknowledges and agrees that the
information of the Corporate Taxpayer is confidential and, except in the
course of performing any duties as necessary for the Corporate Taxpayer and
its Affiliates, as required by law or legal process or to enforce the terms of
this TRA Agreement in good faith, such person shall keep and retain in
confidence and not disclose to any Person any confidential matters of the
Corporate Taxpayer and its Affiliates and successors or concerning OpCo and
its Affiliates and successors learned by the TRA Party pursuant to this TRA
Agreement. This Section 7.12 shall not apply to

(i)any information that has been made public by the Corporate Taxpayer or any
of its Affiliates, becomes public knowledge (except as a result of an act of
the TRA Party in violation of this TRA Agreement) and (ii) the disclosure of
information to the extent reasonably necessary for the TRA Party to prepare
and file its Tax Returns, to respond to any inquiries regarding the same from
any Taxing Authority or to prosecute or defend any material action,
proceeding or audit by any Taxing Authority with respect to such returns.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this TRA Agreement, to the extent
required by applicable law or to the extent reasonably necessary for the
TRA Party to comply with any applicable reportable transaction requirements
under applicable law, each TRA Party (and each employee, representative or
other agent of the TRA Party, as applicable) may disclose the Tax treatment
and Tax structure of the Corporate Taxpayer, OpCo and their Affiliates, and
any of their transactions, and all materials of any kind (including opinions
or other Tax analyses) that are provided to the TRA Party relating to such Tax
treatment and Tax structure.

 

(b)If a TRA Party breaches any of the provisions of this Section 7.12, the
Corporate Taxpayer shall have the right to seek to have the provisions of this
Section 7.12 specifically enforced by injunctive relief by any court of
competent jurisdiction without the need to post any bond or other security, it
being acknowledged and agreed that any such breach shall cause irreparable
injury to the Corporate Taxpayer or any of its Affiliates and that money
damages alone shall not provide an adequate remedy to such Persons. Such
rights and remedies shall be in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other
rights and remedies available at law or in equity.

 

(c)In no event shall this Section 7.12 limit any obligation of any party under
the Limited Partnership Agreement or the Business Combination Agreement.

 

Section 7.13 TRA Party Representative. By executing this TRA Agreement, each
of the TRA Parties shall be deemed to have irrevocably appointed the TRA
Party Representative as

27

 

its agent and attorney in fact with full power of substitution to act from
and after the date hereof and to do any and all things and execute any and all
documents on behalf of such TRA Parties which may be necessary, convenient or
appropriate to facilitate any matters under this TRA Agreement, including:
(i) execution of the documents and certificates required pursuant to this TRA
Agreement; (ii) except to the extent provided in this TRA Agreement, receipt
and forwarding of notices and communications pursuant to this TRA Agreement;
(iii) administration of the provisions of this TRA Agreement; (iv) any and
all consents, waivers, amendments or modifications deemed by the TRA Party
Representative to be necessary or appropriate under this TRA Agreement and the
execution or delivery of any documents that may be necessary or appropriate
in connection therewith; (v) taking actions the TRA Party Representative is
authorized to take pursuant to the other provisions of this TRA Agreement;
(vi) negotiating and compromising, on behalf of such TRA Parties, any dispute
that may arise under, and exercising or refraining from exercising any
remedies available under, this TRA Agreement and executing, on behalf of such
TRA Parties, any settlement agreement, release or other document with respect
to such dispute or remedy; and (vii) engaging attorneys, accountants, agents
or consultants on behalf of such TRA Parties in connection with this TRA
Agreement and paying any fees related thereto on behalf of such TRA Parties,
subject to reimbursement by such TRA Parties. The TRA Parties shall promptly
reimburse the TRA Party Representative for all reasonable costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the TRA Party Representative performing its duties
hereunder. The TRA Party Representative may resign upon thirty (30) days\'
written notice to the Corporate Taxpayer.

all Necessary Action to cause the Board to be comprised at Closing of nine (9)
directors, (i) seven (7) of whom have been nominated by the Seller
Representative (each, a "Seller Director"), initially Neil Bluhm, Greg Carlin,
Paul Wierbicki, Leslie Bluhm, James Gordon, Judith Gold, and Sheli Rosenberg
and (ii) two (2) of whom have been nominated by the Sponsor (each, a "Sponsor
Director"), initially Harry You and Niccolo de Masi, and thereafter
designated pursuant to Section 2.1(b) or Section 2.1(c), as applicable, and
such foregoing directors to be divided into three classes of directors, with

(i)the Class I directors shall include: two (2) Seller Director(s) and one

(1)Sponsor Director, initially Harry You;

(ii)the Class II directors shall include: three (3) Seller Director(s); and

 

(iii)the  Class III directors shall include: two (2) Seller Director(s) and
one (1) Sponsor Director, initially Niccolo de Masi.

 

The initial term of the Class I directors shall expire immediately following
PubCo\'s 2021 annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected.
The initial term of the Class II directors shall expire immediately following
PubCo\'s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected.
The initial term of the Class III directors shall expire immediately
following PubCo\'s 2023 annual meeting at which directors are elected.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, on or prior to the
one (1) year anniversary of the date of this Agreement, the Board will
consider in good faith whether to, and may, in its sole discretion, elect to
add two additional members of the Board, which new members shall be nominated
by the Seller Representative, initially Richard Schwartz and Meredith Bluhm-
Wolf and shall be a Seller Director for all purposes of this Agreement. If and
to the extent that the Board makes such election in its sole discretion,
PubCo shall, and each of the Sellers and the Sponsor (severally, and not
jointly) agrees with PubCo that he, she or it shall, take all Necessary Action
to cause the Board to be comprised of eleven (11) directors and to appoint
such new Seller Directors to the Board. If so nominated and appointed, (i)
Meredith Bluhm-Wolf shall be a Class

IIdirector (with an initial term expiring immediately following PubCo\'s 2022
annual meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected) and (ii)
Richard Schwartz shall be a Class III director

10

 

(with an initial term expiring immediately following PubCo\'s 2023 annual
meeting of stockholders at which directors are elected). For the avoidance of
doubt, only the Seller Representative shall be entitled to remove the new

PubCo\'s Equity Securities are listed ("Controlled Company Eligible"), subject
to the next sentence of this Section 2.1(b) and subject to the rights of the
Sponsor to nominate the Sponsor Directors hereunder, PubCo shall take all
Necessary Action to include in the slate of nominees recommended by the Board
for election as directors at each applicable annual or special meeting of

directors, PubCo would be required to take all Necessary Action to include
each of the other nine (9) individuals nominated by the Seller Representative

Directors hereunder, the number of Seller Directors that may be designated by

Representative and nominated by PubCo without causing such violation and (ii)
from and after such time as PubCo is no longer Controlled Company Eligible, a
number of individuals designated by the Seller Representative that, if
elected, will result in the Sellers and their Permitted Transferees having a
number of directors serving on the Board equal to the greater of (x) such
number of directors as permitted by the securities exchange on which PubCo\'s
Equity Securities are listed or (y) (1) the total members of the Board
multiplied by (2) the percentage of issued and outstanding shares of voting
Equity Securities of PubCo held at such time by the Sellers and their

meeting of stockholders at which directors are to be elected that number of

Action to cause the appropriate number of Seller Directors or Sponsor
Directors, as applicable, to offer to tender their resignation at least 60
days prior to the expected date of PubCo\'s next annual meeting of

Committee may, in its sole discretion, recommend for nomination a Seller
Director or Sponsor Director that has tendered his or her resignation pursuant
to this Section 2.1(d).

(e)Removal; Vacancies. The Seller Representative or the Sponsor, as
applicable, shall have the exclusive right to (i) remove their nominees from
the Board, and PubCo shall take all Necessary Action to cause the removal of
any such nominee at the request of the applicable Party and (ii) designate

clause (i) or (ii) above to be filled by replacement directors designated by
the applicable Party as promptly as practicable after such designation (and in
any event prior to the next meeting or action of the Board or applicable
committee). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
2.1(e), no Party shall have the right to designate a replacement director, and
PubCo shall not be required to take any action to cause any vacancy to be
filled by any such designee, to the extent that election or appointment of
such designee to the Board would result in a number of directors nominated or
designated by such Party in excess of the number of directors that such Party
is then entitled to nominate for membership on the Board pursuant to this
Investor Rights Agreement.

(f)Committees. In accordance with PubCo\'s Organizational Documents, (i) the
Board shall establish and maintain committees of the Board for (x) Audit, (y)

Controlled Company Eligible, the Seller Representative shall have the right,
and PubCo shall take all Necessary Action, to have a majority of the members
of each such committee consist of members of the Board designated by
the Seller Representative, and (ii) at any time when PubCo is not Controlled
Company Eligible, the Seller Representative shall have the right, and PubCo
shall take all Necessary Action, to have a number of the members of each such
committee consist of a

12

 

proportional number of members of each such committee (rounded up) as relates
to the proportion of the Board designated by the Seller Representative. For
as long as such individual serves on the Board and is eligible to serve on
such committee, (x) Niccolo de Masi shall be entitled to serve on the
Compensation Committee and the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee
and (y) Harry You shall be entitled to serve on the Audit Committee as
Chairman.

 

(g)Independent Directors. PubCo has determined that the initial slate of
directors referenced in Section 2.1(a) includes the requisite number of

all Necessary Action to ensure that the Board consists of the requisite number
of directors meeting the independence requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange or any other securities exchange on which the Equity Securities of
PubCo are then listed, in each case giving effect, when applicable, to Section
2.1(h) (and for as long the Company is Controlled Company Eligible and the
Seller Representative is entitled to nominate its full slate of directors
pursuant to the first sentence of Section 2.1(b), the Seller Representative
shall include among its nominees such number of directors meeting such
independnce requirements that, when taken together with other directors
(including the Sponsor Directors) meeting such independence requirements,
PubCo has the requisite number of directors meeting such independence
requirements). For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that,
if at any time the number of directors entitled to be designated by the Seller
Representative and the Sponsor pursuant to this Section 2.1 is less than the
entire membership of the Board, subject to the rights of any other Person to
nominate or designate one or more directors (including, without limitation,
the right of the Sellers Representative and the Sponsor to designate members
for nominations to the Board in accordance with Section 2.1(a)),
the remaining directors shall be nominated by the Nominating and Corporate
Governance Committee and approved by the Board.

Company Eligible, except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing by the
Seller Representative, PubCo shall take all Necessary Action to avail itself
of all "controlled company" exemptions to the rules of the New York Stock
Exchange or any other exchange on which the Equity Securities of PubCo are
then listed and shall comply with all requirements under Law (including Item
407(a) of Regulation S-K) and all disclosure requirements to take such
actions. Among other things, except to the extent otherwise agreed in writing
by the Seller Representative, for so long as PubCo is Controlled Company
Eligible, PubCo shall take all Necessary Action to exempt itself from each of

the event that the Class A Common Stock in PubCo Beneficially Owned by Sellers
and their Permitted Transferees falls below the Board Observer Ownership
Threshold, (y) the Board Observers shall not be entitled to vote on any matter
submitted to the Board nor to offer any motions or resolutions to the Board,
and the Board Observers\' presence or absence at any meeting of the Board
will not be relevant for purposes of determining whether there is a quorum,
and (z) PubCo may withhold information or materials from the Board Observers
and exclude the

 

14

 

Board Observers from any executive sessions and/or all or any portion of any
meeting or discussion of the Board, in each case of this clause (z), if the
Board determines in good faith that access to such information and/or
materials or attendance at such meeting or portion thereof would (A) adversely
affect the attorney-client privilege between PubCo and its counsel, (B)
adversely affect PubCo or its Affiliates under governmental regulations or
other applicable laws,

(C)be in contravention of any agreement or arrangement with any governmental
authority, or (D) result in a conflict of interest. The Board Observers shall
be subject to the same obligations as the members of the Board with respect
to confidentiality and conflicts of interest (and shall provide, prior to
attending any meetings or receiving any information or materials, such
reasonable assurances to such effect as may be requested by PubCo) and shall
be entitled to expense reimbursement in accordance with Section 2.1(i).

 

Section 2.2 Action Requiring Special Approval. For so long as the Sellers and
their Permitted Transferees, either individually or as a group (as such term
is construed in accordance with the Exchange Act), own Equity Securities of
PubCo representing a majority of the voting power of the Equity Securities of
PubCo entitled to vote on matters brought before such stockholder to vote, for
the period ending on the earlier of (x) twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date and (y) the date on which PubCo holds its next annual meeting,
PubCo will not, and will not permit or undertake, or agree to undertake,
whether directly or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the
Sponsor, any amendment to or modification of (a) Section 5.1(ii), Article
VIII, Article X, the first sentence of Section 13.1 or Article XIV of the
Certificate of Incorporation or (b) Article V of the Bylaws of PubCo (in each
case, or the substantive matter thereof), in each case that materially and
adversely impacts the Sponsor and/or its Permitted Transferees in their
capacity as stockholders of PubCo.

Section 2.3 Sharing of Information. To the extent permitted by antitrust,
competition or any other applicable Law, each of PubCo, the Sellers and the
Sponsor agrees and acknowledges that the directors designated by the Seller
Representative and the Sponsor and the Board Observers may share confidential,
non-public information about PubCo and its Subsidiaries ("Confidential
Information") with the Sellers and the Sponsor, as applicable. Each of the
Sellers and the Sponsor recognizes that it, or its Affiliates and
Representatives, has acquired or will acquire Confidential Information the
use or disclosure of which could cause PubCo substantial loss and damages that
could not be readily calculated and for which no remedy at Law would be
adequate. Accordingly, each of the Sellers and the Sponsor covenants and
agrees with PubCo that it will not (and will cause its respective controlled
Affiliates and Representatives not to) at any time, except with the prior
written consent of PubCo, directly or indirectly, disclose any Confidential
Information known to it to any third party, unless (a) such information
becomes known to the public through no fault of such Party, (b) disclosure is
required by applicable Law or court of competent jurisdiction or requested by
a Governmental Entity; provided that such Party promptly notifies PubCo of
such requirement or request and takes commercially reasonable steps, at the
sole cost and expense of PubCo, to minimize the extent of any such required
disclosure, (c) such information was available or becomes available to such
Party before, on or after the Effective Date, without restriction, from a
source (other than PubCo) without any breach of duty to PubCo or (d) such
information was independently developed by such Party or its Representatives
without the use of the Confidential Information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing in this Investor Rights Agreement shall prohibit the
Sellers and the Sponsor from disclosing Confidential Information to

15

 

any Affiliate, Representative, limited partner, member or shareholder of such
Party; provided that such Person shall be bound by an obligation of
confidentiality with respect to such Confidential Information and such Party
shall be responsible for any breach of this Section 2.3 by any such Person. No
Confidential Information shall be deemed to be provided to any
Person, including any Affiliate of the Sellers or the Sponsor, unless such
Confidential Information is actually provided to such Person.

ARTICLE III

 

REGISTRATION RIGHTS

Section 3.1 Shelf Registration.

 

(a)Filing. PubCo shall file, within 30 days of the Closing Date or such other
earlier date as it is required in accordance with any Subscription
Agreements, a Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-3
(the "Form S-3 Shelf"), or if PubCo is ineligible to use a Form S-3 Shelf, a
Registration Statement for a Shelf Registration on Form S-1 (the "Form S-1
Shelf," and together with the Form S-3 Shelf (and any Subsequent Shelf
Registration), the "Shelf"), in each case, covering the resale of all
Registrable Securities (determined as of two (2) Business Days prior to such
filing) on a delayed or continuous basis. PubCo shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the Shelf to become effective as soon as practicable after
such filing, but in no event later than sixty (60) days after the initial
filing thereof or such other earlier date as it is required in accordance
with any Subscription Agreements. The Shelf shall provide for the resale of
the Registrable Securities included therein pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, any Holder.
PubCo shall maintain the Shelf in accordance with the terms of this Investor
Rights Agreement, and shall prepare and file with the SEC such amendments,
including post-effective amendments, and supplements as may be necessary to
keep such Shelf continuously effective, available for use and in compliance
with the provisions of the Securities Act until such time as there are no
longer any Registrable Securities. In the event PubCo files a Form S-1 Shelf,
PubCo shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to convert the Form S-1
Shelf (and any Subsequent Shelf Registration) to a Form S-3 Shelf as soon as
practicable after PubCo is eligible to use Form S-3.

 

(b)Subsequent Shelf Registration. If any Shelf ceases to be effective under
the Securities Act for any reason at any time while there are any
Registrable Securities outstanding, PubCo shall use its reasonable best
efforts to as promptly as is reasonably practicable cause such Shelf to again
become effective under the Securities Act (including obtaining the prompt
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf), and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to as promptly as is reasonably
practicable amend such Shelf in a manner reasonably expected to result in the
withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness of such Shelf or file an
additional Registration Statement as a Shelf Registration (a "Subsequent Shelf
Registration") registering the resale of all outstanding
Registrable Securities from time to time, and pursuant to any method or
combination of methods legally available to, and requested by, any Holder. If
a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, PubCo shall use its reasonable best
efforts to (i) cause such Subsequent Shelf Registration to become effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the
filing thereof (it being agreed that the Subsequent Shelf Registration shall
be an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement if PubCo is a Well-Known
Seasoned Issuer) and (ii) keep such Subsequent Shelf Registration continuously
effective,

16

 

 

available for use and in compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act
until such time as there are no longer any Registrable
Securities outstanding. Any such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on
Form S-3 to the extent that PubCo is eligible to use such form. Otherwise,
such Subsequent Shelf Registration shall be on another appropriate form. In
the event that any Holder holds Registrable Securities that are not
registered for resale on a delayed or continuous basis, PubCo, upon request of
a Holder, shall promptly use its reasonable best efforts to cause the resale
of such Registrable Securities to be covered by either, at PubCo\'s option,
the Shelf (including by means of a post-effective amendment) or a Subsequent
Shelf Registration and cause the same to become effective as soon as
practicable after such filing and such Shelf or Subsequent Shelf Registration
shall be subject to the terms of this Investor Rights Agreement.

 

(c)Requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns. At any time and from time to
time after the Shelf has been declared effective by the SEC, the Special
Holders may request to sell all or any portion of their Registrable
Securities in an underwritten offering that is registered pursuant to the
Shelf (each, an "Underwritten Shelf Takedown"); provided that PubCo shall
only be obligated to effect an Underwritten Shelf Takedown if such offering
(i) shall include securities with a total offering price (including piggyback
securities and before deduction of underwriting discounts) reasonably expected
to exceed, in the aggregate, $10 million (the "Minimum Takedown Threshold")
or (ii) shall be made with respect to all of the Registrable Securities of the
Demanding Holder. All requests for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns shall be made
by giving written notice to PubCo, which shall specify the approximate number
of Registrable Securities proposed to be sold in the Underwritten Shelf
Takedown and the expected price range (net of underwriting discounts and
commissions) of such Underwritten Shelf Takedown; provided that each Special
Holder agrees that the fact that such a notice has been delivered shall
constitute Confidential Information subject to Section 2.3. The Special
Holders that requested such Underwritten Shelf Takedown (the
"Demanding Holders") shall have the right to select the Underwriters for such
offering (which shall consist of one (1) or more reputable nationally or
regionally recognized investment banks), and to agree to the pricing and other
terms of such offering; provided that such selection shall be subject to the
consent of PubCo, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Investor Rights Agreement, in no event shall any Special Holder or any
Transferee thereof request an Underwritten Shelf Takedown during the Lock-Up
Period applicable to such Person. There shall be no limit to the number of
Underwritten Shelf Takedowns that may be requested by any Special Holder,
subject to the proviso in the first sentence of this Section 3.1(c).

 

(d)Reduction of Underwritten Shelf Takedowns. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, in good faith, advise PubCo,
the Demanding Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) in writing that the
dollar amount or number of Registrable Securities that the Demanding Holders
and the Requesting Holders (if any) desire to sell, taken together with all
other shares of Common Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to
sell and all other Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, that have
been requested to be sold in such Underwritten Offering pursuant to separate
written contractual piggyback registration rights held by any other
stockholders, exceeds the maximum dollar amount or maximum number of Equity
Securities that can be sold in the Underwritten Offering without adversely
affecting the proposed offering price, the timing, the distribution method,
or the

17

 

probability of success of such offering (such maximum dollar amount or
maximum number of such securities, as applicable, the "Maximum Number of
Securities"), then PubCo shall include in such Underwritten Offering, as
follows: at all times (i) first, the Registrable Securities of the Demanding
Holders and the Requesting Holders (if any) (pro rata based on the respective
number of Registrable Securities that each Demanding Holder and Requesting
Holder (if any) has requested be included in such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown) that can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities;
(ii) second, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clause (i), the Common Stock or other Equity
Securities that PubCo desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the
Maximum Number of Securities; (iii) third, to the extent that the Maximum
Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (i) and
(ii), the Common Stock or other Equity Securities of other Persons that PubCo
is obligated to include in such Underwritten Offering pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with such Persons and that can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

(e)Withdrawal. Any of the Demanding Holders initiating an Underwritten Shelf
Takedown shall have the right to withdraw from such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown for any or no reason whatsoever upon written notification (a
"Withdrawal Notice") to PubCo and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if any) of
such Demanding Holder\'s intention to withdraw from such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown, prior to the public announcement of the Underwritten Shelf Takedown
by PubCo; provided that a Special Holder not so withdrawing may elect to have
PubCo continue an Underwritten Shelf Takedown if the Minimum Takedown
Threshold would still be satisfied or if the Underwritten Shelf Takedown
would be made with respect to all of the Registrable Securities of such
Special Holder. Following the receipt of any Withdrawal Notice, PubCo shall
promptly forward such Withdrawal Notice to any other Special Holders that had
elected to participate in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Investor Rights Agreement, PubCo
shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred in connection
with the Underwritten Shelf Takedown prior to delivery of a Withdrawal Notice
under this Section 3.1(e).

 

(f)Long-Form Demands. Upon the expiration of the Lock-Up Period applicable to
such Person, and during such times as no Shelf is effective, each Special
Holder may demand that PubCo file a Registration Statement on Form S-1 for the
purpose of conducting an Underwritten Offering of any or all of such Special
Holder\'s Registrable Securities. PubCo shall file such Registration
Statement within 30 days of receipt of such demand and use its reasonable best
efforts to cause the same to be declared effective within 60 days of filing.
The provisions of Section 3.1(c), Section 3.1(d) and Section 3.1(e) shall
apply to this Section 3.1(f) as if a demand under this Section 3.1(f) were an
Underwritten Shelf Takedown, provided that in order to withdraw a demand under
this Section 3.1(f), such withdrawal must be received by PubCo prior to PubCo
having publicly filed a Registration Statement pursuant to this Section
3.1(f).

Section 3.2 Piggyback Registration.

(a)Piggyback Rights. If PubCo or any Special Holder proposes to conduct a
registered offering of, or if PubCo proposes to file a Registration Statement
under the Securities Act with respect to an offering of, Equity Securities of
PubCo or securities or other obligations

 

18

 

exercisable or exchangeable for or convertible into Equity Securities of
PubCo, for its own account or for the account of stockholders of PubCo (or by
PubCo and by the stockholders of PubCo including an Underwritten Shelf
Takedown pursuant to Section 3.1), other than a Registration Statement (or any
registered offering with respect thereto) (i) filed in connection with any
employee stock option or other benefit plan, (ii) for an exchange offer or
offering of securities solely to PubCo\'s existing stockholders, (iii) for an
offering of debt that is convertible into equity securities of PubCo, or (iv)
for a dividend reinvestment plan, then PubCo shall give written notice of
such proposed offering to all Special Holders as soon as practicable but not
less than four (4) calendar days before the anticipated filing date of such
Registration Statement or, in the case of an underwritten offering pursuant
to a Shelf Registration, the launch date of such offering, which notice shall
(A) describe the amount and type of securities to be included in such
offering, the intended method(s) of distribution, and the name of the proposed
managing Underwriter or Underwriters, if any and if known, in such offering,
and (B) offer to all of the Special Holders the opportunity to include in such
registered offering such number of Registrable Securities as such Special
Holders may request in writing within three (3) calendar day after receipt of
such written notice (such registered offering, a "Piggyback Registration");
provided that each Special Holder agrees that the fact that such a notice has
been delivered shall constitute Confidential Information subject to Section
2.3. PubCo shall cause such Registrable Securities to be included in such
Piggyback Registration and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
managing Underwriter or Underwriters of a proposed Underwritten Offering to
permit the Registrable Securities requested by the Special Holders pursuant to
this Section 3.2(a) to be included in a Piggyback Registration on the same
terms and conditions as any similar securities of PubCo included in such
registered offering and to permit the sale or other disposition of such
Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method(s) of
distribution thereof. The inclusion of any Special Holder\'s Registrable
Securities in a Piggyback Registration shall be subject to such Special
Holder\'s agreement to abide by the terms of Section 3.6 below.

 

(b)Reduction of Piggyback Registration. If the managing Underwriter or
Underwriters in an Underwritten Offering that is to be a Piggyback
Registration (other than an Underwritten Shelf Takedown), in good faith,
advises PubCo and the Special Holders participating in the Piggyback
Registration in writing that the dollar amount or number of shares of Common
Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo desires to sell, taken together
with (i) the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, as to which
Registration or a registered offering has been demanded pursuant to separate
written contractual arrangements with Persons other than the Special Holders
hereunder and (ii) the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, as to
which registration has been requested pursuant to Section 3.2, exceeds the
Maximum Number of Securities, then:

(i)If the Registration is initiated and undertaken for PubCo\'s account, PubCo
shall include in any such Registration (A) first, the Common Stock or other
Equity Securities that PubCo desires to sell, which can be sold without
exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause
(A), the Registrable Securities of Special Holders exercising their rights to
register their Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.2(a) (pro rata
based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Special
Holder has requested be included in such Registration), which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; and

19

 

 

(C)third, to the extent that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been
reached under the foregoing clauses (A) and (B), the Common Stock or other
Equity Securities, if any, as to which Registration has been requested
pursuant to written contractual piggyback registration rights of
other stockholders of PubCo, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum
Number of Securities; or

(ii)If the Registration is pursuant to a request by Persons other than the
Special Holders, then PubCo shall include in any such Registration (A) first,
the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, of such requesting
Persons, other than the Special Holders, which can be sold without exceeding
the Maximum Number of Securities; (B) second, to the extent that the
Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clause
(A), the Registrable Securities of Special Holders exercising their rights to
register their Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.2(a) (pro rata
based on the respective number of Registrable Securities that each Special
Holder has requested be included in such Registration) which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities; (C) third, to the extent
that the Maximum Number of Securities has not been reached under the foregoing
clauses (A) and (B), the Common Stock or other Equity Securities that PubCo
desires to sell, which can be sold without exceeding the Maximum Number of
Securities; and (D) fourth, to the extent that the Maximum Number of
Securities has not been reached under the foregoing clauses (A), (B) and (C),
the Common Stock or other Equity Securities, if any, for the account of other
Persons that PubCo is obligated to register pursuant to separate written
contractual piggyback registration rights of such Persons, which can be sold
without exceeding the Maximum Number of Securities.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 3.2(b), in the event
a Demanding Holder has submitted notice for a bona fide Underwritten Shelf
Takedown and all sales pursuant to such Underwritten Shelf Takedown pursuant
to Section 3.1 have not been effected in accordance with the applicable plan
of distribution or submitted a Withdrawal Notice prior to such time that
PubCo has given written notice of a Piggyback Registration to all Special
Holders pursuant to Section 3.2, then any reduction in the number of
Registrable Securities to be offered in such offering shall be determined in
accordance with Section 3.1(d), instead of this Section 3.2(b).

 

(c)Piggyback Registration Withdrawal. Any Special Holder shall have the right
to withdraw from a Piggyback Registration for any or no reason whatsoever
upon written notification to PubCo and the Underwriter or Underwriters (if
any) of such Special Holder\'s intention to withdraw from such Piggyback
Registration prior to the effectiveness of the Registration Statement filed
with the SEC with respect to such Piggyback Registration or, in the case of a
Piggyback Registration pursuant to a Shelf Registration, the filing of the
applicable "red herring" prospectus or prospectus supplement with respect to
such Piggyback Registration used for marketing such transaction. PubCo
(whether on its own good faith determination or as the result of a request for
withdrawal by Persons pursuant to separate written contractual obligations)
may withdraw a Registration Statement filed with the SEC in connection with a
Piggyback Registration (which, in no circumstance, shall include the Shelf) at
any time prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Investor Rights
Agreement, PubCo shall be responsible for the Registration Expenses incurred
in connection with the Piggyback Registration prior to its withdrawal under
this Section 3.2(c).

 

20

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, this Section 3.2 shall not
apply (a) for any Holder or Party, prior to the expiration of the Lock-Up
Period in respect of such Holder or Party or (b) to any Shelf Take-
Down irrespective of whether such Shelf Take-Down is an Underwritten Shelf
Take-Down or not an Underwritten Shelf Take-Down.

 

Section 3.3 Restriction on Transfer. In connection with any Underwritten
Offering of Equity Securities of PubCo, each Holder that holds more than five
percent (5%) of the issued and outstanding Common Stock (after giving effect
to the exchange of all outstanding RSI Units for Class A Common Stock),
agrees that it shall not Transfer any Common Stock (other than those included
in such offering pursuant to this Investor Rights Agreement), without the
prior written consent of PubCo, during the seven (7) calendar days prior (to
the extent notice of such Underwritten Offering has been provided) to and the
90-day period beginning on the date of pricing of such offering, except in the
event the Underwriter managing the offering otherwise agrees by
written consent, and further agrees to execute a customary lock-up agreement
in favor of the Underwriters to such effect (in each case on substantially the
same terms and conditions as all such Holders). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
a Holder shall not be subject to this Section 3.3 with respect to an
Underwritten Offering unless each Holder that holds at least five percent (5%)
of the issued and outstanding Common Stock (after giving effect to the
exchange of all outstanding RSI Units) and each of PubCo\'s directors and
executive officers have executed a lock-up on terms at least as restrictive
with respect to such Underwritten Offering as requested of the Holders.

Section 3.4 General Procedures. In connection with effecting any Registration
and/or Shelf Takedown, subject to applicable Law and any regulations
promulgated by any securities exchange on which PubCo\'s Equity Securities are
then listed, each as interpreted by PubCo with the advice of its counsel,
PubCo shall use its reasonable best efforts (except as set forth in clause

 

(d)below)  to effect such Registration to permit the sale of the Registrable
Securities included in such Registration in accordance with the intended plan
of distribution thereof, and pursuant thereto PubCo shall, as expeditiously as
possible:

 

(a)prepare and file with the SEC as soon as practicable a Registration
Statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such Registration Statement to become effective and
remain effective until all Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement have been sold;

 

(b)prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective amendments
to the Registration Statement, and such supplements to the Prospectus, as may
be reasonably requested by any Holder or as may be required by the rules,
regulations or instructions applicable to the registration form used by PubCo
or by the Securities Act or rules and regulations thereunder to keep the
Registration Statement effective until all Registrable Securities covered by
such Registration Statement are sold in accordance with the intended plan of
distribution set forth in such Registration Statement or supplement to the
Prospectus;

 

(c)prior to filing a Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, furnish without charge to the Underwriters, if any, and
the Special Holders of Registrable Securities included in such Registration,
and such Special Holders\' legal counsel, if any, copies of such Registration
Statement as proposed to be filed, each amendment and supplement to such
Registration Statement (in each case including all exhibits thereto and

21

 

documents incorporated by reference therein), the Prospectus included in such
Registration Statement (including each preliminary Prospectus), and such other
documents as the Underwriters or the Special Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration or the legal counsel for any such Special
Holders, if any, may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition
of the Registrable Securities owned by such Special Holders;

 

(d)prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, use its best
efforts to

 

(i)register  or qualify the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "blue sky" Laws of such
jurisdictions in the United States as the Holders of Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement (in light of their intended plan of
distribution) may request (or provide evidence satisfactory to such Holders
that the Registrable Securities are exempt from such registration or
qualification) and (ii) take such action necessary to cause such Registrable
Securities covered by the Registration Statement to be registered with or
approved by such other Governmental Entities as may be necessary by virtue of
the business and operations of PubCo and do any and all other acts and things
that may be necessary or advisable to enable the Holders of Registrable
Securities included in such Registration Statement to consummate the
disposition of such Registrable Securities in such jurisdictions; provided,
however, that PubCo shall not be required to qualify generally to do
business in any jurisdiction where it would not otherwise be required to
qualify or take any action to which it would be subject to general service of
process or taxation in any such jurisdiction where it is not then otherwise so
subject;

 

(e)cause  all such Registrable Securities to be listed on each securities
exchange or automated quotation system on which similar securities issued by
PubCo are then listed;

 

(f)provide  a transfer agent or warrant agent, as applicable, and registrar
for all such Registrable Securities no later than the effective date of such
Registration Statement;

 

(g)advise each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by a Registration
Statement, promptly after it shall receive notice or obtain knowledge thereof,
of the issuance of any stop order by the SEC suspending the effectiveness of
such Registration Statement or the initiation or threatening of any proceeding
for such purpose and promptly use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the
issuance of any stop order or to obtain its withdrawal if such stop order
should be issued;

 

(h)at least three (3) calendar days prior to the filing of any Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any amendment or supplement to such Registration
Statement or Prospectus or any document that is to be incorporated by
reference into such Registration Statement or Prospectus furnish a draft
thereof to each Special Holder of Registrable Securities included in such
Registration Statement, or its counsel, if any (excluding any
exhibits thereto and any filing made under the Exchange Act that is to be
incorporated by reference therein);

 

(i)notify the Holders at any time when a Prospectus relating to such
Registration Statement is required to be delivered under the Securities Act,
of the happening of any event as a result of which the Prospectus included in
such Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes a Misstatement, and
then to correct such Misstatement as set forth in Section 3.7;

22

 

 

(j)permit Representatives of the Special Holders, the Underwriters, if any,
and any attorney, consultant or accountant retained by such Special Holders or
Underwriter to participate, at each such Person\'s own expense except to the
extent such expenses constitute Registration Expenses, in the preparation of
the Registration Statement, and cause PubCo\'s officers, directors and
employees to supply all information reasonably requested by any such
Representative, Underwriter, attorney, consultant or accountant in connection
with the Registration; provided, however, that such Persons agree
to confidentiality arrangements reasonably satisfactory to PubCo, prior to
the release or disclosure of any such information;

 

(k)obtain a "cold comfort" letter, and a bring-down thereof, from PubCo\'s
independent registered public accountants in the event of an Underwritten
Offering which the participating Special Holders may rely on, in customary
form and covering such matters of the type customarily covered by "cold
comfort" letters as the managing Underwriter may reasonably request, and
reasonably satisfactory to a majority-in-interest of the participating
Special Holders;

 

(l)on the date the Registrable Securities are delivered for sale pursuant to
such Registration, obtain an opinion and negative assurances letter, dated
such date, of counsel representing PubCo for the purposes of such
Registration, addressed to the Special Holders, the placement agent or sales
agent, if any, and the Underwriters, if any, covering such legal matters with
respect to the Registration in respect of which such opinion is being given
as the Special Holders, placement agent, sales agent, or Underwriter may
reasonably request and as are customarily included in such opinions and
negative assurance letters, and reasonably satisfactory to the participating
Special Holders;

(m)in the event of any Underwritten Offering, enter into and perform its
obligations under an underwriting agreement, in usual and customary form, with
the managing Underwriter of such offering;

(n)make available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable,
an earnings statement covering the period of at least 12 months beginning
within three months after the effective date of the Registration Statement
which satisfies the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule
158 thereunder (or any successor rule promulgated thereafter by the SEC);

 

(o)if an Underwritten Offering involves Registrable Securities with a total
offering price (including piggyback securities and before deduction of
underwriting discounts) reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate, $35
million, use its reasonable best efforts to make available senior executives
of PubCo to participate in customary "road show" presentations that may be
reasonably requested by the Underwriter in such Underwritten Offering; and

(p)otherwise, in good faith, cooperate reasonably with, and take such
customary actions as may reasonably be requested, by the Holders, in
connection with such Registration.

 

Section 3.5 Registration Expenses. The Registration Expenses of all
Registrations shall be borne by PubCo. It is acknowledged by the Holders that
the Holders selling any Registrable Securities in an offering shall bear all
incremental selling expenses relating to the sale of

23

 

Registrable Securities (including all reasonable fees and expenses of any
legal counsel representing such Holders (to the extent such counsel is not
also representing PubCo, as determined in accordance with clause (f) of the
definition of "Registration Expenses")), such as Underwriters\' commissions
and discounts, brokerage fees, Underwriter marketing costs, in each case pro
rata based on the number of Registrable Securities that such Holders have sold
in such Registration.

 

Section 3.6 Requirements for Participating in Underwritten Offerings.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Investor Rights
Agreement, if any Holder does not provide PubCo with its requested Holder
Information, PubCo may exclude such Holder\'s Registrable Securities from the
applicable Registration Statement or Prospectus if PubCo determines, based on
the advice of counsel, that such information is necessary to effect the
registration and such Holder continues thereafter to withhold
such information. No Person may participate in any Underwritten Offering of
Equity Securities of PubCo pursuant to a Registration under this Investor
Rights Agreement unless such Person (a) agrees to sell such Person\'s
Registrable Securities on the basis provided in any underwriting and other
arrangements approved by PubCo in the case of an Underwritten Offering
initiated by PubCo, and approved by the Demanding Holders in the case of an
Underwritten Offering initiated by the Demanding Holders and (b) completes
and executes all customary questionnaires, powers of attorney, custody
agreements, indemnities, lock-up agreements, underwriting agreements and other
customary documents as may be reasonably required under the terms of
such underwriting arrangements. Subject to the minimum thresholds set forth
in Section 3.1(c) and 3.4(o), the exclusion of a Holder\'s Registrable
Securities as a result of this Section 3.6 shall not affect the registration
of the other Registrable Securities to be included in such Registration.

 

Section 3.7 Suspension of Sales; Adverse Disclosure. Upon receipt of written
notice from PubCo that a Registration Statement or Prospectus contains a
Misstatement, each of the Holders shall forthwith discontinue disposition of
Registrable Securities until it has received copies of a supplemented or
amended Prospectus correcting the Misstatement (and PubCo hereby covenants to
prepare and file such supplement or amendment as soon as practicable after
giving such notice), or until it is advised in writing by PubCo that the use
of the Prospectus may be resumed. If the filing, initial effectiveness or
continued use of a Registration Statement in respect of any Registration at
any time would require PubCo to make an Adverse Disclosure or would require
the inclusion in such Registration Statement of financial statements that are
unavailable to PubCo for reasons beyond PubCo\'s control, PubCo may, upon
giving prompt written notice of such action to the Holders, delay the filing
or initial effectiveness of, or suspend use of, such Registration Statement
for the shortest period of time, but in no event more than 90 days in any
12-month period, determined in good faith by PubCo to be necessary for such
purpose. In the event PubCo exercises its rights under the preceding
sentence, the Holders agree to suspend, immediately upon their receipt of the
notice referred to above, their use of the Prospectus relating to such
Registration in connection with any sale or offer to sell Registrable
Securities. PubCo shall immediately notify the Holders of the expiration of
any period during which it exercised its rights under this Section 3.7.

 

Section 3.8 Reporting Obligations. As long as any Holder shall own
Registrable Securities, PubCo, at all times while it shall be a reporting
company under the Exchange Act, covenants to file timely (or obtain extensions
in respect thereof and file within the applicable grace

24

 

period) all reports required to be filed by PubCo after the Effective Date
pursuant to Sections 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and to promptly
furnish the Holders with true and complete copies of all such
filings; provided that any documents publicly filed or furnished with the SEC
pursuant to the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis and Retrieval System shall
be deemed to have been furnished to the Holders pursuant to this Section 3.8.

 

Section 3.9 Other Obligations. In connection with a Transfer of Registrable
Securities exempt from Section 5 of the Securities Act or through any broker-
dealer transactions described in the plan of distribution set forth within the
Prospectus and pursuant to the Registration Statement of which such
Prospectus forms a part, PubCo shall, subject to applicable Law, as
interpreted by PubCo with the advice of counsel, and the receipt of any
customary documentation required from the applicable Holders in connection
therewith, (a) promptly instruct its transfer agent to remove any restrictive
legends applicable to the Registrable Securities being Transferred and (b)
cause its legal counsel to deliver the necessary legal opinions, if any, to
the transfer agent in connection with the instruction under clause (a). In
addition, PubCo shall cooperate reasonably with, and take such customary
actions as may reasonably be requested by the Holders, in connection with the
aforementioned Transfers; provided, however, that PubCo shall have no
obligation to participate in any "road shows" or assist with the preparation
of any offering memoranda or related documentation with respect to any
Transfer of Registrable Securities in any transaction that does not constitute
an Underwritten Offering.

 

Section 3.10 Indemnification and Contribution.

 

(a)PubCo agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, its officers,
managers, directors, trustees, equityholders, beneficiaries, affiliates,
agents and Representatives and each Person who controls such Holder (within
the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages,
losses, liabilities and expenses (including attorneys\' fees) (or actions in
respect thereto) caused by, resulting from, arising out of or based upon (i)
any untrue or alleged untrue statement of material fact contained in any
Registration Statement, Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or similar
document incident to any Registration, qualification, compliance or sale
effected pursuant to this Article III or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or
(ii) any violation or alleged violation by PubCo of the Securities Act or any
other similar federal or state securities Laws, and will reimburse, as
incurred, each such Holder, its officers, managers, directors, trustees,
equityholders, beneficiaries, affiliates, agents and Representatives and each
Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of the Securities Act) for
any legal and any other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with
investigating or defending any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action;
provided that, PubCo will not be liable in any such case to the extent that
any such claim, damage, loss, liability or expense are caused by or arises out
of or is based on any untrue statement or omission made in reliance and in
conformity with written information furnished to PubCo by or on behalf of
such Holder expressly for use therein. PubCo shall indemnify the
Underwriters, their officers and directors and each Person who controls such
Underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the same extent as
provided in the foregoing sentence with respect to the indemnification of
each Holder.

25

 

(b)In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder of
Registrable Securities is participating, such Holder shall furnish to PubCo
in writing such information and affidavits as PubCo reasonably requests for
use in connection with any such Registration Statement or Prospectus
(the "Holder Information") and, to the extent permitted by Law, such Holder
shall indemnify and hold harmless PubCo, its directors, officers,
employees, equityholders, affiliates and agents and each Person who controls
PubCo (within the meaning of the Securities Act) against any losses, claims,
damages, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees) (or
actions in respect thereof) arising out of, resulting from or based on any
untrue statement of material fact contained in the Registration Statement,
Prospectus or preliminary Prospectus or similar document or any amendment
thereof or supplement thereto, or any omission of a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
but only to the extent that such untrue statement or omission is contained in
any information or affidavit so furnished in writing by or on behalf of such
Holder expressly for use therein; provided, however, that the obligation to
indemnify shall be several, not joint and several, among such Holders
of Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such Holder of
Registrable Securities shall be in proportion to and limited to the net
proceeds received by such Holder from the sale of Registrable Securities
pursuant to such Registration Statement. The Holders of Registrable
Securities shall indemnify the Underwriters, their officers, directors and
each Person who controls such Underwriters (within the meaning of the
Securities Act) to the same extent as provided in the foregoing sentence with
respect to indemnification of PubCo.

 

(c)Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Section 3.10 shall (i)
give prompt written notice, after such Person has actual knowledge thereof,
to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which such Person seeks
indemnification (provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not
impair any Person\'s right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such
failure has not materially prejudiced the indemnifying party in the defense of
any such claim or any such litigation) and (ii) permit such indemnifying party
to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to
the indemnified party (not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed)
and the indemnified party may participate in such defense at the indemnifying
party\'s expense if representation of such indemnified party would be
inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between such
indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in such
proceeding. An indemnifying party, in the defense of any such claim or
litigation, without the consent of each indemnified party, may only consent
to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement that (i) includes as
a term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff therein to such
indemnified party of an unconditional release from all liability with respect
to such claim or litigation and (ii) does not include any recovery (including
any statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a failure to act
by or on behalf of such indemnified party) other than monetary damages, and
provided, that any sums payable in connection with such settlement are paid in
full by the indemnifying party.

 

(d)The indemnification provided under this Investor Rights Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, manager, director,
Representative or controlling Person of such indemnified party and shall
survive the Transfer of securities.

 

(e)If the indemnification provided in this Section 3.10 from the indemnifying
party is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses,

26

 

claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to herein, then the
indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying the indemnified party, shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by the indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying party and
the indemnified party, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of the indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in
question, including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
or omission or alleged omission to state a material fact, was made by, or
relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying party or indemnified
party, and the indemnifying party\'s and indemnified party\'s relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action; provided, however, that the liability of any Holder under this Section
3.10(e) shall be limited to the amount of the net proceeds received by such
Holder in such offering giving rise to such liability. The amount paid or
payable by a Party as a result of the losses or other liabilities referred to
above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in
Sections 3.10(a), 3.10(b) and 3.10(c), any legal or other fees, charges or
expenses reasonably incurred by such Party in connection with any
investigation or proceeding. The Parties agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 3.1(e) were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation, which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in this Section 3.1(e). No
Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution pursuant to
this Section 3.1(e) from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

 

Section 3.11 Other Registration Rights. Other than the registration rights
set forth in the Original RRA and in the Subscription Agreements, PubCo
represents and warrants that no Person, other than a Holder of Registrable
Securities pursuant to this Investor Rights Agreement, has any right to
require PubCo to register any securities of PubCo for sale or to include such
securities of PubCo in any Registration Statement filed by PubCo for the sale
of securities for its own account or for the account of any other Person.
Further, each of PubCo, the Sponsor, the DMY Independent Directors and the
Sponsor Principals represents and warrants that this Investor Rights Agreement
supersedes any other registration rights agreement or agreement (including the
Original RRA), other than the Subscription Agreements.

Section 3.12 Rule 144. With a view to making available to the Holders the
benefits of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, PubCo covenants
that it will (a) make available at all times information necessary to comply
with Rule 144, if such Rule is available with respect to resales of the
Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, and (b) take such further
action as the Holders may reasonably request, all to the extent required from
time to time to enable them to sell Registrable Securities without
registration under the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions
provided by Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act (if available
with respect to resales of the Registrable Securities), as such rule may be
amended from time to time. Upon the request of any Holder, PubCo will deliver
to such Holder a written statement as to whether PubCo has complied with such
information requirements, and, if not, the specific reasons for non-
compliance.

27

 

Section 3.13 Term. Article III shall terminate with respect to any Holder on
the date that such Holder no longer holds any Registrable Securities. The
provisions of Section 3.10 shall survive any such termination with respect to
such Holder.

 

Section 3.14 Holder Information. Each Holder agrees, if requested in writing
by PubCo, to represent to PubCo the total number of Registrable Securities
held by such Holder in order for PubCo to make determinations under this
Investor Rights Agreement, including for purposes of Section 3.12. Other than
the Sellers and the Founder Holders, a Party who does not hold Registrable
Securities as of the Closing Date and who acquires Registrable Securities
after the Closing Date will not be a "Holder" until such Party gives PubCo a
representation in writing of the number of Registrable Securities it holds.

 

Section 3.15 Termination of Original RRA. Upon the Closing, PubCo, the
Sponsor, the Sponsor Principals and the DMY Independent Directors hereby agree
that the Original RRA and all of the respective rights and obligations of the
parties thereunder are hereby terminated in their entirety and shall be of no
further force or effect.

Section 3.16 Distributions; Direct Ownership.

 

(a)In the event that the Sponsor distributes all of its Registrable Securities
to its members, the members of the Sponsor shall be treated as the Sponsor
under this Investor Rights Agreement; provided that such members of the
Sponsor, taken as a whole, shall not be entitled to rights in excess of those
conferred on the Sponsor, as if the Sponsor remained a single entity party to
this Investor Rights Agreement.

(b)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event
that the members of the Sponsor hold any Registrable Securities directly, the
members of the Sponsor shall be treated as the Sponsor under this Investor
Rights Agreement; provided that the members of the Sponsor, taken as a whole,
shall not be entitled to rights in excess of those conferred on the Sponsor,
as if the Sponsor remained a single entity party to this Investor Rights
Agreement.

 

(c)In the event that a Seller distributes all of its Registrable Securities to
its members, such distributees shall be treated as a Seller under this
Investor Rights Agreement; provided that such distributees, taken as a whole,
shall not be entitled to rights in excess of those conferred on a Seller, as
if such Seller remained a single party to this Investor Rights Agreement.

(d)Notwithstanding the foregoing, no distribution for purposes of this Section

 

3.16may occur prior to the conclusion of any Lock-Up Period applicable to the
Sponsor or such Seller, as applicable.

 

Section 3.17 Adjustments. If there are any changes in the Common Stock as a
result of stock split, stock dividend, combination or reclassification, or
through merger, consolidation, recapitalization or other similar event,
appropriate adjustment shall be made in the provisions of this Investor
Rights Agreement, as may be required, so that the rights, privileges, duties
and obligations under this Investor Rights Agreement shall continue with
respect to the Common Stock as so changed.

and any other agreements, certificates, instruments and documents delivered
pursuant to this Investor Rights Agreement may be executed and delivered in
one or more counterparts and by fax, email or other electronic transmission,

Section 5.7 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial; Jurisdiction. The Law of the
State of Delaware shall govern (a) all Proceedings, claims or matters related
to or arising from this Investor Rights Agreement (including any tort or non-
contractual claims) and (b) any questions concerning the construction,
interpretation, validity and enforceability of this Investor Rights Agreement,
and the performance of the obligations imposed by this Investor Rights
Agreement, in each case without giving effect to any choice of Law
or conflict of Law rules or provisions (whether of the State of Delaware or
any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Law of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. EACH PARTY TO THIS INVESTOR
RIGHTS AGREEMENT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES
(WHETHER ARISING IN CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED
WITH, RELATED OR INCIDENTAL TO THIS INVESTOR

35

 

RIGHTS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS INVESTOR RIGHTS
AGREEMENT AND/OR THE RELATIONSHIPS ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES UNDER THIS
INVESTOR RIGHTS AGREEMENT. THE PARTIES FURTHER WARRANT AND REPRESENT THAT EACH
HAS REVIEWED THIS WAIVER WITH SUCH PARTY\'S LEGAL COUNSEL, AND THAT EACH
KNOWINGLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES SUCH PARTY\'S JURY TRIAL RIGHTS FOLLOWING
CONSULTATION WITH LEGAL COUNSEL. Each of the Parties submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of first, the Chancery Court of the State of Delaware or if such
court declines jurisdiction, then to the Federal District Court for the
District of Delaware, in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Investor Rights Agreement, agrees that all claims in respect of the Proceeding
shall be heard and determined in any such court and agrees not to bring any
Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Investor Rights Agreement in any
other courts. Nothing in this Section 5.7, however, shall affect the right of
any Party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law or at
equity. Each Party agrees that a final judgment in any Proceeding so brought
shall be conclusive and may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any
other manner provided by Law or at equity.

Section 5.8 Specific Performance. Each Party hereby agrees and acknowledges
that it will be impossible to measure in money the damages that would be
suffered if the Parties fail to comply with any of the obligations imposed on
them by this Investor Rights Agreement and that, in the event of any such
failure, an aggrieved Party will be irreparably damaged and will not have an
adequate remedy at Law. Any such Party shall, therefore, be entitled (in
addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled at Law or in
equity) to seek injunctive relief, including specific performance, to enforce
such obligations, without the posting of any bond, and if any Proceeding
should be brought in equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Investor
Rights Agreement, none of the Parties shall raise the defense that there is an
adequate remedy at Law.

 

Section 5.9 Subsequent Acquisition of Shares. Any Equity Securities of PubCo
or Operating Company acquired subsequent to the Effective Date by a Holder
shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Investor Rights Agreement
and such shares shall be considered to be "Registrable Securities" as such
term is used in this Investor Rights Agreement.

 

Section 5.10 Legends. Each of the Holders acknowledges that (i) no Transfer,
hypothecation or assignment of any Registrable Securities Beneficially Owned
by such Holder may be made except in compliance with applicable federal and
state securities laws and (ii) PubCo shall (x) place customary restrictive
legends on the certificates or book entries representing the Registrable
Securities subject to this Investor Rights Agreement and (y) remove such
restrictive legends at the time the applicable Transfer and
other restrictions contemplated thereby are no longer applicable to the
Registrable Securities represented by such certificates or book entries.

 

Section 5.11 No Third Party Liabilities. This Investor Rights Agreement may
only be enforced against the named parties hereto. All claims or causes of
action (whether in contract or tort) that may be based upon, arise out of or
relate to any of this Investor Rights Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Investor Rights Agreement (including any
representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Investor Rights
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Investor Rights Agreement),
may be made only against the Persons that are expressly identified as parties
hereto, as applicable; and no past, present or future direct or indirect
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, partner,
stockholder, Affiliate,

36

 

portfolio company in which any such Party or any of its investment fund
Affiliates have made a debt or equity investment (and vice versa), agent,
attorney or representative of any Party hereto (including any Person
negotiating or executing this Investor Rights Agreement on behalf of a
Party hereto), unless a Party to this Investor Rights Agreement, shall have
any liability or obligation with respect to this Investor Rights Agreement or
with respect any claim or cause of action (whether in contract or tort) that
may arise out of or relate to this Investor Rights Agreement, or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Investor Rights Agreement
(including a representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Investor Rights Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Investor
Rights Agreement).

Section 5.12 Indemnification; Exculpation.

 

(a)PubCo will, and PubCo will cause each of its subsidiaries to, jointly and
severally indemnify, exonerate and hold the Holders and each of their
respective direct and indirect partners, equityholders, members, managers,
Affiliates, directors, officers, shareholders, fiduciaries, controlling
Persons, employees, representatives and agents and each of the partners,
equityholders, members, Affiliates, directors, officers,
fiduciaries, managers, controlling Persons, employees and agents of each of
the foregoing (collectively, the "Holder Indemnitees") free and harmless from
and against any and all actions, causes of action, suits, claims,
liabilities, losses, damages and costs and out-of-pocket expenses in
connection therewith (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses)
incurred by the Holder Indemnitees or any of them on or after the date of
this Investor Rights Agreement (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities"),
arising out of any third party action, cause of action, suit, litigation,
investigation, inquiry, arbitration or claim (each, an "Action") arising
directly or indirectly out of, or in any way relating to, any Holder\'s or
its Affiliates\' ownership of Equity Securities of PubCo or control or
ability to influence PubCo or any of its subsidiaries (other than any such
Indemnified Liabilities (x) to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities arise
out of any breach by such Holder Indemnitee of this Investor Rights
Agreement, the BCA (to the extent such Holder Indemnitee is a party thereto),
any agreement referenced or contemplated thereby to which such Holder
Indemnitee is a party, or any other agreement between such Holder Indemnitee
or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, and PubCo or any of its
subsidiaries, on the other hand, in each case by such Holder Indemnitee or its
Affiliates or other related Persons, or the breach of any fiduciary or other
duty or obligation (whether arising by Law or contract) of such Holder
Indemnitee to (A) its direct or indirect equity holders, creditors or
Affiliates or (B) PubCo, any of its subsidiaries or their respective equity
holders, (y) to the extent such control or the ability to control PubCo or
any of its subsidiaries derives from such Holder\'s or its Affiliates\'
capacity as an officer or director of PubCo or any of its subsidiaries, or (z)
to the extent such Indemnified Liabilities are directly caused by such
Person\'s gross negligence or willful misconduct); provided, however, that
if and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unavailable or
unenforceable for any reason, PubCo will, and will cause its subsidiaries to,
make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of each of the
Indemnified Liabilities that is permissible under applicable law. For the
purposes of this Section 5.12, none of the circumstances described in the
limitations contained in the proviso in the immediately preceding sentence
shall be deemed to apply absent a final non-appealable judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction to such effect, in which case to the extent any such
limitation is so determined to apply to any Holder Indemnitee as to any
previously advanced indemnity payments made by PubCo or any of its
subsidiaries, then such payments shall be

37

 

 

promptly repaid by such Holder Indemnitee to PubCo and its subsidiaries. The
rights of any Holder Indemnitee to indemnification hereunder will be
in addition to any other rights any such Person may have under any other
agreement or instrument to which such Holder Indemnitee is or becomes a party
or is or otherwise becomes a beneficiary or under law or regulation or under
the organizational or governing documents of PubCo or its subsidiaries.

 

(b)PubCo will, and will cause each of its subsidiaries to, jointly and
severally, reimburse any Holder Indemnitee for all reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses and any other
litigation-related expenses) as they are incurred by such Holder Indemnitee in
connection with investigating, preparing, pursuing, defending or assisting in
the defense of any Action for which the Holder Indemnitee would be entitled
to indemnification under the terms of this Section 5.12, or any action or
proceeding arising therefrom. PubCo or its subsidiaries, in the defense
of any Action for which a Holder Indemnitee would be entitled to
indemnification under the terms of this Section 5.12, may, without the consent
of such Holder Indemnitee, consent to entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement if and only if it (i) includes as a term thereof the giving by the
claimant or plaintiff therein to such Holder Indemnitee of an unconditional
release from all liability with respect to such Action, (ii) does not impose
any limitations (equitable or otherwise) on such Holder Indemnitee, and (iii)
does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault, culpability or a
failure to act by or on behalf of such Holder Indemnitee, and provided, that
the only penalty imposed in connection with such settlement is a monetary
payment that will be paid in full by PubCo or its subsidiaries.

 

(c)PubCo acknowledges and agrees that PubCo shall, and to the extent
applicable shall cause its subsidiaries to, be fully and primarily responsible
for the payment to any Holder Indemnitee in respect of Indemnified
Liabilities in connection with any Jointly Indemnifiable Claims (as defined
below), pursuant to and in accordance with (as applicable) the terms of (i)
the Delaware General Corporation Law and the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws, each as amended, (ii) any director indemnification agreement, (iii)
this Investor Rights Agreement, any other agreement between PubCo or any of
its subsidiaries and such Holder Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) pursuant to
which such Holder Indemnitee is indemnified, (iv) the laws of the
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of any subsidiary of PubCo
and/or (v) the certificate of incorporation, certificate of organization,
bylaws, partnership agreement, operating agreement, certificate of formation,
certificate of limited partnership or other organizational or governing
documents of any subsidiary of PubCo ((i) through (v) collectively, the
"Indemnification Sources"), irrespective of any right of recovery such Holder
Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) may have from any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit plan
or other enterprise (other than PubCo, any of its subsidiaries or the insurer
under and pursuant to an insurance policy of PubCo or any of its subsidiaries)
from whom such Holder Indemnitee may be entitled to indemnification with
respect to which, in whole or in part, PubCo or any of its subsidiaries may
also have an indemnification obligation (collectively, the "Indemnitee-
Related Entities"). Under no circumstance shall PubCo or any of its
subsidiaries be entitled to any right of subrogation or contribution by
the Indemnitee-Related Entities and no right of advancement or recovery any
Holder Indemnitee may have from the Indemnitee-Related Entities shall reduce
or otherwise alter the rights of such Holder Indemnitee or the obligations of
PubCo or any of its subsidiaries under the Indemnification Sources. In the
event that any of the Indemnitee-Related Entities shall make any payment to
any Holder Indemnitee in respect of

 

38

 

indemnification with respect to any Jointly Indemnifiable Claim, (x) PubCo
shall, and to the extent applicable shall cause its subsidiaries to, reimburse
the Indemnitee-Related Entity making such payment to the extent of such
payment promptly upon written demand from such Indemnitee-Related Entity, (y)
to the extent not previously and fully reimbursed by PubCo and/or any of its
subsidiaries pursuant to clause (x), the Indemnitee-Related Entity making such
payment shall be subrogated to the extent of the outstanding balance of
such payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Holder Indemnitee
against PubCo and/or any of its subsidiaries, as applicable, and (z) such
Holder Indemnitee shall execute all papers reasonably required and shall do
all things that may be reasonably necessary to secure such rights, including
the execution of such documents as may be necessary to enable the Indemnitee-
Related Entities effectively to bring suit to enforce such rights. Each of the
Parties agree that each of the Indemnitee-Related Entities shall be third-
party beneficiaries with respect to this Section 5.12(c), entitled to enforce
this Section 5.12(c) as though each such Indemnitee-Related Entity were a
party to this Investor Rights Agreement. PubCo shall cause each of its
subsidiaries to perform the terms and obligations of this Section 5.12(c) as
though each such subsidiary were a party to this Investor Rights Agreement.
For purposes of this Section 5.12(c), the term "Jointly Indemnifiable Claims"
shall be broadly construed and shall include, without limitation, any
Indemnified Liabilities for which any Holder Indemnitee shall be entitled to
indemnification from both (1) PubCo and/or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to
the Indemnification Sources, on the one hand, and (2) any Indemnitee-Related
Entity pursuant to any other agreement between any Indemnitee-Related Entity
and such Holder Indemnitee (or its Affiliates) pursuant to which such Holder
Indemnitee is indemnified, the laws of the jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization of any Indemnitee-Related Entity and/or the certificate of
incorporation, certificate of organization, bylaws, partnership agreement,
operating agreement, certificate of formation, certificate of limited
partnership or other organizational or governing documents of any Indemnitee-
Related Entity, on the other hand.

(d)In no event shall any Holder Indemnitee be liable to PubCo or any of its
subsidiaries for any act, alleged act, omission or alleged omission that does
not constitute willful misconduct or fraud of such Holder Indemnitee as
determined by a final, nonappealable determination of a court of competent
jurisdiction.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Investor Rights
Agreement, for purposes of this Section 5.12, the term Holder Indemnitees
shall not include any Holder or its any of its partners, equityholders,
members, Affiliates, directors, officers, fiduciaries, managers, controlling
Persons, employees and agents or any of the partners, equityholders, members,
Affiliates, directors, officers, fiduciaries, managers, controlling Persons,
employees and agents of any of the foregoing who is an officer or director of
PubCo or any of its subsidiaries in such capacity as officer or director. Such
officers and directors are or will be subject to separate indemnification in
such capacity through this Investor Rights Agreement and/or the certificate
of incorporation or organization, bylaws or limited partnership agreements and
other instruments of PubCo and its subsidiaries.

 

(f)The rights of any Holder Indemnitee to indemnification pursuant to this
Section 5.12 will be in addition to any other rights any such Person may have
under any other section of this Investor Rights Agreement or any other
agreement or instrument to which such Holder Indemnitee is or becomes a party
or is or otherwise becomes a beneficiary or under law or regulation or under
the certificate of limited partnership, limited partnership agreement,

39

 

certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or equivalent governing documents) of
PubCo or any of its subsidiaries.

Representative Appointment (this "Amendment and Agreement"), dated as
of July 27, 2020, is entered into by and among the Sponsor, the Company, the
Insiders, the Sellers\' Representative and the Target. Capitalized terms used
and not otherwise defined herein have the meanings set forth in the Original
Sponsor Letter.

WHEREAS, this Amendment and Agreement is being delivered in connection with

Amendment and Agreement) pursuant to which the Company will effectuate a
business combination with the Target, on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein;

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to Section 13 of the Original Sponsor Letter, the Original

WHEREAS, in order to induce the Company, the Target, the Sellers and the

Parties wish to amend the Original Sponsor Letter on the terms set forth
herein.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing recitals, which shall
constitute a part of this Amendment and Agreement, and the mutual promises
contained in this Amendment and Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
thereby, the Parties agree as follows:

 

1.Certain Amendments to the Original Sponsor Letter. The Original Sponsor
Letter is hereby amended as follows:

 

(a)The below shall be added as Section 21 immediately following the existing
Section 20:

"21. Waiver of Anti-Dilution Rights. Section 4.3(b)(i) of the Charter provides
that each share of Class B Common Stock of the Company, par value $0.0001 per
share (the "Class B Common Stock"), shall automatically convert into one share
of Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis (the "Initial Conversion
Ratio") automatically concurrently with or immediately following the closing
of the Business Combination, and Section 4.3(b)(ii) of the Charter
provides that the Initial Conversion Ratio shall be adjusted (the
"Adjustment") in the event that additional shares of Class A Common Stock or
equity-linked securities are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts
offered in the Company\'s initial public offering of securities and related to
or in connection with the closing of the initial Business Combination such
that the Sponsor and the Insiders shall continue to own 25% of the issued and
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock after giving effect to such

the Business Combination Agreement), the Sponsor and each Insider hereby
irrevocably relinquishes and waives any and all rights the Sponsor and each
Insider has or will have under Section 4.3(b)(ii) of the Charter to receive

held by him, her or it, as applicable, in connection with the Closing (as
defined in the Business Combination Agreement) as a result of any Adjustment,
and, as a result, the shares of Class B

 

Common Stock shall convert into shares of Class A Common Stock (or such
equivalent security) at Closing (as defined in the Business Combination
Agreement) on a one-for-one basis such that, as a result of such conversion,
all outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock shall collectively convert into
5,750,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, a portion of which shall be subject
to earnout in accordance with the Business Combination Agreement and a
portion of which shall be subject to forfeiture in accordance with the Founder
Holders Forfeiture Agreement (as defined in the Business Combination
Agreement). When used herein, "Business Combination Agreement" means that
certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of July 27, 2020, by and
among the Company, the Sponsor, Rush Street Interactive, LP, a Delaware
limited partnership (the "Target"), the sellers set forth on the signatures
pages thereto (collectively, the "Sellers"), and Rush Street Interactive GP,
LLC, in its capacity as the Sellers\' Representative thereunder (the
"Sellers\' Representative"), as the same may be amended modified, supplemented
or waived from time to time."

 

(b)Section 15 of the Original Sponsor Letter is hereby replaced in its
entirety with the following:

"Except as set forth in the last sentence of this Section 15, nothing in this
Letter Agreement shall be construed to confer upon, or give to, any person or
corporation other than the parties hereto any right, remedy or claim under or
by reason of this Letter Agreement or any covenant, condition, stipulation,
promise or agreement hereof. Except as set forth in the last sentence of this
Section 15, all covenants, conditions, stipulations, promises and agreements
contained in this Letter Agreement shall be for the sole and exclusive
benefit of the parties hereto and their successors, heirs, personal
representatives and assigns and permitted transferees. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, each of the Target and the
Sellers\' Representative is an express third party beneficiary of this Letter
Agreement and may directly enforce (including by an action for specific
performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief) each of the
provisions set forth in this Letter Agreement as though directly party hereto
and thereto; provided that, to the extent the Business Combination Agreement
is terminated for any reason, the Target and the Sellers\' Representative
shall no longer be a third party beneficiary of this Letter Agreement for any
purposes and shall have no right to directly enforce (including by an action
for specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief) any of
the provisions set forth in this Letter Agreement in any respects."

2.Enforcement Rights. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, but
without limiting the last sentence of Section 1(b) of this Amendment and
Agreement, the Sponsor and each Insider acknowledges and agrees that each of
the Target and the Sellers\' Representative may directly enforce (including
by an action for specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
relief) each of the provisions set forth in this Amendment and Agreement.

 

3.Founder Holders\' Representative.

 

(a)Each of Darla Anderson, Francesca Luthi, and Charles E. Wert (the "dMY
Directors") hereby appoints the Sponsor as agent and attorney in fact for and
on behalf of such dMY Director (the Sponsor, in such capacity, the "Founder
Holders\' Representative") to (i) interpret the terms and provisions of

July 27, 2020, by and among the Company, the Sponsor, Rush Street Interactive,

the signatures pages thereto (collectively, the "Sellers"), and Rush Street

Agreement"), and related provisions of

2

Section 2.8 of the Business Combination Agreement or any related provisions of
the Business Combination Agreement, (vii) administer, pay out, deduct, hold
back or redirect any funds (including any Earnout Shares or Earnout Company
Units), which may be payable or distributable to any dMY Directors pursuant to
the terms of Section 2.8 of the Business Combination Agreement or any related
provisions of the Business Combination Agreement for,

(A) any amount that may be payable by the dMY Directors pursuant to Section
2.8 of the Business Combination Agreement or any related provisions of the
Business Combination Agreement, or (B) any costs, fees, expenses and other
liabilities incurred by the Founder Holders\' Representative, acting in such
capacity, in connection with Section 2.8 of the Business Combination
Agreement or any related provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, and
(viii) take all actions necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the
Founder Holders\' Representative on behalf of the dMY Directors in connection
with Section 2.8 of the Business Combination Agreement or any related
provisions of the Business Combination Agreement.

 

(b)The Founder Holders\' Representative, or any successor hereafter appointed,
may resign at any time by written notice to the Buyer, the Sellers\'
Representative, the Target, and the dMY Directors. Any change in the Founder
Holders\' Representative will become effective upon notice to the Buyer, the
Sellers\' Representative, the Target and the dMY Directors in accordance with
this Section 3. The Founder Holders\' Representative so designated must be
reasonably acceptable to the Buyer, the Sellers\' Representative and the
Target, except that the Buyer, the Sellers\' Representative and the Target
hereby agree that, subject to the dMY Directors providing prior written notice
to the Buyer, the Sellers\' Representative and the Target, any dMY Director
will be acceptable to the Buyer, the Sellers\' Representative and the Target
as a successor Founder Holders\' Representative. All power, authority, rights

Representative will apply to any successor Founder Holders\' Representative.

(c)The Founder Holders\' Representative will not be liable for any act done or
omitted under this Section 3, Section 2.8 of the Business Combination
Agreement or any related provisions of the Business Combination Agreement as
Founder Holders\' Representative while acting in good faith, and any act

conclusive evidence of such good faith. The Buyer, the Sellers\'
Representative and the Target each agree that it will not look to the assets
of the Founder Holders\' Representative, acting in such capacity, for the
satisfaction of any obligations to be performed by the dMY Directors, as the
case may be. In performing any of its duties under this Section 3, Section 2.8
of the Business Combination Agreement or any related provisions of the
Business Combination Agreement, the Founder Holders\' Representative will
not be liable to the dMY Directors for any losses that any such Person

3

 

(as defined in the Business Combination Agreement) may incur as a result of
any act, or failure to act, by the Founder Holders\' Representative under this
Section 3, Section 2.8 of the Business Combination Agreement or any related
provisions of the Business Combination Agreement, and the Founder Holders\'
Representative will be indemnified and held harmless by the dMY Directors for
all losses, except to the extent that the actions or omissions of the Founder
Holders\' Representative constituted fraud, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. The limitation of liability provisions of this Section 3(c) will
survive the termination of this Amendment and Agreement or the Business
Combination Agreement and the resignation of the Founder Holders\'
Representative.

 

(d)The Buyer, Sellers\' Representative and the Target shall be entitled to
rely exclusively upon any notices and other acts of the Founder Holders\'
Representative relating to the dMY Directors\' rights and obligations under
Section 2.8 of the Business Combination Agreement and any related provisions
of the Business Combination Agreement as being legally binding acts of each
dMY Director individually and collectively. The grant of authority providing
for in this Section 3 (i) is coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable
and survive the death, incompetency, bankruptcy or liquidation of any dMY
Director and (ii) shall survive the Closing (as defined in the Business
Combination Agreement).

amended by this Amendment and Agreement, remain in full force and effect. From
and after the date hereof, references to "this Letter Agreement" in the
Original Sponsor Letter shall be deemed references to the Original Sponsor
Letter, as amended by this Amendment and Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, and for the avoidance of doubt, in the event the
Business Combination Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article X thereof for
any reason, this Amendment and Agreement shall automatically terminate and
cease to be of further force and effect.

 

5.Entire Agreement. This Amendment and Agreement and the Original Sponsor
Letter, as amended pursuant to this Amendment and Agreement, and the
Business Combination Agreement constitute the entire agreement and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

 

6.Miscellaneous. Sections 16, 17 and 18 of the Original Sponsor Letter are
hereby incorporated by reference and shall apply mutatis mutandis as if set

(See attached)  

SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

This SERVICES AGREEMENT (as amended, modified or supplemented in accordance
with its terms, this "Agreement"), dated as of this [•], 2020, is by and
between Rush Street Gaming, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
("Service Provider"), and Rush Street Interactive, L.P., a Delaware limited
partnership (together with its Subsidiaries, "Recipient") (Recipient together
with Service Provider, the "Parties").

RECITALS:

 

A.Recipient, dMY Technology Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("dMY"), dMY
Sponsor, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, Rush Street Interactive
GP, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company in its capacity as the Sellers\'
Representative, and the sellers signatory thereto (the "Sellers") are
parties to that certain Business Combination Agreement, dated as of July 27,
2020, (the "BCA").

 

B.Recipient  desires that Service Provider provide (or cause to be provided)
certain services to Recipient, as provided for in this Agreement.

 

C.Service  Provider is willing to provide, and to cause its employees and
agents to provide, such services on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

 

D.Capitalized terms used in this Agreement shall have the respective meanings
ascribed to them in the body of this Agreement or in Annex A (which is
incorporated herein by reference), as applicable.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises and covenants
contained herein, Service Provider and Recipient agree as follows:

SECTION 1 SERVICES.

 

1.1Provision of Services. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, Service Provider, acting directly or indirectly through
its Service Providing Affiliates, employees or agents, shall provide to
Recipient the services set forth on Schedule 1 of this Agreement (together
with any additional services pursuant to Section 1.2, the "Services").
Service Provider may, at the direction of Recipient or with the prior written
consent of Recipient, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed, in each instance and subject to compliance with any
applicable Gaming Laws, subcontract with any other Person (a "Third Party
Service Provider") to directly or indirectly provide or support any Services
to Recipient; provided that Service Provider shall (i) use reasonable care and
prudence in the selection and monitoring of any Third Party Service Provider
and (ii) be responsible for the performance of any Third Party Service
Provider hereunder or any failure of Third Party Service Provider to comply
with the terms hereof. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
including Schedule 1, Service Provider shall be required to provide Services
to Recipient only in connection with the Recipient\'s operation of
its business substantially as conducted in the twelve (12) month period
preceding the date hereof. Except as may be expressly identified in an
applicable Schedule, in no event shall Service Provider be responsible for
providing any services or assistance in connection with the transition or
migration of any Services or data following the termination or expiration of
this Agreement.

 

1.2Additional Services. Recipient may, from time to time, request that
additional services be provided hereunder, provided that such services were
regularly or periodically provided by the Service Provider to the Recipient in
the twelve (12) month period prior to the date hereof. To the extent the
Parties mutually agree in writing as to the specifications, applicable fees
and other terms and conditions under which such additional services shall be
provided, such additional services shall be deemed to be Services under this
Agreement.

 

1.3Performance Standard. Service Provider shall, and shall cause its Service
Providing Affiliates and Third Party Service Providers (as applicable) to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to provide (or cause to be provided) to
Recipient the Services in a timely, professional and workmanlike manner, and
at substantially the same level of service, and with substantially the same
degree of care, as Service Provider provided similar services to Recipient in
the twelve (12)- month period immediately prior to the date hereof.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Service Provider
shall be required to perform the Services for the benefit only of Recipient,
and Service Provider shall not be required to perform or to cause to be
performed any of the Services other than for the benefit of Recipient.

 

1.4Personnel. The selection of the persons who will provide the Services for
and on behalf of Service Provider shall be made by Service Provider in
its reasonable discretion. Without limiting Service Provider\'s obligation to
provide the Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including
to meet the services standards set forth herein), in no event shall Service
Provider be required to hire additional personnel or to retain any specific
employee to provide the Services.

1.5Changes. Service Provider may, upon reasonable advanced notice to
Recipient, make changes from time to time in the manner of performing the
Services if it has made the same or substantially similar changes in
performing the same or substantially similar services for its own (retained)
business or its Affiliates.

 

1.6Consents. Service Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain as promptly as practicable the consents, approvals or authorizations of
any Person as may be necessary for the performance of its obligations
pursuant to this Agreement, including obtaining from third-party vendors any
consents necessary to grant any sublicenses in connection with the performance
of the Services. In the event that the consent of any third-party vendor, if
required, is not obtained reasonably shortly after the date hereof, Service
Provider shall notify Recipient and shall cooperate with Recipient in
arranging for alternative means reasonably satisfactory to Recipient by which
Recipient may obtain the Services affected by the failure to obtain such
consent. If the Parties arrange such alternative means, Service Provider shall
provide the Services in accordance therewith. Recipient will reimburse
Service Provider for all fees and costs incurred by Service Provider in
connection with obtaining such consents and alternative Services in accordance
with Section 1.7.

1.7Payment for Services; Expense Reimbursement. As compensation for the
Services during the term of this Agreement, (a) Recipient shall reimburse
Service Provider for all third party costs, including consent fees and costs
incurred under Section 1.6, incurred in connection with the provision of the
Services, (b) Recipient shall reimburse Service Provider for its reasonable
and documented out-of-pocket travel and related expenses, subject to the
approval of Recipient (such

 

2

 

approval not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and receipt
of expense reports detailing such expenses, to the extent incurred by Service
Provider pursuant to this Agreement on behalf of, or for the benefit of,
Recipient, and (c) Recipient shall reimburse Service Provider for an
allocable portion of payroll, benefits and overhead (calculated at 150% of an
employee\'s salary, bonus and benefits cost) with respect to Service
Provider\'s or its Service Providing Affiliate\'s employees who perform or
otherwise assist with the provision of the Services; provided however, that
Service Provider shall disclose to Recipient each such employee\'s salary,
bonus and benefits cost and the employee\'s allocation of time in connection
with the Services, and the corresponding fees or reimbursements generated
thereby on a weekly basis in a monthly report (certified as true and correct
by Service Provider\'s Chief Executive Officer) in a form reasonably
acceptable to Recipient (the "Monthly Allocation Reports"). Service Provider,
its Service Providing Affiliates, and Third Party Service Providers, as
applicable, shall invoice Recipient for such amounts on a monthly basis and
shall attach the applicable Monthly Allocation Report to each such invoice.
Recipient shall pay Service Provider, its Service Providing Affiliates, and
Third Party Service Providers, as applicable, all undisputed amounts within
fifteen (15) days after Recipient\'s receipt of a properly issued invoice.

 

1.8Taxes. The amount of any sales tax, use tax, excise tax, value added tax,
goods and services tax or similar tax (excluding, for the avoidance of
doubt, any income tax) that is required to be paid by Service Provider, its
Service Providing Affiliates or a Third Party Service Provider in connection
with the Services shall be invoiced by Service Provider, its Service Providing
Affiliates or Third Party Service Provider, as applicable, and shall be paid
by Recipient, together with the amounts payable pursuant to Section 1.7 or
otherwise provided under this Agreement.

1.9Disputed Charges. Service Provider shall keep records of the Services
provided hereunder and reasonable supporting documentation of all costs and
expenses incurred in providing such Services. In the event Recipient disputes
any charges related to the Services, Recipient shall deliver a written
statement describing the dispute to Service Provider within twenty

 

(20)business days following Recipient\'s receipt of the invoice or other
documentation of such charges. The statement shall provide a reasonably
detailed description of the disputed items. Upon delivery of the written
statement, Recipient and Service Provider shall cooperate and negotiate in
good faith to resolve such disputed charges, and Service Provider shall make
its records relating to the Services available to Recipient for inspection
upon reasonable notice during normal business hours. If the Parties are
unable to resolve such disputed charges within sixty (60) days of delivery of
the written statement, then such disputed charge shall be resolved in
accordance with Annex B hereto. All payments required to be made pursuant to
this Agreement shall bear interest from (and including) the day that is
thirty (30) days after the date such payment is due until (but excluding) the
date of payment, at a monthly rate equal to the lesser of (i) four percent
(4%) annually or (ii) the maximum rate permitted by applicable Law. In
addition, Recipient shall indemnify and reimburse Service Provider for its
costs, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and disbursements, incurred to
collect any unpaid amount.

 

1.10Employee Matters. Service Provider shall cause its employees and agents
and the employees and agents of its Service Providing Affiliates (as
applicable) and shall direct its Third Party Service Providers to cause their
employees and agents, to be available to provide the Services to Recipient,
and to devote such time and effort to the business of Recipient as shall be
reasonably necessary to perform the Services in accordance with this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the

3

 

foregoing, except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all matters
pertaining to the employment or engagement of the employees and agents of
Service Provider and its Service Providing Affiliates or Third Party Service
Providers are the sole responsibility of Service Provider or its Service
Providing Affiliates or Third Party Service Providers, as applicable.

1.11Compliance with Laws. Service Provider shall, and shall direct its Service
Providing Affiliates (as applicable) and Third Party Service Providers to,
(a) comply in all material respects with all Laws that may be applicable to
the Services (including any applicable Gaming Laws), (b) obtain and maintain
all material licenses, permits, approvals, authorizations, registrations,
findings of suitability, franchises and entitlements necessary or appropriate
to perform their duties and obligations under this Agreement (including any
necessary or appropriate Gaming Licenses) and comply with the terms and
conditions of such licenses, permits, approvals, authorizations,
registrations, findings of suitability, franchises and entitlements, and (c)
file all returns and reports lawfully required to be filed with Governmental
Entities (including any Gaming Authorities) in connection with their
obligations hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Service Provider shall not be responsible for providing any Service, or part
thereof, if and to the extent such Service would violate applicable Law;
provided that, upon the request and at the expense of Recipient, Service
Provider shall use commercially reasonable efforts to modify the applicable
Service so that such Service may be provided in compliance with applicable
Law. Service Provider shall notify Recipient of the curtailment or cessation
of any Service pursuant to this Section 1.11.

 

1.12Gaming Authority Approvals; Gaming Problems. Each Party\'s performance of
its respective obligations set forth in this Agreement shall be subject
to obtaining and maintaining all necessary or appropriate Gaming Authority
approvals, if any. If any Gaming Authority objects to, or proposes the
modification of, any portion of this Agreement, the Parties shall negotiate in
good faith to reach a mutually agreeable accommodation to address such
objections or proposed modifications. In the event that Recipient, Service
Provider or any of its Service Providing Affiliates, Third Party Service
Providers or their respective employees experiences a Gaming Problem, the
affected Party shall promptly notify the other Party of the relevant details
and take all actions necessary or advisable to eliminate, terminate,
discontinue or otherwise cure the Gaming Problem, including terminating
the relationship with any Person giving rise to the Gaming Problem and taking
all other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to remedy the Gaming
Problem.

 

1.13Books and Records. Without limiting Section 1.9, duly
authorized representatives of Recipient shall, upon reasonable notice to
Service Provider, have reasonable access during normal business hours to
examine, inspect and copy the books and records held by Service Provider
relating to the Services; provided that no such access will be provided to
the extent that disclosing any such information would reasonably be expected
to constitute a waiver of attorney- client, work product or other legal
privilege with respect thereto. Recipient shall not be permitted to access
any information to the extent such access could reasonably be expected to
violate any confidentiality obligation or commitment of Service Provider to
any other Person; provided however, notwithstanding any other provision herein
to the contrary, Recipient shall have access to and the right to audit the
Monthly Allocation Reports and all information which such reports are based
upon at all times and upon reasonable notice.

 

4

 

1.14Relationship of the Parties. Each Party (including its respective
employees, agents, representatives, Affiliates and Third Party Service
Providers) shall act solely as an independent contractor. The existence of
this Agreement shall not be deemed to cause either Party (or any of its
employees, agents or representatives) to be an employee, employer, officer,
agent, partner, business representative, or legal representative of, or joint
venturer with, the other Party. Neither Party shall make any warranties or
representations, or assume or create any obligations, on the other Party\'s
behalf, except as may be expressly permitted hereby. Each Party shall be
solely responsible for the actions of its employees, agents, representatives
and Affiliates (and their respective employees, agents and representatives).

 

1.15Third Party Rights. Service Provider shall not, and shall cause its
Service Providing Affiliates, Third Party Service Providers and their
respective employees and agents not to, disclose to Recipient or otherwise
use during the performance of the Services, any confidential or proprietary
information owned by any third parties that such Parties do not have
permission to so disclose or use.

 

1.16Outside Activities of the Parties. This Agreement shall be limited to the
purposes set forth herein and nothing in this Agreement, whether by
implication or otherwise, shall be construed to extend the relationship of
the Parties beyond such purposes.

and Third Party Service Providers to, use commercially reasonable steps

reasonable practices or as required by applicable Law.

 

(b)The Parties agree that,

(i)to the extent Recipient discloses any information that identifies, could be
used to identify, or is otherwise associated with an individual person or
device (together with any definition for any similar term provided by

Party Service Providers to maintain, commercially reasonable security to

and availability of such information, systems or networks;

 

(iv)assist Recipient (1) in responding to any request from a data subject, and

requirements and self-regulatory guidelines relating to Personal Information
("Privacy Laws"), including with respect to security, breach notifications,

regulators, in each of clauses (1) and (2) solely to the extent relating to
the Service Provider\'s receipt of Recipient Personal Information under this
Agreement and the processing thereof;

 

(v)notify the Recipient without undue delay, on becoming aware of any security
incident, misuse of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of any Recipient
Personal Information and take reasonable actions to investigate, to provide a

such security incident, misuse of or unauthorized access to or disclosure of
any Recipient Personal Information;

 

(vi)refrain from, and instruct any Service Providing Affiliates and Third
Party Service Providers to refrain from, notifying or otherwise disclosing the
existence of any compromise related to Recipient Personal Information,
without providing prior written notice to the Recipient, except that Service
Provider, its Service Providing Affiliates and Third Party Service Providers
may notify or otherwise disclose the existence of such a compromise without

for charges accrued or expenses incurred but unpaid as of the date of such
termination or expiration and (b) as set forth in the provisions of this
Agreement that are specifically designated herein as surviving
such termination or expiration. Termination or expiration of this Agreement

SECTION 3 INDEMNIFICATION

 

3.1Indemnification of Service Provider. To the fullest extent permitted by
Law, Recipient shall indemnify Service Provider and its Affiliates, and its
and their officers, managers, members, employees, representatives and agents
and hold them harmless from and against any and all third party claims,
losses, costs, damages and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys\' fees
(all of which shall be reimbursed as incurred), arising out of or relating to
any act or omission performed or omitted pursuant to this Agreement to the
extent it is finally determined that such acts or omissions (a) constituted
gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, (b) were taken in
contravention of this Agreement willfully, in bad faith or as the result of
grossly negligent actions or omissions, or (c) resulted from or is related to
any material breach of this Agreement, in each case by Recipient. To the
fullest extent permitted by Law, none of Service Provider nor the foregoing
Persons shall be liable for damages or otherwise to Recipient for any act or
omission performed or omitted by such Person, except to the extent it is
finally determined that such actions or omissions (x) constituted gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct, (y) were taken in contravention
of this Agreement willfully, in bad faith or as the result of grossly
negligent actions or omissions, or (z) resulted from or is related to any
material breach of this Agreement, in each case by Service Provider. Any
indemnity pursuant to this Section 3.1 (i) shall not be deemed exclusive of
any other rights to which Service Provider or any of the foregoing Persons may
be entitled under any applicable statute, agreement or otherwise, (ii) shall
continue as to Service Provider or any of the foregoing Persons who
have ceased to serve in such capacity and (iii) shall inure to the benefit of
the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of Service Provider or such
Person, as applicable.

 

3.2Indemnification of Recipient. To the fullest extent permitted by Law,
Service Provider shall indemnify Recipient and its Affiliates, and its and
their officers, managers, members, employees, representatives and agents and
hold them harmless from and against any and all third party claims, losses,
costs, damages and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys\' fees (all of
which shall be reimbursed as incurred), arising out of or relating to any act
or omission performed or omitted pursuant to this Agreement or in connection
with the provision of the Services to the extent it is finally determined that
such acts or omissions (a) constituted gross negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct, (b) were taken in contravention of this Agreement willfully, in
bad faith or as the result of grossly negligent actions or omissions, or (c)
resulted from or is related to any material breach of this Agreement, in each
case by Service Provider. Any indemnity pursuant to this Section 3.2, (x)
shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which Recipient or any
of the foregoing Persons may be entitled under any applicable statute,
agreement or otherwise, (y) shall continue as to Recipient or any of the
foregoing Persons who have ceased to serve in such capacity and (z) shall
inure to the benefit of the heirs, successors, assigns and administrators of
Recipient or such Person, as applicable.

 

3.3Notice of Claim; Defense. A Person entitled to indemnification pursuant
to Sections

3.1or 3.2 (the "Indemnified Party") shall give Recipient or Service Provider,
as the case may be (the "Indemnifying Party"), prompt notice of any claim
that may give rise to any indemnification obligation under Sections 3.1
or 3.2, as applicable, together with the estimated amount of such

 

8

 

claim. Failure to provide such notice shall not affect the indemnification
obligations hereunder in the absence of actual and material prejudice. If the
Indemnifying Party elects to defend or prosecute a third-party claim, the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate in the defense or prosecution thereof,
which cooperation shall include, to the extent reasonably requested by the
Indemnifying Party, the retention, and the provision to the Indemnifying
Party, of records and information reasonably relevant to such third-party
claim, and making employees of the Indemnified Party available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
materials provided hereunder. Neither Party will make any settlement of any
third-party claim that would give rise to liability on the part of the other
Party without such Party\'s prior written consent, and neither Party will be
liable for the amount of any settlement affected without such prior written
consent.

 

3.4In the event a Person (other than Recipient or Service Provider)
indemnified pursuant to Sections 3.1 and 3.2 seeks indemnification
thereunder, then (a) such Person shall request that Recipient or Service
Provider, as applicable (the "Representative Party"), make a claim for
indemnification to the other Party on such Person\'s, (b) the Representative
Party shall act as such Person\'s representative with respect to
such indemnification claim and (c) the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled

information shared by or received from the other Party (each, a
"Disclosing Party") or learned by the Receiving Party pursuant to this
Agreement or in the course of the provision or receipt of the Services
(collectively, "Confidential Information"). Each Receiving Party agrees to
safeguard the Disclosing Party\'s Confidential Information received under this
Agreement with the same degree of care that the Receiving Party uses to
protect its own similar Confidential Information. The Receiving Party
may disclose Confidential Information (i) to its auditors, attorneys,
financial advisors, bankers and other appropriate consultants and advisors who
have a need to know such information and are informed of their obligation to
hold such information confidential (and have agreed or are subject to a
professional or contractual obligation to do so) to the same extent as is

with such obligations the Receiving Party will be responsible, (ii) to its
Affiliates, Third Party Service Providers (if applicable) and their respective
employees and agents who have a need to know such information for purposes of
providing or receiving the Services and who are informed of their obligation
to hold such information confidential (and have agreed or are subject to a
professional or contractual obligation to do so) to the same extent as is
applicable to the Receiving Party and in respect of whose failure to comply
with such obligations the Receiving Party will be responsible; and (iii)

disclose any such Confidential Information by any Gaming Authority or any

other requirements of Law.

 

4.2Protective Order. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any
demand or request for disclosure of Confidential Information is made pursuant
to Section 4.1(iii), the Receiving Party shall promptly notify the Disclosing
Party of the existence of such request or demand and shall use good faith
efforts to provide the Disclosing Party with a reasonable opportunity to seek
an appropriate protective order or other remedy, which both Parties will
cooperate in seeking to obtain. In the event that such appropriate protective
order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates, Third Party Service Providers (if applicable) and their
respective employees and agents to, furnish only that portion of the
Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed.

each case that was (x) created or developed by Service Provider for Recipient
in the course of performing the Services and (y) delivered to Recipient, and
solely to the extent necessary for Recipient to use such deliverable or work
product. The licenses set forth in Section 5.2(a) and (b)(i) shall
automatically and immediately terminate upon the termination of the Term. To
the extent that the preceding licenses include any Trademarks (which they

and additional instruments and documents and to do such other acts and
things as may be reasonably necessary to more fully effectuate this
Agreement.

interpreted in such manner as to be effective and valid under applicable
Law, but if any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid

of such unenforceability or invalidity, and the remaining provisions of this
Agreement shall continue to be binding and in full force and effect.

 

9.6Third-Party Beneficiaries. The representations, warranties, covenants, and
obligations of the Parties are made for the express benefit of the Parties and
successors and permitted assigns, and, except as provided in Section 3 with

waived by either Party, unless such waiver is in writing and signed by
that Party. The waiver by a Party of a breach of any provision of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any other provision
of this Agreement or any further breach of the provision so waived.

for performance falls upon a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday, such time
for performance shall be extended to the next business day.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION

 

(a)Except as otherwise provided herein, this Annex B shall apply to any
dispute, controversy or claim arising under or related to this Agreement or
the business or transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether arising
in contract, tort or otherwise, and whether arising at law or in equity),
including (a) any dispute regarding the construction, interpretation,
performance, validity or enforceability of any provision of this Agreement or
whether any Person is in compliance with, or in breach of, any provision of
this Agreement, and (b) the applicability of this Annex B to a particular
dispute. Any dispute to which this Annex B applies is referred to herein as a
"Dispute."

(b)The provisions of this Annex B shall be the exclusive method of resolving
Disputes. Any Dispute, including any question concerning this Agreement\'s
existence, validity or termination, shall be referred to and finally and
exclusively resolved by an arbitration in accordance with the CPR Rules for
Non-Administered Arbitration then in effect (the "Rules"), by a sole
arbitrator. The arbitration shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act,
9 U.S.C. §§ 1- 16, and a judgment upon the award rendered by the arbitrator
may be entered in any of court having jurisdiction thereof. Within thirty (30)
days after service of the arbitration notice upon the respondent, the Parties
will attempt to agree upon the designation of the arbitrator. If, within that
period, the Parties do not agree on the designation of the arbitrator, then
CPR will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with its Rules. The arbitrator
designated or appointed, as applicable, pursuant to this Annex B shall be
referred to herein as the "Arbitrator."

 

(c)The place of arbitration shall be Chicago, Illinois, or such other
location as the Parties may mutually agree.

(d)The language of the arbitration will be English.

 

(e)The non-prevailing Party in any arbitration shall be obligated to pay all
costs and expenses related to such arbitration (including the fees and
expenses charged by CPR and the Arbitrator and the reasonable attorneys\'
fees and out of pocket costs of the prevailing Party).

(f)It is the intent of the Parties that, barring extraordinary circumstances,
the Arbitrator shall use its best efforts to render the arbitral award (the
"Award") within sixty (60) days after his or her appointment. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Parties may agree to extend this time or the Arbitrator
may do so in its discretion if it determines that the interest of justice so
requires. Failure to adhere to this time limit shall not be a basis for
challenging the Award.

 

(g)Either Party may apply to the Arbitrator seeking injunctive relief until
the Award is rendered or the controversy is otherwise resolved. Neither Party
may apply for, and the Arbitrator may not award, punitive, incidental,
consequential, special or indirect damages. Either Party also may, without
waiving any remedy under this Agreement, seek from any court having
jurisdiction any interim or provisional relief that is necessary to protect
the rights or property of that Party, pending the Arbitrator\'s determination
of the merits of the controversy.

undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for the Company to pursue, in
which case, the provisions of Section 1.10(a) shall not apply to any such
corporate opportunity.

opportunity for the Company if it is a business opportunity that (i) the
Company is neither financially or legally able, nor contractually permitted to
undertake, (ii) from its nature, is not in the line of the Company\'s

determinations, opinions, judgments, or other decisions) granted to the
Company under this Agreement or any other agreement, instrument, or other
document to which the Company is a party.

 

3.2Composition of the Board.

 

(a)Number and Appointment. The Board initially shall consist of three (3)
Managers. Thereafter, the number of Managers shall be established from time to
time by the Member. The initial Managers shall be Neil Bluhm, Gregory Carlin
and Richard Schwartz. Any Manager position to be filled by reason of an
increase in the number of Managers or by any other reason shall be filled by
RSI, subject in each case, to the receipt of any requisite Gaming Licenses
and/or approvals from Gaming Authorities. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, but subject to the last sentence of Section 3.2(b), each of
Neil Bluhm (or one of his adult children) and Gregory Carlin shall be entitled
to serve as Managers until they (or their Permitted Transferees, successors
or assigns) (taken together) hold fewer Equity Interests (as such term is
defined in the Business Combination Agreement) of dMY Technology Group, Inc.
and RSI (taken collectively) than another shareholder or affiliated group of
shareholders.

(b)Term. Each Manager appointed shall serve effective upon the Company\'s
receipt of notice appointing such Manager (or at such later time or upon
the happening of some event specified in such notice) from RSI (except that
the Managers identified by name in Section 3.2(a) shall serve from the date of
this Agreement) and until a successor is appointed in accordance with the
terms hereof or his, her or its earlier resignation, death or removal in
accordance with this Agreement. A Manager will be removed from the Board, with
or without cause, only upon the written request of RSI. A Manager may resign
at any time by delivering written notice to the Company. Such resignation
shall be effective upon receipt unless it is specified to be effective at some
other time or upon the happening of some other event. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, any Manager may be removed from his or her
position as such upon a good faith finding of the Board that such director has
a Gaming Problem that cannot be cured, in each case, pursuant to the terms of
Section 8.1.

(c)Vacancies. Subject to the receipt of any requisite Gaming Licenses
and/or approvals from Gaming Authorities, a vacancy on the Board because of
resignation, death or removal of a Manager will be filled by RSI in its sole
discretion. If RSI elects to not appoint a replacement Manager pursuant to the
terms of this Section 3.2, the number of Managers that constitute the Board
shall be automatically reduced, subject to future adjustment by the Member
pursuant to Section 3.2(a).

(d)Reimbursement; Compensation. The Managers shall be entitled to be
reimbursed for their direct out-of-pocket travel expenses incurred in the
course of their attendance at Board meetings.

3.3Board Actions; Meetings. Each Manager shall have one vote on all matters
submitted to the Board (whether the consideration of such matter is taken at
a meeting, by written consent or otherwise) and unless another percentage is
set forth herein or required by applicable law, any determination or action
required to be taken by the Board shall be taken by a majority of the
Managers then in office (through meetings of the Board or written consents
pursuant to this Section 3.3). A majority of the Managers then in office
shall constitute a quorum sufficient for conducting meetings and making
decisions. The vote of a majority of Managers present at a meeting at which a
quorum is present shall be the act of the Board. Regular meetings of the Board
may be held on such date and at such time and at such place as shall from
time to time be determined by the Board. Special meetings of the Board may be

 

-5 -

 

called from time to time by any two Managers. Notice of each special meeting
of the Board stating the date, place and time of such meeting shall be given
to each Manager by hand, telephone, telecopy, overnight courier or the U.S.
mail at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to any meeting of the Board.
Notice may be waived before or after a meeting or by attendance without
protest at such meeting. Any action to be taken by the Board may be taken at a
meeting of the Board or by a written consent executed by Managers having not
less than the minimum votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such
action at a meeting. Prompt notice of the taking of any action by the Board
without a meeting by less than unanimous consent will be given to those
Managers who did not consent in writing to the action. Managers shall be
entitled to participate in a meeting of the Board by means of telephone
conference or similar communications equipment by which all Persons
participating in the meeting can communicate with each other, and such
participation in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at the meeting.
The Board may adopt such other procedures governing meetings and the conduct
of business at such meetings as it shall deem appropriate.

3.4Delegation of Authority. Subject to obtaining and maintaining any Gaming
Authority licensing requirements and approvals, the Board may, from time to
time, delegate to one or more Persons (including any Member, Manager, officer
or other authorized person of the Board) such authority and duties as the
Board may deem advisable; provided that no Person shall be delegated the
power to take any action that would violate the express terms of this
Agreement. Any delegation pursuant to this Section 3.4 may be revoked at any
time by the Board. The Board may not create or establish committees.

 

3.5Limitation of Liability.

 

(a)Duties of Managers and Officers; Limitation of Liability. Except as
otherwise provided herein and to the maximum extent permitted by the Act, no
present or former Manager or Officer nor any such Manager\'s or Officer\'s
Affiliates, nor any of its or their respective employees, officers,
managers/directors, direct or indirect equityholders, agents or
representatives shall be liable to the Company or to the Member for any act
or omission performed or omitted by such Person in its capacity as Manager or
Officer; provided that, except as otherwise provided herein, such limitation
of liability shall not apply to the extent the act or omission was
attributable to such Person\'s gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud,
in each case as determined by a final judgment, order or decree of an
arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or
with respect to which the time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal
has been perfected). Each Manager and Officer shall be entitled to rely upon
the advice of outside and in-house legal counsel, independent public
accountants and other experts, including financial advisors, and any act of or
failure to act by such Manager or Officer in good faith reliance on such
advice shall in no event subject such Manager or Officer or any of such
Manager\'s or Officer\'s Affiliates, or any of its or their respective
employees, officers, managers/directors, direct or indirect equityholders,
agents or representatives to liability to the Company or the Member.

 

(b)Board Discretion. Whenever in this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated herein the Board is permitted or required to take any action or
to make a decision or determination, each Manager shall take such action or
make such decision or determination in such Manager\'s sole discretion, unless
another standard is expressly set forth herein or therein. Whenever in this
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein the Board is permitted
or required to take any action or to make a decision or determination in its
"sole discretion" or "discretion," with "complete discretion" or under a grant
of similar authority or latitude, each Manager shall be entitled to consider
such interests and factors as the Manager desires, so long as the Manager does
not act in bad faith. Whenever in this Agreement or any other agreement
contemplated herein the Board is permitted or required to take any action or
to make a decision or

-6 -

 

determination in its "good faith" or under another express standard, each
Manager shall act under such express standard and, to the extent permitted
by applicable law, shall not be subject to any other or different standards
imposed by this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated herein, and,
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, so long as such
Manager acts in good faith, the resolution, action or terms so made, taken or
provided by the Board shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement or any
other agreement contemplated herein or impose liability upon such Manager or
any of such Manager\'s Affiliates, or any of its or their respective
employees, officers, managers/directors, direct or indirect equityholders,
agents or representatives. With respect to any action taken or decision or
determination made by the Board, it shall be presumed that the Managers acted
in good faith and in compliance with this Agreement and the Act and any Person
bringing, pleading or prosecuting any claim with respect to any action taken
or decision or determination made by the Board shall have the burden
of overcoming such presumption; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt,
this sentence shall not be deemed to increase or place any duty of care or
loyalty on the Board or any Manager.

(c)Limitation of Duties. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law,
the Company and the Member each hereby waives any claim or cause of
action against each Manager, Officer and the Member and each of their
respective Affiliates, employees, officers, managers/directors, direct or
indirect equityholders, agents and representatives (other than claims or
causes of action against any such Person serving in his, her or its capacity
as an officer, employee or service-provider of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries) for any breach of any fiduciary duty to the Company or the
Member or any of the Company\'s subsidiaries by any such Person, including as
may result from any conflict of interest, including a conflict of interest
between the Company or the Member or the Member\'s equity holders or any of
the Company\'s subsidiaries and such Person or otherwise, any breach of
loyalty or any breach of the duty of care; provided that, with respect to
actions or omissions by a Manager or Officer, such waiver shall not apply to
the extent the act or omission was attributable to such Manager\'s or
Officer\'s gross negligence, willful misconduct or fraud, in each case as
determined by a final judgment, order or decree of an arbitrator or a court of
competent jurisdiction (which is not appealable or with respect to which the
time for appeal therefrom has expired and no appeal has been perfected). The
Member acknowledges and agrees that in the event of any such conflict of
interest, each such Person (in the absence of bad faith) may act in the best
interests of such Person or its Affiliates, or any of its or their respective
employees, officers, managers/directors, direct or indirect equityholders,
agents and representatives. No Manager, Officer or Member (other than any
Person serving as an officer, employee or service-provider of the Company or
any of its subsidiaries) shall be obligated to give any consideration to any
interest of or factors affecting the Company or any of its subsidiaries or the
Member, or to recommend or take any action in its capacity as a Manager,
Officer or Member that prefers the interests of the Company or any of its
subsidiaries or the Member over the interests of such Person or its
Affiliates, or any of its or their respective employees,
officers, managers/directors, direct or indirect equityholders, agents or
representatives, and each of the Company and the Member hereby waives the
fiduciary duty, if any, of such Person to the Company and/or the Member,
including in the event of any such conflict of interest or otherwise;
provided that, with respect to actions or omissions by any Manager or Officer,
such waiver shall not apply to the extent the act or omission was
attributable to such Manager or Officer\'s gross negligence, willful
misconduct or fraud, in each case as determined by a final judgment, order or
decree of an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction (which is not
appealable or with respect to which the time for appeal therefrom has expired
and no appeal has been perfected). The provisions of this Agreement, to the
extent that they restrict the duties (including fiduciary duties) and
liabilities of an Indemnified Person otherwise existing at law or in equity,
are agreed by the Company and the Member to replace such other duties and
liabilities of such Indemnified Person. Except as expressly set forth herein

 

-7 -

 

 

or in another agreement between such Indemnified Person and the Company or any
of its subsidiaries or Affiliates, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law no Indemnified Person will have any fiduciary duties to the
Company or the Member, and will otherwise not have any obligations other than
such obligations as specifically provided by this Agreement or any such other
agreement.

 

(d)Designation and Duties of Officers. Subject to obtaining and maintaining
any Gaming Authority licensing requirements and approvals, the Board may
from time to time designate individuals as officers of the Company
("Officers"), and any such Officers shall have such authority and perform such
duties as the Board may from time to time delegate to them, including on
behalf of or in respect of the Company, and shall serve at the will of the
Board; provided that the Board shall immediately remove from office any
Officer who has been determined by the Board to have or who may have a Gaming
Problem. The initial officers of the Company are Neil Bluhm (Chairman),
Gregory Carlin (Chief Executive Officer) and Richard Schwartz (President).

 

(e)Effect on Other Agreements. This Section 3.5 shall not in any way affect,
limit or modify any Person\'s duties, liabilities or obligations under any
employment agreement, consulting agreement, management services agreement,
confidentiality agreement, non- competition agreement, non-solicitation
agreement or any similar agreement with any Manager, Officer, the Company or
any of their respective subsidiaries.

ARTICLE IV

EXCULPATION AND INDEMNIFICATION

 

4.1Exculpation. No present or former Officer or Manager shall be liable to any
Manager, the Company or the Member for any loss suffered by the Company or
the Member unless such loss is caused by such Person\'s gross negligence,
willful misconduct or fraud, in each case, as determined by a final judgment,
order or decree of an arbitrator or a court of competent jurisdiction (which
is not appealable or with respect to which the time for appeal therefrom has
expired and no appeal has been perfected). Any Officer or Manager may consult
with outside or in-house counsel and accountants and other experts, including
financial advisors, in respect of Company affairs and, provided such Person
acts in good faith reliance upon the advice or opinion of such counsel or
accountants or other experts, such Person shall not be liable for any loss
suffered by the Company or the Member in reliance thereon. The preceding
sentence shall in no way limit any Person\'s right to rely on information to
the extent provided in Section 18-406 of the Act. No Member, Manager or
Officer of the Company shall be personally liable under any judgment of a
court, or in any other manner, for any debt, obligation or liability of the
Company, whether that liability or obligation arises in contract, tort or
otherwise, solely by reason of being a Member, Manager or Officer of the
Company or any combination of the foregoing.

4.2Right to Indemnification. The Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless any Person (each an "Indemnified Person") to the fullest extent
permitted under the Act, as the same now exists or may hereafter be amended,
substituted or replaced (but, in the case of any such amendment, substitution
or replacement only to the extent that such amendment, substitution or
replacement permits the Company to provide broader indemnification rights than
the Company is providing immediately prior to such amendment), against all
expenses, liabilities and losses (including attorney fees, judgments, fines,
excise taxes or penalties) reasonably incurred or suffered by such Person (or
one or more of such Person\'s Affiliates) by reason of the fact that such
Person is or was a Member or is or was serving as a Manager or Officer or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or the Board as a managing
member, sole member, manager, officer, director, principal or member of
another corporation, partnership, joint

 

-8 -

 

 

venture, limited liability company, trust or other enterprise if, in each
case, and unless otherwise determined by the Board in good faith,
such Indemnified Person acted in good faith and in a manner the Person
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Company or of such corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust or other enterprise and, with respect to any criminal action
or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Person\'s conduct was
unlawful; provided that (A) unless the Board otherwise determines, no Person
shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder with respect to a proceeding
initiated by such Person or with respect to a proceeding between such Person
or such Person\'s Affiliates (excluding, for purposes hereof, the Company\'s
Member or any of its subsidiaries) on the one hand and the Company or any of
its Affiliates on the other; and (B) no Person shall be indemnified for any
expenses, liabilities and losses suffered that are attributable to
such Person\'s or its Affiliates\' (excluding, for purposes hereof, the
Company\'s Member or any of its subsidiaries) present or future breaches of
any representations, warranties or covenants by such Indemnified Person or its
Affiliates (excluding, for purposes hereof, the Company\'s Member and its
subsidiaries), employees, agents or representatives contained herein or in any
other agreement with the Company\'s Member or any of its subsidiaries.
Expenses, including attorneys\' fees and expenses, incurred by any such
Indemnified Person in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Company as
incurred in advance of the final disposition of such proceeding, including any
appeal therefrom, upon receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of
such Indemnified Person to repay such amount if it shall ultimately be
determined that such Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Company. The rights granted pursuant to this Article IV shall be deemed
contract rights and no amendment, modification or repeal of this Article IV
shall have the effect of limiting or denying any such rights with respect to
actions taken or proceedings arising prior to any amendment, modification
or repeal. It is expressly acknowledged that the indemnification provided in
this Article IV could involve indemnification for negligence or under theories
of strict liability.

4.3Nonexclusivity of Rights. The right to indemnification and the advancement
and payment of expenses conferred in this Article IV shall not be exclusive of

statutory), provision of the Certificate or this Agreement, any other
agreement or any resolution of the Member or vote of the Board or otherwise.
Insurance. The Company may purchase and maintain insurance or cause its
subsidiaries to purchase and maintain insurance, at its or their expense, to
protect itself and any Person who is or was serving as a Manager, an Officer
or an agent of the Company or is or was serving at the request of the Company
or the Board as a manager, director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor,
trustee, employee, agent or similar functionary of another foreign
or domestic limited liability company, corporation, partnership, joint
venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other enterprise
against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the Company would have
the power to indemnify such Person against such expense, liability or loss
under this Article IV.

 

4.4Limitation. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary
(including in this Article IV), any indemnity by the Company relating to the
matters covered in this Article IV shall be provided out of and to the extent
of the Company\'s assets only and the Member (unless the Member otherwise
agrees in writing or is found in a final decision by a court of competent
jurisdiction to have personal liability on account thereof) shall not have
personal liability on account thereof or shall be required to make additional
capital contributions to help satisfy such indemnity of the Company (except as
expressly provided herein).

 

4.5Effect on Other Agreements and Member\'s Obligations. This Article
IV shall not in any way affect, limit or modify the Member\'s liabilities or
obligations under this Agreement or any Officer\'s or employee\'s liabilities
or obligations under any employment agreement, consulting agreement,

 

-9 -

 

confidentiality agreement, noncompetition agreement, nonsolicitation
agreement or any other agreement with the Company or any of its subsidiaries
or Affiliates.

 

4.6Savings Clause. If this Article IV or any portion hereof shall
be invalidated on any ground by any court of competent jurisdiction, then the
Company shall nevertheless indemnify and hold harmless each Manager, any
Officer or any other Person indemnified pursuant to this Article IV to the
fullest extent permitted by any applicable portion of this Article IV that
shall not have been invalidated and to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law.

ARTICLE V

 

TRANSFERS AND MEMBER RIGHTS

 

5.1Transfer of Membership Interests.

 

(a)Subject to receipt of the required prior approval of any applicable Gaming
Authority, the Member may sell, assign, transfer or otherwise dispose of,
whether voluntarily or involuntarily or by operation of law (a "Transfer"),
all or any portion of its Membership Interests. If the Member transfers any of
its interest in the Company pursuant to this Section 5.1, the transferee
shall be admitted to the Company upon its execution of an instrument
signifying its agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and such other documents and instruments as the Board determines to
be necessary or appropriate. If the Member transfers all of its interests in
the Company, such admission shall be deemed effective immediately, and
immediately following such admission, the transferor Member shall cease to be
a member of the Company. Upon assignment, the Board shall amend Schedule I
without the further vote, act or consent of any other person to reflect such
new person as a Member.

(b)The Company, the Member and each transferee of Membership Interests shall
cooperate with any applicable Gaming Authority in respect of any suitability
investigation (if so required). Any Transfer of Membership Interests shall be
contingent upon the transferee being found suitable by any applicable Gaming
Authority (if so required).

 

(c)The Member shall indemnify the Company for any losses or damages incurred
as the result of any Transfer that does not meet the requirements of the
applicable Gaming Laws. Notwithstanding anything in this Article V to the
contrary, no Transfer of Membership Interests shall be permitted, and no
transferee of Membership Interests shall be admitted to the Company as a
Member:

(i)if, in the opinion of the Board, such Transfer or admission alone or in
conjunction with one or more other transfers or admissions could or could
reasonably be expected to (A) result in a violation of applicable legal
requirements, including securities laws, Gaming Laws and Gaming Licenses, (B)
result in (or could result in) a Gaming Problem, (C) be an event which would
constitute a violation or breach (or, with the giving of notice or passage of
time, would constitute a violation or breach) of any law, regulation,
ordinance, agreement or instrument by which the Company, or any of its
properties or assets, is bound or (D) require the Company to register under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and (ii) until such Transfer
has been approved by all applicable Gaming Authorities. Without limiting the
foregoing, any Transfer of Membership Interests hereunder is subject to and
must be in compliance with all applicable Gaming Laws, including the receipt
of all applicable Gaming Licenses and other approvals.

signifying its agreement to be bound by the terms and conditions of this
Agreement and such other documents and instruments as the Board determines to
be necessary or appropriate. Upon admission, the Board shall amend Schedule I

ARTICLE VIII

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

8.1Gaming Problems.

(a)Definitions. When used in this Section 8.1, the following terms have the

following meanings:

 

(i)"Gaming Problem" means, a determination by the Board that a "Gaming
Problem" exists following the occurrence of any of the following: (i) a
communication from a Gaming Authority that the Company or any Gaming Related
Person does not satisfy any suitability, eligibility or other qualification
criteria pursuant to any applicable Gaming Laws with respect to a Gaming
License, including any character or suitability criteria thereunder; (ii) a
communication from a Gaming Authority that a Gaming Related Person must divest
itself of any interest in, as applicable, or disassociate from, the Company
or its Affiliates; or (iii) circumstances such that any Gaming Related Person
is deemed likely, in the reasonable discretion of the Board based on
verifiable information received from any Gaming Authority or otherwise, to
preclude or materially delay, impede or impair the ability of the Company,
the Member and/or its Affiliates or any Gaming Related Person of the foregoing
to obtain, maintain or renew a Gaming License, or such as may result in the
imposition of materially burdensome terms and conditions on, or the
revocation or suspension of, such a Gaming License. For the avoidance of
doubt, the imposition of monetary fines by a Gaming Authority will not
generally constitute a "Gaming Problem" unless accompanied by one of the
three factors set forth in the preceding sentence.

(ii)"Gaming Related Person" means a Manager, the Member or, with respect to
the Member, any other Person whose relationship with the member may result in
the Gaming Authorities determining that there is or may be a Gaming Problem.

 

-12 -

 

 

(iii)Gaming Problem; Compliance with Gaming Laws. In the event that any
Manager or the Member (or a Gaming Related Person of the Member) experiences a
Gaming Problem, such Manager or the Member shall promptly notify the Board of
the relevant details and take all actions necessary or advisable to eliminate,
terminate, discontinue or otherwise cure the Gaming Problem, including: (i)
terminating the relationship with any Person giving rise to the Gaming
Problem, (ii) with respect to the Member, effecting the Transfer of its
Membership Interests as permitted hereunder, including to a blind trust (if
approved by the Board and then by the relevant Gaming Authority), and (iii)
taking all other actions as may be necessary or appropriate to remedy the
Gaming Problem. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, all
Transfers or redemptions of Membership Interests shall be subject to
compliance with all applicable requirements of all Gaming Laws, including any
right of prior approval, review and/or filing thereunder. If any Gaming
Authority requires the implementation of another mechanism or terms for any
Transfers or redemptions of Membership Interests that are inconsistent with
Article V of this Agreement, the terms required by such Gaming Authority will
control and the applicable provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
modified by the Board (without the consent of the Member) in a manner
consistent with such requirements, and the Board shall have authority to
implement such modifications (without the consent of the Member) at its
discretion.

 

(b)Gaming Problem Withdrawal. Notwithstanding Section 5.4, in the event that
the Board determines that a Gaming Problem exists with respect to the Member
(or a Gaming Related Person of the Member), and the Member has not eliminated,
terminated, discontinued or otherwise cured such Gaming Problem by the earlier
of (i) any deadline imposed by the relevant Gaming Authority and/or the Board
or (ii) sixty (60) days after the Member received notice of such Gaming
Problem, then the Member shall be deemed to be a withdrawing Member hereunder.

 

(c)Severability. If any provision of this Section 8.1 or the application of
any such provision to any Person or under any circumstance shall be held
invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any respect by a court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall not affect
any other provision of this Section 8.1.

8.2Amendments. This Agreement may be amended or modified and any provision
hereof may be waived only by the Member. If any Gaming Authority with
jurisdiction over the Company or its operations, objects to or proposes the
modification of, any portion of this Agreement, the Member and the Company
shall negotiate in good faith to reach a mutually agreeable accommodation to
address such objections or proposed modifications.

8.3Successors. Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement will inure
to the benefit of and be binding upon the Member and its respective legal
representatives, heirs, successors and assigns.

8.4Governing Law; Venue; Severability. This Agreement is governed by and shall
be construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware excluding
any conflict-of-laws rule or principle that might refer the governance or the
construction of this Agreement to the law of another jurisdiction. In the
event of a direct conflict between the provisions of this Agreement and any
provision of the Certificate or any mandatory provision of the Act, the
applicable provision of the Certificate or the Act shall control. Subject to
Section 8.6 and unless the Company otherwise consents in writing to the
selection of an alternate forum, any dispute relating hereto shall be heard
solely and exclusively in the state or federal courts of Delaware, and each
party or Member consents and agrees to jurisdiction and venue therein and not
to contest jurisdiction or move for forum non conveniens or otherwise dispute
the forum. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any person may be bring an action
(i) to enforce a judgment or order from a state or federal court of Delaware
in any court with jurisdiction over the person against

 

-13 -

 

whom such judgment or order is being enforced and (ii) for specific
performance or injunctive relief in any court with jurisdiction over the
person against whom such equitable relief is sought. If any provision of this
Agreement is held to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect
under any applicable law or rule in any jurisdiction, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability will not affect any other provision or the
effectiveness or validity of any provision in any other jurisdiction, and
this Agreement will be reformed, construed and enforced in such jurisdiction
as if such invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never been
contained herein.

 

8.5Notices. All notices, demands or other communications to be given or
delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this Agreement shall be in
writing and shall be deemed to have been given only (i) when delivered
personally to the recipient, (ii) one (1) business day after being sent to the
recipient by reputable overnight courier service (charges prepaid) provided
that confirmation of delivery is received, (iii) upon machine-generated
acknowledgment of receipt after transmittal by facsimile (provided that a
confirmation copy is sent via reputable overnight courier service for delivery
within two (2) business days thereafter), or (iv) five (5) business days
after being mailed to the recipient by certified or registered mail (return
receipt requested and postage prepaid), in each case to the addresses or
telecopy numbers as have been supplied in writing to the Company.

 

8.6MUTUAL WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. BECAUSE DISPUTES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH
COMPLEX TRANSACTIONS ARE MOST QUICKLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESOLVED BY AN
EXPERIENCED AND EXPERT PERSON AND THE PARTIES WISH APPLICABLE STATE AND
FEDERAL LAWS TO APPLY (RATHER THAN ARBITRATION RULES), THE PARTIES DESIRE THAT
THEIR DISPUTES BE RESOLVED BY A JUDGE APPLYING SUCH APPLICABLE LAWS.
THEREFORE, TO ACHIEVE THE BEST COMBINATION OF THE BENEFITS OF THE JUDICIAL
SYSTEM AND OF ARBITRATION, EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY WAIVES ALL
RIGHTS TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT TO RESOLVE
ANY DISPUTE BETWEEN OR AMONG ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO, WHETHER ARISING IN
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING OUT OF, CONNECTED WITH, RELATED OR
INCIDENTAL TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY AND/OR THE
RELATIONSHIP ESTABLISHED AMONG THE PARTIES HEREUNDER. EACH OF THE PARTIES TO
THIS AGREEMENT HEREBY AGREES AND CONSENTS THAT ANY SUCH CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION
OR CAUSE OF ACTION SHALL BE DECIDED BY COURT TRIAL WITHOUT A JURY AND THAT THE
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OF A COPY OF
THIS AGREEMENT WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF THE
PARTIES HERETO TO THE WAIVER OF THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY.

 

8.7Complete Agreement; Headings; Construction; Counterparts. This Agreement
terminates and supersedes all other agreements concerning the subject
matter hereof previously entered into among any of the parties. Descriptive
headings are for convenience only and will not control or affect the meaning
or construction of any provision of this Agreement. Wherever from the context
it appears appropriate, each term stated in either the singular or the plural
shall include the singular and the plural and pronouns stated in either the
masculine, feminine or the neuter gender shall include the masculine, the
feminine and the neuter. All references to Articles and Sections refer to
articles and sections of this Agreement. Reference in this Agreement to
"including," "includes" and "include" shall be deemed to be followed by the
words "without limitation." This Agreement may be executed and delivered by
each party hereto in separate counterparts (including by means of facsimile or
electronic transmission in portable document format), each of which when so
executed and delivered shall be deemed an original and both of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

-14 -

 

8.8Partition; Appraisal Rights. The Member waives, until termination of the
Company, any and all rights that it may have to maintain an action for
partition of the Company\'s property. Section 18- 210 of the Act (entitled
"Contractual Appraisal Rights") shall not apply or be incorporated into this
Agreement and the Member hereby expressly waives all rights under Section
18-210 of the Act.

8.9Third Party Beneficiary. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Company and the Member acknowledge and agree that RSI is an express third
party beneficiary of this Agreement and may directly enforce (including by an
action for specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable relief)
Section 3.2 and Section 5.3 as if RSI were directly a party hereto.
