of Section 368(a) of the Code and that this Agreement be, and is hereby
adopted as, a "plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361
of the Code.

of the state of New Jersey as a direct wholly owned Subsidiary of Merger Sub
2, and an indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease. Immediately thereafter, and as
part of the same plan, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of the
NJBCA and the DLLCA, at the Second Effective Time, the First Surviving
Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub 2. As a result of the Second
Merger, Merger Sub 2 will continue as the surviving company of the Second
Merger (the "Surviving Company") and will continue its existence under the
laws of the state of Delaware as a wholly owned Subsidiary of Buyer, and the
separate corporate existence of the First Surviving Company will cease.

  



  

1.2 _Effective Times_. On the Closing Date, subject to the payment by Buyer
of the consideration required to be paid by Buyer at the Closing pursuant to
this Agreement, the Parties will cause the First Merger to be consummated by
filing a certificate of merger, in a form mutually agreeable to Buyer and the
Company (the "First Certificate of Merger"), to be properly executed
and filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the DGCL and with the Secretary of State of
the State of New Jersey in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
NJBCA and will take all such other actions as may be required by Applicable
Laws to make the First Merger effective as promptly as practicable. The First
Merger will become effective at the time that the First Certificate of Merger
is accepted for filing by both the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware and the Secretary of State of the State of New Jersey, or at such
later date and time as is specified in the First Certificate of Merger (such
time and date being referred to herein as the "First Effective Time").
Immediately following the filing of the First Certificate of Merger, Merger
Sub 2 shall cause a certificate of merger with respect to the Second Merger
(the "Second Certificate of Merger" and, together with the First Certificate
of Merger, the "Certificates of Merger") to be filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the DLLCA and with the Secretary of State of the State of New Jersey in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the NJBCA and will take all such
other actions as may be required by Applicable Laws to make the Second Merger
effective as promptly as practicable. The Second Merger will become effective
at the time that the Second Certificate of Merger is accepted for filing by
both the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Secretary of
State of the State of New Jersey, or at such later date and time as is
specified in the Second Certificate of Merger (such time and date being
referred to herein as the "Second Effective Time"). The First Effective Time
shall precede in all events the Second Effective Time.

  



  

1.3 _Effects of the Mergers_.

  



  

(a) The Mergers will have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the
Certificates of Merger and the applicable provisions of the NJBCA, DGCL and

(c) At the Second Effective Time, the certificate of formation and limited
liability company agreement of Merger Sub 2 will, by virtue of the Second

directors of the First Surviving Company immediately following the First
Effective Time, to hold office until their respective successors are duly
elected or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the
First Surviving Company. Each of the Parties will take all necessary action to
cause the manager of Merger Sub 2 immediately prior to the Second Effective
Time to become the manager of the Surviving Company as of the
Second Effective Time.

  



  

(e) The officers (i) of the Company immediately prior to the First Effective
Time, who shall be the Persons named on Schedule 1.3(e), will be the officers
of the Surviving Company immediately following the First Effective Time and
(ii) of Merger Sub 2 immediately prior to the Second Effective Time, who
shall be the persons named on Schedule 1.3(e), will be the officers of the
Surviving Company immediately following the Second Effective Time, and such
officers shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected
or appointed and qualified or their earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the certificate of formation and limited liability company
agreement of the Surviving Company.

  



  

(f) At the First Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without
any action on the part of any Party and subject to delivery by the relevant
Stockholder of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing such
Stockholder's Shares, each duly endorsed in blank or accompanied by a
separate executed stock power or similar document legally sufficient to assign
the Shares to Buyer:

  



  

(i) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger Sub
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the First Effective Time will be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the First Surviving
Company;

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 3 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) the Shares of Company Preferred Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and
Cancelled Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the Preferred Payment;

  



  

(iii) each Share of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares and
Cancelled Shares) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive
(i) a number of shares of Buyer Common Stock equal to the Estimated Purchase
Price divided by $10.00 (in each case, the "Closing Share Consideration"),
(ii) the per share amount of payments, if any, to Common Stockholders
under Section 2.5(c), and (iii) the per share amount of any other release to
Common Stockholders generally under this Agreement, in each case determined
by dividing the aggregate amount of such released amounts by the number of
Fully Diluted Shares (collectively, clauses (i) - (iii), the "Common Share
Merger Consideration"). For the avoidance of doubt, each component of the
Common Share Merger Consideration will be payable only when, as and if, and in
the forms contemplated by the applicable provisions of this Agreement; and

  



  

(iv) each Share that is owned or held in treasury by the Company or that is
owned by Buyer or any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist (the
"Cancelled Shares") and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

  



  

(g) All of the Shares converted into the right to receive the Preferred
Payment or the Common Share Merger Consideration pursuant to this Article 1
shall no longer be outstanding and upon the conversion thereof shall cease to
exist as of the First Effective Time, and uncertificated Shares represented
by book entry form ("Book-Entry Shares") and each certificate
that, immediately prior to the First Effective Time represented any such
Shares (each, a "Certificate") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Preferred Payment or the Common Share Merger Consideration into
which the Shares represented by such Book-Entry Share or Certificate have
been converted pursuant to this Section 1.3, as well as any dividends or
other distributions to which Stockholders become entitled pursuant to Section
1.6.

  



  

1.4 _Conversion of First Surviving Corporation Shares_. At the Second
Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without any action on the
part of any of the Parties or holders of any securities of the First Surviving
Company or of Merger Sub 2, (i) each membership interest of Merger Sub 2
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding as a membership interest of the Surviving
Company and (ii) all shares of common stock of the First Surviving Company
shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist without any consideration being
payable therefor.

  



  

1.5 _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock will be
issued by virtue of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In lieu
of any fractional share of Buyer Common Stock that otherwise would be issuable
pursuant to this Agreement, each Stockholder who otherwise would be entitled
to receive a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock that otherwise be received by that
holder) will be paid an amount in cash determined by multiplying (a) $10.00
by (b) the fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock to which such Stockholder
would otherwise be entitled on a payment date, which such product shall be
rounded up to the nearest penny (the "Fractional Share Cash Amount"). No
such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights, or any other
rights in respect of any fractional share of Buyer Common Stock. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Fractional Share Cash Amount constitutes part of the
Common Share Merger Consideration.

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 4

1.6 _Exchange of Shares_.

  



  

(a) Surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. Upon surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to Buyer, together with the
documents specified in Section 1.3(f), duly completed and validly executed,
the holder of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor the Common Share Merger Consideration or
Preferred Payment, as applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue
on any Fractional Share Cash Amount payable upon surrender of any Certificate
or Book-Entry Share. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section
1.6(a), each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any
time after the First Effective Time to represent only the right to receive,
upon such surrender, the Common Share Merger Consideration or Preferred
Payment, as applicable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to deliver a
Certificate; instead, the Book-Entry Shares of such holder shall be deemed
surrendered and shall forthwith be cancelled.

  



  

(b) Treatment of Unexchanged Shares. No dividends or other distributions, if
any, with a record date after the First Effective Time with respect to Buyer
Common Stock, shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Share of
Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive shares of
Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3 until such holder shall surrender
such Shares in accordance with this Section 1.6. After the surrender in
accordance with this Section 1.6 of a Share to be converted into the right to
receive shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.3, the holder
thereof shall be entitled to receive (in addition to the Common Share Merger
Consideration payable to such holder pursuant to this Section 1.6) any
such dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to the Buyer Common Stock
issuable in respect of such Share of Company Common Stock.

  



  

(c) No Further Ownership Rights in Capital Stock. From and after the First
Effective Time, (i) all holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall
cease to have any rights as stockholders of the Company other than the right
to receive the Preferred Payment or Common Share Merger Consideration into
which the Shares represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement upon the surrender of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share in accordance with Section 1.6(a)
(together with any dividends or other distributions to which such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares become entitled in accordance with
Section 1.6(b)), without interest, and (ii) the stock transfer books of the
Company shall be closed with respect to all Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the First Effective Time. From and after the First Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall remain closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Company of Shares that were outstanding immediately prior to the
First Effective Time. If, at any time after the First Effective Time, any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing Shares are presented
to the Surviving Company or the Buyer for any reason, such Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article
1, subject to Applicable Laws in the case of Dissenting Shares.

  



  

(d) Unclaimed Amounts. Any portion of the Common Share Merger Consideration
or the Preferred Payment (including any interest or other amounts received
with respect thereto) that remains unclaimed by, or otherwise undistributed
to, the holders of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares as of the second
anniversary of the Closing shall, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Company and any holder of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares who has not theretofore complied with this Article
1 shall thereafter look only to Buyer or the Surviving Company (subject to
abandoned property, escheat or similar Applicable Laws), as general creditors
thereof, for satisfaction of its claim for Common Share Merger Consideration
or Preferred Payment which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this Article 1 without interest thereon.

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 5

(e) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Buyer, the Buyer shall deliver, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the applicable Common
Share Merger Consideration or Preferred Payment, as applicable, deliverable
in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

  



  

1.7 _Notices to Stockholders; Dissenting Shares_.

  



  

(a) The Company shall, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the date
hereof, but in any event no later than 15 days after the date of this
Agreement, mail or deliver to each Stockholder a letter from the Company
providing such Stockholder with (i) a brief information statement regarding
the Company and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) the
notification required by Section 14A:5-6 of the NJBCA with respect to the
Written Consent, and (iii) notice in the manner contemplated in Section
14A:11-1 of the NJBCA of such Stockholder's right to dissent to the First
Merger pursuant Section 14A:11-1 of the NJBCA.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
any Shares held by a Stockholder who has neither voted in favor of the
First Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who will have properly
demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with Section 14A:11-1 of the
NJBCA (collectively, the "Dissenting Shares") will not be converted into or
represent the right to receive the Preferred Payment or Common Share Merger
Consideration (or any portion thereof), in respect of such Dissenting
Shares. Such Stockholder will instead be entitled to receive payment of the
appraised value of such Dissenting Share in accordance with the provisions of
Section 14A:11-1 of the NJBCA, except that any Dissenting Share held by a
Stockholder who will have failed to perfect or who effectively will have
withdrawn or otherwise lost his, her, or its rights to appraisal of such
Shares under Section 14A:11-1 of the NJBCA will thereupon be deemed to have
been converted into and to have become exchangeable, as of the First
Effective Time, for the right to receive, in the manner provided in Section
1.6, the Preferred Payment or Common Share Merger Consideration, as
applicable, without any interest thereon.

  



  

(c) At the First Effective Time, any holder of Dissenting Shares will cease
to have any rights with respect thereto, except the rights provided in
Section 14A:11-1 of the NJBCA.

  



  

(d) The Company shall provide Buyer prompt written notice of any demand
received by it for appraisal of Shares, any withdrawal of any such demand and
any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the
First Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such demand, and
Buyer shall have the opportunity and the right to direct all negotiations and
Proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written
consent of Buyer, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.

  



  

1.8 _Transfer Taxes_. All stamp, transfer, documentary, sales, use,
registration and other such taxes, levies and fees (including any penalties
and interest) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Contemplated
Transactions (collectively, the "Transfer Taxes") will be the responsibility
of the Stockholders. The Stockholders will, at their own expense, procure any
stock transfer stamps required by, and properly file on a timely basis all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any Transfer
Tax. No Transfer Taxes will be or become a Liability of Buyer or the Surviving
Company. Each Transfer Tax Return will be prepared by the Party that
customarily has primary responsibility for filing such Transfer Tax Return
pursuant to Applicable Laws. Any Transfer Tax Returns prepared by the Company
pursuant to this Section 1.8 will be made available to Buyer at least ten
Business Days before such Transfer Tax Returns are due to be filed.

(a) $260,000,000,

  



  

(b) plus the amount, if any, by which the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds
the Net Working Capital Target,

2.2 _Calculation of Estimated Purchase Price for Closing_.

  



  

(a) On or before the third Business Day before the Closing Date, the Company
will deliver to Buyer a written statement (the "Estimated Purchase Price
Calculation Statement") setting forth (i) the Company's good faith estimate of
the amount of (A) the Closing Net Working Capital, (B) the Closing
Indebtedness, (C) the Company Transaction Expenses, and (ii) the
Company's resulting good faith estimate of the Aggregate Purchase Price based

certificate signed by an executive officer of the Company certifying that
the estimated Closing Net Working Capital was determined in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement. Schedule 2.2 sets forth the format for the
calculation of the amounts described in this Section 2.2. Concurrently with
delivery of the Estimated Purchase Price Calculation Statement, the Company
will deliver to Buyer wire transfer instructions and other delivery

time to time thereafter, and which shall be orally confirmed, by the Company
(if prior to Closing) or the Stockholder Representative (if after the Closing)
prior to each payment hereunder, the "Wire Transfer Instructions"). Following
the delivery of the Estimated Purchase Price Calculation Statement, if the
Buyer has any objection to any amounts included in the Estimated Purchase
Price Calculation Statement, Buyer and the Company shall reasonably cooperate
in good faith to resolve such objections. If the Company and the Buyer are
unable to resolve any dispute with respect to the Estimated Purchase Price
Calculation Statement, such dispute shall not under any circumstance delay the
Closing, and the amounts set forth in the Estimated Purchase Price
Calculation Statement shall be the amounts used for the purposes of
the Closing.

Each of the Company, Stockholder Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders), Buyer and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that each of them
will have the right to rely on the Allocation Schedule as setting forth a
true, complete and accurate listing of all amounts due to be paid by
Buyer, Merger Sub and the Company at Closing. Buyer, Merger Sub and the
Surviving Company will not have any Liability with respect to the allocation
of proceeds among the Stockholders resulting from any payments made to such
Stockholders pursuant to the Allocation Schedule. The Stockholders, by

Business Combination Agreement| Page 8 
---|--- 

 



    



  

2.5 _Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Buyer's Preparation of the Statement. Within 90 days after the Closing
Date, Buyer will prepare and deliver to each of the
Stockholder Representative and the Buyer Sponsor a statement (the "Final
Purchase Price Calculation Statement") setting forth, in reasonable detail,
Buyer's calculations ("Buyer's Proposed Calculations") of (i) the amount of
the Closing Net Working Capital, (ii) Closing Indebtedness, (iii) Company
Transaction Expenses, and (iv) the resulting Aggregate Purchase Price based
on the foregoing and the other elements set forth in Section 2.1.

  



  

(b) Objections; Resolution of Disputes.

  



  

(i) Unless one or both of the Stockholder Representative and the Buyer
Sponsor notifies Buyer in writing within 45 days after Buyer's delivery of
the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement of any objection to Buyer's
Proposed Calculations (the "Notice of Objection"), the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement will become final and binding on the Parties at the
end of such 45-day period. During such 45-day period, Stockholder
Representative, the Buyer Sponsor and their respective representatives and
advisors will be permitted to review all materials and information used by
Buyer in preparing the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement and Buyer
will make available such personnel as are reasonably necessary to assist
Stockholder Representative or the Buyer Sponsor in its respective review of
the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement. Any Notice of Objection must
specify in reasonable detail the basis for the objections set forth therein.

  



  

(ii) If either or both of Stockholder Representative and the Buyer Sponsor
(an "Objecting Party") provides a Notice of Objection to Buyer and each other
within such 45-day period, Buyer and the Objecting Party (or the Objecting
Parties, if both the Stockholder Representative and the Buyer Sponsor deliver
a Notice of Objection or elect to participate after the other party delivers a
Notice of Objection) will, during the 30-day period following Buyer's receipt
of the Notice of Objection, attempt in good faith to resolve the objections
of Stockholders. During such 30-day period, Buyer and its independent auditors
and other representatives and their advisors will be permitted to review the
working papers of the Objecting Party and, if applicable, their
representatives relating to the Notice of Objection and the basis therefor.
If Buyer and the Objecting Party are unable to resolve all such
objections within such 30-day period, the matters remaining in dispute that
were properly included in the Notice of Objection will be submitted to RSM US
LLP (or, if such firm declines to act, to another nationally recognized public
accounting firm mutually agreed upon by Buyer and the Objecting Party in
writing and, if Buyer and the Objecting Party are unable to so agree within 10
days after the end of such 30-day period, then Buyer and the Objecting Party
will each select such a firm and such firms will jointly select a third
nationally recognized firm to resolve the disputed matters (such selected firm
being the "Independent Accounting Firm")). Buyer and the Objecting Party will
instruct the Independent Accounting Firm to render its decision as
promptly as practicable but in no event later than 30 days after its
selection. Buyer and the Objecting Party will further instruct the
Independent Accounting Firm to deliver a written report containing its
calculation of the disputed items and a written explanation in reasonable
detail of each required adjustment to the disputed items, including the basis
for those adjustments. The Independent Accounting Firm will act as an expert
and not an arbitrator to resolve the disputed matters solely based on
submissions made on behalf of Stockholders and Buyer that are consistent with
the terms of this Agreement (and not by independent review or
additional discovery in any form). The Independent Accounting Firm will not
assign a value to any item that is greater than the greater value for such
item claimed by either Party or less than the lesser value for such item
claimed by either Party. The resolution of disputed items by the Independent
Accounting Firm will be final and binding, and the determination of the
Independent Accounting Firm may be enforced as if it were an arbitral award
that is final, binding and non-appealable and upon which a judgment may be
entered by a court having jurisdiction over the Party against which such
determination is to be enforced, absent manifest error. Any Party may seek
specific enforcement or take other necessary legal action to enforce any
decision made by the Independent Accounting Firm. The other Party's only
defense to such a request for specific enforcement or other legal action shall
be manifest error or fraud by or upon the Independent Accounting Firm. The
fees and expenses of the Independent Accounting Firm will be
apportioned between Buyer, on one hand, and the Objecting Party, on the other
hand, based upon the inverse proportion of the amount of the disputed items
on the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement resolved in favor of each of
Buyer and such Person ( _i.e._ , so that the prevailing Party bears a lesser
amount of such fees and expenses), with any expenses that are the
responsibility of the Stockholders being paid out of the shares of Buyer
Common Stock representing the Adjustment Reserve Amount. The Final
Purchase Price Calculation Statement, as adjusted pursuant to this Section
2.5(b)(ii), will be final and binding on the Parties. All information
provided by the Parties to each other and the Independent Accounting Firm
under this Section 2.5 will be held in confidence and will not be further
disclosed by the Parties and the Independent Accounting Firm.

(c) Adjustment Payment. Upon determination, in accordance with Section
2.5(b), of the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement and the final
calculations of the items to be included therein under Section 2.5(a), the
Aggregate Purchase Price will be recalculated using such finally determined
amounts. The following payments, if any, will be deemed to be adjustments to
the Aggregate Purchase Price for all purposes.

  



  

(i) If the Aggregate Purchase Price (as determined under this Section 2.5)
exceeds the Estimated Purchase Price by more than $1,500,000, then Buyer will
deliver or cause to be delivered, no later than three Business Days after the
Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement becomes final and binding under
Section 2.5(b), to each Common Stockholder, in book-entry form shares of
Buyer Common Stock to each Common Stockholder equal to:

  



  

(A) (1) the Adjustment Reserve Amount; multiplied by (2) a fraction equal to
(x) the number of Shares of Company Common Stock held by that Common
Stockholder immediately prior to the First Effective Time divided by (y) the
Fully Diluted Shares (each being that Common Stockholder's "Pro Rata Share");
divided by (3) $10.00; plus

  



  

(B) (1) the lesser of (x) the amount of such excess (above the $1,500,000
threshold) or (y) $3,000,000; multiplied by (2) that Common Stockholder's Pro
Rata Share; divided by (3) $10.00.

  



  

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Aggregate Purchase Price (as
determined under this Section 2.5) by more than $1,500,000, then no later
than three Business Days after the Final Purchase Price Calculation Statement
becomes final and binding under Section 2.5(b), Stockholder Representative
and Buyer Sponsor will provide joint instructions to the Buyer to release from
Buyer's reserve established pursuant to Section 2.4(b) a number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock equal to the lesser of (1) the amount of such excess
(above the $1,500,000 threshold) divided by $10.00, and (2) the number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock representing the Adjustment Reserve Amount. The
Adjustment Reserve Amount is Buyer's sole and exclusive source of recovery of
any amount by which the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Aggregate
Purchase Price by more than $1,500,000. Such instructions to the Buyer will
also provide that any shares of Buyer Common Stock representing the balance of
the Adjustment Reserve Amount after the release of reserved shares of Buyer
Common Stock under the previous sentence will be delivered in book-entry form
to the Common Stockholders, with an amount of shares of Buyer Common Stock so
delivered to each Common Stockholder equal to that Common Stockholder's Pro
Rata Share of such remaining amount. Each payment to a Common Stockholder will
be in accordance with the instructions provided by that Common Stockholder to
the Buyer.

(iii) If the Aggregate Purchase Price (as determined under this Section 2.5)
is not more than $1,500,000 more or less than the Estimated Purchase Price,
then no later than three Business Days after the Final Purchase Price
Calculation Statement becomes final and binding under Section 2.5(b),
Stockholder Representative and Buyer Sponsor will provide joint instructions
to the Buyer to release the shares of Buyer Common Stock representing the
Adjustment Reserve Amount and deliver in book-entry form such number of
shares of Buyer Common Stock to each Common Stockholder equal to that Common
Stockholder's Pro Rata Share of such remaining amount. Each payment to a
Common Stockholder will be in accordance with the instructions provided by
that Common Stockholder to the Buyer.

  



  

(d) Adjustment Reserve Amount. The number of shares of Buyer Common Stock
representing the Adjustment Reserve Amount will be held in reserve by Buyer
pursuant to Section 2.4(b).

  



  

(e) Indemnification Expense Reserve Amount.

  



  

(i) The Indemnification Expense Reserve Amount will be $0 if (A) the
Stockholder Litigation is finally settled or resolved by a court prior to
Closing, and (B) the final amount of the DandO Indemnifiable Matters has either
been paid by the Company prior to Closing or is included in the calculation
of the Estimated Purchase Price, whether as Net Working Capital, Indebtedness,
or Company Transaction Expenses.

  



  

(ii) The number of shares of Buyer Common Stock representing the
Indemnification Expense Reserve Amount will be held in reserve by
Buyer pursuant to Section 2.4(c) and this Section 2.5(e). The Indemnification
Expense Reserve Amount will be reduced by any amount required (by final
settlement or court resolution) to be indemnified by the Company after the
Closing Date for any acts or omissions of the Company's current or former
officers, directors, governors, members, partners, or managers in
connection with the Stockholder Litigation (the "DandO Indemnifiable Matters"),
net of any amounts recovered by the Company under any insurance policy
(including any directors' and officers' liability insurance) or other
indemnity, contribution or similar payment received with respect to such
matter. The Company will use reasonable best efforts to collect under all
available insurance policies or indemnity, contribution or other similar
agreements. For the avoidance of doubt, the right of offset against the
Indemnification Expense Reserve Amount shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of the Company and its Affiliates for any DandO Indemnifiable Matters and the
Indemnification Expense Reserve Amount shall not be available to the Company
for any Liability other than a DandO Indemnifiable Matter.

  



  

(iii) The Company will promptly deliver written notice to the Stockholder
Representative and to the Buyer Sponsor of any claim made against the Company
with respect to a DandO Indemnifiable Matter. Such written notice will specify
in reasonable detail the amount of the claim, the basis therefor, and a
summary of rights that are reasonably available to the Company under any
insurance policy, indemnity, contribution or similar agreement with respect
thereto. The Company will provide the Stockholder Representative and the
Buyer Sponsor with any other information reasonably requested by the
Stockholder Representative or by the Buyer Sponsor with respect to any such
claim. Any disputes regarding DandO Indemnifiable Matters or any purported
offset against the Indemnification Expense Reserve Amount shall be resolved
in accordance with Article 11.

(iv) On the earlier to occur of: (A) the final settlement or court resolution
of the Stockholder Litigation or (B) the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, Buyer will release to each Common Stockholder a number of shares of
Buyer Common Stock equal to (x) the remaining Indemnification Expense Reserve
Amount, if any, multiplied by (y) that Common Stockholder's Pro Rata Share,
divided by (z) $10.00.

  



  

(v) If, within the five years following the second anniversary of the Closing
Date, the Company receives any amounts under any insurance policy, indemnity,
contribution or other similar agreement for any DandO Indemnifiable Matters that
were previously deducted from the Indemnification Expense Reserve Amount,
then the Company will promptly distribute those funds to the Common
Stockholders in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares.

  



  

2.6 _Withholding_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, and
for the avoidance of doubt, (a) the payor of each payment made pursuant to
this Agreement shall be entitled to make such payment net of any Taxes
required by Applicable Law to be deducted or withheld from such payment and
(b) any amounts deducted or withheld from any such payment shall be timely
remitted to the applicable Taxing authority and shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
whom such deduction and withholding was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
there shall not be any withholding on account of U.S. federal income Taxes on
a payment to a Stockholder in respect of the Preferred Payment or in respect
of its shares of Common Stock of the Common Share Merger Consideration if the
Stockholder timely provides a valid duly executed IRS Form W-9, W-8BEN or
W-8BEN-E claiming a complete exemption from backup withholding prior to
Closing.

  



  

2.7 _Lock-Up Period; Stop-Transfer Notices_.

  



  

(a) Lock-Up Agreement. Each Common Stockholder agrees that such Common
Stockholder shall not Transfer any Buyer Common Stock issued to such Common
Stockholder as part of the Closing Share Consideration that may have been
issued to such Common Stockholder prior to the earlier of (i) the first
anniversary of the Closing Date, (ii) the date, following the 180th day after
the Closing Date, on which the VWAP of Buyer Common Stock equals or exceeds
$15.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends,
reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), (iii) the date, following
the 270th day after the Closing Date, on which the VWAP of Buyer Common
Stock equals or exceeds $13.00 per share (as adjusted for stock splits, stock
dividends, reorganizations, recapitalizations and the like), or (iv) Buyer's
completion of a liquidation, merger, stock exchange or other similar
transaction that results in all of Buyer's stockholders having the right to
exchange their shares of Buyer Common Stock for cash, securities or other
property (the "Lock-up Period").

  



  

(b) Permitted Transfers. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Lock-up
Period, Transfers of Closing Share Consideration are permitted to be made (i)
in the case of an entity, as a distribution to its partners, stockholders or
members; (ii) in the case of an individual, by a bona fide gift to one of the
members of the individual's immediate family or to a trust, the beneficiary
of which is a member of the individual's immediate family, for estate planning
purposes; (iii) in the case of an individual, by virtue of laws of descent
and distribution upon death of the individual; (iv) in the case of
an individual, pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order; (v) if
consented to in advance by the Post-Closing Buyer Board; provided, however,
that in each case of clauses (i) through (iv), the permitted transferees must
enter into a written agreement agreeing to be bound by these transfer
restrictions and the other terms described in this Section 2.7 to the extent
and for the duration that such terms remain in effect at the time of the
Transfer.

(c) Stop-Transfer Notice. Each holder of Buyer Common Stock, inclusive of any
Person to whom shares of Buyer Common Stock have been Transferred by a Common
Stockholder in accordance with Section 2.7(b)) (each, a "Holder") of Buyer
Common Stock issued pursuant to this Agreement hereby authorizes Buyer during
each applicable Lock-Up Period to cause its transfer agent for the shares of
Buyer Common Stock that are subject to restriction on Transfer during the
applicable Lock-Up Period ("Lock-up Shares") to decline to transfer, and to
note stop transfer restrictions on the stock register and other records
relating to, such Lock-up Shares for which the undersigned is the record
holder and, in the case of Lock-up Shares for which the Holder is the
beneficial holder but not the record holder, such Holder agrees during the
applicable Lock-Up Period to cause the record holder to cause the relevant
transfer agent to decline to transfer, and to note stop transfer
restrictions on the stock register and other records relating to, such Lock-
up Shares, if such Transfer would constitute a violation or breach of this
Agreement. In addition, any Holder who is not a resident of the United States
and is not an accredited investor as defined under Rule 501 of Regulation D
under the Securities Act hereby authorizes Buyer to instruct its transfer
agent to note that such Transaction Securities were issued under an exemption
from registration under Regulation S and to utilize the CREST
electronic clearing system for the purpose of compliance with legend and
transfer restriction requirements as provided for by Regulation S. In
addition, each Holder agrees that Buyer may issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to its transfer agent in order to ensure compliance with the
Securities Act, including as to Regulation S as applicable.

  



  

(d) Releases from Lock-Ups. Buyer will not grant an early release or waiver
of the restrictions imposed by any lock-up agreement upon the Buyer Sponsor
or the Common Stockholders during the Lock-Up Period unless a similar release
or waiver, on a pro rata basis, is provided to the Common Stockholders or the
Buyer Sponsor, respectively, from any such Person's lock-up agreement.
Except as provided in this Section 2.7, Buyer shall not release, amend or
waive the Sponsor Lock-Up Agreement or any lock-up agreement of any Common
Stockholder and shall enforce any violations thereof

  



  

2.8 _Equity Incentive Plan_. Not less than five Business Days prior to the
filing with the SEC of the Schedule TO, the board of directors of Buyer shall

Company, that provides for the issuance of restricted stock units and other
forms of equity incentive awards by Buyer subject to an aggregate cap on such
awards equal to 12% of the number of shares of Buyer Common Stock on a fully-
diluted basis (the "Post-Closing Equity Incentive Plan").

Document of the Company; (ii) violate any Applicable Law; (iii) constitute a
breach or violation of or a default under, conflict with or give rise to or
create any right of any Person other than the Company to accelerate, increase,

than a Permitted Encumbrance, of the Company under any Major Contract; or
(iv) result in the creation or imposition of any Encumbrance on the
Shares, except where such a breach, violation, default, conflict or right

on Form 10-Q for each fiscal quarter that Buyer filed such reports to disclose
its quarterly financial results and (iii) all other forms, reports,

required by (A) Rules 13a-14 or 15d-14 under the Exchange Act and (B) 18
U.S.C. §1350 (Section 906 of SOX) with respect to any report referred to in
clause (i) above (collectively, the "Public Certifications"). The SEC Reports
(x) were prepared in all material respects in accordance with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act, as the case may be,
and the rules and regulations thereunder to the extent in effect at the time
of filing and (y) except to the extent an SEC Report has been revised,
amended, supplemented or superseded by a later-filed SEC Report that has been
filed prior to the date of this Agreement, and did not, as of their
respective effective dates (in the case of SEC Reports that are registration
statements filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and at
their respective filing dates with the SEC (in the case of all other SEC
Reports) contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. The Public Certifications are each true as of
their respective dates of filing with the SEC. As used in this Section 5.5,
the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include any manner permitted by
SEC rules and regulations in which a document or information is
furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC. (I) The Buyer
Public Units, the Buyer Common Stock, and the Buyer Public Warrants are
listed on the NYSE (or such other nationally recognized stock exchange on
which shares of Buyer Common Stock may then be listed), (II) Buyer has not
received any written deficiency notice from the NYSE (or such other nationally
recognized stock exchange on which shares of Buyer Common Stock are then
listed) relating to the continued listing requirements of such Buyer
Securities, (III) there are no Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of
Buyer, Threatened against Buyer by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority or any other Person with respect to the continued
listing of such Buyer Securities on the NYSE (or such other
nationally recognized stock exchange on which shares of Buyer Common Stock
are then listed), including any intention by such entity to suspend, prohibit
or terminate the quoting of such Buyer Securities on the NYSE (or such other
nationally recognized stock exchange on which shares of Buyer Common Stock
are then listed) and (IV) such Buyer Securities are in compliance with all of
the applicable listing and corporate governance rules of the NYSE (or such
other nationally recognized stock exchange).

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 30

(b) None of (i) any current report on Form 8-K, and any exhibits thereto or
any other report, form, registration or other filing made with any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; (ii) the Information Statement; or (iii) the mailings or other
distributions to Buyer's stockholders or prospective investors with
respect to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or in any amendment to any of documents identified in (i)
through (iii), will, when filed, made available, mailed or distributed, as
the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
are made, not misleading.

  



  

(c) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference
in the SEC Reports (the "Buyer Financials"), fairly present in all material
respects the financial position and the results of operations, changes in
shareholders' equity, and cash flows of Buyer at the respective dates of and
for the periods referred to in such financial statements, all in
accordance with (i) GAAP methodologies applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved and (ii) Regulation S-X or Regulation S-K
promulgated by the SEC, as applicable (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto and for the omission of notes and audit adjustments in the case of
unaudited quarterly financial statements to the extent permitted by Regulation
S-X or Regulation S-K, as applicable).

  



  

(d) Buyer has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph (e) of Rule
15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act. Buyer's disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial) required to be
disclosed by Buyer in the reports that it files or furnishes under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to Buyer's management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of SOX.
Buyer's management has completed an assessment of the effectiveness
of Buyer's disclosure controls and procedures and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, presented in any applicable SEC Report, or any amendment
thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or
amendment based on such evaluation. Based on Buyer's management's most
recently completed evaluation of Buyer's internal control over financial
reporting, (i) Buyer had no significant deficiencies or material weaknesses
in the design or operation of its internal control over financial reporting
that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect Buyer's ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial information and (ii) Buyer
does not have Knowledge of any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Buyer's internal
control over financial reporting.

Financials, Buyer has not incurred any liabilities or obligations of the type
required to be reflected on a balance sheet in accordance with GAAP that is

or understandings that would cause the description of the Trust Agreement in

solely for Buyer's own account and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution or other disposition thereof in violation of
the Securities Act or any applicable state securities law. Buyer acknowledges

5.21 _Independent Investigation; No Reliance_. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by Buyer is not done in reliance
upon any representation or warranty by, or information from, the Company, any
Stockholder, or any of their respective Affiliates, employees, or
representatives, whether oral or written, express or implied, including any
implied warranty of merchantability or of fitness for a particular purpose,
except for the representations and warranties specifically and expressly set
forth in Article 3 (as modified by the Disclosure Schedule), and Buyer
acknowledges that the Stockholders and the Company expressly disclaim any
other representations and warranties. The consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement by Buyer is instead done entirely on the basis
of Buyer's own investigation, analysis, judgment, and assessment of the
present and potential value and earning power of the Company, as well as
those representations and warranties by the Company and the Stockholders
specifically and expressly set forth in Article 3 (as modified by the
Disclosure Schedule). Buyer acknowledges that neither the Company nor any
Stockholder has made any representations or warranties to Buyer regarding the
probable success or profitability of the Company or the Business. Buyer

business or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement not specifically

Schedule), and none of the Company, the Stockholders, or any other Person will
have or be subject to any Liability to Buyer or any other Person resulting

such information, including any confidential information memoranda distributed
on behalf of the Company relating to the Business or other publications or
data room (including any electronic or "virtual" data room) information
provided or made available to Buyer or its representatives, or any other
document or information in any form provided or made available to Buyer or
its representatives, including any management presentations, in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

5.22 _Brokers_. Except as provided in Section 5.22 of the Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, Buyer does not have any Liability to any broker, finder or similar
intermediary in connection with the transactions contemplated herein that

any fee or expense with respect thereto.

  



  

ARTICLE 6 
  _CERTAIN COVENANTS_

  



  

6.1 _Certain Actions to Close Transactions_.

  



  

(a) Consents and Notifications Generally. On the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement (including Sections 6.1(b) and 6.1(c)), the
Company and Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) take, or
cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things,
necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to Closing to be
satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most
expeditious manner practicable, consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including preparing and filing promptly and fully all
documentation to effect all necessary filings, notifications, notices,
petitions, statements, registrations, submissions of information,
applications and other documents (including any required or recommended
filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain as promptly as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) all approvals,
consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
registrations, permits, authorizations and other confirmations from any
Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper or advisable to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) defend any
Proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement
or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
(iv) obtain as promptly as practicable all necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties. For purposes of this Agreement, "Antitrust Laws"
means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act,
the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and all other Applicable Laws
that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or
lessening of competition through merger or acquisition. None of the Company,
Stockholders, or Buyer will, nor will they permit any of their respective
Affiliates to, take any actions that would, or that could reasonably be
expected to, result in any of the conditions set forth in Article 6 either
being delayed or not being satisfied.

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 36 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Antitrust Notification. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, the Company and Buyer will (i) as promptly as practicable, but in
no event later than 10 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, file or
cause to be filed with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice
(the "DOJ") a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) supply as
promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested by the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental Authority
pursuant to the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken (including by
their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions consistent with this
Section 6.1 necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act as soon as practicable (and in any event no
later than the Outside Date). The Company and Buyer will furnish to the other
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request
in connection with its preparation of any filing or submission under the HSR
Act or such other Antitrust Law.

  



  

(c) Antitrust Actions. Buyer agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including
by its Affiliates), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made, any
and all undertakings necessary to resolve such objections, if any, that a
Governmental Authority may assert under any Antitrust Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to avoid or eliminate each
and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may be asserted by any
Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, in each case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as practicable and in any event no later than the Outside Date,
including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of Buyer (or its Affiliates), (ii) creating, terminating, or
divesting relationships, ventures, contractual rights, or obligations of Buyer
or its Affiliates and (iii) otherwise taking or committing to take any action
that would limit Buyer's freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to
retain or hold, directly or indirectly, any businesses, assets, equity
interests, product lines, or properties of Buyer or its Affiliates, in each
case as may be required in order to obtain all approvals, consents,
clearances, expirations, or terminations of waiting periods, registrations,
permits, authorizations, and other confirmations required directly or
indirectly under any Antitrust Law or to avoid the commencement of any action
to prohibit the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any
Antitrust Law, or, in the alternative, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in
any Proceeding seeking to prohibit the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or delay the Closing beyond the Outside Date. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Agreement requires the Company or any Stockholder to,
and Buyer may not and may not agree to, divest, hold separate, or otherwise
take any action that limits Buyer's, the Company's, any Stockholder's or
their respective Affiliates' freedom of action, ownership or control with
respect to, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests, product lines or
properties of the Company, any Stockholder, or any of their respective
Affiliates.

  



  

(d) Antitrust Proceedings. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
covenants of the Parties contained in this Section 6.1, if any Proceeding,
including any Proceeding by a private party, is instituted (or Threatened to
be instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
the Ancillary Documents as violative of any Antitrust Law, the Company and
Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any such
Proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order,
whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that
prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 37 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Cooperation. The Company and Buyer will use (and will cause their
respective Affiliates to use) its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and in connection with any investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any Proceeding
initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform the other Party of (and
supply to the other Party) any communication received by such Party from, or
given by such Party to, the FTC, the DOJ, or any other Governmental Authority
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
Proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) permit the other Party to review in
advance and incorporate the other Party's reasonable comments in any
communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority with respect to
obtaining any clearances required under any Antitrust Law in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) consult with the
other Party in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the Governmental Authority
or other Person, give the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate in such meetings and teleconferences. The Parties will take
reasonable efforts to share information protected from disclosure under the
attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or
any other privilege pursuant to this Section in a manner so as to preserve
the applicable privilege.

  



  

(f) No Liability for Unobtained Consents and Permits. Except the obligation
to use commercially reasonable efforts set forth in Section 6.1 (or as a
result of a breach of any representation or warranty in Article 3), none of
the Company or any Stockholder will have any obligation whatsoever to Buyer
arising out of, relating to, or resulting from the failure to obtain any
Consent or Permit (provided that the Company and the Stockholders have
performed their obligations under this Agreement). No term of this Agreement
will be breached, and no condition will be deemed not satisfied as a result of
(i) the failure to obtain any Consent or Permit or (ii) any Proceeding
commenced or Threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of, relating
to, or resulting from the failure to obtain any Consent or Permit.

  



  

6.2 _Access to Information_.

  



  

(a) Pre-Closing Access for Buyer. From the date hereof through Closing,
subject to the Nondisclosure Agreement and the reasonable
confidentiality precautions of the Company, the Company will (i) cause Buyer
and its representatives to have reasonable access during normal business
hours and upon prior consent of the Company (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), to the facilities, books and records of the Company
for the opportunity to investigate the Business, and (ii) furnish to Buyer and
its representatives such additional financial and operating data and other
information relating to the Business as Buyer reasonably requests. Buyer and
its representatives will conduct such investigation in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Company and will not have
access to any personnel without the written consent of the Chief Executive
Officer of the Company. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company obtained by Buyer or any of its representatives
pursuant to this Section 6.2(a) will be kept confidential in accordance with
the Nondisclosure Agreement. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2 obligates
the Company or any of its Affiliates to (1) violate any Applicable Law, (2)
breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any Person whether such duty
arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise (provided that the Company
will, and will cause its Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third-party consents or waivers that would permit the supply of
such information), or (3) jeopardize the protection of any attorney-client or
attorney work product privilege or similar privilege.

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 38 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Post-Closing Access for the Stockholders and Buyer Sponsor. Throughout
the seven-year period after Closing, subject to Buyer's
reasonable confidentiality precautions, Buyer will, during normal business
hours and upon reasonable notice from any Stockholder or the Buyer Sponsor:
(i) cause the Stockholder, the Stockholder Representative, the Buyer Sponsor
and their respective representatives to have reasonable access to the books
and records (including financial and Tax records, Tax Returns, files, papers
and related items) of the Company, and to the personnel responsible for
preparing and maintaining such books and records, in each case to the extent
necessary or reasonably desirable to (1) defend or pursue any Proceeding, (2)
prepare or audit financial statements, (3) prepare or file Tax Returns, or
(4) address Tax, accounting, financial or legal matters or respond to any
investigation or other inquiry by or under the control of any Governmental
Authority; and (ii) permit the Stockholders, Stockholder Representative, the
Buyer Sponsor and their respective representatives to make copies of such
books and records for the foregoing purposes, at their expense. If requested
by Buyer, the applicable Stockholder or the Buyer Sponsor will provide
reasonable substantiation of the purpose for such access to show that such
access is for any of the foregoing purposes. Nothing contained in this
Section 6.2 obligates Buyer or any of its Affiliates to (1) violate any
Applicable Law, (2) breach any duty of confidentiality owed to any Person
whether such duty arises contractually, statutorily or otherwise (provided
that Buyer will, and will cause its Affiliates to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any third-party consents or waivers that would
permit the supply of such information), or (3) jeopardize the protection of
any attorney-client or attorney work product privilege or similar privilege.

  



  

(c) Post-Closing Retention of Information by the Stockholders and Buyer
Sponsor. At and after Closing, the Stockholders and the Buyer Sponsor may
retain in their (or any of its Affiliates' or representatives') respective
possession, subject to Buyer's reasonable confidentiality precautions, any
copies of any books or records of such types described in Section 6.2(b) that
are in the possession or control of the Stockholders, Stockholder
Representative or the Buyer Sponsor (or the possession or control of any of
their respective Affiliates or representatives), in each case for any purpose
described in Section 6.2(b).

  



  

6.3 _Further Assurances_. If after Closing any further action is necessary,
proper or desirable to carry out any purpose of this Agreement, then each
Party will take such further action (including the execution and delivery of
further documents) as the other Party reasonably requests to carry out such
purpose. The foregoing will be at the expense of such requesting Party, except
to the extent this Agreement otherwise allocates such expense to any other
Party.

  



  

6.4 _Confidentiality and Publicity_.

  



  

(a) Nondisclosure Agreement. Subject to the other terms of this Section 6.4,
each Party acknowledges that the information being furnished or made
available to it in connection with the transactions contemplated under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents is subject to the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement between the Company and Buyer, dated July 24, 2020
(the "Nondisclosure Agreement"), the terms of which are incorporated herein
by reference. Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Nondisclosure
Agreement will terminate with respect to information relating exclusively to
the Company.

  



  

(b) Confidentiality. From and after the Closing, each Stockholder shall keep
confidential any and all non-public information relating to the Company or
the Business; provided, however, that no Stockholder shall be liable hereunder
with respect to any disclosure to the extent such disclosure is determined by
that Stockholder (with the advice of counsel) to be required or requested in
connection with any Applicable Law or Order and provided further that a
Stockholder may disclose any such information as reasonably necessary to
perform its obligations or enforce its rights under this Agreement and the
Ancillary Documents. If a Stockholder is required or requested in connection
with any Applicable Law or Order to disclose any non-public information, that
Stockholder shall (i) to the extent permissible by such Applicable Law or
Order, provide Buyer with prompt written notice of such requirement,
(ii) disclose only that information that the Stockholder determines (with
advice of counsel) is required or requested to be disclosed, and (iii) use
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such non-public
information, including by, at Buyer's request, reasonably cooperating with
Buyer (at Buyer's sole cost and expense) to obtain an appropriate protective
order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment will be
accorded such non-public information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, such
non-public information shall not include information that is or becomes
available to the public after the Closing other than as a result of a
disclosure by a Stockholder in breach of this Section 6.4(b).

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 39 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Publicity. Except as stated in this Agreement (including Section 8.6) or
as required by Applicable Law or the rules or regulations of the NYSE (or
such other nationally recognized stock exchange on which shares of Buyer
Common Stock are then listed), each Party will not, and each Party will cause
each of its Affiliates not to, make any public release or announcement
regarding this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated herein
without the prior written approval thereof of each Party provided,
however, that each Party may make any such announcement which it in good
faith believes, based on advice of legal counsel, is necessary or advisable
in connection with any requirement of Applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of the NYSE (or such other nationally recognized stock exchange
on which shares of Buyer Common Stock are then listed), it being understood
and agreed that each Party will, to the extent reasonably practicable, confer
with the other Parties concerning the timing and content of such press
release or public announcement before the same is made and will consider in
good faith any comments made by the other Parties.

  



  

6.5 _Notification of Changes_. From the date of this Agreement until the
earlier to occur of (a) the Closing or (b) termination of this Agreement in
accordance with the provisions of Section 9.3 (the "Interim Period"), each
Party shall promptly advise the others in writing of (i) any event occurring
subsequent to the date of this Agreement that would render the
representations or warranties of that Party contained in this Agreement
untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 10.2(a) or
Section 10.3(a), as applicable, would not be satisfied, (ii) any breach of the
covenants or obligations of that Party under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Document to which it is a party such that the condition set forth in Section
10.2(b) or Section 10.3(b), as applicable, would not be satisfied (except to
the extent such covenant or obligation shall by its terms be complied with or
satisfied at the Closing), (iii) any Material Adverse Effect on that Party. In
no event shall the giving of any such notice be deemed to cure any breach of
this Agreement or to modify the Disclosure Schedule or Buyer Disclosure
Schedule, as applicable, in each case, except if the Closing occurs.

  



  

6.6 _Post-Closing Board of Directors_. The Parties shall take all necessary
action so that the Post-Closing Buyer Directors are the board of directors of
Buyer.

7.3 _Cooperation with Information Statement and SEC Filings_.

  



  

(a) Prior to the Closing and in connection with Buyer's preparation of the
Information Statement, any other filing required to be made by Buyer with the
SEC under the Exchange Act or any responses to any comments from the SEC
relating to the Information Statement, the Schedule TO or other required
filings, the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
to Buyer, and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Representatives, including legal and accounting representatives, to
provide all cooperation reasonably requested by Buyer that is customary in
connection with the preparation of the Information Statement, Schedule TO and
such other filings or responses to SEC comments, which may include, among
other things, obtaining the consents of any auditor to the inclusion of the
financial statements of Company in the Information Statement and other filings
with the SEC. The Company agrees that it will use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide all information reasonably necessary for Buyer to prepare
and file the Information Statement and Schedule TO no later than October 2,
2020 (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter).

  



  

(b) The Company and Buyer shall ensure that none of the information supplied
by or on its behalf for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Information Statement will, at the date it is first mailed to the stockholders
of Buyer, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading. If at any time prior to the Closing any information
relating to the Company or Buyer, or any of their respective Affiliates,
directors or officers is discovered by the Company or Buyer that is required
to be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement so
that such document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information
shall promptly notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated to the stockholders of Buyer.

  



  

7.4 _Written Consent_. No later than one Business Days following the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by all Parties, the Company shall
deliver to Buyer a copy of the executed Written Consent.

  



  

7.5 _Stockholders Agreement_. The Company and the Stockholders shall take all
necessary action to cause the Stockholders Agreement to be
terminated effective immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

ARTICLE 8 
  _CERTAIN COVENANTS OF BUYER_

  



  

8.1 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) Compensation and Severance. Throughout the 12-month period after Closing,
Buyer will, or will cause one or more of Buyer's Affiliates (including the
Company) to, provide to each employee of the Company (i) base salary or hourly
wages which are no less than the base salary or hourly wages provided by the
Company immediately prior to the Closing and (ii) target bonus and incentive
opportunities which are no less than the target bonus and incentive
opportunities, if any, provided by the Company immediately prior to the
Closing. If any employee of the Company is terminated by the Company during
the 12-month period after Closing in circumstances under which such employee
would have been entitled to receive severance benefits immediately prior to
the Closing, the Company will provide severance benefits to such individuals
which are no less than those provided by the Company immediately prior to the
Closing.

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 43 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Employee Benefits. Throughout the 12-month period after Closing, Buyer
will, or will cause one or more of Buyer's Affiliates (including the Company)
to, provide to each employee of the Company (and their dependents) employee
benefits that as a whole are at least comparable in all material respects to
the employee benefits received by the employees (and their dependents) as
employees of the Company immediately before Closing. Without limiting any
obligation already existing, for purposes of eligibility and vesting for all
benefits and for purposes of accruals or entitlement to vacation, sick leave,
paid time off, severance and similar benefits, Buyer will cause each employee
of the Company to be given or retain (as applicable) full credit under the
employee benefits of Buyer and its Affiliates (including the Company) after
Closing for such employee's service with the Company or Affiliate before
Closing (including the full carryover to such benefits or retention, as
applicable, of any earned, but unused, time or pay with respect to the
foregoing). Each such employee (and such dependent) will be allowed to
participate in such employee benefits without regard to preexisting
conditions, waiting periods, evidence of insurability or other exclusions or
limitations not imposed on such individual by, or which were otherwise
satisfied under, the Company's employee benefit arrangements before
Closing. Buyer will apply or credit (or cause to be applied or credited)
toward any deductible requirements under all welfare benefit Plans all
amounts paid by employees (or dependents) under the welfare benefit Plans of
the Company during the Company Plan year in which the Closing Date occurs.

  



  

(c) Certain COBRA Obligations. At all times from and after Closing, Buyer
will, or will cause an Affiliate of Buyer to, make available all COBRA
Coverage, with respect to current or former employees of the Company or their
dependents who are classified as "MandA Qualified Beneficiaries" within the
meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9. "COBRA Coverage" means the
continuation of health coverage requirements of Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title
I of ERISA as added by COBRA and subsequent amendments or similar Applicable
Law.

  



  

(d) No Amendment of Benefits nor Third-Party Beneficiary. Without limiting
Sections 11.6 and 11.9, (i) no Company Plan or other employee benefit is or
will be deemed to be amended by any term hereof and (ii) no Person, including
any employee (or dependent thereof) of the Company, is a third-party
beneficiary of any term of this Agreement.

  



  

8.2 _Exculpation and Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. Throughout
the six-year period after Closing, Buyer will prevent the amendment, repeal
or modification of any provision in any Organizational Document of the Company
(including, as result of the Mergers, the Organizational Documents of the
Surviving Company) relating to exculpation or indemnification and hereby
guaranties, and agrees to promptly pay or cause to be paid, all amounts
required to be indemnified by the Surviving Company for acts or omissions
prior to the First Effective Time of the Company's former officers,
directors, governors, members, partners, or managers holding office before
the First Effective Time (except to the extent required by Applicable Law), it
being the intent of the Parties that such officers, directors, governors,
members, partners, or managers will continue to be entitled to such
exculpation and indemnification for such acts or omissions to the greatest
extent permitted under Applicable Law. Throughout the six-year period after
Closing, Buyer will maintain (or cause to be maintained) in effect directors'
and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions occurring before
the First Effective Time of such officers, directors, governors, members,
partners, or managers on terms no less favorable than those of the current
directors' and officers' liability insurance; provided, however, that in no
event will Buyer be required to expend (or cause to be expended) in any one
year an amount exceeding 250% of the annual premium currently paid by the
Company for such current coverage; and, provided, further, that if the annual
premium for such coverage exceeds such amount, then Buyer will be obligated
to maintain (or cause to be maintained) a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
at any time prior to the First Effective Time, the Company may cause the
Company to purchase "tail" directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies, covering the same persons and providing the same terms
with respect to coverage and amount as aforesaid, and the terms of which will
provide coverage until the sixth anniversary of the Closing, and upon the
purchase of such insurance, Buyer's obligations under the immediately
preceding sentence will be deemed satisfied. Buyer's obligations under this
Section will not be terminated or modified in a manner that adversely affects
any Person to whom this Section relates with respect to acts or omissions
prior to the First Effective Time without the consent of such affected Person
(it being expressly agreed that each such Person to whom this Section relates
will be a third-party beneficiary of this Section).

8.3 _No Shop_. Throughout the period that begins on the date hereof and ends
upon the earlier of the First Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3, Buyer will not, and will cause each
authorized representative or agent of Buyer not to, directly or indirectly,
solicit, initiate, seek, or encourage any inquiry, proposal, or offer from,
furnish any information to, or participate in any discussion or negotiation
with any Person (other than the Company, the Stockholders or any Person on
their behalf) regarding any transaction (other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) that would constitute a Business Combination.

  



  

8.4 _Pre-Closing Conduct of Business by Buyer_. Except as expressly
contemplated in this Agreement, as required under Applicable Law or
any Contract in existence on the date of this Agreement to which Buyer is a
party, or as otherwise consented to in writing by the Company (which consent
will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed), from the date of
this Agreement through Closing:

  



  

(a) Buyer will conduct its business in its Ordinary Course of Business;
provided, however, that no action or failure to take action by Buyer with
respect to the matters addressed in Section 8.4(b) shall constitute a breach
of this Section 8.4(a) unless such action or failure to take such action
would also constitute a breach of Section 8.4(b); and

  



  

(b) the Company will not do any of the following:

  



  

(i) except as mutually agreed in writing by Buyer and the Company, issue or
otherwise allow to become outstanding or redeem or otherwise acquire any
equity interest of Buyer or right to any such equity interest;

  



  

(ii) split, combine, or reclassify any equity interests of Buyer;

  



  

(iii) make any purchase, sale, or disposition of any material asset
(including by merging, consolidating or entering into a business
combination with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the stock or
assets of, any other Person);

  



  

(iv) grant any Encumbrance on any material asset, other than (i) pursuant to
a Buyer Major Contract (or a Contract not required to be disclosed in the
Disclosure Schedule to avoid a breach under Section 5.9) or (ii) any Permitted
Encumbrance;

  



  

(v) become a guarantor with respect to any obligation of any other Person or
assume any obligation of any such Person for borrowed money;

  



  

(vi) incur any indebtedness for borrowed money that cannot be prepaid at any
time without penalty;

  



  

(vii) except in its Ordinary Course of Business, enter into any Contract that
would, if existing on the date hereof, be a "Buyer Major Contract," or amend
or terminate any Buyer Major Contract in any respect that is material and
adverse to Buyer;

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 45 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(viii) (i) fail to prepare and timely file all material Tax Returns with
respect to Tax Returns required to be filed by Buyer before Closing or timely
withhold and remit any Taxes or (ii) make or change any material election with
respect to Taxes;

  



  

(ix) (i) adopt or change any material accounting method or principle, except
as required under GAAP or (ii) change any annual accounting period;

  



  

(x) amend any of its Organizational Documents;

  



  

(xi) pay, discharge, settle or satisfy any material Liability, except in its
Ordinary Course of Business;

  



  

(xii) commence or settle any litigation claim that is pending or Threatened
against, relating to or involving Buyer;

  



  

(xiii) file a petition in bankruptcy under any provisions of federal or state
bankruptcy law or consent to the filing of any bankruptcy petition against
such entity under any other similar Applicable Law;

  



  

(xiv) establish any Subsidiary or enter into any new line of business;

  



  

(xv) enter into any Contract with respect to the voting of Buyer Securities;

  



  

(xvi) make any capital expenditure;

  



  

(xvii) take any action that would reasonably be expected to significantly
delay or impair (A) the timely filing of any of its public filings with the
SEC (giving effect to permitted extensions), or (B) its compliance in all
material respects with Applicable Laws relating to securities; or

  



  

(xviii) agree or commit to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

8.5 _Use of Trust Account Proceeds_.

  



  

Prior to the Closing, none of the funds held in the Trust Account may be used
or released except (i) for the withdrawal of interest to pay franchise and
income taxes, (ii) up to $187,500 to fund working capital requirements, and
(iii) to effectuate the Tender Offer. The Parties agree that at the Closing,
the funds in the Trust Account, after taking into account payments for the
Redemption, shall first be used (a) to pay the Preferred Payment and (b) up
to $16,400,000 to pay all Buyer Transaction Expenses. Any remaining
proceeds shall be distributed to the Company and used for working capital and
general corporate purposes. Thereafter, the Trust Account and Trust Agreement
shall be terminated.

  



  

8.6 _Tender Offer_.

  



  

(a) Tender Offer. As promptly as practicable, and in any event not more than
the later of 10 days from the date hereof or seven Business Days following
delivery of the Company Historical Financials (the "TO Commencement Date"),
Buyer shall commence (under the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under the Exchange Act)
an offer to purchase all outstanding shares of Buyer Common Stock (the
"Tender Offer") for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount
then on deposit in the Trust Account, less Taxes and interest (the "Tender
Consideration"). Buyer agrees that no shares of Buyer Common Stock held by
Buyer will be tendered in the Tender Offer. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
Parties, Buyer shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (subject to
market conditions) to conduct the Tender Offer without stockholder vote
pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the Exchange Act (as modified,
waived or otherwise agreed to with the SEC) which regulates issuer tender
offers and in compliance with the requirements of Buyer's certificate of
incorporation, and will file Tender Offer documents with the SEC. The
obligation of Buyer to accept for payment shares of Buyer Common Stock validly
tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer shall be
subject to the satisfaction of each of the conditions set forth in the Tender
Offer. Unless agreed to by the Parties or required by the SEC, no material
change (including changing the amount per share offered to the stockholders)
may be made to the Tender Offer which imposes additional conditions to the
Tender Offer or is inconsistent with this Section. The Parties hereby agree
to negotiate in good faith to amend the conditions set forth in the Tender
Offer to reflect any changes that may be reasonably required as a result of
discussions with the SEC or its staff. Unless an extension of the tender
offer period is agreed to by the Parties or is required as a result of a
change required by the SEC, the Tender Offer shall expire on the date that is
20 Business Days following the commencement of the Tender Offer (the "Initial
Expiration Date"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, and subject to the
provisions of Section 9.3, if, at any scheduled expiration of the Tender
Offer, the conditions set forth in the Tender Offer, have not been satisfied
or waived, Buyer may extend the Tender Offer for one or more consecutive
periods beyond the Initial Expiration Date (the Initial Expiration Date as
extended, the "Expiration Time"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer,
without the consent of the Company, may extend the Tender Offer for any
period required by any Applicable Law or any change requested or required by
the SEC, or the staff thereof, applicable to the Tender Offer.

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 46 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Payment Obligations. Subject to the terms of the Tender Offer and this
Agreement and the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions to the
Tender Offer, Buyer shall accept for payment all shares of Buyer Common Stock
validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer
promptly after the Expiration Time and pay for such shares as soon as
practicable (and, in any event, no more than three Business Days) after the
Expiration Time.

  



  

(c) Payments to Persons Other than Registered Holders. If the payment to a
registered holder under the Tender Offer is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing the
shares of Buyer Common Stock is registered on the transfer books of Buyer, it
shall be a condition of payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be
endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes
required by reason of the payment of such consideration to a Person other than
the registered holder of the certificate surrendered, or shall have
established to the reasonable satisfaction of Buyers that such Taxes either
have been paid or are not applicable.

  



  

(d) Offer Documents. As promptly as reasonably practicable on the date of
the commencement of the Tender Offer, Buyer shall file with the SEC a Tender
Offer Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements
thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Tender Offer which shall
contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (an "Offer to
Purchase") and forms of the related letter of transmittal and any related
summary advertisement (such Schedule TOs, Offers to Purchase and such other
documents, together with all supplements and amendments thereto, being
referred to herein collectively as the "Offer Documents"). The Offer
Documents will comply as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and in addition shall contain substantially the same financial and
other information about the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
the redemption rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act
which regulates the solicitation of proxies. Each Party agrees to correct
promptly any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents that
shall have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Buyer
further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so
corrected, to be filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so
corrected, to be disseminated to holders of shares of Buyer Common Stock,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Offer Documents shall
be made by Buyer without the prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned) of the Company. Buyer shall give the
Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the
Offer Documents prior to such documents being filed with the SEC or
disseminated to holders of the shares of Buyer Common Stock and shall give
due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereby by the Company and its counsel. Buyer shall provide the Company and
its counsel with any comments (whether written or oral) that Buyer or its
counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments, shall provide the
Company and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on the responses of Buyer to such comments, shall allow the Company and its
counsel to participate in any discussions with the SEC or its staff, and shall
give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes
suggested thereby by the Company and its counsel.

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 47 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) Company Cooperation. The Company acknowledges that a substantial portion
of the filings with the SEC and mailings to holders of shares of Buyer Common
Stock with respect to the Tender Offer shall include disclosure regarding the
Company and its management, operations and financial condition. Accordingly,
the Company agrees to (i) deliver the Company Historical Financials not later
than October 2, 2020 (or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter) and
(ii) as promptly as reasonably practicable but in no event later than seven
Business Days prior to the TO Commencement Date, provide Buyer with such
information as shall be reasonably requested by Buyer for inclusion in or
attachment to the Offer Documents to be filed or mailed as of and following
the commencement of the Tender Offer, that is accurate in all material
respects and complies as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and in addition shall contain substantially the same financial and
other information about the Company as is required under Regulation 14A
promulgated under the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies
even if such information is not required under the tender offer rules. The
Company understands that such information shall be included in the Offer
Documents or responses to comments from the SEC or its staff in connection
therewith and mailings.  The Company shall make its officers and employees
reasonably available to Buyer and its counsel in connection with the
drafting of such filings and mailings and responding in a timely manner to
comments from the SEC.

  



  

(f) Termination of Tender Offer. Buyer shall not terminate the Tender Offer
prior to any scheduled Expiration Time except in the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.

  



  

(g) Other Actions. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
6.4(c):

  



  

(i) as promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (and in
any event before the opening of trading on the NYSE (or such other nationally
recognized stock exchange on which shares of Buyer Common Stock are then
listed) on the next Business Day thereafter), Buyer and the Company shall
mutually agree on and issue a press release announcing the execution of this
Agreement (the "Signing Press Release"). Immediately after the issuance of
the Signing Press Release (and in any event within four (4) Business Days
after the execution of this Agreement), Buyer shall prepare and file a pre-
commencement Schedule TO-C or Report on Form 8-K pursuant to the Exchange Act
to report the execution of this Agreement, attaching this Agreement, and
describing the terms thereof as required by applicable federal securities
laws, and the Signing Press Release thereto (the "Signing Filing"), which the
Company shall review, comment upon and approve (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to filing; and

  



  

   

Business Combination Agreement| Page 48

(ii) as promptly as practicable after the completion of the Tender Offer,
Buyer shall prepare a draft amendment to Schedule TO or Form 8-K announcing
the completion of the Tender Offer, if applicable, together with, or
incorporating by reference such other information that may be required to be
disclosed with respect to such results, including the Closing of the Business
Combination, if applicable, in any report or form to be filed with the SEC,
which the Company shall review, comment upon and approve (which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to filing.
As promptly as practicable after the completion of the Tender Offer, Buyer
and the Company shall mutually agree on and issue a press release announcing
the results of the Tender Offer and, if applicable, the consummation of the
Business Combination ("Closing Press Release") and if applicable, Buyer shall
prepare a draft Form 8-K announcing the completion of the Tender Offer, which
the Company shall review, comment upon and approve (which approval shall not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) prior to filing ("Closing
Filing"). Concurrently with the Closing, if not included in the same filings
after completion of the Tender Offer, Buyer and the Company shall mutually
agree on, and Buyer shall distribute, the Closing Press Release and Buyer
shall file the Closing Filing with the SEC as soon as reasonably practicable
thereafter.

  



  

8.7 _Registration Rights Agreement_. Buyer agrees to execute and deliver a
Registration Rights Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 8.7 (the
"Registration Rights Agreement") with the other parties thereto at
Closing, which shall include all of the Stockholders.

  



  

8.8 _Sponsor Lock-Up Restriction_. Buyer shall, within one day following the
date of this Agreement, enter into an amended and restated lock-up agreement
with the Buyer Sponsor on the same terms as those provided in Section 2.7 (the
"Sponsor Lock-Up Agreement").

  



  

8.9 _Blue Sky Laws_. Buyer shall take such steps as may be necessary to
comply with the securities and blue sky laws of all jurisdictions which are
applicable to the issuance of the Buyer Common Stock in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the registration and resale
of the Buyer Common Stock pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. The
Company shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer, at Buyer's reasonable request,
to assist Buyer to comply with the securities and blue sky laws of
all jurisdictions which are applicable in connection with the issuance of
Buyer Common Stock in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the registration and re-sale of the Buyer Common Stock pursuant
to the Registration Rights Agreement.

  



  

8.10 _Stockholder Consent and Information Statement_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement and in lieu of calling a meeting of the Buyer's stockholders, the
Buyer shall submit to certain of the Buyer's stockholders holding, in the
aggregate, a number of shares of Buyer Securities sufficient to approve the
Buyer Stockholder Approval Matters by the Required Buyer Stockholder Approval,
(i) within one Business Day after the date hereof, the form of irrevocable
written consent attached hereto as Exhibit 8.10(a)(i) of this Agreement, and
(ii) no later than one Business Day prior to the date of the Information
Statement, the form of irrevocable written consent attached hereto as Exhibit
8.10(a)(ii), (such written consents, as duly executed and delivered by such
Stockholders, and taken together, the "Buyer Stockholders' Written Consent").
As soon as practicable upon receipt of the Buyer Stockholders' Written
Consent by the corporate secretary of the Buyer, the Buyer will provide the
Company with a copy of such Buyer Stockholders' Written Consent, certified as
true and complete by the corporate secretary of the Company. In connection

(b) Buyer shall, promptly following the delivery of the Buyer Stockholders'
Written Consent provide Buyer's stockholders an opportunity in accordance
with the Buyer Organizational Documents and the IPO Prospectus to have their
shares of Buyer Common Stock redeemed (the "Redemption"). The Buyer
Stockholders' Written Consent shall include resolutions in favor of
approving (i) the approval of this Agreement and the transactions

Company and Buyer shall hereafter mutually determine to be necessary or
appropriate in order to effect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the approvals described in foregoing clauses (i) through (vi),
collectively, the "Buyer Stockholder Approval Matters"). As promptly as
practicable following the execution of this Agreement (but in any event not
later than the TO Commencement Date), Buyer shall prepare and file with the
SEC a written information statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2 of
the Exchange Act (such information statement, including any amendment or
supplement thereto, the "Information Statement") containing (i) the
information specified in Schedule 14C under the Exchange Act concerning the
Buyer Stockholders' Written Consent and the Buyer Stockholder Approval, and
(ii) a notice to every Buyer stockholder that did not execute the Buyer
Stockholder Written Consent in accordance with the provisions of this Section
8.10(b) of this Agreement, the Exchange Act, the DGCL and the Organizational
Documents of the Buyer. Each of the Company and the Stockholders shall
promptly furnish to the Buyer all information concerning such Person as may
be reasonably requested in connection with the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Information Statement. The Information Statement shall
comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Exchange Act, the DGCL and the rules of the NYSE (or such other
nationally recognized stock exchange on which shares of Buyer Common
Stock are then listed). If, at any time prior to the date that is twenty (20)
days after the Information Statement is first mailed to the Stockholders, any
information relating to the Buyer, the Company, the Stockholders or any of
their respective affiliates, officers or directors should be discovered by
the Buyer, the Company, or the Stockholders which is required to be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement, so that the
Information Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto,
and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Applicable Law,

ARTICLE 11 
  _CERTAIN GENERAL TERMS AND OTHER AGREEMENTS_

  



  

11.1  _Waiver of Claims Against Trust Account_. Reference is made to the IPO
Prospectus. The Company and each Stockholder represents and warrants that it
has read the IPO Prospectus and understands that Buyer has established the
Trust Account containing the proceeds of the IPO and overallotment shares
acquired by Buyer's underwriters (including interest accrued from time to
time thereon) for the benefit of Buyer's public stockholders (including
overallotment shares acquired by Buyer's underwriters) (the "Public
Stockholders") and that, except as otherwise described in the IPO Prospectus,
Buyer may disburse monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public
Stockholders in the event they elect to redeem their shares of Buyer Common
Stock in connection with the consummation of Buyer's initial business
combination (as such term is used in the IPO Prospectus) ("Business
Combination") or in connection with an extension of the deadline to
consummate a Business Combination, (b) with respect to any interest earned on
the amounts held in the Trust Account, as necessary to pay any franchise or
income Taxes, and (c) to Buyer after or concurrently with the consummation of
its Business Combination. For and in consideration of Buyer entering into
this Agreement and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt
and sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, Company and each Seller
hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its Affiliates that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither the Company nor any
Stockholder does now or shall at any time prior to the Closing have any
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust
Account (or, or at any time hereafter, to distributions therefrom to Public
Stockholders or otherwise occurring prior to the Closing in accordance with
the terms of the Trust Agreement "Public Distributions"), or make any claim
against the Trust Account (including any Public Distributions therefrom),
regardless of whether such claim arises as a result of, in connection with
or relating in any way to, this Agreement or any proposed or actual business
relationship between Buyer or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the
Company, any Stockholder or their respective Representatives, on the other
hand, this Agreement or any other matter, and regardless of whether such
claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or any other theory of legal
liability (any and all such claims are collectively referred to hereafter as
the "Released Claims"). The Company and each Stockholder on behalf of itself
and their respective Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims
that the Company, such Stockholder or their respective Affiliates may have
against the Trust Account now or in the future (in each case, however, prior
to the consummation of a Business Combination) as a result of, or arising out
of, any negotiations or Contracts with Buyer or its Representatives and will
not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any Public
Distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged
breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with Buyer or its
Affiliates). The Company and each Stockholder on behalf of itself and their
respective Affiliates agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver is
material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by Buyer and its
Affiliates to induce Buyer to enter in this Agreement, and the Company and
each Stockholder further intends and understands such waiver to be valid,
binding and enforceable against the Company, each Stockholder and their
respective Affiliates. To the extent the Company, a Stockholder or any of
their respective Affiliates commences any Proceeding based upon, in
connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to Buyer
or its Representatives, which Proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary
relief against Buyer or its Representatives, the Company and each Stockholder
hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Company's, each Stockholder's and
their respective Affiliates' sole remedy shall be against funds held outside
of the Trust Account and that such claim shall not permit any of the Company,
any Stockholder or their respective Affiliates (or any Person claiming on any
of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have any claim against the Trust
Account (including any Public Distributions therefrom) or any amounts
contained therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) nothing herein shall
serve to limit or prohibit the Company's or the Stockholder Representative's
right to pursue a claim against Buyer for legal relief against monies or other
assets held outside the Trust Account, for specific performance or other
equitable relief pursuant to Section 11.15 (including a claim for Buyer to
specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement and cause the
disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in the Trust Account (after
giving effect to the Redemption) to the Stockholders in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement, or for Buyer's fraud, and
(ii) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the
Company may have in the future against Buyer's assets or funds that are not
held in the Trust Account (including any funds that have been released from
the Trust Account to Buyer and any assets that have been purchased or acquired
with any such funds). This Section 11.1 shall survive termination of this
Agreement for any reason.

  



  

11.2  _Notices_. All notices, requests, permissions, waivers, consents, and
other communications hereunder must be in writing and will be deemed to have
been given only (a) three Business Days following sending by registered or
certified mail, postage prepaid, (b) when sent, if sent by facsimile

after the Closing (which such covenants shall survive the Closing and
continue until fully performed in accordance with their terms).

Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
each of the Parties is responsible for the payment of its own respective costs

burden of proof will arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the
authorship of any of the terms hereof or thereof.

  



  

11.6  _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in Section 8.2 and

to which an appeal of the decisions of any such court may be taken, AND EACH
PARTY AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE, OR COOPERATE IN OR ENCOURAGE THE COMMENCEMENT
OF, ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, EXCEPT IN SUCH A COURT. EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT IT MAY DO SO, THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE THEREIN OF SUCH A PROCEEDING. EACH PARTY HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY CONSENTS TO THE SERVICE OF A COPY OF THE SUMMONS AND COMPLAINT,
AND ANY OTHER PROCESS WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING THAT MAY BE SERVED
IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING, BY CERTIFIED MAIL, RETURN RECEIPT REQUESTED, BY
DELIVERING A COPY THEREOF TO SUCH PARTY AT ITS RESPECTIVE ADDRESS, BY THE
REQUIREMENTS OF Section 11.2 OR BY ANY OTHER METHOD PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE
LAW. EACH PARTY HEREBY AGREES THAT A FINAL JUDGMENT IN ANY SUCH PROCEEDING
WILL BE CONCLUSIVE AND MAY BE ENFORCED IN ANY JURISDICTION BY SUIT ON THE
JUDGMENT OR BY ANY OTHER MANNER PROVIDED BY APPLICABLE LAW. Each Party hereby
expressly waives any right it may have to a jury trial in any SUCH proceeding.

  



  

11.9  _Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waiver_. This Agreement, including the
Disclosure Schedule, the Buyer Disclosure Schedule, other Schedules and
Exhibits, constitutes the entire Agreement between the Parties pertaining to
the subject matter herein and supersedes any other existing representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement, or similar assurance (whether direct
or indirect, written or oral, or statutory, express or implied) of any Party
regarding such subject matter (and there is no other representation,
warranty, covenant, agreement, or similar assurance of any Party regarding
such subject matter). No supplement, modification or amendment hereof will be
binding unless expressed as such and executed in writing by each Party. Except
to the extent as may otherwise be stated herein, no waiver of any term hereof
will be binding unless expressed as such in a document executed by the Party
making such waiver (and then only to the extent so expressed). No waiver of
any term hereof will be a waiver of any other term hereof, whether or not
similar, nor will any such waiver be a continuing waiver beyond its stated
terms. Except to the extent as may otherwise be stated herein, failure to
enforce strict compliance with any term hereof will not be a waiver of, or
estoppel with respect to, any existing or subsequent failure to comply.

  



    

Business Combination Agreement| Page 61 
---|--- 

 



    



  

11.10  _Assignment; Binding Effect_. Neither this Agreement nor any right or
obligation hereunder will be assigned, delegated or otherwise transferred (by
operation of law or otherwise) by either Party without the prior written
consent of the other Party, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.
This Agreement will be binding on and inure to the benefit of the respective
permitted successors and assigns of the Parties. Any purported assignment,
delegation or other transfer not permitted by this Section is void.

  



  

11.11  _Severability; Blue-Pencil_. If any term of this Agreement is
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, then all other terms of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect, and such term automatically
will be amended so that it is valid, legal and enforceable to the maximum
extent permitted by Applicable Law, but as close to the Parties' original
intent as is permissible.

  



  

11.12  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, all of which will be considered one and the same agreement, and
will become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the Parties and delivered, in person or by facsimile or electronic image
scan, receipt acknowledged, to the other Party.

  



  

11.13  _Disclosure Schedules_. Certain information is contained in the
Disclosure Schedule or the Buyer Disclosure Schedule solely for informational
purposes, may not be required to be disclosed pursuant hereto (including
disclosed items that do not meet or exceed stated dollar thresholds), and
will not imply that such information or any other information is required to
be disclosed. Inclusion of such information will not establish any level of
materiality or similar threshold or be an admission that any of such
information is material. Each matter disclosed in any section of the
Disclosure Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule in a manner that makes its
relevance to one or more other sections of the Disclosure Schedule or Buyer
Disclosure Schedule, respectively, reasonably apparent on the face of such
disclosure will be deemed to have been appropriately included in each such
other section of the Disclosure Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule
(notwithstanding the presence or absence of any reference in or to
any section of the Disclosure Schedule or Buyer Disclosure Schedule).

  



  

11.14  _Legal Representation; Conflicts Waiver_. Recognizing that Faegre
Drinker has acted as legal counsel to the Company and certain Stockholders
prior to the Closing, and that Faegre Drinker may act as legal counsel to
those Stockholders after the Closing, Buyer and the Company hereby waive on
their own behalf, and agree to cause their Affiliates to waive, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, any conflicts of interest that may arise in
connection with Faegre Drinker representing the Stockholders after the
Closing in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, based on the fact that Faegre Drinker may be deemed to have
represented the Company prior to the Closing or in connection with the
transactions contemplated in this Agreement. In addition, all communications
involving attorney-client confidences between the Company, any
Stockholder, and Faegre Drinker in the course of the negotiation and
documentation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will be
deemed to be attorney-client confidences that belong solely to the
Stockholders (and not the Company) and may be controlled by the Stockholders.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing,
(a) the Stockholders and their post-Closing Affiliates (and not the Company)
will be the sole holders of the attorney-client privilege with respect to the
negotiation and documentation of the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the "Pre-Sale Communications"), and the Company will not be a
holder of the Pre-Sale Communications, and (b) Faegre Drinker will have no
duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose the Pre-Sale Communications or files
pertaining to the Pre-Sale Communications to the Company by reason of any
attorney-client relationship between Faegre Drinker and the Company or
otherwise. Any access by Buyer, Merger Sub, Merger Sub 2, or the Company to
Pre-Sale Communications after the Closing (whether through the Company's
computer systems or otherwise) will not amount to a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege, nor will it adversely affect any rights of the Stockholders
with respect to that attorney-client privilege.

11.15  _Specific Enforcement_.

  



  

(a) Subject to Section 11.15(b), the Parties acknowledge and agree that,
subject to the provisions of this Section 11.15, irreparable damage would
occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or are otherwise breached, and that
monetary damages, even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor
and therefore fully intend for specific performance to be an available remedy
for breaches of this Agreement. It is accordingly agreed that, subject to
Section 11.15(b), prior to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section 9.3, each Party shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the
performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement to any court referred
to in Section 11.8, without proof of actual damages, this being in addition
to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

  



  

(b) Each of the Parties agree that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief, on the terms set
forth herein, on the basis that the other Parties have an adequate remedy at
law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with any such order or injunction.

  



  

11.16  _Appointment of Stockholder Representative_.

  



  

(a) Each Stockholder hereby irrevocably appoints Shareholder Representative
Services LLC as his, her or its representative
("Stockholder Representative"), as true and lawful agent and attorney-in-
fact, with full power of substitution, with full power and authority to act
for and on behalf of such Stockholder for all purposes of this Agreement and
the Ancillary Documents, and with respect to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents,
agrees to be bound by the provisions of this Agreement or other such
agreements and the terms of such transactions. Stockholder Representative
hereby accepts such appointment. Stockholder Representative may take any and
all actions that it believes are reasonably necessary or appropriate under
this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents, including interpreting all of the
terms and provisions of this Agreement and the Ancillary Documents. Each
Stockholder acknowledges and agrees that Stockholder Representative, pursuant
to this Agreement, has the exclusive authority to act on his, her or its
behalf in connection with this Agreement, the Ancillary Documents and
other transaction documents and related matters, including (i) authorization
of payments to be made by any Stockholder or Stockholder Representative under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, (ii) directing the distribution of
all payments and amounts to any Stockholder, (iii) the giving and receiving
of notices to be given or received by any Stockholder, (iv) the right to
resolve, settle, defend, or dispute any claims made by Buyer under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document, including with respect to any
adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.5, or take any actions
and exercise such other power, rights and authority as set forth herein, (v)
the right to retain legal counsel and to engage accountants with respect to
matters regarding this Agreement, any Ancillary Document, and related
documents, (vi) the right to waive any condition or provision of this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document and to take any other action under this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document, including amending this Agreement or any
Ancillary Document in any respect, prior to or after the Closing on behalf of
such Stockholder, and (vii) taking any and all other actions specified in or
contemplated by this Agreement or any Ancillary Document. All decisions and
actions by Stockholder Representative permitted by this Agreement shall be
binding upon all Stockholders, and no Stockholder shall have any right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same and all Stockholders
agree to be severally and not jointly (in accordance with their Pro Rata
Shares) liable therefor. Buyer shall be entitled to deal with and rely
conclusively on Stockholder Representative as provided herein as if, and with
the same effect as if, Stockholder Representative constituted all of the
Stockholders. The Stockholder Representative may resign at any time upon 30
day's advance written notice. Upon the death or resignation of Stockholder
Representative appointed hereby, Stockholders shall appoint a replacement
Stockholder Representative who shall possess and assume the rights, powers,
duties and obligations of Stockholder Representative with the same effect as
though such substitute representative had originally been Stockholder
Representative under this Agreement.

  



    

Business Combination Agreement| Page 63 
---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Stockholder Representative shall have no duties to the Stockholders or
liability to the Stockholders, other than as expressly set forth in this
Agreement, with respect to any action taken, omission, decision made or
instruction given by Stockholder Representative in connection with this
Agreement or any Ancillary Document while acting in good faith and without
gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder Representative shall
not be liable for any action or omission pursuant to the advice of counsel.
The Stockholders will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Stockholder
Representative from and against any and all Liabilities, forfeitures, and
actions (including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their
staffs and all expense of document location, duplication and shipment)
(collectively, "Representative Losses") arising out of or in connection with
the Stockholder Representative's execution and performance of this Agreement
and any Ancillary Documents, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; provided, that in the event that any such Representative
Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of the Stockholder Representative,
the Stockholder Representative will reimburse the Stockholders the amount of
such indemnified Representative Loss to the extent attributable to such gross
negligence or willful misconduct. If not paid directly to the Stockholder
Representative by the Stockholders, any such Representative Losses may be
recovered by the Stockholder Representative from (i) the funds in the
Stockholder Representative Reserve Fund and (ii) any other funds that become
payable to the Stockholders under this Agreement at such time as such
amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Stockholders; provided, that
while this Section allows the Stockholder Representative to be paid from the
aforementioned sources of funds, this does not relieve the Stockholders from
their obligation to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are
suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent the Stockholder Representative from
seeking any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In no event will
the Stockholder Representative be required to advance its own funds on behalf
of the Stockholders or otherwise. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any restrictions or limitations on liability or
indemnification obligations of, or provisions limiting the recourse against
non-parties otherwise applicable to, the Stockholders set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement are not intended to be applicable to the indemnities
provided to the Stockholder Representative under this Section. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the
Stockholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement.

  



  

(c) Upon the Closing, $350,000 (the "Stockholder Representative Reserve
Fund") will be wired to the Stockholder Representative pursuant to Section
2.4(a), which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing
the Stockholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to this
Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. The Stockholders will not
receive any interest or earnings on the Stockholder Representative Reserve
Fund and irrevocably transfer and assign to the Stockholder Representative
any ownership right that they may otherwise have had in any such interest or
earnings. The Stockholder Representative will not be liable for any loss of
principal of the Stockholder Representative Reserve Fund other than as a
result of its gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Stockholder
Representative will hold these funds separate from its corporate funds, will
not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other
corporate purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its
creditors in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the
completion of the Stockholder Representative's responsibilities, the
Stockholder Representative will deliver any remaining balance of the
Stockholder Representative Reserve Fund to the Stockholders. For tax purposes,
the Stockholder Representative Reserve Fund will be treated as having been
received and voluntarily set aside by the Stockholders at the time of
Closing. The parties agree that the Stockholder Representative is not acting
as a withholding agent or in any similar capacity in connection with the
Stockholder Representative Reserve Fund.

  



    

Business Combination Agreement| Page 64

(d) Any action taken by Stockholder Representative pursuant to the authority
granted in this Section 11.16 shall be effective and absolutely binding as
the action of the Stockholders and Stockholder Representative under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Documents.

  



  

(e) Buyer shall be entitled to rely, and shall be fully protected in relying,
upon any statements furnished to it by, and the actions of, or the failure to
act by, Stockholder Representative. Buyer shall not be liable to any
Stockholder for any losses sustained by any such Stockholder, arising out of
or related to the performance of, or failure to perform by, Stockholder
Representative of its obligations set forth in this Agreement, as applicable.
