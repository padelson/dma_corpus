THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER is entered into as of December 21, 2010,
among TERADATA CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (" _Acquiror_ "), APRIMO,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and TDC MERGER SUB, INC., a
Delaware corporation and wholly-owned subsidiary of Acquiror (" _Merger Sub_
"), under the following circumstances:

A. The Board of Directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
approved this Agreement and determined that the Merger (as hereinafter
defined) on the terms set forth in this Agreement is advisable and in the best
interests of its stockholders and has recommended that its stockholders
approve the Merger on the terms set forth in this Agreement.

B. The Boards of Directors of Acquiror and Merger Sub have approved this
Agreement and the Merger, and Acquiror, as the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, has adopted this Agreement and approved the Merger on the terms set forth
in this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing, the representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which hereby is
acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the parties hereby agree as
follows:

ARTICLE 1

 

THE MERGER

1.01  _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law
(the " _DGCL_ "), on the Closing Date, Merger Sub shall be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), the separate corporate existence of
Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the corporation
surviving the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ").

 

1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, on a date to be specified by Acquiror and
the Company, which shall be no later than the second Business Day following
the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver by the party or
parties entitled to the benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in
Article 7 (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent
permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions), or at such other place, time
and date as shall be agreed in writing between Acquiror and the Company;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article 7
shall not have been satisfied or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived on
such second Business Day, then the Closing shall take place on the first
Business Day thereafter on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied
or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived. The date on which the Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_." 1.03 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as soon
as practicable after the Closing, the parties shall file with the Secretary
of State of Delaware (the " _Delaware Secretary of State_ ") a certificate of
merger relating to the Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "), executed and
acknowledged in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL, and all
other filings required under the DGCL in connection with the Merger. The
Merger shall become effective at the time that the Certificate of Merger has
been duly filed with and accepted by the Delaware Secretary of State (the
time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").

1.04 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL.

 

1.05 _Certificate of Incorporation_. The Certificate of Incorporation of the
Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall be the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation (except that the name of the
Surviving Corporation shall be Aprimo, Inc.), until thereafter amended in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

 

1.06 _Bylaws_. The Bylaws of Merger Sub in effect at the Effective Time shall
be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended in
accordance with its terms and applicable Law.

successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified or upon their earlier
resignation or removal in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation and applicable Law: (a) the directors of Merger Sub at the
Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, and (b)
the officers of the Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the

ARTICLE 2

 

CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

2.01 _Conversion of Capital Stock; Merger Consideration_. (a) At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any action on the part of Merger
Sub or the Company or their respective Securityholders:

(i) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of Merger
Sub Common Stock shall be converted into and become one fully paid and non-
assessable share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(ii) _Cancellation of Certain Stock_. All shares of Common Stock and Preferred
Stock that are authorized but unissued or that are issued but not outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof and no consideration shall be delivered in
exchange therefor.

(iii) _Company Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without additional action on the part of any holder of shares of Company
Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, each share of Company Stock that is issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Appraisal
Shares) shall be canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to
receive, upon surrender of the Certificate representing such Company Stock in
accordance with Section 2.02, without interest: (A)

 



2  an amount in cash equal to the product of (1) the Common Stock Equivalent
for such share of Company Stock _multiplied by_ (2) the quotient obtained by
dividing (x) the Closing Payment Amount by (y) the Fully-Diluted Shares (the
" _Per Share Closing Payment_ "), and (B) an amount in cash equal to the Per
Share Deferred Payment(s) determined as set forth in Sections 2.01(d) and
2.01(e) (collectively with the Per Share Closing Payment, the " _Per Share
Payment Amounts_ ").

(b) For purposes of this Agreement: 

(i) The " _Estimated Merger Consideration_ " shall be an amount in cash equal
to $525,000,000  _plus or minus_ (A) the estimated amount of the Working
Capital Adjustment, if any (estimated based on the Estimated Adjustment
Schedule), _minus_ (B) the estimated amount of the Closing Debt, if any
(estimated based on the Estimated Adjustment Schedule) and, _plus_ (C) the
amount of the Exercise Cash (estimated based on the Estimated Adjustment
Schedule);

(ii) The " _Closing Payment Amount_ " shall be an amount in cash equal to the
sum of (A) the Estimated Merger Consideration, _minus_ (B) the Escrow Amount,
_plus_  (C) the aggregate exercise price of unexercised Options and Warrants
entitled to payment pursuant to Sections 2.03(a) and 2.03(b).

(iii) The " _Adjusted Merger Consideration_ " shall be the Estimated Merger
Consideration, _plus or minus_ (A) the difference, if any, between the
estimated Working Capital Adjustment provided pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and
the final Working Capital Adjustment determined as provided in Section
2.05(b), and _plus or minus_ (B) the difference, if any, between the amount of
the estimated Closing Debt provided pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and the final
Closing Debt amount determined as provided in Section 2.05(b), and _plus or
minus_ (C) the difference, if any, between the amount for the estimated
Exercise Cash provided pursuant to Section 2.05(a) and the final Exercise
Cash amount determined as provided in Section 2.05(b).

(c) Within two Business Days after the Closing Statement becomes final and
binding in accordance with Section 2.05:

(i) if the Adjusted Merger Consideration is greater than the Estimated Merger
Consideration determined on the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay to the Escrow Agent to hold in accordance with
the terms of the Escrow Agreement as part of the Escrow Amount an amount equal
to the difference between the Estimated Merger Consideration and the Adjusted
Merger Consideration, or

 

(ii) if the Adjusted Merger Consideration is less than the Estimated Merger
Consideration, Acquiror shall be entitled to make a claim (an " _Adjustment
Claim_ ") against the Escrow Amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement for the amount by which the Adjusted Merger Consideration is less
than the Estimated Merger Consideration. 

(d) At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit the Escrow
Amount with the Escrow Agent to hold pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. On the
Interim Distribution Date,

 



3  Acquiror shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay (directly or through a
payroll processor) as soon as practicable, but in any event within two (2)
Business Days, to each former holder of Securities who is entitled to receive
the Per Share Deferred Payment(s) pursuant to Section 2.01 or 2.03 (subject,
however, to Section 2.02(f)), for each Security held at the Effective Time, an
amount equal to (A) either (1) if the aggregate amount of any Claim Reserve
then existing together with any amounts previously paid out of the Escrow with
respect to Claims (the " _Aggregate Claims_ ") is less than $5,000,000,
$25,000,000 or (2) if the amount of the Aggregate Claims is $5,000,000 or
more, $25,000,000 less the amount of the Aggregate Claims in excess of
$5,000,000, _divided by_ (B) the Fully Diluted Shares, and _multiplied by_ (C)
the applicable Common Stock Equivalent for the class of Security held (the "
_Per Share Interim Payment_ "). On the Expiration Date, Acquiror shall
instruct the Escrow Agent to pay (directly or through a payroll processor) as
soon as practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days, to each
former holder of Securities who is entitled to receive Per Share Deferred
Payment(s) pursuant to Section 2.01(a) or 2.03 (subject, however, to Section
2.02(f)), for each Security held at the Effective Time, an amount equal to
(A) the remaining Escrow Amount less the amount of any Claim Reserve then
existing, _divided by_ (B) the Fully Diluted Shares and _multiplied by_ (C)
the applicable Common Stock Equivalent for the class of Security held (the "
_Per Share Expiration Date Payment_ ").

(e) If the entire remaining Escrow Amount is not paid on the Expiration Date
in accordance with Section 2.01(d) as a result of one or more pending
Indemnity Claims, then at the time that all pending Indemnity Claims have been
fully resolved as provided in Article 9 or Article 10 and any required
payment is made from the Claim Reserve with respect to such Claim to the
Acquiror Group, Acquiror shall instruct the Escrow Agent to pay (directly or
through a payroll processor) as soon as practicable, but in any event within
two (2) Business Days, to each former holder of Securities entitled to
receive any Deferred Payments pursuant to Section 2.01(a) or Section 2.03
(subject, however, to Section 2.02(f)), for each Security held at the
Effective Time, an amount equal to (A) any remaining Claim Reserve, _divided_
by (B) the Fully Diluted Shares, and _multiplied_ by (C) the applicable Common
Stock Equivalent for the class of Security held (the " _Per Share
Final Payment_ " and, collectively with the Per Share Interim Payment and the
Per Share Expiration Date Payment, if any, the " _Per Share Deferred
Payment(s)_ ").

 

(f) The Per Share Payment Amounts shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
effect of any reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company
Stock), reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to
the Securities occurring (or for which a record date is established)
after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.

(g) Each holder of more than one percent (1%) of the Fully Diluted Shares,
shall be entitled to receive all payments hereunder by wire transfer pursuant
to the instructions provided pursuant to Section 2.02(b).

2.02 _Exchange Fund_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of
Company Stock for the Closing Payment Amount to be paid with respect to such
Company Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(a) are as follows:

(a) At or prior to the Effective Time, Acquiror shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the Securityholders for payment through
the Exchange Agent in

 



4  accordance with this Section 2.02, cash in an amount equal to the Estimated
Merger Consideration less the Escrow Amount (the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, Acquiror shall cause the Exchange Agent
to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the applicable Closing Payment
Amount payable with respect thereto, provided that the Acquiror shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to assist the Company in developing
arrangements for the delivery of such materials prior to Closing to
stockholders of the Company holding one percent (1%) or more of the Fully
Diluted Shares to facilitate the payment of the Per Share Closing Payment to
such stockholders immediately following the Effective Time, provided that the
Company provides payment instructions to Acquiror at least three Business Days
prior to the Effective Time _. _ Such instructions may include directions by
a group of Affiliated Securityholders as to the appropriate allocations of
payments among such Affiliated Securityholders (including, by way of example,
a request to allocate a disproportionate share of the aggregate Closing
Payment Amount payable to such Affiliated Securityholders to one of such
Affiliated Securityholders in exchange for such Affiliate giving up the right
to Deferred Payment(s) and the payment of such Deferred Payments instead to
the other Affiliated Securityholder), provided that prior to the Closing Date
all such Affiliated Securityholders certify in writing to the Exchange Agent
their agreement to such allocation, and agree to indemnify the Acquiror, the
Exchange Agent and all other Securityholders for any claims arising out of
the Exchange AgentÂ’s compliance with such instructions. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor the Per Share Closing
Payment that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to this Article 2
in respect of all Company Stock held by such holder, payable as provided in
this Article 2, and the Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be
canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Stock not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, the applicable Per Share
Closing Payment may be paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate is presented
to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and evidence that an applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each
Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the applicable Per Share
Closing Payment as contemplated by this Section 2.02 and any Per Share
Deferred Payment(s) payable pursuant to Sections 2.01(d) and 2.01(e).

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration
of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the
Company Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article 2.

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the
holders of Securities as of the end of the sixth month after the Effective
Time shall be delivered

 



5  to Acquiror (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar law), upon
demand, and any holder of Securities who has not previously complied with this
Section 2.02 shall be entitled to receive from Acquiror (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or similar law) payment of its claim for the applicable Per
Share Closing Payment and any Deferred Payments payable pursuant to Section
2.01, without interest.

 

(e) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Acquiror, Merger Sub,
the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable
to any holder of shares of Company Stock delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(f) Each of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Securities such amounts as it is required to deduct
and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
other applicable state, local or foreign Tax Law; provided, that if such
payment is to be made on behalf of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation by
the Exchange Agent, Escrow Agent or a payroll agent, the Exchange Agent,
Escrow Agent and/or payroll agent may so deduct and withhold such amounts
and pay such amounts to or as directed by Acquiror or the Surviving
Corporation for remittance as provided in this Section 2.02(f). To the extent
that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts: (i) shall be remitted to
the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) upon payment to such applicable
Governmental Entity, shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to such holder of Securities in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Acquiror,
as the case may be.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Closing Payment Amount
deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

2.03 _Equity Awards and Warrants_. (a) As soon as practicable following the
date of this Agreement, the Company Board (or, if appropriate, any committee
of the Company Board administering the Option Plans) shall adopt such
resolutions or take such other actions (including obtaining any
required consents, which shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to
Acquiror) as may be required to effect the following:

(i) at the Effective Time, each outstanding Option shall be canceled in full
and the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, in consideration for such
cancellation:

(A) an amount in cash equal to the product of: (x) the number of shares of
Common Stock subject to the vested portion of such Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting by
reason of the Merger), and (y) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Closing
Payment over the exercise price per share of Common Stock subject to such
Option, which amount (less any required withholding) shall be payable to such
holder from the Exchange Fund (directly

 



6  or through a payroll processor) as soon as practicable following the
Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 days thereafter, and

 

(B) if the holder of the Option is entitled to receive a payment under Section
2.03(a)(i)(A), an additional amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the
number of shares of Common Stock subject to the vested portion of such Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time (after giving effect to any
acceleration of vesting by reason of the Merger), and (y) the Per Share
Deferred Payment(s) amount payable pursuant to Section 2.01(d) or 2.01(e),
which amount(s) (less any required withholding) shall be payable to such
holder from the Escrow Amount (directly or through a payroll processor) at
the time or times any such payments are made with respect to the Company Stock
pursuant to Section 2.01 and provided that all such payments shall be made
within five years after the Effective Time to the extent required by Section
409A of the Code;

(ii) at the Effective Time, each outstanding RSU shall be canceled in full and
the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive, in consideration for such

following the Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 days thereafter,
and 

(B) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of

the Effective Time (after giving effect to any acceleration of vesting by
reason of the Merger), and (y) any Per Share Deferred Payment(s) payable
pursuant to Section 2.01(d) or 2.01(e), which amount(s) (less any required
withholding) shall be payable to such holder from the Escrow Amount (directly
or through a payroll processor) at the time or times any such payments are
made with respect to the Company Stock pursuant to Section 2.01 and provided
that all such payments shall be made within five years after the Effective
Time to the extent required by Section 409A of the Code.

(b) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company
Board shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions (including
obtaining any required consents) as may be required so that, at the Effective
Time, each holder of a Common Warrant (and of any Series A2 Warrant that
permits the adjustments provided for in this Section 2.03(b)) outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive pursuant
to such Common Warrant (or such Series A2 Warrant), upon exercise of such
Common Warrant (or such Series A2 Warrant) pursuant to its terms, solely:

(i) an amount in cash equal to the product of the number of Common Stock
Equivalents subject to the Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time and
the Per Share Closing Payment per Common Stock Equivalent subject to such
Warrant, which

 



7  amount shall be payable to such holder from the Exchange Fund as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 days
thereafter, and

 

(ii) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of

obtaining any required consents) as may be required so that any Series A2
Warrant that by its terms does not permit the adjustments provided for in
Section 2.03(b) will be cancelled as of the Effective Time if not exercised
prior to the Effective Time.

 

2.04 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Company Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that is held by any record holder who is entitled to demand and
properly demands appraisal of such Company Stock pursuant to, and who complies
in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the "
_Appraisal Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per
Share Payment Amounts payable pursuant to this Article 2, but instead at the
Effective Time the holders of Appraisal Shares shall become entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262 of the DGCL and at the Effective Time all Appraisal Shares shall
cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and cease
to exist and the holder of such Appraised Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except as set forth in this Section 2.04.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 of the DGCL or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then
the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holderÂ’s Appraisal
Shares under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease and each of
such holderÂ’s Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the
Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive, without
interest thereon, the Per Share Payment Amounts. The Company shall deliver
prompt notice to Acquiror of any demands for appraisal of any Shares,
attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL that are received by the Company for appraisal of any
Shares, and provide Acquiror with the opportunity to participate (at its
expense) in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not,
without the prior written consent of Acquiror (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), make any payment with respect
to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Any amount payable to any holder of Appraisal Shares exercising
appraisal rights shall be paid in accordance with the DGCL by Acquiror.

 

2.05 _Estimated Adjustment Amounts and Closing Statement_. (a) At least five
Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare and
deliver to Acquiror a schedule (the " _Estimated Adjustment Schedule_ ")
setting forth its good faith estimates of each of the

 



8  following amounts as of the Closing Date (the " _Estimated Adjustment
Amounts_ "): (i) the amount of the Closing Debt, if any, (ii) the amount of
the Closing Net Working Capital, (iii) the amount of the Working Capital
Adjustment, if any, and (iv) the amount of the Exercise Cash (including a
statement identifying the Options and Warrants exercised and the Persons who
exercised such Options and Warrants). The Estimated Adjustment Amounts shall
be subject to AcquirorÂ’s reasonable approval. The Company shall make available
to Acquiror all work papers and other books and records used in calculating
the Estimated Adjustment Amounts, as well as the appropriate personnel
involved in the preparation thereof.

(b) Within 60 days after the Closing Date, Acquiror shall cause to be
prepared and delivered to the Stockholder Representative a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth, as of the Effective Time: (i) the amount
of the Closing Debt, if any, (ii) the amount of the Exercise Cash, and (iii)
a calculation of the net working capital of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
which shall be prepared from the books and records of the Company and shall
show the following as of the Effective Time (determined on a consolidated
basis in accordance with GAAP, applied consistently with the manner in which
the CompanyÂ’s audited 2009 financial statements included in the Financial
Statements were prepared):

 

(i) the aggregate book value of the current assets of the Company, excluding
any prepaid initial public offering expenses and less the amount of the
Exercise Cash (collectively, the " _Current Assets_ "), and

(ii) the aggregate current liabilities of the Company, but excluding any
Closing Debt and any deferred revenue (collectively, the " _Current
Liabilities_ ").

(c) The Closing Statement also shall show the amount determined by subtracting
the Current Liabilities from the Current Assets (the result of such
subtraction being the " _Closing Net Working Capital_ "). Based on the
Closing Net Working Capital, the adjustment (the " _Working Capital
Adjustment_ ") used to calculate the Adjusted Merger Consideration shall be as
follows: (i) if the Closing Net Working Capital is less than 95% of the
Target Working Capital, the Working Capital Adjustment shall be a downward
adjustment equal to the amount by which the Closing Net Working Capital is
less than 95% of the Target Working Capital, and (ii) if the Closing
Net Working Capital is more than 105% of the Target Working Capital, the
Working Capital Adjustment shall be an upward adjustment equal to the amount
by which the Closing Net Working Capital exceeds 105% of the Target Working
Capital. For purposes of clarity, the Working Capital Adjustment shall be
zero if not adjusted pursuant to the forgoing clauses (i) or (ii).

(d) Upon delivery of the Closing Statement, the Acquiror shall deliver to the
Stockholder Representative all relevant backup materials reasonably requested
by the Stockholder Representative, including all schedules and detailed backup
used in any of the calculations above. The Closing Statement shall become
final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of: (i) the date the
Stockholder Representative gives notice of his acceptance of the Closing
Statement, (ii) the 30th day following receipt of the Closing Statement by
the Stockholder Representative, unless the Stockholder Representative gives
written notice to Acquiror prior to such date of his disagreement with the
Closing Statement (the " _Notice of Disagreement_ "), or (iii) if the Notice
of Disagreement is received by Acquiror within such 30-day period, on the
earlier

 



9  of: (x) the date Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative resolve in
writing any differences they have with respect to the matters specified in the
Notice of Disagreement, or (y) the date any disputed matters finally are
resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm as hereinafter provided. The Notice
of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement, which must be based on the Closing Statement not being
accurate, not being prepared in accordance with this Section 2.05, or state
that the Acquiror has failed to provide sufficient backup materials and
information to allow the Stockholder Representative to review.

 

(e) During the 30-day period following the delivery of the Notice of
Disagreement, Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall seek in good
faith to resolve in writing any differences which they may have with respect
to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement and Acquiror shall also
deliver to the Stockholder Representative all reasonably requested relevant
backup materials not previously provided, in detail reasonably requested by
the Stockholder Representative. If all such differences are not so resolved
within the 30-day period, at the end of such 30-day period, Acquiror and the
Stockholder Representative shall submit to an independent accounting firm
(the " _Accounting Firm_ ") for review and resolution any and all matters
which remain in dispute and which were property included in the Notice of
Disagreement. Unless Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative otherwise
agree in writing, the Accounting Firm shall be KPMG LLP. The Accounting Firm
shall promptly, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the
American Arbitration Association, review only those unresolved items and
amounts specifically set forth and objected to in the Notice of Disagreement,
and resolve the dispute with respect to each such specific unresolved item and
amount in accordance with this Agreement. The Accounting Firm shall render a
written decision as to each disputed matter, including a statement in
reasonable detail of the basis for its decision. Each of the parties to this
Agreement agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with
the Accounting Firm, and to cause the Accounting Firm to resolve any such
dispute as soon as practicable after the commencement of the Accounting FirmÂ’s
engagement. The Accounting Firm shall be instructed to use its best efforts to
notify the parties of its determination concerning the matter(s) included in
the Notice of Disagreement within 30 days of its appointment. The
determination of the Accounting Firm shall be final and binding on the
parties, and judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting
Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such
determination is to be enforced. Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative
each shall pay their own fees and expenses incurred in connection with any
such arbitration and 50% of the fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm,
provided, however, that the Stockholder Representative shall be entitled to
deduct its portion of such fees and expenses from the Escrow Amount.

 

2.06 _Authority to Convey Assets_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments, assurances and any other actions or things are
necessary, desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or
otherwise, in the Surviving Corporation its rights, title or interest in, to
or under any of the rights, properties or assets of Merger Sub or the Company
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to execute and deliver, in
the name and on behalf of Merger Sub and/or the Company, as applicable, all
such deeds, bills of sale, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of Merger Sub and/or the Company or otherwise, all such
other actions and things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm any and all right, title and

 



10  interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out the Merger.

 

2.07 _Certain Tax Matters_. For U.S. federal income tax purposes, any payment
to the Securityholders other than holders of Equity Awards of any Escrow
Amount will be treated as deferred contingent purchase price eligible for
installment sale treatment under Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding
provision of foreign, state or local law, as appropriate, and will be subject
to imputation of interest under Section 483 or Section 1274 of the Code. Any
interest and earnings on the Escrow Amount will be included in the gross
income of the Acquiror pursuant to Section 468B(g) of the Code. In no
event shall the total amount of the Escrow Amount, including any interest and
earnings thereon, to be paid to the Securityholders under this Agreement
exceed an amount to be designated pursuant to this Agreement, which is
intended to ensure that the right of the Securityholders to any such payments
is not treated as a contingent payment without a stated maximum selling price
under Section 453 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. Neither the Acquiror nor the Company shall take a position in any
Tax Return or examination or other administrative or judicial proceeding
(including any ruling request) relating to any Tax that is inconsistent with
such treatment. Any payment of any Escrow Amount to a holder of Equity Awards
will be treated as compensation reportable on Forms W-2 to be issued by the
Company and includable in gross income of such holder at the time of payment.

ARTICLE 3

The Company hereby represents and warrants to Merger Sub and Acquiror as

all Encumbrances, and free of any other restriction (including any restriction
on the right to vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock, voting
securities or other equity interests), except for restrictions imposed by

and there are not any outstanding obligations of the Company or any Subsidiary
to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be issued, delivered or sold: (i) any

Agreement. There are no debentures, bonds, notes or other Indebtedness of the
Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for,
securities having the right to vote) on any matters on which stockholders of
the Company may vote. Neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries is a
party to any voting agreement with respect to the voting of any stock or
voting securities of, or other equity interests in, the Company. Except for
this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of the Company is a party to any
agreement pursuant to which any Person is entitled to elect, designate or
nominate any director of the Company or any Subsidiary.

(f) All outstanding shares of Company Stock and all outstanding Options and
Warrants have been issued in compliance with all applicable securities Laws.

3.04 _Authority; Execution and Delivery; Enforceability_. (a) The Company has
all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject, in the
case of the Merger, to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval. The
Company Board, by a vote at a meeting duly called at which a quorum of

other transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the best interests
of the Company and its stockholders, and (iii) recommending that the CompanyÂ’s
stockholders approve the Merger and directing that the Merger be submitted to
the CompanyÂ’s stockholders for approval as provided in Section 6.03, and such

for the filing of the appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL).
The Company has duly executed and delivered this Agreement and, assuming the
due authorization, execution and delivery by each of Acquiror and Merger Sub,
this Agreement constitutes its legal, valid and binding obligation,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject as to
enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, and
other Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors rights
and to general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 

(b) No "interested stockholder," "fair price," "moratorium," "control share
acquisition" or other similar antitakeover statute or similar statute or
regulation (including Title 3, Subtitle 7 of the DGCL), or similar provision
or term of the Company Certificate or the Company Bylaws,

 



14  applies with respect to the Company with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

3.05 _Consents and Approvals; No Violation_. Subject to obtaining the Required
Consents, and except: (i) as may result solely from any facts or
circumstances relating to Acquiror or its Affiliates, or (ii) for the other
consents, approvals and other matters listed in Section 3.05 of the Disclosure
Letter, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement to be executed and delivered by the Company, nor the consummation by
the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, nor compliance

(a) conflict with or result in any breach of any provision of the Company
Certificate, the Company Bylaws, or any other governing document or agreement
of the Company;

properties or assets of the Company or any Subsidiary;

right of termination or acceleration of, any Material Contract or, to the
extent that individually or in the aggregate it would have a Material Adverse
Effect, any other Contract;

(d) violate any Law applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or any of
their respective properties or assets; or

(e) require any consent, approval, authorization or Permit of or from, or
filing with or notification to, any Governmental Entity.

of the Disclosure Letter, the Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with GAAP (except, in the case of the unaudited interim financial
statements included in the Financial Statements, for the absence of footnotes,
the anticipated year-end adjustments disclosed in Section 3.06 of the
Disclosure Letter and other normal year-end adjustments that are not material
in amount) and, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, in a manner
consistent with the manner in which the 2009 audited financial statements
included in the Financial Statements were prepared. The Financial Statements
present fairly the consolidated financial position of the Company at the dates
thereof and the CompanyÂ’s consolidated results of operations and related
changes in financial position for the periods then ended (subject, in the case
of unaudited Financial Statements, to the absence of footnotes, the
anticipated year-end adjustments disclosed in Section 3.06 of the Disclosure
Letter and other normal year-end adjustments that are not material in amount).
The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain a standard system of accounting
established and administered in accordance with GAAP, including, without
limitation, books and records that are accurate and complete in all material
respects.

 



15 (b) The Company has provided to Acquiror true and correct copies of all
management recommendation and other similar letters and recommendations
received from the CompanyÂ’s auditors.

(but not including customer hosting systems), are adequate to conduct the
business of the Company and the Subsidiaries as presently conducted and at
the levels of business contemplated for 2011 and 2012 in the business plan
provided by the Company to Acquiror, without additional capital expenditures
other than as set forth in the business plan of the Company provided by the

under any other federal, state or foreign Law designed to prohibit, restrict
or regulate actions for the purpose or effect of monopolization, restraint of

Acquiror and the Company shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts, and
cause each of their respective Subsidiaries to cooperate and use reasonable

Affiliates or to require any such Person to dispose of, license (whether
pursuant to an exclusive or nonexclusive license) or hold separate all or any
portion of the business or assets or any product of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or Acquiror or its Affiliates, in each case as a result of or in

the Subsidiaries or AcquirorÂ’s subsidiaries or (2) directly or indirectly
prevent the Company or its Subsidiaries or Acquiror or any subsidiary of
Acquiror from operating any of their business in substantially the same
manner as operated immediately prior to the date of this Agreement, nor shall
Acquiror or any Affiliate be obligated to agree to any of the foregoing
actions nor enter into any Consent Agreement with, or other Order by, any
Governmental Entity providing for any of the foregoing.

(e) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the
Company and the Subsidiaries between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, subject
to applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good faith on a
reasonably regular basis with Acquiror to report material, individually or in
the aggregate, operational developments, material changes in the status of
relationships with customers and resellers, material changes in the status of
ongoing operations and other matters reasonably requested by Acquiror
pursuant to procedures reasonably requested by Acquiror; provided, however,
that no such consultation shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or other provision in this
Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

 



41 (f) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify
Acquiror in writing of:

(i) the occurrence of any matter or event that (1) is, or that is reasonably
likely to be, a Material Adverse Effect, or (2) has resulted, or is
reasonably likely to result, in (I) any representation and warranty of the
Company set forth in this Agreement that is qualified as to materiality
becoming untrue, (II) any such representation and warranty that is not so
qualified becoming untrue in any material respect, or (III) any condition to
the transactions contemplated hereby and set forth in Section 7.03 not being
satisfied;

 

(ii) the failure of the Company to perform in any material respect any
obligation to be performed by it under this Agreement;

(iii) any written notice or other written communication from any Person (other
than a Governmental Entity) alleging that notice to or consent of such Person
is required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the failure with which to comply would result
in any of the conditions set forth in Section 7.03 not being satisfied;

(iv) any written notice or other written communication from any material
customer, distributor or reseller to the effect that such customer,
distributor or reseller is terminating or otherwise materially adversely
modifying its relationship with Company or any Subsidiary as a result of the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

(v) any material written notice or other material written communication from
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and a copy of any such notice or
communication shall be furnished to Acquiror;

 

(vi) any written filing or written notice made by the Company with any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and a copy of any such filing or notice shall
be furnished to Acquiror; and

(vii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, relating to or involving
or otherwise affecting the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that, if
pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been
disclosed pursuant to Section 7.03(f) or that relate to the consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

(g) If any event occurs after the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time without breach by the Company of any of its
obligations under this Agreement and such event results in a representation or
warranty of the Company set forth in Article 3 being inaccurate, and if
inclusion of such event in one or more sections of the Disclosure
Letter would cause such representation or warranty to be accurate (a "
_Change_ "), the Company may propose in writing to Acquiror to update one or
more sections of the Disclosure

 



42  Letter to reflect the Change (an " _Update Notice_ "). Following receipt of
an Update Notice, Acquiror will make a reasonable good faith determination of
whether the Change would reasonably be expected to cause the condition set
forth in Section 7.03(a) not to be met, and as a result that the Acquiror
would have a right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) due
to the occurrence of such Change were it not included in the Update Notice.
If Acquiror determines that it would have a right to terminate under Section
8.01(d) due to the Change, Acquiror shall have the right to reject the Update
Notice and terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to the Company
pursuant to such Section 8.01(d); provided, however, that if Acquiror does not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d) following such
determination, then the sections of the Disclosure Letter referred to in the
Update Notice, as modified by the Update Notice, shall be deemed to be part of
the Disclosure Letter for all purposes of this Agreement as though included
therein as of the date of this Agreement. If, on the other hand,
Acquiror makes a good faith determination that the Change would not
reasonably be expected to give rise to a right to terminate this Agreement
under Section 8.01(d), it shall notify the Company of that fact, and Acquiror
shall thereafter have the option of whether or not to accept the Update
Notice, and if it does not accept the Update Notice, the representations or
warranties that would have been modified thereby will not be modified. The
Stockholder Representative will not be deemed to have agreed to any
determination made by the Acquiror as to whether the Change gives rise to a
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(d), and preserves
his right to contest any determinations made by the Acquiror pursuant to
this provision.

(h) Acquiror shall give prompt notice to the Company of: (A) any
representation or warranty made by Acquiror or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in
Section 7.02(a) could not be satisfied or (B) the failure of Acquiror or
Merger Sub to perform in any material respect any obligation to be performed
by such party under this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
Section 7.02(b) could not be satisfied; provided, however, that no such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect
thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this
Agreement.

6.03 _Stockholder Consent or Approval_. Immediately after execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall, in compliance with the DGCL, the Company
Certificate and the Company Bylaws, at its election either: (i) convene a
special meeting of the stockholders of the Company for the purpose of
permitting the stockholders to consider and to vote upon adoption of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger by the required vote (" _Company
Stockholder Approval_ "), or (ii) solicit written consents of the stockholders
of the Company to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company also
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to: (x) solicit a stockholder vote
approving the right of any "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code) to receive those "parachute payments" under Section
280G(b)(5) of the Code payable pursuant to a Contract between any such
disqualified individuals and the Company or pursuant to an Employee Plan that
are at and exceed three times such disqualified individualÂ’s "base amount" (as
defined in Section 280G(b)(3)) (the " _280G Payments"_ ), (y) cause the
relevant disqualified individuals to execute waivers of the 280G Payments such
that the vote determines their right to receive (or retain) the 280G Payments
to the extent necessary pursuant to Federal Income Tax Regulation Section
1.280G-1, Q/A-7, and (z) deliver to Acquiror all documentation with respect to
such actions prior to such vote to allow Acquiror the opportunity 

 



43  to review. For purposes of this provision, the 280G Payments shall be
calculated using the amounts and entitlements payable pursuant to any Contract
in effect as of the date immediately prior to the signing of this Agreement.

6.04 _No Solicitation_. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any
Subsidiary to, nor shall it authorize or permit any director, officer or
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiary or any investment banker,
attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative of the Company or any
Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly
encourage or take any other action to knowingly facilitate, any Takeover
Proposal or any inquiries or the making of the proposal that could reasonably
be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, or (ii) enter into, continue or
otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish
to any Person (or any representative thereof) any information with respect to
or otherwise cooperate in any way with any Person (or any representative
thereof) with respect to, any Takeover Proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from
any Person or group (other than Acquiror or Merger Sub or any of their
Affiliates) relating to, or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, in
one transaction or a series of transactions, any merger, consolidation,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation or dissolution involving
the Company or any direct or indirect acquisition, including by way of any
merger, consolidation, tender offer, exchange offer, stock acquisition, asset
acquisition, binding share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, license agreement or similar
transaction, of (i) assets or businesses that constitute or represent 10% or
more of the total revenue, net income, or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) 10% or more of the outstanding shares
of Common Stock or Preferred Stock or of any class of capital stock of, or
other equity or voting interests in, one or more of the Subsidiaries of the
Company which, in the aggregate, directly or indirectly hold the assets or
businesses referred to in clause (i) above.

6.05 _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not such
transactions are consummated.

6.06 _Transaction Litigation_. The Company shall give Acquiror the reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder
litigation against the Company or its directors relating to the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement
shall be agreed to without the prior written consent of Acquiror, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

6.07 _Public Announcements_. Acquiror shall consult with the Company and
provide the Company with the reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger. The Company
shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
Merger without the AcquirorÂ’s consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, except as reasonably may be required in
connection with soliciting approval of the Merger by the holders of the
Company Stock or as it may reasonably conclude may be required by applicable
Law or court process.

 



44 6.08 _Obligations of Merger Sub_. Acquiror shall cause Merger Sub to perform
its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement.

6.09 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers_. (a) From the Effective Time
through the sixth anniversary of the date on which the Effective Time occurs,
each of Acquiror and the Surviving Corporation shall, jointly and severally,
indemnify and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time
prior to the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
predecessor thereof (the "Company Indemnified Parties"), against all claims,
losses, liabilities, damages, judgments, fines and reasonable fees, costs and
expenses, including attorneysÂ’ fees and disbursements, incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to the
fact that the Company Indemnified Party is or was an officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any predecessor thereof, whether

Party of a request therefor.

(b) The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain, and Acquiror shall cause the Certificate of Incorporation and
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation to so contain, provisions no less

the Company Certificate and Company Bylaws.

(c) Acquiror shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain, at no expense
to the beneficiaries, in effect for six years from the Effective Time the

contemplated by this Agreement).

(d) In the event Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 6.09(d).

6.10 _Additional Financial Statements_. (a) Until the earlier of the
termination of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the Company shall

changes

 



45  in stockholdersÂ’ equity and cash flows of the Company and the Subsidiaries
for the month then ended and the year to date and a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and the Subsidiaries as at the end of such month, which shall

the 2009 audited financial statements included in the Financial Statements
were prepared.

(b) The Company shall prepare and provide to Acquiror, as soon as practical
and in any event not later than February 15, 2011, audited consolidated

consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the Subsidiaries as at December
31, 2010, which shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP, together with an
unqualified opinion on such financial statements from Ernst and Young, LLP. In
the event that the Effective Time will occur prior to such audited financial
statements for 2010 are completed, the Company shall deliver to Acquiror prior
to the Effective Time the most recent draft of such audited financial
statements for 2010 to the extent prepared, which shall be prepared in
accordance with GAAP, and after such delivery the Company shall have no
further obligation under this Section 6.10(b).

6.11 _Resignation of Directors_. At the Closing, if requested by Acquiror, the
Company shall deliver to Acquiror evidence reasonably satisfactory to Acquiror
of the resignation of any or all the directors of the Company and any
Subsidiary, effective at the Effective Time.

testing company to test the CompanyÂ’s Aprimo Marketing Studio on Demand
product as described in Section 6.13 of the Disclosure Letter during the first

shall provide the results of such test (including all reasonable details
provided by the testing company regarding such results) to the Person
identified in Section 6.13 of the Disclosure Letter. If the results of the
test show that the CompanyÂ’s Aprimo Marketing Studio On Demand product is not
reasonably likely to meet in all material respects the standards set forth in
Section 6.13 of the Disclosure Letter without the incurrence by the Company or
Acquiror of expenses for capital equipment or engineering resources greater
than those set forth in Section 6.13 of the Disclosure Letter, then Acquiror
may make a Claim against the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section 9.02(c) in the
amount of the reasonable expenses of the remediation required to modify the
product to meet the standard set forth in Section 6.13 of the Disclosure
Letter.

6.14 _Section 1445 Certificate_. At or prior to the Closing, the Company

Effective Time, whether before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of the Company and Acquiror;

(b) by action of the Company Board or Acquiror if:

(i) the Merger is not consummated on or before March 31, 2011 (the " _Initial
Date_ "); provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be available to any party whose
failure to perform or observe in any material respect any of its obligations
under this Agreement in any manner shall have been the cause of, or resulted
in, the failure of the Merger to occur on or before the Outside Date; and
provided further, that if the only condition to Closing under Article 7 that
has not been satisfied on or before the Initial Date (except any conditions
that are expected to be satisfied at Closing) is the expiration or early
termination of the waiting period applicable to the Merger under the HSR Act,
or the approval by a Governmental Entity or termination or expiration of a
waiting period under any other applicable Antitrust Law, then the right to
terminate this agreement pursuant to this Section 8.01(b)(i) shall not be
available to any party prior to June 30, 2011 (the " _Outside Date_ ");

(ii) the condition set forth in Section 7.01(c) is not satisfied and the

(iii) the Company Stockholder Approval is not obtained within six hours after
execution of this Agreement;

(c) by the Company, if Acquiror or Merger Sub breaches or fails to
perform any of its covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if
any of the representations or warranties of Acquiror or Merger Sub contained
herein fails to be true and correct, which breach or failure: (i) would give
rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.02(b),
and (ii) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the Outside Date or, if
reasonably capable of being cured, Acquiror or Merger Sub, as the case may be,
is not diligently attempting, or has ceased to diligently attempt, to cure
such breach or failure after receiving written notice from the Company
(provided that the

 



49  Company is not then in breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement and no representation or warranty of the Company contained in this
Agreement then fails to be true and correct such that the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.03(a) or 7.03(b) could not then be satisfied); or

 

(d) by Acquiror, if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of the Company contained herein fails to be true
and correct, which breach or failure: (i) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in Sections 7.03(a) or 7.03(b), and (ii) is not
reasonably capable of being cured by the Outside Date or, if reasonably
capable of being cured, the Company is not diligently attempting, or has
ceased to diligently attempt, to cure such breach or failure after
receiving written notice from Acquiror (provided that Acquiror and Merger Sub
is not then in breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
and no representation or warranty of Acquiror or Merger Sub contained in this
Agreement then fails to be true and correct such that the conditions set
forth in Sections 7.02(a) or 7.02(b) could not then be satisfied).

8.02  _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement
by either Acquiror or the Company as provided in Section 8.01, this Agreement
shall forthwith become void and have no effect, and there shall be no
liability or obligation on the part of any party hereto except with respect
to this Section 8.02 and Article 11, which provisions shall survive such
termination indefinitely; provided, however, that no such termination (or any
provision of this Agreement) shall: (i) relieve any party from liability for
any damages for fraud or any willful and material breach by a party of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth in this Agreement,
or (ii) have any effect on the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

8.03  _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any time
before or after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval; provided,
however, that after receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval, (i) there
shall be made no amendment that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without the further approval of such stockholders,
(ii) no amendment shall be made to this Agreement after the Effective Time,
and (ii) except as provided above in this Section 8.03, no amendment of this
Agreement shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company. This

delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, or (d) waive the satisfaction of
any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by
Acquiror shall require the approval of the stockholders of the Company
unless such approval is required by Law. Any agreement on the part of a party
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure of any party
to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 



50 8.05 _Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver_. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 8.03 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 8.04 shall, in order to be effective, require, in the case of the
Company, action by the Company Board, or the duly authorized designee of the
Company Board and, in the case of Acquiror or Merger Sub, a duly authorized
officer. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective Time shall not
require the approval of the stockholders of the Company.

ARTICLE 9

INDEMNIFICATION

9.01 _Survival of Representations and Warranties; Limitation on Claims_. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement and in any agreement or
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing and
shall terminate and expire on the Expiration Date. A Claim Notice with
respect to an Indemnity Claim or a Tax Claim must be given prior to the
Expiration Date, and after such date the Acquiror Group shall have no further
right to make any Indemnity Claim, Tax Claim or an Offset with respect thereto
(except to the extent a Claim Notice with respect to such Claim was given
prior to such date).

9.02 _Indemnification Claims_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article 9 and Section 10.05, from and after the Effective Time, AcquirorÂ’s
claim against the Escrow Amount shall be the sole and exclusive source of
funds available to compensate and reimburse Acquiror, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation, and/or any of their respective Affiliates, directors,
officers and employees and the predecessors, successors and/or assigns of any
of them (including, following the Effective Date, the Company) (collectively,
the " _Acquiror Group_ ") for the amount of all demands, claims, actions or
causes of action, judgments, costs of settlement, assessments, losses,
damages, liabilities, costs and expenses (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) (collectively, " _Damages_ "),
asserted against, resulting from, imposed upon or incurred by any member of
the Acquiror Group and which arise or are alleged to arise from, by reason of
or resulting from, directly or indirectly (each, an " _Indemnity Claim_ ")
any of the following:

(a) any misrepresentation or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of
the Company contained in this Agreement (other than Section 3.19);

(b) any breach by the Company prior to the Effective Time of any covenant,
agreement or obligation of the Company contained in this Agreement (other than
in respect of Tax Claims);

 

(c) solely with respect to Claims asserted on or before December 31, 2011, any
Claims made pursuant to Section 6.13;

(d) any failure by the Company to obtain prior to the Closing the consents and
approvals listed in Section 9.02(d) of the Disclosure Letter (provided that
any Indemnity Claim under this Section 9.02(d) shall be limited to the Damages
directly attributable to such failure, without regard to any revenue
anticipated from any renewals of, or

 



51  replacement Contracts for, the Contracts listed in Section 9.2(d) of the
Disclosure Letter); and

(e) any demand, claim, action, cause of action or the like made by any Person
claiming to be an owner of any equity interest, stock or Purchase Rights of
the Company which arises out of, or is based upon, having been the owner of
any such interest, stock or Purchase Rights prior to the Closing (including,
without limitation, under applicable securities Laws), and any costs and
expenses related to the defense of any action, suit or proceeding
with respect to Appraisal Shares under the DGCL.

9.03 _General Procedures Applicable to Claims_. (a) Any Claim asserted by a
member of the Acquiror Group shall be valid only if the Acquiror or the
Surviving Corporation (for and on behalf of such member of the Acquiror Group)
notifies the Stockholder Representative in writing reasonably promptly after
Acquiror determines that it has a reasonable basis for the Claim (a "Claim
Notice"). Each Claim Notice shall specify the nature of the Claim, the
applicable provision(s) of this Agreement under which the Claim arises and, if
practicable, the amount of, or an estimate amount of, the Damages. No failure
or delay in giving a Claim Notice and no failure to include any specific
information or any reference to any provision of this Agreement under which
the Claim arises shall affect the rights of a member of the Acquiror Group
under this Agreement. Acquiror or the Surviving Corporation may send a copy of
any Claim Notice to the Escrow Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

 

(b) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any demand,
claim, action, cause of action or the like (whether against the Surviving
Corporation, against Acquiror or against any other member of the Acquiror
Group) for which a member of the Acquiror Group asserts an Indemnity Claim (a
" _Third Party Claim_ "), the aggrieved member of the Acquiror Group (the "
_Third Party Indemnitee_ ") shall inform the Stockholder Representative of all
material details regarding such Third Party Claim known to the Third Party
Indemnitee. The Stockholder Representative shall have the right, at his own
expense, to participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim with counsel
of his choice but without any right to control such defense. The Third Party
Indemnitee shall not pay, or permit to be paid, any settlement of any Third
Party Claim without the consent of the Stockholder Representative (which
consent shall not unreasonably be withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the
event of any Claim pursuant to this Article 9 (including any Third Party
Claim), Acquiror shall provide, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide, the Stockholder Representative with reasonable access to the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s personnel, assets, books and records, Tax Returns,
work papers and any other documents and information relating to such Claim as
the Stockholder Representative reasonably may request. Notwithstanding this
Section 9.03(b), Section 10.03 shall govern any contest with respect to Taxes
with any Governmental Entity.

 

9.04 _Limitation of Liability_. The Escrow Amount shall be the sole and
exclusive source of recovery for Claims under this Agreement. Except for
remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of Law and for injunctive and
provisional relief, from and after the Closing, this Article 9 shall be the
sole and exclusive remedy for breaches of this Agreement and any and
all Claims arising thereby (including any covenant, obligation,
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or in the Escrow
Agreement). Recovery for any Claims with respect to remedies that cannot be
waived as a matter of Law shall, in all events, be made first against the
Escrow

 



52  Amount and liability for any Claims in excess of the Escrow Amount shall be
several and not joint among the Securityholders and limited to the Per Share
Closing Payments and Per Share Deferred Payment(s) received by each such
Securityholder.

9.05 _Basket Amount_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 9
or Article 10, members of the Acquiror Group shall not be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.02 or Section 10.01(a) with respect to:
(i) (A) any misrepresentation or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty
(other than a misrepresentation or inaccuracy of the representations and/or
warranties set forth in Sections 3.01, 3.02, 3.03 and 3.11) or (B) any Tax
Claim, except to the extent that the aggregate amount of Damages suffered
or incurred by members of the Acquiror Group exceed, on a cumulative basis,
$1,000,000 (the " _Basket Amount_ "), but once the Basket Amount is exceeded,
then the Acquiror Group shall be entitled to indemnification with respect to
all such Damages, including the Basket Amount, or (ii) any matter for which a
reserve or liability is included in the final Closing Statement (to the extent
of the reserve or liability so included in the final Closing Statement).

 

9.06 _Insurance Proceeds_. (a) The Acquiror Group shall not be entitled to
indemnification to the extent that any Damages incurred by the Acquiror Group
are reduced by the proceeds of any insurance actually received by the Acquiror
Group (up to the amount of the coverage that would have been available with
respect to such Damages under the insurance maintained by the Company
immediately prior to the Effective Time) net of: (i) the reasonable costs and
expenses incurred in obtaining payment of such insurance proceeds, and (ii)
any retroactive premium adjustments with respect to such insurance as
a result of such claim.

9.07 _Claims Against the Escrow Amount; Arbitration_. Except as provided in
Section 2.05 with respect to any Adjustment Claims, AcquirorÂ’s right to
reimbursement from the Escrow Amount with respect to any Claim shall be final
30 days after Acquiror gives the Claim Notice to the Stockholder
Representative and the Escrow Agent, unless within such 30-day period the
Stockholder Representative sends Acquiror a written notice objecting to the
Claim. To the extent the Stockholder Representative so disputes any Claim,
Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve such Claim and, unless such Claim is resolved by mutual agreement
between Acquiror and the Stockholder Representative within 30 days after such
notice of objection is given either Acquiror or the Stockholder Representative
may refer such Claim: (i) if the amount of the Claim is $1,000,000 or more,
for arbitration in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware pursuant to
Title 10, Section 349 of the Delaware Code, or (ii) if the amount of such
Claim is less than $1,000,000, to the American Arbitration Association to be
settled by arbitration conducted before a single arbitrator in (A) Dayton,
Ohio, if the arbitration is sought by the Stockholder Representative, (B) in
Indianapolis, Indiana, if the arbitration is sought by Acquiror or another
member of the Acquiror Group, or (C) such other location as the parties may
agree in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association. The arbitrator shall be instructed to deliver his
award to Acquiror, the Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent. The
award of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties, and
judgment upon the award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction thereof. No party shall be entitled to, and the arbitrator shall
not be permitted to award, punitive damages. The fees and expenses of the
arbitrator shall be apportioned between the parties by the arbitrator in
accordance with the findings and results of the arbitration. Any award shall
be a conclusive determination of the disputed matter, shall be

 



53  final and binding upon the parties and shall not be contested by the
parties. The determination of whether withholding consent is reasonable or
unreasonable as provided in the last sentence of Section 10.02(a) and the
next-to-last sentence of Section 10.03 shall be deemed to be a Claim for
purposes of this Section 9.07.

9.08 _Tax Benefits_. For purposes of determining the extent of and limitations
on indemnification under this Agreement, the amount of any Damages that may be
subject to indemnification under this Agreement will be determined net of any
Tax Benefit.

ARTICLE 10

 

TAX MATTERS

 

10.01 _Indemnification Obligations With Respect to Taxes_. (a) Subject to
Section 9.05 and Section 10.05, Acquiror may make a Claim (a " _Tax Claim_ ")
against the Escrow Amount for Damages relating to, asserted against, resulting
from, imposed upon or incurred by any member of the Acquiror Group and which
arise or are alleged to arise from, by reason of or resulting from, directly
or indirectly, any of the following: (i) all Taxes of the Company or any
Subsidiary with respect to Pre-Closing Tax Periods; (ii) all Taxes of the
Company or any Subsidiary under Federal Income Tax Regulation 1.1502-6 (or
comparable provisions of state or local law or regulation) solely as a result
of the Company or any Subsidiary having filed Tax Returns before the Closing
Date on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis with any other Person;
(iii) Taxes of any other Person for which responsibility is on the Company or
any Subsidiary by Contract or otherwise; and (iv) any misrepresentation or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the Company or
any Subsidiary in Section 3.19 and any breach of any covenant, agreement or
obligation of the Company with respect to Taxes contained in this Agreement,
except to the extent such liabilities are otherwise indemnified pursuant to
the foregoing clauses (i)Â–(iii). For purposes of this Section 10.01(a), Taxes
relating to Company and a Subsidiary shall include any Taxes imposed on a
predecessor entity and which the Company or Subsidiary is treated as a
successor.

 

(b) For purposes of this Article 10, whenever it is necessary to determine the
liability for Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period, the determination
of the Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including
the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Straddle Period_ ") and the portion of the
Straddle Period beginning after the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consists of two taxable years or periods,
one of which ends at the close of the Closing Date and the other of which
begins at the start of the day following the Closing Date, and items of
income, gain, deduction, loss or credit, and state and local apportionment
factors of the Company for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such
two taxable years or periods on a "closing of the books basis;" _provided_ ,
_however_ , (i) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on
an annual basis, such as the deduction for depreciation; and (ii) Ad Valorem
taxes, such as real and personal property taxes, shall be apportioned ratably
between such periods on a daily basis.

10.02 _Tax Returns and Payment Responsibility_. (a) With respect to all
taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date and any Straddle Period
for which a Tax Return is required to be filed on or after the Closing Date (a
" _Pre-Closing Tax Return_ "), Acquiror will be responsible for and will cause
to be prepared and duly filed all income Tax Returns of the

 



54  Company and any Subsidiary and all consolidated, combined or unitary Tax
Returns that include the Company and any Subsidiary. Acquiror shall provide
the Stockholder Representative with a copy of any Tax Return filed after the
Closing Date that reflects operations and Taxes relating only to the Company
or any Subsidiary (including a pro forma, if necessary) for any periods
(including Straddle Periods) ending on or before the Closing Date but only if
Acquiror makes a Tax Claim against the Escrow Amount pursuant to Section
10.01(a) with respect to any such period. The Acquiror shall not be permitted
to make a Tax Claim against the Escrow Amount with respect to any Tax Return
that it is responsible to file pursuant to this Section 10.02 if such Claim
stems from taking a position on such a return that is not consistent with
prior practice (unless required by Law) or stems from making an election under
Federal Income Tax Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii)(D). Any and all
properly deductible Company Expenses shall be deducted in the Tax period of
the Company ending on the Closing Date and Treasury Regulations Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) shall not apply to any such payments. For purposes
hereof, "Company Expenses" shall mean the amounts payable in respect of Equity
Awards pursuant to this Agreement and the employer portion of any payroll,
social security, unemployment and any similar Taxes relating to payments to
the holders of Equity Awards. To the extent that any Company Expenses are not
permitted to be so deducted by applicable Law, they shall be deducted as soon
as possible after the Closing. If any such deduction creates or increases a
net operating loss of the Company, such net operating loss first shall be
carried back to previous years to the greatest extent permitted by applicable
law (and Acquiror shall not make an election under Section 172(b)(3) of the
Code to waive the carryback of any such net operating loss) and then shall be
carried forward to the greatest extent permitted by applicable Law. Neither
the Acquiror nor the Company shall amend, modify or otherwise change any
such Pre-Closing Tax Return without the prior consent of the Stockholder
Representative if such amendment, modification or change could give rise to an
indemnifiable claim under Section 10.01(a), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, subject to a resolution of
whether withholding consent is reasonable or unreasonable made pursuant to
Section 9.07, if challenged by Acquiror.

(b) All Tax Returns that are to be prepared and filed by Acquiror pursuant to
the preceding paragraph and that relate to Taxes for which a Tax Claim is made
by Acquiror pursuant to Section 10.01(a) shall be submitted to the
Stockholder Representative not later than 15 days prior to the due date for
the filing of such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is within 45 days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the
Closing Date).

(c) Consolidated Return. The Acquiror shall file a consolidated U.S. federal
income Tax Return for the affiliated group (within the meaning of Code
Section 1504) that will include the Company and its Subsidiaries for periods
starting after the Closing Date. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that, as a consequence of the transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the
taxable year of the Company shall close for U.S. federal income tax purposes
at the end of the day on the Closing Date, (ii) to the extent applicable Law
in other taxing jurisdictions so permits, the taxable year of the Company
shall close at the end of the day on the Closing Date, and (iii) all federal,
state, provincial, local and foreign Tax Returns shall be filed consistently
on the foregoing basis.

 



55 (d) The Acquiror shall not be permitted to make a Tax Claim against the Escrow
Amount for any Tax liability resulting from an election made under Section
338(g) of the Code in connection with the Merger.

(e) Cooperation; Audits. In connection with the preparation of Tax Returns,
audit examinations, and any proceedings relating to the Tax liabilities
imposed on the Company or a Subsidiary for which a Tax Claim could be made,
Acquiror or the Company, on the one hand, and the Stockholder Representative,
the Securityholders, on the other hand, shall cooperate fully with each other,
including the furnishing or making available during normal business hours of
records, personnel (as reasonably required), books of account, powers of
attorney or other materials necessary or helpful for the preparation of such
Tax Returns, the conduct of audit examinations or the defense of claims by
Taxing Authorities that could relate to a Tax Claim. 

10.03 _Contest Provisions_. The Stockholder Representative can elect to
represent the interests of the Company (in a good faith manner) in any Tax
audit or administrative or court proceeding relating to any Tax for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date (including a Straddle
Period) for which a Tax Claim against the Escrow Amount could be made under
Section 10.01(a), and to employ counsel of its choice, at its expense, to
defend the position against the Governmental Authority provided that the
Stockholder Representative shall summarize the course of any such action and
the Acquiror can participate in any such action at its expense.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Stockholder Representative shall not be
entitled to settle, either administratively or after the commencement of
litigation, any Tax Claim regarding Taxes of the Company or a Subsidiary that
would be paid from the Escrow Amount without the prior written consent of the
Acquiror, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, subject to a
resolution of whether withholding consent is reasonable or unreasonable made
pursuant to Section 9.07, if challenged by the Stockholder Representative.
With respect to any Tax matter relating to a Pre-Closing Tax Period for which
a Tax Claim will not be made, Acquiror shall have the sole right to represent
the interests of the Company and any Subsidiary.

10.04 _Tax Treatment of Post-Closing Adjustments_. All Adjustment Claims and
Indemnity Claims shall be treated as an adjustment to the amount paid for the
Securities for tax purposes.

10.05 _Limitation_. Acquiror shall be entitled to make a Tax Claim against the
Escrow Amount only to the extent that Acquiror has to make a payment to any
Governmental Authority (or to any Person as reimbursement for a payment made
to a Governmental Authority) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and only
to the extent that the amount of such Tax Claim exceeds the amounts included
in the calculation of the final Working Capital Adjustment with respect to
such item. A Tax Claim shall include all reasonable attorneysÂ’ and
accountantsÂ’ fees, costs and other out-of-pocket expense incurred by Acquiror
in connection with the matters covered by the Tax Claim.

 

10.06 _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. Anything in any other agreement
to the contrary notwithstanding, the Company and each Subsidiary shall take
action to cease and terminate, any Tax allocation or Tax Sharing Agreement
(other than between the Company and any wholly-owned Subsidiary) effective at
the Effective Time, and all obligations thereunder 

 



56  shall terminate and no additional payments shall be made under any such
allocation or agreement after the Effective Time, except with respect to any
claims in effect as of such termination. 

ARTICLE 11

MISCELLANEOUS

11.01 _Stockholder Representative_. (a) Mark Koulogeorge (the "Stockholder

Stockholder Representative under this Agreement. In the event of the death,
resignation or incapacity of the Stockholder Representative, his or
her successor shall be appointed by a majority in interest of the holders of
Company Stock (determined as of immediately prior to the Effective Time)
within 30 days of such death, resignation or incapacity. A resignation of the
Stockholder Representative shall not be effective until a successor
Stockholder Representative has been appointed, and has accepted such
appointment. The decisions and actions of any successor Stockholder
Representative shall be, for all purposes, those of a Stockholder
Representative as if originally named herein.

(b) The Stockholder Representative hereby is irrevocably constituted and
appointed: (i) to take all actions on behalf of the Securityholders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements, (ii) to administer, receive and distribute all
payments and distributions, (iii) to receive, respond to and settle all other
notices, communications and matters directed to the Securityholders under this
Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, (iv) to take any action (or to determine
to take no action) with respect to this Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement
or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, an Ancillary
Agreement or any of the foregoing enumerated matters, and (v) to execute and
deliver all instruments and documents of every kind incident to the foregoing
for all intents and purposes and with the same effect as the Securityholders
could do personally.

(c) The death or incapacity of any Securityholder shall not terminate the
authority and agency of the Stockholder Representative.

(d) The Stockholder Representative shall not be liable to any holder of any
Securities or for any act done or omitted under this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, in its capacity as Stockholder Representative. The
Securityholders shall severally indemnify the Stockholder Representative and
hold him harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of
the Stockholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with the
acceptance or administration of his duties hereunder, including any out-of-
pocket costs and expenses and legal fees and other legal costs reasonably
incurred by the Stockholder Representative. The Company shall be entitled to
deposit a total of $100,000 from amounts otherwise payable to the
Securityholders pursuant to this Agreement to an account (which may be non-
interest bearing) maintained by the Stockholder Representative (the "Expense
Fund") for the fees and expenses of the Stockholder Representative incurred in
connection with this Agreement. At the discretion of the Stockholder
Representative, any balance of the Expense Fund not used for payment of fees
and expenses as described above will be returned to the Securityholders based
on their respective pro rata share of the of the Adjusted Merger Consideration
paid pursuant to this Agreement.

 



57 (e) The Stockholder Representative may elect to receive payments, exclusively
from the Deferred Payment Amount(s) payable to the Securityholders Affiliated
with the Stockholder Representative and actually available for distribution
(after payment of any Claims and subject to any Claim Reserve), in an amount
equal to the proceeds necessary to ensure (i) reimbursement of all expenses,
direct and indirect, related to serving on the Company Board not reimbursed by
the Company as of the Effective Date and (ii) director compensation in an
amount equal to all other non management members of the board of directors.
The Stockholder Representative shall present to the Escrow Agent a statement
of such amounts, together with a certification from the Affiliated
Securityholders that they agree with such payment amounts. To the extent the
Deferred Payment(s) payable to the Securityholders Affiliated with the
Stockholder Representative are not sufficient to pay such amounts in full,
there shall be no obligation on the part of the Escrow Agent to pay any such
excess amounts to the Stockholder Representative. All such payments shall be
in accordance with the provisions of Article 2 and the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

11.02 _Waiver_. Either Acquiror, on the one hand, or the Company, on the
other, may, by written notice to the other: (a) extend the time for
performance of any of the obligations or other actions of the other party
under this Agreement, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations or
warranties of such other party contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any of the
conditions or covenants of such other party contained in this Agreement, or
(d) waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of such other party
under this Agreement. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, no action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including, without limitation, any
investigation by or on behalf of either party shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any of the
representations, warranties, covenants, conditions, or agreements contained
in this Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of this
Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any subsequent
breach.

 

11.03 _Entire Agreement; Amendment_. This Agreement, including any exhibits,
schedules, the Disclosure Letter and any documents referred to herein (which
exhibits, schedules, Disclosure Letter and documents are incorporated herein
by this reference) shall constitute the complete and entire agreement between

other writings with respect to such subject matter. This Agreement can be
modified or amended only by a writing duly executed by Acquiror, the Company
and, after the Closing, the Stockholder Representative.

11.04 _Further Assurances_. From time to time, as and when requested by
any party hereto, any other party shall execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, all such documents and instruments and shall take, or
cause to be taken, all such further or other actions as such other party may
reasonably deem necessary or desirable to evidence and effectuate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Any party or other recipient may from time to time change its address and
facsimile number for purposes of this Agreement by giving notice of such
change as provided herein.

11.08 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which
together will constitute but one agreement.

11.09 _Parties in Interest; Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights
hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties hereto without the prior

11.11 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced by any rule of law or public policy, all other
terms and provisions of this Agreement will nevertheless remain in full force
and effect so long as, and only so long as, the economic or legal substance of

manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated to the extent possible.

11.12 _Specific Enforcement_. The parties acknowledge and agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages, even if available, would
not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, the parties shall be
entitled to an

 



60  injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions of this Agreement
in any court referred to in clause (a) below, without proof of actual damages
(and each party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of
any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable,
invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a
remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any such
breach. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
to the personal jurisdiction of any Delaware state court or any federal court
located in the State of Delaware in the event any dispute arises out of
this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court
and (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than any Delaware state court or any federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware. 

11.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS
AGREEMENT, THE MERGER, OR ANY OF THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT. Each party hereto: (a) certifies that no representative or agent
of any other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such party
would not, in the event of any action, suit or proceeding, seek to enforce the
foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto
have been induced to enter into this Agreement by, among other things, the
mutual waiver and certifications in this Section 11.13.
