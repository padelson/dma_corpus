Agreement (including Section 2.8), at the Effective Time, automatically by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company, any holder thereof or any other Persons:

Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, if any, shall be cancelled
and no consideration shall be paid or payable with respect thereto;

 

(b) each Existing Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than any Existing Share to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.7(a))
shall be converted into the right to receive:

(i) an amount of unregistered shares of Parent Common Stock determined by
dividing the Stock Consideration (subject to adjustment as provided in Section
2.16) by the number of Existing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time ("Per Share Stock Consideration");

 

(ii) an amount of cash or other immediately available funds equal to (1) the
Cash Consideration, minus the Escrow Amount, divided by (2) the number of
Existing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(iii) (A) if the PRB Sale has occurred prior to the Effective Time, an amount

Existing Shares at the time and in the manner required by Section 5.20(b), and
(B) if the PRB Sale has not occurred prior to the Effective Time, a number of

respect to such Existing Share to the former holder thereof in accordance

Section 2.8  _Reallocation of Merger Consideration_. Promptly following the
date of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to each of the holders of

Questionnaire") which shall solicit certain information from such holder
relative to such Persons qualifications as an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501(a) of Regulation D, as amended, under the Securities Act
(an "Accredited Investor"). In the event that the Company does not deliver to
Parent, on or prior to the third Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
fully-completed and executed Investor Questionnaires from such number of
Persons such that the Parent may reasonably determine that the aggregate
number of Persons holding Existing Shares immediately prior to the Effective
Time who are not Accredited Investors (each, an "Unaccredited Investor") is 35
or fewer, then notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the Parent Common Stock and, if applicable, the PRB Subsidiary Interests

Investors and:

 



-18- (a) in lieu of the Merger Consideration paid pursuant to Section 2.7(b), each

of:

 

(A) the sum of (1) the product of the Per Share Stock Consideration multiplied
by the Average Stock Price, plus (2) if the PRB Sale has not occurred prior
to the Effective Time, the quotient obtained by dividing the PRB Value by the
number of Existing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, the "Unaccredited Investor Per Share Cash-Out Consideration");
and

(B) (1) the Cash Consideration, minus the Escrow Amount, divided by (2) the
number of Existing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time;

(ii) if the PRB Sale has occurred prior to the Effective Time, an amount of
cash or other immediately available funds equal to (A) the PRB Escrow Recovery
divided by (B) the number of Existing Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, to be disbursed to the former holders of such Existing
Shares at the time and in the manner required by Section 5.20(b); and

 

(iii) any cash disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund with
respect to such Existing Share to the former holder thereof in accordance
with Section 8.5(g) or (h), as and when such disbursements are required to be
made.

(b) in lieu of the Merger Consideration paid pursuant to Section 2.7(b), each
Existing Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
any Existing Share to be cancelled pursuant to Section 2.7(a)) held by a
Person that is an Accredited Investor shall be converted into the right to
receive:

(i) an amount of unregistered shares of Parent Common Stock determined by
dividing the Stock Consideration (subject to adjustment as provided in Section
2.16) by the number of Existing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by Accredited Investors;

 

(ii) an amount of cash or other immediately available funds equal to (A) the
Accredited Investors aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Cash Consideration,
minus the Accredited Investors aggregate Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Amount,
minus the Aggregate Unaccredited Investor Cash-Out Consideration, divided by
(B) the number of Existing Shares outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time that are held by Accredited Investors;

 



-19- (iii) (A) if the PRB Sale has occurred prior to the Effective Time, an amount
of cash or other immediately available funds equal to (1) the PRB Escrow
Recovery divided by (2) the number of Existing Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time, to be disbursed to the former holders of
such Existing Shares at the time and in the manner required by Section
5.20(b), and (B) if the PRB Sale has not occurred prior to the Effective Time,
a number of the PRB Subsidiary Interests equal to (1) the number of total PRB
Subsidiary Interests, divided by (2) the number of Existing Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by
Accredited Investors; and

 

(iv) any cash disbursements required to be made from the Escrow Fund with
respect to such Existing Share to the former holder thereof in accordance
with Section 8.5(g) or (h), as and when such disbursements are required to be
made.

Section 2.9 _Escrow Contribution_. At Closing, Parent shall cause the Escrow
Amount to be paid over to Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Escrow
Bank") to hold in escrow pursuant to an escrow agreement mutually acceptable

required to be distributed to the Indemnitees or the Indemnitors in accordance
with the provisions of Article VIII.

 

Section 2.10 _Adjustments to Cash Consideration_.

 

(a) _Adjustments_. At the Closing, the Cash Consideration shall be adjusted

which reductions due to Title Defects exceed amounts due for Title Benefits,
as provided in Section 5.7, (B) the amount of reductions due to Environmental
Defects as provided in Section 5.8, and (C) the amount, if any, by
which Adjusted Net Working Capital is less than zero.

Section 2.11 _Deposit of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall select a bank or trust
company to act as the exchange agent in the Merger (the "Exchange Agent"). At
or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent (i) stock certificates or book-entry
registrations representing the number of unregistered shares of Parent Common
Stock and (ii) immediately available funds equal to the total Cash
Consideration less the Escrow Amount, in each case in the quantity sufficient
to deliver the Merger Consideration (together with, to the extent
then determinable, any cash payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to
Section 2.14, but excluding the Escrow Amount) (collectively, the "Exchange
Fund"), and, if the PRB Sale has not occurred on or prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, the PRB
Subsidiary Interests with the Exchange Agent. Parent shall instruct the
Exchange Agent to timely pay and deliver the Merger

  



-20-  Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with this
Agreement. The Exchange Agent will be instructed to invest the funds included
in the Exchange Fund in the manner directed by Parent; _provided_ that in no
event shall any losses on such investments affect the amount of cash payable
to holders of Existing Shares pursuant to this Article II. Any interest or
other income resulting from the investment of such funds shall be the
property of, and will be paid to, Parent.

(b) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the holders
of Existing Shares as of the date that is one year after the Effective Time
(as well as any interest or proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be
delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent, other than the PRB Subsidiary
Interests (if applicable), which shall be delivered to the Company. Any such
holders who have not theretofore complied with this Section 2.11 and Section
2.12(a) shall thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of each Existing Share such Person holds as determined
pursuant to this Agreement, in each case without any interest thereon. If
payment for Existing Shares is not claimed prior to the date on which such
shares of Parent Common Stock, PRB Subsidiary Interests (if applicable), or
cash would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental
Authority, the unclaimed items shall, to the extent permitted by abandoned
property and any other applicable Law, become the property of Parent (and to
the extent not in its possession shall be delivered to it), free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled to such property.
Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to
any holder of Existing Shares for any Merger Consideration (or any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto) paid to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. The Buyer Parties and
the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the transfer books of the
Company relating to the Existing Shares to establish the identity of those
Persons entitled to receive the Merger Consideration specified in this
Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. In the event
of a dispute with respect to ownership of any Existing Shares, the Buyer
Parties and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to tender to the custody of
any court of competent jurisdiction any Merger Consideration with respect
to such Existing Shares and file legal proceedings interpleading all parties
to such dispute, and will thereafter be relieved with respect to any claims
thereto.

 

Section 2.12 _Payment and Delivery of Merger Consideration_.

 

(a) On or promptly after the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to mail or deliver to each Person who was, immediately prior
to the Effective Time, a holder of record of Existing Shares: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may reasonably specify and the Company shall reasonably
approve (including (A) a provision specifying that the exchange of Existing
Shares shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Existing Shares shall
pass only upon delivery of such Existing Shares to the Exchange Agent, and (B)
a provision pursuant to which such Person agrees to be bound by the
provisions of this Section 2.12, Article VIII, Section 9.1, and the other
applicable provisions of this Agreement), and (ii) requirements and
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of Existing Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration to which such Person may be entitled
pursuant to this Article II. Upon delivery to the Exchange Agent of such
letter of transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, the holder of such Existing Shares will be entitled to
receive as

 



-21-  promptly as practicable after the Effective Time the Merger Consideration
and any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
or paid in consideration therefor in respect of such holders Existing
Shares, after giving effect to any required deduction for Taxes. No interest
will accrue or be paid with respect to any payment to be made upon surrender
of Existing Shares. For purposes of the payment of Merger Consideration and
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued or
paid in consideration therefor in respect of Existing Shares held in the
Company Rabbi Trust, such payment shall be made to the Company, in
its capacity as trustee of the Company Rabbi Trust, for distribution to the
beneficiaries of the Company Rabbi Trust in connection with the termination of
the Company Rabbi Trust and the related deferred compensation plan of the
Company.

 

(b) All shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger
shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if ever a
dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent
Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time,
that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of
all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No
dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent Common Stock shall
be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Existing Shares until such Existing
Shares are surrendered for exchange in accordance with this Section 2.12.
Subject to the effect of applicable Laws, following surrender of any such
Existing Shares, there shall be issued and/or paid to the holder of the
certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) at the time of such surrender, the
dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time
theretofore payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
and not yet paid to such holder, and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the
dividends or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a
payment date subsequent to surrender.

(c) The Buyer Parties, the Company and the Exchange Agent, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Person such amounts as the Buyer Parties,
the Company or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, are required to deduct and
withhold under applicable Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld shall be
remitted to the appropriate Governmental Authority and upon such remittance
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Buyer Parties, the Company or the Exchange Agent.

(d) _Legend_. Any certificate representing Parent Common Stock or the PRB
Subsidiary Interests, as applicable, issued to any Person pursuant to this
Article II shall be imprinted with the following legend:

 

 _"THESE SECURITIES HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED, AND MAY NOT BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF, IN WHOLE OR IN
PART, OTHER THAN PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION UNDER SAID ACT OR IN CONFORMITY WITH
THE LIMITATIONS OF RULE 144 OR OTHER EXEMPTION AS THEN IN EFFECT, WITHOUT
FIRST OBTAINING IF REASONABLY REQUIRED BY THE COMPANY, (I) A WRITTEN OPINION
OF COUNSEL _

 



-22- _ SATISFACTORY TO THE COMPANY, WHICH MAY BE COUNSEL TO THE COMPANY, TO THE
EFFECT THAT THE CONTEMPLATED SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION WILL NOT BE IN
VIOLATION OF SAID ACT, OR (II) A NO-ACTION OR INTERPRETIVE LETTER FROM THE
STAFF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION TO THE EFFECT THAT SUCH STAFF
WILL TAKE NO ACTION IN RESPECT OF THE CONTEMPLATED SALE OR OTHER DISPOSITION."
_

 

Section 2.13 _Rights as Members; Transfers of Existing Shares_. All Existing
Shares, when converted as provided in Section 2.7, shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and retired, shall cease to
exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive for each such
Existing Share the Merger Consideration and any cash in lieu of
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with this Article II.
At the Effective Time, the holders of Existing Shares shall cease to be, and
shall have no rights as, members of the Company, other than the right to
receive the Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock as provided under this Article II. After the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers of Existing Shares
on the Companys transfer books pertaining to the Existing Shares.

Section 2.14 _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof,
no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock and no certificates or scrip
therefor, or other evidence of ownership thereof, will be issued in the
Merger. In lieu thereof, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid to each Person
who otherwise would receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock,
rounded to the nearest one-hundredth of a share, an amount of cash (without
interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying the
fractional share interest in Parent Common Stock to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled by the Average Stock Price.

Section 2.15 _Share-Based Awards_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
all unvested Company Restricted Shares, if any, shall vest in full so as to no
longer be subject to any forfeiture or vesting requirements of the Company
Share Plan or any underlying award agreements, and all such Company
Restricted Shares shall be considered outstanding Existing Shares for all
purposes of this Agreement, including, without limitation, for purposes of the
right to receive the Merger Consideration with respect thereto. The Company
Board (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the Company
Share Plan) shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be
required to effect the foregoing.

 

Section 2.16 _Anti-Dilution Provisions_. In the event that on or after the
first trading day used in determining the Average Stock Price and before the
Effective Time Parent changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the
number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Parent Common Stock
issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization,
reclassification, or similar transaction with respect to the outstanding
Parent Common Stock, the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
in exchange for the Existing Shares pursuant to the provisions of this
Article II shall be equitably adjusted; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, no such adjustment shall be made with regard to the Parent Common Stock
if (a) Parent issues additional shares of Parent Common Stock and receives
consideration for such shares in a bona fide third party transaction, or (b)
Parent issues employee or director stock options, restricted stock awards,
grants or similar equity awards or Parent issues Parent Common Stock upon
exercise or vesting of any such options, grants or awards.

 



-23- Section 2.17 _No Right to Dissent_. Section 18-210 of the DLLCA
(titled "Contractual Appraisal Rights") shall not apply to or be incorporated
into this Agreement or the Contemplated Transactions.

 

Section 2.18 _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any
further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to carry
out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Entity or the
Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and property
of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers, managers and directors of
the Surviving Entity and the Parent, respectively, shall be fully authorized
(in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take
such action.

-28- Section 3.9 _Financial Statements; Indebtedness_.

 

(a) The Company has delivered to the Parent its audited financial statements
(including balance sheet, income statement and statement of cash flows) as of
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, for the fiscal years then ended and its
unaudited financial statements as of March 31, 2015 (the "Unaudited Balance
Sheet Date") and March 31, 2014, for the three-month periods then ended
(collectively, the "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements have been
prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting
principles ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods
indicated. The Financial Statements fairly present in all material respects
the financial condition, operating results and cash flows of the Company as of
the dates, and for the periods, indicated therein, subject in the case of the
unaudited Financial Statements to normal year-end audit adjustments. Except as

(b) The books, records and accounts of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries accurately and fairly reflect, in reasonable detail,

respects, reasonable assurance that: (i) transactions are executed in
accordance with managements general or specific authorization; (ii)
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial
statements in conformity with GAAP and to maintain accountability for assets;
and (iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with managements
general or specific authorization. There is not, and there has not been, any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves or involved management or other
employees who have or had a significant role in the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries internal control over financial reporting. No significant
deficiencies or material weaknesses in the design or operation of
the Companys and each of its Subsidiaries system of internal control over
financial reporting were identified in Companys most recent assessment that
would be reasonably likely to adversely affect the Thunder Entities ability
to record, process, summarize and report financial information.

its Subsidiaries arose in the ordinary course of business, are carried on the
records of the Company and its Subsidiaries at values determined in accordance

of such Company Indebtedness; (ii) the incurrence of any other Indebtedness by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; or (iii) the ability of the Company or
its Subsidiaries to grant any Lien on any of its assets. With respect to each
item of Company Indebtedness, the Company and its Subsidiaries are not in
default and no payments are past due. The Company has not received any notice
of a default, alleged failure to perform or any offset or counterclaim with
respect to any item of Company Indebtedness. The Closing Statement will
contain a complete and accurate list of each item of Company Indebtedness as
of the Closing Date, identifying the creditor to which such
Company Indebtedness is owed, the name and address of such creditor, the type
of instrument under which such Company Indebtedness is owed and the aggregate
dollar amount of such item of Company Indebtedness immediately prior to the

business dealings with them, and (d) maintain their assets in their current
condition, except for ordinary wear and tear, depletion of oil and gas

indirect liability, whether actual or contingent, with respect to any
misclassification of any person as an independent contractor rather than as
an employee, or as exempt rather than non-exempt, or with respect to any
employee leased from another employer.

(b) There are no collective bargaining agreements or other labor union
agreements in effect to which any of the Thunder Entities are a party or
bound. None of the Thunder Entities are the subject of any Legal Proceeding
asserting that it has committed an unfair labor practice or seeking to compel

had any actual or, to the Companys Knowledge, threatened strike, slowdown,
work stoppage, boycott, lockout, job action or other material labor dispute
since January 1, 2012. There has not been a "mass layoff" or "plant closing"

Thunder Entities within the six months preceding the date of this Agreement.

employee benefit plan, policy, agreement or program, whether or not subject
to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"),
maintained, established or sponsored by any of the Thunder Entities, in which
any of the Thunder Entities participates, to which any of the Thunder
Entities contributes or with respect to which any of the Thunder Entities has
any direct or indirect liability, contingent or otherwise (collectively, the
"Benefit Plans"). The Thunder Entities have timely made all
required contributions and premium payments (without regard to any waivers
granted with respect thereto) to each Benefit Plan or

 



-31-  any funds or trusts established thereunder or in connection therewith and
have no current or projected liability in respect of post-employment health,
medical or life insurance benefits for any current or former employees, other
than liability for health plan continuation coverage described in Part 6 of
Title I(B) of ERISA and at the individuals expense, and each Benefit Plan has
been established, administered and maintained in compliance in all material
respects with its terms and all applicable Laws for any such Benefit Plan,
including ERISA and the Code.

(e) Each Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a)
of the Code has received a favorable determination letter (or opinion letter,
if applicable) from the IRS stating that such Benefit Plan is so qualified
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances
that would reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification.
None of the Thunder Entities nor any other entity which, together with any of
the Thunder Entities, would be treated as a single employer under Section
4001 of ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate") contributes to
or has in the past six years sponsored, maintained, contributed to or had any
liability in respect of any defined benefit pension plan (as defined in
Section 3(35) of ERISA) or plan subject to Section 412 of the Code, Section
302 of ERISA or Title IV of ERISA. No Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA and none of the Thunder

sponsored or contributed to, or had any liability or obligation in respect of,
any such multiemployer plan.

routine claims for benefits) that, individually or in the aggregate, has
resulted or would reasonably be expected to result in material liability to
the Thunder Entities is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened. No event has occurred, and to the Knowledge of the Company, no
condition exists that would, directly or by reason of the affiliation of any
of the Thunder Entities with any of their ERISA Affiliates, subject the
Thunder Entities to any material Tax, fine, Lien, penalty or other liability
imposed by ERISA, the Code or other applicable Laws. Each Benefit Plan that
constitutes a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code and applicable regulations) complies in all material
respects with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

Merger (either alone or in combination with any other event) will not: (i)
materially increase the compensation or benefits payable by any Thunder
Entities under any Benefit Plan; (ii) result in any acceleration of the time
of payment or vesting of any material benefits payable by any Thunder Entities
under any Benefit Plan, other than the Company Share Plan; or (iii) create any
limitation or restriction on the right of any Thunder Entity to merge, amend
or terminate any Benefit Plan, or (iv) except as set forth on _Section
3.11(g)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, result in the payment of any
amount that could, individually or in combination with any other such payment,

-46- Section 4.6 _SEC Documents; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Parent has filed all required reports, registration statements and other
documents with the SEC that it has been required to file since January 1,
2014 (the "Parent Reports"), and has paid all fees and assessments due and
payable in connection therewith. As of their respective dates of filing with
the SEC (or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the
date hereof, as of the date of such subsequent filing), the Parent Reports
complied as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and
regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Parent Reports. None of
the Parent Reports when filed with the SEC, or if amended prior to the date
hereof, as of the date of such amendment, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Parent has not
received notice that there are any outstanding comments from or unresolved
issues raised by the SEC, as applicable, with respect to any of the Parent
Reports. Except for those liabilities that are fully reflected or reserved
against in the most recent audited consolidated balance sheet of Parent and
its Subsidiaries contained in Parents Annual Report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2014, and except for liabilities reflected in
the Parent Reports filed prior to the date hereof or incurred in the ordinary
course of business, consistent with past practice, of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, or incurred in connection with this Agreement, since December
31, 2014 to the date hereof, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has
any liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,
contingent or otherwise) required by GAAP to be set forth on its consolidated
balance sheet or in the notes thereto.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements of Parent (including any related
notes and schedules thereto) included in the Parent Reports complied as to
form, as of their respective dates of filing with the SEC (or, if amended or
superseded by a subsequent filing prior to the date hereof, as of the date of
such subsequent filing), in all material respects, with all applicable
accounting requirements and with the published rules and regulations of the
SEC with respect thereto (except, in the case of unaudited statements, as
permitted by the rules of the SEC), have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be
disclosed therein), and fairly present, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of Parent and its Subsidiaries and the
consolidated results of operations, changes in shareholders equity and cash
flows of such companies as of the dates and for the periods shown.

(c) Parent (i) has established and maintained disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the
Exchange Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act, and (ii) has
disclosed based on its most recent evaluations, to its outside auditors and
the audit committee of the Parents board of directors (A) all significant
deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange
Act) that are reasonably likely to adversely affect Parents ability to
record, process, summarize and report financial data and (B) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in Parents internal control over financial reporting.

 



-47- Section 4.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2014,
there has been no change or development with respect to Parent and its assets
and business or combination of such changes or developments that, individually
or in the aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a material
adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries.

Section 4.8 _Financing; Availability of Funds_.

 

(a) On or prior to the date hereof, the Parent has delivered to the Company a
true and complete copy of a letter dated July 13, 2015 pursuant to which
Barclays Bank PLC committed to arrange $2,000,000,000 of senior unsecured
bridge loans to finance a portion of the aggregate Cash Consideration (such
letter, together with the schedules and exhibit thereto, the "Debt Commitment
Letter").

(b) As of the Closing Date, assuming (i) the satisfaction of the conditions to
the Buyer Parties obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions
(including Section 6.3(a)), (ii) satisfaction of the conditions set forth in
Exhibit C of the Debt Commitment Letter and (iii) receipt of the Financing
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms, the
Buyer Parties will have sufficient immediately available funds in cash or cash
equivalents to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration and to pay any other
amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement, and to consummate the Merger.

Section 4.9 _Qualifications_. As of the Closing Date, the Buyer Parties will
be qualified with, and will have obtained any and all necessary consents
from, any applicable Governmental Authority required in order to own an
interest in the Thunder Properties.

Laws, so as to permit consummation of the Merger and make effective
the Contemplated Transactions as promptly as practicable and otherwise to
enable consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, and each will cooperate
fully with, and furnish information to, the other party to that end. In
addition and subject to Section 5.10(c), each party to this Agreement shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain each Consent (if any) required
to be obtained (pursuant to any applicable Law or Contract, or otherwise) by
such party in connection with the Merger or any of the other Contemplated
Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that, under no circumstance may the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries pay a fee to any third party in order to

two hours after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, written consents
in favor of the adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of the
Contemplated Transactions are executed and delivered to the Company and to

Existing Shares (the "Member Consents"). The Member Consents

 



-48-  shall specify that adoption and approval of this Agreement and approval of
the Contemplated Transactions, including the Merger, shall constitute (i)
adoption of this Agreement under the DLLCA and under the Thunder LLC
Agreement, and (ii) approval by the Members of: (A) the escrow (including the
Escrow Amount) and indemnification obligations of such Members set forth in
Article II and Article VIII; and (B) appointment of the Members Agent

Section 5.3 [Reserved]

Section 5.5 _Press Releases_. The Company and the Parent have agreed to the
text of the joint press release announcing the signing of this Agreement. The
Company shall consult with Parent before issuing any press release, written
employee communication or other written Member or shareholder communication
with respect to the Merger or this Agreement and will not issue any such
communication or make any such public statement without the prior consent of
Parent; _provided_ that the Company may, without the prior consent of Parent
(but after prior consultation, to the extent practicable in the
circumstances), issue such communication or make such public statement as may
be required by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.6 _Access; Information_. The Company agrees that, upon reasonable
notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of
information, it will (and will cause its Subsidiaries to) afford the Parent
and the Parents officers, employees, counsel, accountants and other
authorized Representatives, such access during normal business hours
throughout Pre-Closing Period to the books, records (including, without
limitation, Tax Returns and work papers of independent auditors), properties
and personnel of the Company and to such other information of the Company as
the Parent may reasonably request and, during such period, it will furnish
promptly to Parent all information concerning the business, properties and
personnel of the Company as the Parent may reasonably request. The Company
shall not be required to afford access to or disclose information that would
jeopardize attorney-client privilege, contravene any binding agreement with
any third party, or violate any Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
will make appropriate substitute arrangements in circumstances where the
foregoing applies. The Buyer Parties shall maintain as such any information
that is nonpublic and confidential to the extent required by, and in
accordance with, the separate Non-Disclosure Agreement between the Parent and
the Company (the "Confidentiality Agreement").

Section 5.7 _Title Matters_.

 

(a) _Examination Period_. Until 5:00 p.m. Central Time on August 12, 2015 (the
"Examination Period"), the Company shall permit the Buyer Parties and their
Representatives to examine all abstracts of title, title opinions, title
files, ownership maps, Lease, Unit, Well, and division order files,
assignments, operating and accounting records and all Contracts and other
agreements pertaining to the Thunder Properties, insofar as the same may

 



-49-  now be in existence and in the possession or Control of the Thunder
Entities, subject to such restrictions upon disclosure as may exist under
confidentiality or other agreements binding upon the Thunder Entities. The
Thunder Entities shall not be required to perform any additional title work,
and no existing abstracts and title opinions will be updated and made current
by the Thunder Entities. Should the Buyer Parties prepare or update abstracts
or title opinions, a copy of same will be made available to the Company,
without cost and without warranty of any kind, for the Companys independent
examination upon the delivery of a notice of alleged Title Defect.

 

(b) _Title Defects_. The term "Title Defect" means: (i) any Lien, burden,
irregularity or other defect that causes the applicable Thunder Entity not to
have Defensible Title to a Thunder Property; (ii) the failure to provide any
notice or obtain any consent shown on _Section 3.3_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule as and when required; and (iii) any default by a Thunder Entity
under a Lease or Contract that would (A) have an adverse effect on the
operation or value of, or increase the operating cost of, a Lease or any Well,
(B) prevent the Thunder Entity from receiving the proceeds of production or
share of hydrocarbons attributable to its Net Revenue Interest therein, or (C)
result in the reduction, loss or cancellation of the Companys Net Revenue
Interest therein.

 

(c) _Notice of Title Defects; Title Defect Valuation_.

 

(i) If the Buyer Parties discover any Title Defect affecting a Thunder
Property, the Parent shall promptly notify the Company of such alleged Title
Defect. To be effective, such notice (a "Title Defect Notice") must (A) be
received by the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period, (B)
describe the Title Defect in sufficient, specific detail (including any
alleged variance in the Net Revenue Interest), (C) identify the specific
Thunder Property affected by such Title Defect, including Well by Well and/or
Lease by Lease identification, (D) contain copies of all data, title opinions
and other documents and information in the Buyer Parties possession or
control relating to the alleged Title Defect and their determination of the
Title Defect Value, and (E) include the Title Defect Value, as reasonably
determined by Buyer Parties acting in good faith.

(ii) The value attributable to each Title Defect (the "Title Defect Value")
shall be determined based upon the criteria set forth below:

(A) If the Title Defect is a Lien upon a Thunder Property (other than any
Lien existing as a result of the Credit Facility or the Senior Notes,
respectively, which Liens, in order to avoid any doubt, shall not be
considered Title Defects for purposes of this Agreement), the Title Defect
Value is the amount necessary to be paid to remove the Lien from the affected
Thunder Property, if known at the time of issuance of the Title Defect Notice;
otherwise, the Title Defect Value shall be the face amount of the Title
Defect;

 



-50- (B) If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue Interest attributable
to a Lease or Well is less than that stated on _Section 3.13_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, then the Title Defect Value is the product of the
Allocated Value attributed to such Thunder Property, multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the difference between the Net Revenue Interest
applicable thereto set forth on _Section 3.13_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule and the actual Net Revenue Interest, and the denominator of which is
the applicable Net Revenue Interest stated on _Section 3.13_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule;

(C) If the Title Defect represents an obligation, burden or charge upon the
affected Thunder Property (including any increase in working interest for
which there is not a proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest) and for
which the economic detriment to the Buyer Parties is unliquidated, the amount
of the Title Defect Value shall be determined by taking into account, in each
case if known, the Allocated Value of the affected Thunder Property, the
portion of the Thunder Property affected by the Title Defect, the
legal effect of the Title Defect, and the potential economic effect of the
Title Defect over the life of the affected Thunder Property;

 

(D) If the Title Defect represents a consent to be obtained or a notice to be
delivered by the Company which has not been obtained or delivered, as
applicable, by the expiration of the Examination Period, then the Title Defect
Value is the Allocated Value attributed to such Thunder Property; and

 

(E) Such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a proper
evaluation.

 

The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be determined without
duplication of any costs or losses included in any other Title Defect Value
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
5.7(c)(ii), in no event shall a Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value
of the Thunder Property affected thereby.

 

(d) _Exclusive Remedies for Title Defects_. Subject to Section 5.7(f), the
following shall be Buyer Parties sole and exclusive remedy with respect to
Title Defects:

(i) No later than two Business Days following receipt of a Title
Defect Notice, the Company and the Parent shall meet and use their reasonable
best efforts to agree on the validity or invalidity of each asserted Title
Defect and the Title Defect Value of each alleged Title Defect in such Title
Defect Notice. If, prior to the Closing Date, the Company and Parent cannot
agree on the validity or invalidity of any Title Defect asserted pursuant to
Section 5.7(c) and the associated Title Defect Value of such Title Defect,
such asserted Title Defect shall constitute a "Disputed Title Defect." The
Company shall have the right to elect, within its sole discretion, whether or
not to attempt to cure any such asserted Title Defect. The Cash Consideration
shall be reduced by the Title Defect Value associated with each Title Defect
asserted pursuant to Section 5.7(c), if any, (1) as to which, prior to the
Closing Date, the Company and Parent have agreed on both the validity and the
Title Defect Value, and (2) that is not cured prior to Closing. In order to
avoid any doubt, there shall be no adjustment to the Cash Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.10(a) for the Title Defect Value of any Disputed Title
Defect.

 



-51- (ii) Any Title Defect cured by the Company to the reasonable satisfaction
of Parent or for which the Parent receives an adjustment to the Cash
Consideration shall constitute a Permitted Encumbrance.

In order to avoid any doubt, except in the case of Fraud, the Buyer Parties
exclusive remedies with respect to Title Defects (other than Disputed Title
Defects), including any breach of Section 3.13 or, as it pertains to any
Lease, Section 3.17, shall be recourse to the procedures described in this
Section 5.7. Except in the case of Fraud, any Title Defects (other than
Disputed Title Defects) not asserted by the Buyer Parties prior to the
expiration of the Examination Period shall be deemed waived in all respects,
and the Indemnitees shall have no right to indemnification with respect to any
Title Defects (including any breach of Section 3.13 or, as it pertains to any
Lease, Section 3.17) pursuant to Article VIII, including, without limitation,
pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or 8.2(b) of this Agreement.

(e) _Title Benefits_. Subject to Section 5.7(f), and in accordance with
Section 2.10(a)(ii), the Company shall be entitled to an upward adjustment to
the Cash Consideration (such upward adjustment not to exceed the aggregate
amount of all reductions due to Title Defects) with respect to all Title
Benefits in an amount (the "Title Benefit Value") mutually agreed upon by the
parties and determined in accordance with the criteria set forth in the
definition of the term Title Defect Value. A party identifying a Title
Benefit affecting the Thunder Properties shall promptly notify the other party
in writing of such Title Benefit. The term "Title Benefit" shall mean the
Companys Net Revenue Interest in any Lease that is greater than the Net
Revenue Interest set forth on _Section 3.13_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, or the Companys working interest in any Well that is less than the
working interest set forth on _Section 3.13_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule (without a proportionate decrease in the Net Revenue Interest
applicable to such Well), including, without limitation, Wells and/or Net
Revenue Interests acquired by the Company after the date of this Agreement and
prior to the Closing.

(f) _Limitation_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, (i) if the Title Defect Value for a given Title Defect, or the
Title Benefit Value for a given Title Benefit, does not exceed $50,000, then
no claim or adjustment to the Cash Consideration shall be made for such Title
Defect or Title Benefit, and any such Title Defect shall be deemed to be a
Permitted Encumbrance for purposes of this Agreement and shall not be deemed
to constitute a breach of Section 3.13 or, as it pertains to any Lease,
Section 3.17, (ii) if the aggregate net value of all uncured Title Defects
and Title Benefits exceeding $50,000 individually does not exceed $68,750,000,
then no adjustment of the Merger Consideration shall be made therefor and each
such Title Defect shall not be deemed to constitute a breach of Section 3.13
or, as it pertains to any Lease, Section 3.17, and (iii) if the aggregate net
value of all uncured Title Defects and Title Benefits exceeding $50,000
individually exceeds $68,750,000, then the Cash Consideration shall only be
adjusted by the amount of such excess, and Title Defects with an aggregate
Title Defect Value equal to $68,750,000 shall not be deemed to constitute a
breach of Section 3.13 or, as it pertains to any Lease, Section 3.17.

 



-52- Section 5.8 _Environmental Matters_.

 

(a) _Environmental Review_.

 

(i) The Buyer Parties shall have the right to conduct an environmental review
of the Thunder Properties prior to the expiration of the Examination Period
("Environmental Review"). The Company shall provide the Buyer Parties such
access as they may reasonably request to the Leases, Units and Wells (provided
that if such Well is operated by a third party, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to secure such access) and the non-privileged
environmental data in the Thunder Entities files for the Thunder Properties.
The scope of work comprising the Environmental Review conducted at or upon
the Leases, Units and Wells shall be limited to that mutually agreed in
writing by the Parent and the Company (acting reasonably) prior to
commencement thereof and shall not include any intrusive test or procedure
without the prior written consent of the Company, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld. The Parent shall (A) consult with the Company before
conducting any work comprising such Environmental Review, (B) perform all such
work in a safe and workmanlike manner and so as to not unreasonably interfere
with the Thunder Entities operations, and (C) comply with all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations of applicable Governmental Authorities. The
Parent and the Company shall cooperate and use reasonable best efforts to
obtain any third party consents that are required in order to perform any work
comprising the Environmental Review, including, without limitation, consent
from the operator of any Thunder Properties operated by a third party that
the Buyer Parties desire to inspect. The Company shall have the right to have
one or more Representatives accompany the Parent at all times during the
Environmental Review, the Parent shall give the Company notice not more than
seven days and not less than 48 hours before any visits by the Parent to any
of the Thunder Properties, and the Parent shall seek and obtain the Companys
prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) before it
enters upon any of the Thunder Properties. With respect to any samples taken
in connection with the Environmental Review, the Parent shall take split
samples, providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and identified,
to the Company. The Parent hereby agrees to release, defend, indemnify and
hold harmless the Company and its Affiliates from and against all claims
arising from, out of any negligence or willful misconduct of any Buyer Party
during the Environmental Review.

 

(ii) Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, the Buyer Parties shall
treat all matters revealed by the Environmental Review, including, without
limitation, any analyses, compilations, studies, documents, reports or data
prepared or generated from such review (the "Environmental Information"), as
confidential, and the Buyer Parties shall not disclose any Environmental
Information to any Governmental Authority or other third party without the
prior written consent of the Company except as hereafter provided. Prior to
the Closing, the Buyer Parties may use the Environmental Information only in
connection with the Contemplated Transactions. The Environmental Information
shall be disclosed by the Buyer Parties only to their Representatives who need
to know the Environmental Information for purposes of evaluating
the Contemplated Transactions and who have agreed to be bound by the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement. If this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing, upon

 



-53-  the Companys request the Buyer Parties shall promptly deliver the
Environmental Information, and all copies thereof and works based thereon, to
the Company, which Environmental Information shall become the sole property
of the Company. Upon request the Buyer Parties shall provide copies of the
Environmental Information to the Company without charge.

 

(b) _Definitions_.

 

(i) The term "Environmental Defect" shall mean, with respect to any given
Thunder Property, a violation of Environmental Laws in effect as of the date
of this Agreement in the jurisdiction in which such Thunder Property is
located, including, without limitation, the presence of Hazardous Substances
at, on, under or migrating to or from any Thunder Property at concentrations
in excess of those permitted under such Environmental Laws, but excluding the
presence of naturally occurring radioactive material resulting from operations
customary in the oil and natural gas industry.

 

(ii) The term "Environmental Defect Value" shall mean, with respect to an
Environmental Defect, the estimated costs and expenses to correct such
Environmental Defect in the most cost-effective manner reasonably available,
consistent with Environmental Laws, taking into account that non-permanent
remedies (such as mechanisms to contain or stabilize Hazardous Substances,
including, without limitation, monitoring site conditions, natural
attenuation, risk-based corrective action, institutional controls or other
appropriate restrictions on the use of property, caps, dikes, encapsulation,
leachate collection systems, etc.) may be the most cost-effective manner
reasonably available.

(c) _Notice of Environmental Defects_. If the Buyer Parties discover any
alleged Environmental Defect affecting the Thunder Properties, the Parent
shall promptly notify the Company of such alleged Environmental Defect. To be
effective, such notice (an "Environmental Defect Notice") must: (i) be
received by the Company prior to the expiration of the Examination Period;
(ii) describe the Environmental Defect in sufficient, specific detail,
including (A) the written conclusion of the Parent that an Environmental
Defect exists, which conclusion shall be reasonably substantiated by the
factual data gathered in the Environmental Review, and (B) a separate specific
citation of the provisions of Environmental Laws alleged to be violated
and the related facts that substantiate such violation; (iii) identify the
specific Thunder Property affected by such Environmental Defect, including, if
available, a site plan showing the location of all sampling events, boring
logs and other field notes describing the sampling methods utilized and the
field conditions observed, chain-of-custody documentation and laboratory
reports; (iv) the procedures recommended to correct the Environmental Defect;
and (v) the Parents reasonable good faith estimate of the Environmental
Defect Value, including, without limitation, the basis for such estimate, for
which the Parent would agree to adjust the Cash Consideration in order to
accept such Environmental Defect if the Company elected Section 5.8(d)(ii) as
the remedy therefor.

(d) _Exclusive Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Subject to Section 5.8(e)
below, the following shall be the Buyer Parties sole and exclusive remedy
with respect to alleged Environmental Defects asserted prior to the expiration
of the Examination Period:

 



-54- (i) Upon the receipt of an Environmental Defect Notice from the Parent
asserting an alleged Environmental Defect, the Company shall have the option,
but not the obligation, to attempt to cure such Environmental Defect at any
time prior to the Closing.

 

(ii) With respect to each alleged Environmental Defect that is not reasonably
cured on or before the Closing, the Cash Consideration shall be reduced by
the Environmental Defect Value for such Environmental Defect agreed upon in
writing by the Parent and the Company acting reasonably.

 

(iii) Any Environmental Defect cured by the Company or for which the Parent
receives an adjustment to the Cash Consideration shall be excluded from the
scope of the Companys representations and warranties in Section 3.16.

__In order to avoid any doubt, the Buyer Parties  exclusive remedies with
respect to Environmental Defects identified and asserted prior to the
expiration of the Examination Period shall be recourse to the procedures set
forth in this Section 5.8. Following the expiration of the Examination
Period, the Buyer Parties exclusive remedies with respect to matters relating
to Environmental Laws shall be as set forth in Article VII (prior to the
Closing) or Article VIII (after the Closing); _provided_ , _however_ , that
no breach of any representation or warranty of the Company relating to
compliance with Environmental Laws or other related matters with respect to
any Thunder Property shall be asserted by or on behalf of any Indemnitee
unless all such alleged breaches have collectively resulted in Damages in
excess of the amount that would have been sufficient for an adjustment to the
Cash Consideration pursuant to Section 5.8(e) below. __

 

(e) _Limitation of Remedies for Environmental Defects_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) if the
Environmental Defect Value for a given Environmental Defect does not exceed
$100,000, then no adjustment to the Cash Consideration shall be made for such
Environmental Defect, (ii) if the aggregate of all Environmental Defect
Values exceeding $100,000 individually for uncured Environmental Defects not
waived by the Parent does not exceed $68,750,000, then no adjustment of the
Cash Consideration shall be made therefor, and (iii) if the aggregate of all
Environmental Defect Values exceeding $100,000 individually for uncured
Environmental Defects not waived by the Parent exceeds $68,750,000, then the
Cash Consideration shall only be reduced by the amount of such excess.

 

Section 5.9 _Solicitation of Other Proposals_.

 

(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall not, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries and its and its Subsidiaries Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly, solicit, initiate, knowingly encourage, knowingly facilitate,
or furnish or disclose nonpublic information in furtherance of, any inquiries
or the making of any offer or proposal regarding any Acquisition
Transaction, or participate in any discussions (other than to respond
negatively) or negotiations with, any Person (other than the Parent and its
Affiliates or Representatives) concerning any Acquisition Transaction or any
proposal that reasonably could be expected to lead to an Acquisition
Transaction.

 



-55- (b) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall advise the Parent within
the Notice Period (as defined below) of the receipt, directly or indirectly,
of any inquiries or proposals from any third party, or of any discussions or
negotiations with any third party involving the Company, the Members or their
respective Representatives, relating to an Acquisition Transaction (including
a summary of the material and significant terms and conditions thereof and the
identity of the other Person(s) involved), and promptly furnish to the Parent
a copy of any such inquiry or written proposal. For purposes of this
Agreement, the term "Notice Period" shall mean (i) with respect to such
written inquiries or proposals or other written materials, written notice as
promptly as practicable and in no event later than 24 hours after receipt
thereof and (ii) with respect to such oral inquiries, discussions,
negotiations or proposals, oral notice as promptly as practicable and in no
event later than 24 hours after receipt thereof.

 

Section 5.10 _Regulatory Applications_.

 

(a) The Buyer Parties and the Company and their respective Subsidiaries will
cooperate, coordinate and use all reasonable best efforts to prepare as
promptly as possible all documentation, to effect all filings and to obtain
all permits, consents, approvals and authorizations of all Governmental
Authorities necessary to consummate the Merger (the "Requisite
Regulatory Approvals") and will make all necessary filings in respect of
those Requisite Regulatory Approvals as soon as practicable, including,
without limitation, all required filings by the Company and the Parent,
respectively, and the payment of all required fees by the Parent under and
pursuant to the HSR Act. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Section 5.10 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Parent: (i) shall have the
principal responsibility for devising and implementing the strategy of the
parties with respect to seeking any Requisite Regulatory Approvals and
coordinating any contacts, where permitted, with any Governmental Authorities;
and (ii) shall take the lead in all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Authorities in connection with obtaining any such Requisite
Regulatory Approvals; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except where prohibited
by applicable Law or any Governmental Authorities, each of the Company and
the Parent will have the right to review in advance, and to the extent
practicable each will consult with the other, in each case subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, with respect to all
material written information submitted to any Governmental Authority in
connection with the Requisite Regulatory Approvals. In exercising the
foregoing right, each of the parties will act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Each party agrees that it will consult with the other party with
respect to obtaining all material permits, consents, approvals and
authorizations of all Governmental Authorities necessary or advisable to
consummate the Contemplated Transactions, and each party will keep the other
party apprised of the status of material matters relating to completion of the
Contemplated Transactions.

 

(b) Each of the Company and the Buyer Parties will, upon request, furnish the
other party with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries,
managers, directors, officers, Members and shareholders and such other
matters, in each case as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in
connection with any filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of such
other party or any of its Subsidiaries with or to any Governmental Authority
in connection with the Contemplated Transactions.

 



-56- (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.10 or
elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have any
obligation under this Agreement: (i) to divest or agree to divest (or cause
any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity or any of its Subsidiaries) to divest or agree to divest) any of its
businesses, product lines or assets, or to take or agree to take (or cause any
of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity
or any of its Subsidiaries) to take or agree to take) any other action or to
agree (or cause any of its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity or any of its Subsidiaries) to agree) to any limitation
or restriction on any of its businesses, product lines or assets; or (ii) to
contest any Legal Proceeding relating to the Merger or any of the other
Contemplated Transactions.

 

Section 5.11 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time, the Parent will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless the present and former managers, officers and employees of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an "Indemnified Party") against all costs
or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages or liabilities as incurred, in connection with any Legal
Proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising
out of actions or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time
(including the Contemplated Transactions), whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, (i) to the same extent as such Persons are
indemnified, exculpated or have the right to advancement of expenses pursuant
to the Companys and its Subsidiaries Constituent Documents
and indemnification agreements, if any, in effect on the date of this
Agreement, and (ii) without expanding clause (i), to the fullest extent
permitted by Law.

 

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this Section
5.11, upon learning of any Legal Proceeding, shall promptly notify the
Parent, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Parent of any
liability it may have to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not
actually and materially prejudice the Parent. In the event of any such Legal
Proceeding (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Parent shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, and the Parent
shall not be liable to the Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other
counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Party
in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the Parent elects not
to assume such defense or counsel for the Indemnified Party advises that there
are issues that raise conflicts of interest between the Parent and the
Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent, and the Parent shall pay, promptly as statements
therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for
the Indemnified Party (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction),
(ii) the Indemnified Party will cooperate in the defense of any such matter,
and (iii) the Parent shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

(c) For a period of six years following the Effective Time, the Parent will
provide directors and officers liability insurance that serves to reimburse
the present and former officers, managers and directors of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (determined immediately prior to the Effective Time) with
respect to claims against such managers, directors and officers arising from
facts or events occurring before the Effective Time (including the

 



-57- _ _ Contemplated Transactions), which insurance will contain substantially
similar coverage and amounts, and contain terms and conditions materially no
less advantageous to the Indemnified Party as that coverage currently
provided by the Company; _provided_ , that the Parent may substitute therefor
policies of the Parent or its Subsidiaries containing terms with respect to
coverage and amount materially no less advantageous to such managers,
directors or officers; _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall the
Parent be required to pay aggregate premiums for insurance under this Section
5.11(c) in excess of 250% of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in
2014 on an annualized basis for such purpose and, if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage
available for a cost not exceeding such amount; and _provided_ , _further_ ,
that officers, managers and directors of the Company or any Subsidiary may be
required to make application and provide customary representations and
warranties to the Parents insurance carrier for the purpose of obtaining
such insurance (provided that no such application or representation or
warranty shall limit or preclude coverage for any act or omission occurring
prior to the Effective Time). __

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in lieu of
Parents obligations under the first sentence of Section 5.11(c), Parent may,
prior to the Effective Time, purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy on the
Companys existing policy of directors and officers liability insurance on
terms with respect to coverage and amounts no less favorable in the aggregate
than the Companys current policy, with an annual cost not in excess of 250%
of the aggregate premiums paid by the Company in 2014 on an annualized basis.
In the event that Parent shall purchase such "tail" policy, Parent shall
maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to honor its
obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other applicable obligations under the
first sentence of 5.11(c) for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.11 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and Representatives.

 

Section 5.12 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Each of the Company and the
Parent will give prompt notice to the other of any fact, event or
circumstance known to it that (a) is reasonably likely, individually or taken
together with all other facts, events and circumstances known to it, to result
in any Material Adverse Effect or any material adverse effect on the
Parent, or (b) would cause or constitute a material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained herein that
reasonably could be expected to give rise, individually or in the aggregate,
to the failure of a condition in Article VI; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any noncompliance with the foregoing shall not constitute the failure to
satisfy a condition set forth in Article VI or give rise to any right of
termination under Article VII unless the underlying breach shall
independently constitute such a failure or give rise to such a right; and
_provided further_ , that the covenants of the parties in this Section 5.12
shall expire at the Effective Time. 

 



-58- Section 5.13 _Activities of the Company Pending Closing_. Except in connection
with the PRB Transaction, the sale or other disposition of the Non-Core

goodwill and ongoing business shall be unimpaired at the Effective Time, and
(iv) keep in full force and effect all material insurance policies (including
maintaining the amount of coverage provided by any such policies) maintained
by the Company and its Subsidiaries, other than changes to such policies made
in the ordinary course of business. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, and otherwise as expressly permitted by this Agreement or as
required by applicable Law, during the Pre-Closing Period, the Company shall

Section 5.14 _Activities of the Parent Pending Closing_. Except in connection
with the Contemplated Transactions or as required by applicable Law, during
the Pre-Closing Period, the Parent shall, and shall cause each of its

(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned

 



-61-  or delayed), to (a) enter into any transaction that reasonably could be

Section 5.15 _Company Employees_. At the Effective Time and continuing until
12 months thereafter, all employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries

employees. The Parent shall give credit to all such Continuing Employees for
their prior service time with the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in
connection with the determination of eligibility for and participation in any
employee benefit plans maintained by Parent and/or its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall result in the duplication
of any benefits for the same period of service. No provision of this Section
5.15 or any other provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (including any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of
continued employment by the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise. Nothing
herein shall (i) guarantee employment for any period of time or preclude the
ability of Parent, the Company or its Subsidiaries to terminate the employment

The Company shall provide Parent the opportunity to participate in the

settlement of such litigation shall be proposed or agreed to by the Company,
and no agreement or arrangement with any Member with respect to any such
litigation shall be proposed or entered into by the Company without the prior
written consent of Parent.

 



-62- Section 5.17 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 

(i) The Company shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, on or before the
Closing Date, all Tax Returns of the Thunder Entities that are due on or
before such date (determined without regard to any applicable extensions) and
the Company shall pay or cause to be paid all Taxes shown due thereon. All
such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Law.

__(ii) The Company shall provide Parent with a draft of the 2014 U.S. federal
income Tax Return of the Thunder Entities along with any supporting work
papers on or before the Closing Date, and in any event, within 10 days before
the filing date for such Tax Return (taking into account any applicable
extensions) for Parent s review, comment and approval (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed). If such Tax Return is required to be filed
prior to the Closing Date, the Company will incorporate any reasonable
comments proposed by Parent and timely file such Tax Return; _provided_ ,
that any such comments would not result in material incremental Taxes. The
Company and Parent shall reasonably cooperate, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates, officers, employees, agents and auditors reasonably to
cooperate, in preparing and filing the 2014 U.S. federal income Tax Return of
the Thunder Entities, including maintaining and making available to each other
all records necessary in connection with Taxes. __

 

(iii) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns of the Thunder Entities for any taxable period ending

practices of the Company with respect to such Tax Returns, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law.

(iv) Until the General Representation Survival Time, Parent shall not cause
or permit the amendment of any Tax Returns of the Thunder Entities for any
taxable period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Straddle Period
that have been filed prior to the Closing Date, except with the prior approval
of the Members Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) or with
the advice of Tax counsel to Parent that such amendment is required to correct
one or more material errors in such Tax Returns.

 

(v) Until the General Representation Survival Time, without duplication of
amounts receivable under Article VIII and without regard to the limitations
set forth in Section 8.3(a), but taking into account the limitations set forth
in Section 8.3(c), to the extent of any increase in the Tax Liability Amount
over the amount reflected in respect thereof in the Closing Statement or any
Taxes due and payable with respect to a Tax Return of the Thunder Entities for
any taxable period, or the portion of any Straddle Period (allocated in
accordance with Section 5.17(b)), ending on or before the Closing Date that
were not previously taken into account in the Tax Liability Amount, then ten
days prior to the due date for such Taxes, or as soon as reasonably
practicable thereafter, the parties shall cause the Escrow Bank to release
from the Escrow Fund to the applicable Thunder Entity the amount of such
increase in the Tax Liability Amount or Taxes, as reasonably determined by
Parent.

 



-63- (b) _Straddle Period Tax Allocation_. Unless prohibited by applicable Law, the
taxable period of each Thunder Entity shall end as of the Closing Date. If
applicable Law does not permit any Thunder Entity to close its taxable period
as of the end of the Closing Date, and in any case in which a Tax is assessed
with respect to a Straddle Period, the Taxes, if any, attributable to a such
taxable period shall be allocated (i) to the Company for the period up to and
including the Closing Date, and (ii) to Parent for the period subsequent to
the Closing Date.

 

(c) _Tax Audits_.

 

(i) If notice of any Tax Claim shall be received by Parent or any Thunder
Entity, the notified party shall notify the Members Agent in writing of such
Tax Claim within 15 Business Days of receipt of such notice by Parent or such
Thunder Entity.

 

 __(ii) Parent shall have the right to represent the interests of the Thunder
Entities in any Tax Claim; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Parent shall keep
the Members Agent reasonably informed and consult in good faith with the
Members Agent with respect to any issue relating to such Tax Claim, including
the ultimate resolution of the Tax Claim, and shall not resolve any such Tax
Claim in a manner resulting in any amount becoming payable to a Thunder Entity
pursuant to Section 5.17(a)(v) without the prior approval of the Members
Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). _ _

(d) _Transfer Taxes_. The Company shall be liable for and shall pay all sales,
use, stamp, documentary, filing, recording, transfer or similar fees or Taxes
or governmental charges as levied by any Governmental Authority (including any
interest and penalties) in connection with the Contemplated Transactions
("Transfer Taxes"). All necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all such Transfer Taxes shall be filed by the party legally
obligated to file such Tax Return, and, if required by applicable Law, the
parties will, or will cause their Affiliates to, join in the execution of any
such Tax Returns.

(e) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. The Company shall terminate any
Tax sharing, allocation, indemnity or similar agreement or arrangement
between any Thunder Entity and any other Person (other than another Thunder
Entity) as of the Closing Date and, from and after the Closing Date, no
Thunder Entity shall be obligated to make any further payments, or take or
refrain from taking any action, pursuant to any such agreement.

(f) _FIRPTA Certification of Non-Foreign Status_. As promptly as practicable
after the execution of this Agreement but in no event later than five days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use reasonable efforts to obtain
a Certification of Non-Foreign Status (as provided in Section
1.1445-2(b)(2)(iv)(A) or (B), as applicable, of the Treasury Regulations)
("FIRPTA Certification") from each holder of Existing Shares that is eligible
to provide a FIRPTA Certification. For each holder of Existing Shares that is
ineligible or otherwise fails to provide a FIRPTA Certification, Parent shall
be permitted to instruct the Exchange Agent to

 



-64-  withhold from the Cash Consideration otherwise payable to such Person
pursuant to Section 2.7 or Section 2.8 of this Agreement, as applicable, and
pay over to the appropriate taxing authorities any amounts required to be
withheld pursuant to Section 1445 of the Code. If a holder of Existing Shares
is a disregarded entity (as provided in Section 1.1445-2(b)(2)(iii) of the
Treasury Regulations), including an entity that is disregarded as separate
from its owner under Section 301.7701-3 of the Treasury Regulations, the owner
of such holder for Tax purposes must provide the FIRPTA Certification.

 

(g) _Tax Treatment of Payments_. The parties agree to treat any indemnity
payment made pursuant to this Agreement, in each case, as an adjustment to
the purchase price for all income Tax purposes, except as otherwise required
by applicable Law.

(h) _Disputes_. Any dispute as to any matter covered by this Section 5.17
shall be resolved by an independent nationally recognized accounting firm
mutually agreed to by the parties (the "Tax Arbiter"). The fees and expenses
of the Tax Arbiter shall be borne equally by the Indemnitors from the Escrow
Fund, on the one hand, and Parent, on the other. If any dispute with respect
to a Tax Return is not resolved prior to the due date of such Tax Return, such
Tax Return shall be filed in the manner which the party responsible for
filing such Tax Return deems correct, without prejudice to the other partys
rights hereunder.

-67- Section 5.20 _Matters Concerning PRB Transaction and the Non-Core Assets_.

 

 __(a) During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company agrees to keep Parent
reasonably informed on a timely basis regarding the timing and actions taken
in connection with any PRB Sale and any PRB Agreement, the transfer or
disposition of the Non-Core Assets to Prize Exploration, LLC, and the transfer
or disposition of the Equity Securities of Prize Exploration, LLC to a third
party. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, enter
into, or thereafter waive, amend or modify any provision of, any PRB Agreement
or any agreement related to the transfer or disposition of the Non-Core Assets
to Prize Exploration, LLC that, in either case, (i) is adverse in any
respect to Parent, the Company or the Surviving Entity; or (ii) results in the
imposition of any residual liability on Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Entity; _provided, however_ , that none of (A) the decision to sell the PRB
Assets or the amount of cash or equity securities included as a component of
the purchase price to be received therefor, the decision to transfer or
dispose of the Non-Core Assets to Prize Exploration, LLC, or the decision to
transfer or dispose of the Equity Securities of Prize Exploration, LLC to a
third party (B) any modification (including decrease) in the amount of any
cash or equity securities included as a component of the purchase price
applicable to the PRB Sale, or (C) any extension or delay of closing of the
PRB Sale shall be deemed to be adverse to Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Entity for these purposes. In no event shall any PRB Agreement or
any agreement related to the transfer or disposition of the Non-Core Assets
contemplate or permit the delay of the Closing in order to consummate the PRB
Sale or any other transaction contemplated by any PRB Agreement. __

 

 __(b) Following the Closing, if the PRB Sale occurred prior to the Effective
Time, the Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, consult in
good faith with the Members  Agent with respect to all notices of claims for
indemnification received by the Surviving Entity from the PRB Acquirer
following the PRB Sale. Neither the Parent nor the Surviving Entity
shall compromise, settle or resolve any such indemnity claims without the
prior approval of the Members Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). If reasonably requested by the Members Agent in
connection with such matters, the Surviving Entity shall retain legal counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Members Agent in order to assist the Surviving
Entity in matters relating to any such indemnity claims; _provided_ , that the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be recouped by the Surviving Entity
out of any amounts received by the Surviving Entity from the PRB Escrow Fund.
Upon the expiration of the escrow period described in the PRB Agreement (which
the Surviving Entity shall not agree to amend or modify without the prior
consent of the Members Agent, in its sole discretion), the Parent shall cause
the Surviving Entity to promptly request and, if necessary, pursue all
necessary steps to obtain payment to the Surviving Entity of any amounts
remaining in the PRB Escrow Fund to which the Surviving Entity is entitled.
Promptly following receipt of the PRB Escrow Recovery, but in any event within
10 Business Days, the Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to pay the
amount of the PRB Escrow Recovery to the Exchange Agent for distribution to
the Persons who held Existing Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time
pursuant to Section 2.7(b)(iii) or Section 2.8(a)(ii) and Section 2.8(b)(iii),
as applicable. The Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity not to waive, or
agree to waive, amend or modify, any provision of any PRB Agreement without
the prior consent of the Members Agent, in its sole discretion. If the PRB
Sale does not occur prior to the Effective Time and the PRB Subsidiary
Interests constitute part of the Merger Consideration pursuant to this
Agreement, the Company and the Parent agree that, for United __

 



-68-  States federal income Tax purposes, the transfer of the PRB Subsidiary
Interests to the holders of Existing Shares pursuant to this Agreement shall
be treated as part of the consideration received by them in redemption of a
portion of the Existing Shares consistent with the principles of Revenue
Ruling 79-273, 1979-2 C.B. 125.

Section 7.3, as applicable, if this Agreement is terminated and the Merger is

5.8(a)(ii), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3, Section 7.4 and Article IX will

-73- Section 7.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) The Company and the Parent agree that if the Parent terminates this
Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c) or Section 7.1(e), the Company shall pay

Business Days after receipt by Company of written notice of termination of

Parent or the Company pursuant to Section 7.1(b) and (i) at the time of the
termination all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Sections 6.1 and

the Closing and could have been satisfied assuming a Closing would occur)
were satisfied or waived; (ii) at the time of such termination, Parent and
Merger Sub have not received the Financing; and (iii) the failure of Parent
and Merger Sub to receive the Financing is not attributable to a breach

contained in this Agreement, then the Parent shall pay to the Company, in
cash, the Reverse Termination Fee within two Business Days after receipt by
the Parent of written notice of termination of this Agreement.

(d) If a party fails to pay when due any amount payable by such party under
this Section 7.3, then: (i) such party shall reimburse the other party for

upon the occurrence of different events. Nothing in this Section 7.3(e) shall
limit the obligations of the Parent or the Company, as the case may be, to
pay any amounts required to be paid by such party under Section 9.3 in
addition to any nonrefundable fee required to be paid by such party. Each of
the parties acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are
an integral part of the Contemplated Transactions and that neither of the
Reverse Termination Fee or the Termination Fee is a penalty, but rather is a
reasonable amount that will

 



-74-  compensate the receiving party in the circumstances in which such payment is
payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone
while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Contemplated Transactions, each of
which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision. The
parties agree that in the event the Company pays the Termination Fee to
Parent, in a situation in which such amount is payable pursuant to this
Section 7.3, the Company shall have no further liability to Parent or Merger
Sub; _provided_ , that, nothing contained herein shall relieve the Company
from liability for any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement that
gives rise to the Parents right to terminate this Agreement or Fraud. The
parties further agree that in the event Parent pays the Reverse Termination
Fee to the Company, in a situation in which such amount is payable pursuant
to this Section 7.3, Parent shall have no further liability to the Company;
_provided_ , that, nothing contained herein shall relieve Parent from
liability for any willful and intentional breach of this Agreement that gives
rise to the Companys right to terminate this Agreement or Fraud. So long as
this Agreement shall not have been terminated, Parent and the Company shall be
entitled to pursue a grant of specific enforcement pursuant to Section 9.13,
but under no circumstance shall Parent or the Company be permitted or entitled
to receive both a grant of specific enforcement under Section 9.13 and payment
of the Termination Fee or Reverse Termination Fee, as applicable, or other
damages. If Parent shall be obligated to pay the Reverse Termination Fee, the
Companys sole and exclusive remedy with respect to the Financing Sources and
each Affiliate, controlling person or Representative of any such Person and
any successors or assigns of any of the foregoing shall be the receipt of the
Reverse Termination Fee from Parent.

contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) such representations, warranties,
covenants and obligations, and the rights and remedies that may be exercised
by the Indemnitees with respect thereto, shall not be waived, limited or
otherwise affected by or as a result of (and the Indemnitees shall be deemed

notwithstanding) any knowledge on the part of any of the Indemnitees or any
of their Representatives, regardless of whether obtained through any

any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made or
purported to have been made on or after the date of this Agreement);

(b) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company (i) in this Agreement as if such representation or warranty was made
on and as of the Closing (except to the extent such representation or warranty
is made as of an earlier date, in which case such representation and warranty
shall be true and correct as of such earlier date), or (ii) in the
certificates referred to in Sections 6.3(a), 6.3(b) and 6.3(c) (in each case,
without giving effect to (x) any materiality, Material Adverse Effect or
similar qualifications limiting the scope of such representation or warranty,
or (y) any update of or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule made
or purported to have been made on or after the date of this Agreement);

(c) any inaccuracy in any information or breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in the Closing Statement, including any inaccuracy or
failure to calculate properly the Adjusted Indebtedness Amount or any other
amount as set forth in the Closing Statement;

 

(d) any breach of any covenant or obligation of the Company or the Members
Agent in this Agreement (provided there shall be no right to indemnification
for the covenant of the Company set forth in clause "(b)" of Section 5.12 with
respect to notice of any fact, event or circumstance that would cause or
constitute a material breach of any of its representations or warranties,
unless the failure to give such notice was a willful and intentional breach by
the Company);

(e) any claim asserted by any current, former or alleged Member of the
Company (i) relating to this Agreement, any other Transaction Document or any
of the Contemplated Transactions, (ii) alleging any ownership of, interest in
or right to acquire any Equity Securities of the Company of any of its
Subsidiaries, or (iii) that is in any way inconsistent with, or that involves
an allegation of facts inconsistent with, any of the information set forth in
Section 3.4 (other than Section 3.4(d)) or the corresponding section of the
Company Disclosure Schedule or in the Closing Statement;

__(f) the PRB Assets, the PRB Subsidiary, the Non-Core Assets, the PRB
Transaction or the disposition of the Non-Core Assets ( _provided_ that, in
order to avoid any doubt, if the PRB Transaction was a PRB Sale, no Damages
shall be deemed to exist with respect to such PRB Transaction in connection
with any claims (and associated fees and expenses related thereto) by the PRB
Acquirer to the extent satisfied out of the PRB Escrow Fund); and __

 

(g) Disputed Title Defects.

 

Section 8.3 _Limitations_.

 

(a) _Threshold_. Subject to Section 8.3(b), the Indemnitors shall not be
required to make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 8.2(a) or
Section 8.2(b) for any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement until such time as the total amount of all Damages
(including the Damages arising from such inaccuracy or breach 

 



-77-  and all other Damages arising from any other inaccuracies or breaches of any
representations or warranties) that have been directly or indirectly suffered
or incurred by any one or more of the Indemnitees, or to which any one or
more of the Indemnitees has or have otherwise directly or indirectly become
subject, exceeds $27,500,000 (the "Threshold Amount") in the aggregate.
Subject to Section 8.3(d), if the total amount of such Damages exceeds the
Threshold Amount, then the Indemnitees shall be entitled to be indemnified
against and compensated and reimbursed for the entire amount of such Damages
exceeding the Threshold Amount.

 

(b) _Applicability of Threshold_. The limitation set forth in Section 8.3(a)
shall not apply (and shall not limit the indemnification or other obligations
of any Indemnitor): (i) to inaccuracies in or breaches of any of the Specified
Representations; and (ii) to the matters referred to in Sections 8.2(c)
through 8.2(g), inclusive.

 

(c) _Closing Statement Threshold_. The Indemnitors shall not be required to
make any indemnification payment pursuant to Section 8.2(c) as a result of
any variance between estimates used in the Closing Statement and the actual
figures (once known) unless the net effect of such variances (both positive
and negative) results in actual Adjusted Net Working Capital that is at least
$5,000,000 less than the Adjusted Net Working Capital set forth on the Closing
Statement. In the event actual Adjusted Net Working Capital is determined to
be at least $5,000,000 more than the Adjusted Net Working Capital set
forth on the Closing Statement, the Parent promptly shall deposit with the
Escrow Bank the amount of actual Adjusted Net Working Capital in excess of the
Adjusted Net Working Capital set forth on the Closing Statement, which shall
thereafter be part of the Escrow Amount.

(d) _Liability Cap_. The total amount of indemnification payments that each
Indemnitor that did not commit Fraud shall be required to make to the
Indemnitees pursuant to Section 8.2 shall be limited to such Indemnitors Pro
Rata Share of the aggregate Merger Consideration (before deduction of any
applicable Taxes) (it being understood that there shall be no limitation on
the liability of any Indemnitor that was directly or indirectly involved in
any Fraud); _provided_ , _however_ , that, other than with respect to the
Specified Representations, no Indemnitor shall be liable for aggregate
monetary Damages resulting from the matters referred to in Sections 8.2(a),
8.2(b) or 5.17(a)(v) in excess of such Indemnitors Pro Rata Share of the
Escrow Amount.

 

(e) _Limitations on Disputed Title Defects_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) if the Title Defect Value for a
given Disputed Title Defect does not exceed $50,000, then no claim for Damages
pursuant to Section 8.2(g) shall be made, (ii) if the aggregate net value of
all uncured Title Defects exceeding $50,000 asserted during the Examination
Period and all Disputed Title Defects exceeding $50,000 does not exceed
$68,750,000, then no claim for Damages pursuant to Section 8.2(g) shall be
made, and (iii) if the aggregate net value of all uncured Title
Defects exceeding $50,000 asserted during the Examination Period and all
Disputed Title Defects exceeding $50,000 exceeds $68,750,000, then the
Indemnitors shall only be liable for monetary Damages in the amount of such
excess (less the amount of any adjustment to the Cash Consideration made
prior to Closing pursuant to Section 2.10(a)(ii)).

 



-78- (f) _No Contribution_. Each Indemnitor waives, and acknowledges and agrees
that such Indemnitor shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or
attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity
or advancement of expenses or other right or remedy against the Surviving
Entity or any Thunder Entity in connection with any indemnification
obligation or any other liability to which such Indemnitor may become subject
under or in connection with this Agreement or any other agreement or document
delivered to Parent in connection with this Agreement. Effective as of the
Closing, the Members Agent, on behalf of itself and each Indemnitor,
expressly waives and releases any and all rights of subrogation, contribution,
advancement, indemnification or other claim against Parent, the
Surviving Entity or any Thunder Entity.

Section 8.4 _Defense of Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person (other than an
Indemnitee) of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether against the Surviving
Entity, any Thunder Entity, Parent or any other Person) with respect to which
any Indemnitor may become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or
reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII (other than any Tax
Claim, which shall be governed exclusively by Section 5.17(c), and other than
any claim or Legal Proceeding relating to the PRB Assets, the PRB Transaction,
the Non-Core Assets or the disposition of the Non-Core Assets (an
"Excluded Asset Third Party Claim"), which shall be governed exclusively by
Section 8.4(b)), Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Members Agent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(x) Parent will discuss in advance, to the extent such discussion does not
result in any delay adverse to such defense and is legally permissible, and
consider in good faith the views of the Members Agent with respect to such
defense, and (y) the Members Agent may (at its own cost and expense)
participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement of any such claim
or Legal Proceeding controlled by Parent pursuant to this Section 8.4(a). If
Parent so proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

 

(i) subject to the other provisions of this Article VIII, all reasonable
expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be
borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnitors;

(ii) each Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any documents and
materials in such Indemnitors possession or control that may be necessary to
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding;

 

(iii) Parent shall defend such claim in good faith, subject to Parents right
to settle, adjust or compromise such claim pursuant to Section 8.4(a)(iv);
and

__(iv) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim
or Legal Proceeding acting reasonably and in good faith; _provided_ , however,
that (x) such settlement, adjustment or compromise includes an unconditional
release of each Indemnitor (by name to the extent such Indemnitor is a
named party to such claim or Legal Proceeding, or otherwise by reference to
generic terminology such as "current and former members" of the Company or
language to similar effect) from any liabilities _ _

 



-79- _ _ arising out of such claim or Legal Proceeding and does not include any
statement as to, or any admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act
by or on behalf of any Indemnitor and (y) if Parent settles, adjusts or
compromises any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the consent of the
Members Agent, the Members Agent shall retain the right to contest the
existence of any obligation of the Indemnitors to hold harmless, indemnify,
compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee with respect to such claim or Legal
Proceeding and/or the amount of Damages incurred by the Indemnitees in
connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding; _provided further_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall any Indemnitor be liable for
Damages with respect to any claim or Legal Proceeding settled or compromised
as set forth in this Section 8.4(a)(iv) in excess of such Indemnitors Pro
Rata Share of the amount of such settlement, adjustment or compromise (other
than Parents reasonable attorneys fees and reasonable out-of-pocket costs in
defending such claim or Legal Proceeding). __

 

If Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or
Legal Proceeding, the Members Agent may proceed with the defense of such
claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent;
provided, however, that the Members Agent may not settle, adjust or
compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed). In such case, Parent shall cooperate with the
Members Agent in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of
any such claim or Legal Proceeding, including making available any documents
and materials in its possession or control that may be necessary to the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding.

 

(b) In the event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any
Excluded Asset Third Party Claim with respect to which any Indemnitor may
become obligated to hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any
Indemnitee pursuant to this Article VIII:

 

(i) the Members Agent shall have the right to assume the defense of such
Excluded Asset Third Party Claim on behalf of the Indemnitors, at the
Indemnitors expense and with its own counsel, and the Indemnitee(s) shall
cooperate in good faith in such defense; provided, the Members Agent shall
not have the right to defend or direct the defense of any such Excluded Asset
Third Party Claim that seeks an injunction or other equitable relief against
the Indemnitee(s). In the event that the Members Agent assumes the defense of
any such Excluded Asset Third Party Claim, subject to Section 8.4(b)(ii), it
shall have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid,
dispute, defend, appeal, or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Excluded
Asset Third Party Claim in the name and on behalf of the Indemnitee(s). The
Indemnitee(s) shall have the right to participate in the defense of any such
Excluded Asset Third Party Claim with counsel selected by such Indemnitee(s),
subject to the Members Agents right to control the defense thereof. The
reasonable fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnitors. If the Members Agent elects not to compromise or defend any
such Excluded Asset Third Party Claim, fails to promptly notify
the Indemnitee(s) in writing of its election to defend as provided in this
Section 8.4(b)(i), or fails to diligently prosecute the defense of such
Excluded Asset Third Party Claim, then, upon reasonable notice from Parent to
the Members Agent, the

 



-80-  Indemnitee(s) may, subject to Section 8.4(b)(ii), pay, compromise, or defend
such claim and seek indemnification for any and all Damages based upon,
arising from or relating thereto. The Indemnitors and the Parent shall
cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the
defense of any such Excluded Asset Third Party Claim, including making
available any documents and materials in their possession or control that may
be necessary to the defense of such Excluded Asset Third Party Claim.

(ii) The Members Agent shall defend such claim in good faith, subject to the
Members Agents right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim pursuant to
Section 8.4(b)(iv);

 

(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Members
Agent shall not agree to settle any Excluded Asset Third Party Claim without
the prior written consent of the Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed), and no Indemnitee shall agree to settle any Excluded
Asset Third Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Members
Agent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(iv) If the Members Agent has assumed the defense of an Excluded Asset Third
Party Claim and a firm offer that the Members Agent desires to accept is made
to settle any such Excluded Asset Third Party Claim without leading to
liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of
the Indemnitee(s) and which provides, in customary form, for the unconditional
release of such Indemnitee(s) from all liabilities and obligations in
connection with such Excluded Asset Third Party Claim, the Members Agent
shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnitee(s). If the
Indemnitee(s) fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) days after
its receipt of such notice, the Indemnitee(s) may continue to contest or
defend such Excluded Asset Third Party Claim and in such event, the maximum
liability of the Indemnitors as to such Excluded Asset Third Party Claim shall
not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnitee(s) fails to
consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Excluded
Asset Third Party Claim, the Members Agent may settle the Excluded Asset
Third Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such
Excluded Asset Third Party Claim.

 

 __(c) Parent shall give the Members  Agent prompt notice of the commencement
of any Legal Proceeding described in this Section 8.4 against Parent, Merger
Sub or the Surviving Entity; _provided, however_ , that any failure on the
part of Parent to so notify the Members Agent shall not limit any of the
obligations of the Indemnitors under this Article VIII (except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). __

Section 8.5  _Indemnification Claim Procedure_. Any claim for
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement pursuant to this Article VIII
shall be brought and resolved exclusively as follows:

 



-81- (a) If any Indemnitee has or claims in good faith to have incurred or
suffered, or believes in good faith that it may incur or suffer, Damages for
which it is or may be entitled to be held harmless, indemnified, compensated
or reimbursed under Article VIII or for which it is or may be entitled to a
monetary remedy (including in the case of a claim based on Fraud), such
Indemnitee shall deliver a notice of claim (a "Notice of Claim") to the
Members Agent promptly, but in any event within 30 days of becoming aware of
such Damages. Each Notice of Claim shall: (i) state that such Indemnitee
believes in good faith that such Indemnitee is or may be entitled to
indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Article VIII or is or may
otherwise be entitled to a monetary remedy; (ii) contain a brief description
of the facts and circumstances supporting such Indemnitees claim; and (iii)
if practicable, contain a good faith, non-binding, preliminary estimate of the
aggregate amount of the actual and potential Damages that the Indemnitee
believes have arisen and may arise as a result of such facts and circumstances
(the aggregate amount of such estimate, as it may be modified by such
Indemnitee from time to time, being referred to as the "Claimed Amount").

(b) During the 20-day period commencing upon delivery by an Indemnitee to the
Members Agent of a Notice of Claim (the "Dispute Period"), the Members
Agent may send to the Indemnitee who delivered the Notice of Claim a written
response (the "Response Notice") in which the Members Agent: (i) agrees
that the full Claimed Amount is owed to such Indemnitee; (ii) agrees that
part, but not all, of the Claimed Amount (the "Agreed Amount") is owed to the
Indemnitee; or (iii) indicates that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to
such Indemnitee. If the Response Notice is delivered in accordance with clause
"(ii)" or "(iii)" of the preceding sentence, such Response Notice shall also
contain a brief description of the facts and circumstances supporting the
Members Agents claim that only a portion or no part of the Claimed Amount is
owed to the Indemnitee, as the case may be. Any part of the Claimed Amount
that is not agreed to be owed to the Indemnitee pursuant to the Response
Notice (or the entire Claimed Amount, if the Members Agent asserts in the
Response Notice that no part of the Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee)
is referred to in this Agreement as the "Contested Amount" (it being
understood that the Contested Amount shall be modified from time to time to
reflect any modifications by the Indemnitee to the Claimed Amount). If a
Response Notice is not sent to the Indemnitee prior to the expiration of the
Dispute Period, then the Members Agent shall be conclusively deemed to have
agreed that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee.

(c) If (i) the Members Agent delivers a Response Notice to the Indemnitee
agreeing that the full Claimed Amount is owed to the Indemnitee, or (ii) the
Members Agent does not deliver a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during
the Dispute Period, then (A) Parent shall pay the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnitee from the Escrow Fund, and (B) if the amount available in the Escrow
Fund is insufficient to cover the full Claimed Amount, then, subject to the
limitations provided for in Section 8.3(d), each Indemnitor shall, within ten
Business Days following such earlier date, pay such Indemnitors Pro Rata
Share of the amount of such shortfall to the Indemnitee.

 

(d) If the Members Agent delivers a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during
the Dispute Period agreeing that less than the full Claimed Amount is owed to
the Indemnitee, then (i) Parent shall pay the Agreed Amount to the Indemnitee
from the Escrow Fund, and (ii) if the amount available in the Escrow Fund is
insufficient to cover the full Agreed Amount, then, subject to
the limitations provided for in Section 8.3(d), each Indemnitor shall, within
ten Business Days following the date of such Response Notice, pay such
Indemnitors Pro Rata Share of the amount of such shortfall to the Indemnitee.

 



-82- (e) If the Members Agent delivers a Response Notice to the Indemnitee during
the Dispute Period indicating that there is a Contested Amount, the Members
Agent and the Indemnitee shall attempt in good faith to resolve the dispute
related to the Contested Amount within 30 days after the date on which the
Members Agent delivers such Response Notice (or such longer period as the
Indemnitee and the Members Agent may mutually agree in writing). If the
Indemnitee and the Members Agent resolve such dispute during such period,
then their resolution of such dispute shall be binding on the Members Agent,
the Indemnitors and such Indemnitee and a settlement agreement stipulating the
amount owed to the Indemnitee (the "Stipulated Amount") shall be signed by the
Indemnitee and the Members Agent. Parent shall, following the execution of
such settlement agreement, pay the Stipulated Amount to the Indemnitee from
the Escrow Fund. If the amount available in the Escrow Fund is insufficient to
cover the full Stipulated Amount, then, subject to the limitations provided
for in Section 8.3(d), each Indemnitor shall, within ten Business Days
following the execution of such settlement agreement (or such shorter period
of time as may be set forth in the settlement agreement), pay such
Indemnitors Pro Rata Share of the amount of such shortfall to the Indemnitee.

(f) Other than with respect to any claim for indemnification relating
primarily to Tax matters (which shall be governed by Section 5.17), in the
event that the Indemnitee and the Members Agent fail to reach a resolution on
a Notice of Claim or Contested Amount that is the subject of a Response
Notice, within 30 days after the date on which the Members Agent delivers
such Response Notice (or such longer period as the Indemnitee and the Members
Agent may mutually agree in writing) (whether it is a matter between the
Indemnitee, on the one hand, and the Members Agent, on the other hand, or it
is a matter that is subject to a claim or Legal Proceeding asserted or
commenced by a third party brought against the Indemnitee or any Thunder
Entity), such dispute (an "Arbitrable Dispute") shall be settled by binding
arbitration. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, nothing in this Section
8.5 shall prevent the Indemnitee from seeking preliminary injunctive relief
from a court of competent jurisdiction pending settlement of any Arbitrable
Dispute.

(i) Except as herein specifically stated, any Arbitrable Dispute shall be
resolved by arbitration in Dallas, Texas in accordance with JAMS
Comprehensive Arbitration Rules and Procedures (the "JAMS Rules") then in
effect. However, in all events, the provisions contained in this Agreement
shall govern over any conflicting rules which may now or hereafter be
contained in the JAMS Rules. Any judgment upon the award rendered by the
arbitrator shall be entered in any court having jurisdiction over the subject
matter thereof. The arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any equitable
and legal remedies that would be available if any judicial proceeding was
instituted to resolve an Arbitrable Dispute. The final decision of the
arbitrator, as entered by a court of competent jurisdiction, will be furnished
by the arbitrator to the Members Agent and the Indemnitee in writing and will
constitute a final, conclusive and non-appealable determination of the issue
in question, binding upon the Members Agent, the Indemnitors and the
Indemnitee, and an order with respect thereto may be entered in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Any such arbitration shall be kept confidential by the
Indemnitee, the Members Agent and the Indemnitors; _provided_ that such
parties may discuss the arbitration with their respective advisors, attorneys,
directors, officers, members and Affiliates.

 



-83- (ii) Any such arbitration will be conducted before a single arbitrator who
will be compensated for his or her services at a rate to be determined by the
Indemnitee and the Members Agent or by JAMS, but based upon reasonable hourly
or daily consulting rates for the arbitrator in the event the parties are not
able to agree upon his or her rate of compensation.

(iii) The arbitrator shall be mutually agreed upon by the Indemnitee and
the Members Agent. In the event the Indemnitee and the Members Agent are
unable to agree within 20 days following submission of the dispute to JAMS by
one of the parties, JAMS will have the authority to select an arbitrator from
a list of arbitrators who satisfy the criteria set forth in clause "(iv)"
below.

__(iv) The arbitrator shall not have any past or present family, business or
other relationship with the Indemnitee, any Thunder Entity, the Members 
Agent, any of the Indemnitors or any Affiliate, director or officer thereof,
unless, following full disclosure of all such relationships, the Indemnitee
and the Members Agent agree in writing to waive such requirement with respect
to the arbitrator in connection with such dispute. In addition, unless
otherwise agreed to between the Indemnitee and the Members Agent in writing,
the arbitrator in any dispute related to an Arbitrable Dispute shall have at
least 15 years experience in the negotiation of definitive merger and
acquisition agreements involving privately held entities; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if JAMS is not able to provide an arbitrator for such
arbitration with the requisite experience set forth in this clause "(iv),"
such arbitrator shall be a retired Article III Federal District Court judge.
_ _

(v) The arbitrator shall be instructed to hold up to an eight-hour, one-day
hearing regarding the disputed matter within 60 days of his or her
designation and to render an award no later than 30 days after the conclusion
of such hearing, in each case unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing by
the Indemnitee and the Members Agent. The final decision of the arbitrator:
(A) shall include the amount of the award to the Indemnitee (the "Award
Amount"), if any; (B) shall be furnished to the Members Agent and the
Indemnitee in writing; and (C) shall constitute a conclusive determination of
the issue(s) in question, shall be binding upon the Members Agent, the
Indemnitors and the Indemnitee and shall not be contested by any of them.

 

(vi) No discovery other than an exchange of relevant documents may occur in
any arbitration commenced under the provisions of this Section 8.5. The
Indemnitee and the Members Agent agree to act in good faith to promptly
exchange relevant documents.

 

 __(vii) The Indemnitee and the Members  Agent (on behalf of the Indemnitors)
will each pay 50% of the initial compensation to be paid to the arbitrator in
any such arbitration and 50% of the costs of transcripts and other normal and
regular expenses of the arbitration proceedings; _provided_ , _however_ , that
(A) the prevailing party _ _

 



-84-  in any arbitration will be entitled to an award of attorneys fees and
costs, and (B) all costs of arbitration, other than those provided for above,
will be paid by the losing party, and the arbitrator will be authorized to
determine the identity of the prevailing party and the losing party. The
losing party shall be determined solely by the arbitrator. If an Indemnitee is
found to be the prevailing party in any arbitration, the amount of the fees
and expenses of such Indemnitee payable by the Indemnitors pursuant to this
clause "(vii)" shall be added to the Award Amount.

 

(viii) The arbitrator chosen in accordance with these provisions will not have
the power to alter, amend or otherwise affect the terms of these arbitration
provisions or any other provisions contained in this Section 8.5 or this
Agreement.

 

(ix) Upon resolution of the Arbitrable Dispute in accordance with this Section
8.5 (A) Parent shall pay the Indemnitee the Award Amount from the Escrow
Fund, and (B) if the amount available in the Escrow Fund is insufficient to
cover the full Award Amount, then, subject to the limitations provided for in
Section 8.3(d), each Indemnitor shall, within ten Business Days following the
delivery of the final decision of the arbitrator (or such shorter period as
may be set forth in such final decision), pay such Indemnitors Pro Rata Share
of the amount of such shortfall to the Indemnitee. Any ruling or decision of
the arbitrator may be enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction.

(g) Promptly after the General Representation Survival Time, Parent shall
notify the Members Agent in writing of the amount that Parent determines in
good faith to be necessary to satisfy any amounts due pursuant to Section
5.17(a)(v) and all claims made by an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 8.2 that
have been asserted, but not resolved prior to the General Representation
Survival Time (each such claim an "Unresolved Claim" and such amount, the
"Retained Escrow Amount"); _provided, however_ , the Retained Escrow Amount
shall not exceed the sum of all Agreed Amounts and Stipulated Amounts not yet
paid from the Escrow Fund plus the amount of any Claimed Amounts for which
the Dispute Period has not yet lapsed and any Contested Amounts then pending.
Within ten Business Days after the General Representation Survival Time,
Parent shall cause the Escrow Bank to release from the Escrow Fund to the
Exchange Agent for distribution to each Indemnitor, an amount equal to (i)
such Indemnitors Pro Rata Share, _multiplied by_ (ii) the amount, if any, by
which the aggregate amount remaining in the Escrow Fund as of the
General Representation Survival Time _exceeds_ the Retained Escrow Amount.

__(h) Following the General Representation Survival Time, if an Unresolved
Claim is finally resolved, then Parent shall within five Business Days after
the final resolution of such Unresolved Claim and the delivery to the
Indemnitee of the amount to be delivered to the Indemnitee from the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Article VIII, release from the Escrow Fund to the Exchange
Agent for distribution to each Indemnitor, an amount equal to (i) such
Indemnitors Pro Rata Share, _multiplied by_  (ii) the amount, if any, by
which the aggregate amount held in the Escrow Fund as of the time of such
disbursement exceeds the amounts that Parent determines in good faith to be
necessary to satisfy all remaining Unresolved Claims (which amounts will
continue to be held in the Escrow Fund). __

 



-85- __(i) All claims by an Indemnitee for Damages pursuant to Article VIII shall
be recovered (i) first, from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Section 8.5 and (ii) second, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 8.3(d), when either the Escrow Fund has been
exhausted or the aggregate amount of the claims made by the Indemnitees
pursuant to Article VIII exceeds the amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund,
from the Indemnitors, severally and not jointly and severally, in proportion
to each Indemnitors Pro Rata Share; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the
extent any amounts are released from the Escrow Fund to any Indemnitee with
regard to claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that are
not subject to the limitations set forth in Section 8.3(d), such recovered
amounts shall not reduce the amount that the Indemnitees may recover with
regard to claims for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement that are
subject to the limitation contained in Section 8.3(d); _provided_ , _further_
, that with respect to claims for Damages with respect to any Excluded Asset
Third Party Claim for which the Members Agent has assumed the defense thereof
pursuant to Section 8.4(b), the Indemnitees may elect, in their sole
discretion, to recover such Damages from the Indemnitors, severally and not
jointly and severally, in proportion to each Indemnitors Pro Rata Share
without first seeking recovery from the Escrow Fund pursuant to clause "(i)"
of this Section 8.5(i). __

Section 8.6 _Setoff_. In addition to Section 8.5 and any rights of setoff or
other similar rights that Parent or any of the other Indemnitees may have at
common law or otherwise, Parent shall have the right to withhold and deduct
any sum that is or may be owed to any Indemnitee under this Article VIII from
any amount otherwise payable by any Indemnitee to any Indemnitor under any
Transaction Document or otherwise in connection with any of the Contemplated
Transactions.

 

Section 8.7 _Exercise of Remedies Other Than by Parent_. No Indemnitee (other

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 9.1  _Members  Agent_.

(a) _Appointment_. By virtue of the adoption and approval of this Agreement in
exchange for Merger Consideration pursuant to this Agreement, the Indemnitors
irrevocably nominate, constitute and appoint EscroSol, LLC, an Oklahoma
limited liability company, as the agent and true and lawful attorney in fact
of the Indemnitors (the "Members Agent"), with full power of substitution,
to act in the name, place and stead of the Indemnitors for purposes of
executing any documents and taking any actions that the Members Agent may, in
the Members Agents sole discretion, determine to be necessary, desirable or
appropriate in connection with any claim for indemnification, compensation or
reimbursement under Article VIII. EscroSol, LLC hereby accepts its appointment
as Members Agent.

(b) _Authority_. The Indemnitors grant to the Members Agent full authority to
execute, deliver, acknowledge, certify and file on behalf of such Indemnitors
(in the name of any or all of the Indemnitors or otherwise) any and all
documents that the Members Agent may, in his sole discretion, determine to be
necessary, desirable or appropriate, in such forms and containing such
provisions as the Members Agent may, in his sole discretion, determine to be
appropriate, in performing his duties as contemplated by Section 9.1(a).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement or in
any other agreement executed in connection with the Contemplated Transactions
(i) each Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal exclusively with the Members
Agent on all matters relating to any claim for indemnification, compensation
or reimbursement under Article VIII, and (ii) each Indemnitee shall be
entitled to rely conclusively (without further evidence of any kind
whatsoever) on any document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of
any Indemnitor, by the Members Agent, and on any other action taken or
purported to be taken on behalf of any Indemnitor, by the Members Agent, as
fully binding upon such Indemnitor.

 

(c) _Power of Attorney_. The Indemnitors recognize and intend that the power
of attorney granted in Section 9.1(a): (i) is coupled with an interest and is
irrevocable; (ii) may be delegated by the Members Agent; and (iii) shall
survive the death, incapacity, dissolution, liquidation or winding up of each
of the Indemnitors.

 

(d) _Replacement_. If the Members Agent shall die, resign, become disabled or
otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder, the
Indemnitors shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least a majority
of the Merger Consideration), within ten days after such death, resignation,
disability or inability, appoint a successor to the Members Agent (who shall
be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and immediately thereafter notify Parent
of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed the
Members Agent as Members Agent hereunder. If for any reason there is
no Members Agent at any time, all references herein to the Members Agent
shall be deemed to refer to the Indemnitors.

(e)  _Limitation of Liability_. In consideration of the services to be
provided by the Members Agent pursuant to this Agreement, each Indemnitor,
for itself and its heirs, successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably releases
and agrees to hold harmless the Members Agent from any claim or Damages
arising or alleged to arise out of the Members Agents actions or failure to
act in connection with its obligations hereunder, save and except for the
Members Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnitors
acknowledge and agree that, but for the release of liability in favor of the
Members Agent contained in this Section 9.1(e), the Members Agent would not
be willing to serve in such capacity, and that the foregoing release of
liability is intended to induce the Members Agent to serve in such capacity.
The foregoing release of liability is intended to be enforceable to the
fullest extent allowed by applicable Law. 

 



-87- Section 9.2 _No Waiver Relating to Claims for Fraud_. The liability of any
Person under Article VIII will be in addition to, and not exclusive of, any
other liability that such Person may have at law or in equity based on such
Persons Fraud. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, none of the provisions set forth in this Agreement, including the
provisions set forth in Article VIII, shall be deemed a waiver by any party to
this Agreement of any right or remedy which such party may have at law or in
equity based on any other Persons Fraud, nor will any such provisions limit,
or be deemed to limit: (a) the amounts of recovery sought or awarded in any
such claim for Fraud; (b) the period during which a claim for Fraud may be
brought; or (c) the recourse which any such party may seek against another
Person with respect to a claim for Fraud.

Section 9.3 _Fees and Expenses_. Whether or not this Agreement and the Merger
are consummated, and except as otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses (including legal and financial advisory fees
and expenses) incurred in connection with, or in anticipation of, this
Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions shall be paid by the party
incurring such expenses (including, with respect to fees and expenses incurred
by the Company and unpaid as of the Effective Time, by the Surviving Entity

Amount, Aggregate COC Amount and the Employment Tax Amount in the Closing
Statement).

irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement in the courts of the State of Delaware or any federal court sitting

-91- (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, it is
explicitly agreed that the Company shall be entitled to seek specific

Subs obligations to consummate the Contemplated Transactions only in the
event that (i) all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in Article VI

consummated pursuant to Section 2.3 (other than those conditions that by their
terms are to be satisfied at the Closing and could have been satisfied
assuming a Closing would occur); (ii) the Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing; (iii) Parent has failed to consummate the Closing in
breach of Section 2.3; and (iv) the Company has irrevocably confirmed to

the Closing will occur. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the
Company be entitled to enforce or seek to enforce specifically Parents
obligation to consummate the Contemplated Transactions if the Financing has
not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing).

Section 9.14  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties
in separate counterparts (including by means of executed counterparts
delivered via facsimile or other electronic means), each of which shall be
deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the
same instrument.

Section 9.15 _Disclosure Schedule_. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be
arranged in separate parts corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections
and subsections contained in this Agreement, and the information disclosed in
any numbered or lettered part shall be deemed to relate to and to qualify only
the particular representation or warranty set forth in the corresponding
numbered or lettered Section or subsection of this Agreement, except to the
extent that (a) such information is cross-referenced in another part of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, or (b) it is reasonably apparent on the face of
the disclosure (without reference to any document referred to therein) that
such information qualifies another representation and warranty of the Company
in this Agreement. The Company Disclosure Schedule shall be delivered as of
the date hereof, and no amendments or modifications thereto shall be made. Any
purported update or modification to the Company Disclosure Schedule after the
date hereof shall be disregarded.

 

Section 9.16 _Provisions Related to the Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding

or claims against any Financing Source in connection with or related to this

with or related to this Agreement, the Financing or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, including for any consequential,
special, exemplary, punitive or indirect damages (including any loss of
profits, business or anticipated savings) or damages of a tortious nature and
the Company agrees not to and to cause its Affiliates not to, seek to enforce
this Agreement against, make any claims for breach of this Agreement against,
or seek to recover monetary damages from any Financing Source.

defined in the Act, (an " _Indemnitee_ ") harmless who was or is a party or
is threatened to be made a party to any threatened, pending or completed
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that the Indemnitee is or was a member,
manager on the Board or officer of the Company, or is or was serving at the
request of the Company as a director, officer, employee, manager or agent of
another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust or other enterprise, against expenses, including attorneys fees,
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably
incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the action, suit or proceeding
if the Indemnitee acted in good faith and in a manner the Indemnitee
reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best interests of the
Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no
reasonable cause to believe the conduct was unlawful. The termination of any
action, suit, or proceeding by judgment, order, settlement, conviction or upon
a plea of _nolo contendere_ or its equivalent, shall not, of itself, create a
presumption that the Indemnitee did not act in good faith and in a manner
which the Indemnitee reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the best
interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal action or
proceeding, had reasonable cause to believe that the conduct was unlawful.

 

(b) _Advancement of Expenses_. Expenses incurred by an Indemnitee in defending
a civil or criminal action, suit or proceeding shall be paid by the Company
in advance of the final disposition of the action, suit or proceeding upon
receipt of an undertaking by and on behalf of the Indemnitee to repay the
amount if it shall ultimately be determined that he is not entitled to
be indemnified by the Company as authorized by the provisions of _Section
4.1(a)_.

(c) _Non-Exclusivity_. The indemnification and advancement of expenses
provided by or granted pursuant to _Sections 4.1(a)_ and _4.1(b)_ shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking indemnification or
advancement of expenses may be entitled in the discretion of the Board or
pursuant to any agreement, vote of the Member, as a matter of law or equity or
otherwise, and such rights shall inure to the benefit of the heirs, executors
and administrators of the Indemnitee.

 

(d) _Insurance_. The Company shall be required to purchase and maintain
insurance, including directors and officers insurance, at the Companys
expense, on behalf of any Indemnitees against any liability that may be
asserted against or expense that may be incurred by an Indemnitee in
connection with the activities of the Company regardless of whether the
Company would have the power to indemnify such Indemnitee against such
liability under the provisions of this LLC Agreement, unless the Board
determines such insurance cannot be obtained on commercially reasonable terms.

 



5 Section 4.2 _Binding Effect_. Except as otherwise provided herein, every
covenant, term and provision hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Member and its permitted successors, transferees, and assigns
(including any assignee for security purposes or person holding a security
interest).

 

Section 4.3 _Severability_. Except as otherwise provided in the succeeding
sentence, every provision of this LLC Agreement is intended to be severable,
and, if any term or provision hereof is illegal or invalid for any reason
whatsoever, such illegality or invalidity shall not affect the validity or
legality of the remainder of this LLC Agreement. The preceding sentence
of this Section shall be of no force or effect if the consequence of
enforcing the remainder of this LLC Agreement without such illegal or invalid
term or provision would be to cause the Member to lose the benefit of its
economic bargain.

 

Section 4.4 _Choice of Law_. This LLC Agreement shall be construed and
interpreted according to the laws of the State of Delaware. 

EXECUTED AND ADOPTED by WPX ENERGY, INC., as sole member of the Company, as of
the date first above stated.

4 ARTICLE II - REGISTRATION RIGHTS

 

2.1 _Shelf Registration_.

 

(a) On or prior to the 120th day following the Closing, the Company will
prepare and file a Shelf Registration Statement (which Shelf Registration
Statement shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement if the Company is
then eligible to file an Automatic Shelf Registration Statement) registering
for resale the Registrable Securities under the Securities Act; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Company shall not, and shall not be required, to file
such Shelf Registration Statement prior to [], 2015.1 The plan of
distribution indicated in the Shelf Registration Statement will include all
such methods of sale as any Holder may reasonably request in writing prior to
the filing of the Shelf Registration Statement and that can be included in the
Shelf Registration Statement under the rules and regulations of the SEC. The
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as promptly as
practicable following such filing. Until such time as all
Registrable Securities cease to be Registrable Securities or the Company is
no longer eligible to maintain a Shelf Registration Statement, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to keep current and effective
such Shelf Registration Statement and file such supplements or amendments to
such Shelf Registration Statement (or file a new Shelf Registration Statement
(which Shelf Registration Statement shall be an Automatic Shelf Registration
Statement if the Company is then eligible to file an Automatic Shelf
Registration Statement) when such preceding Shelf Registration Statement
expires pursuant to the rules of the SEC) as may be necessary or appropriate
in order to keep such Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective
and useable for the resale of all Registrable Securities under the Securities
Act. Any Shelf Registration Statement when declared effective (including the
documents incorporated therein by reference) will comply in all material
respects as to form with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act and will not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading.

(b) Any one or more Holders of Registrable Securities may request to sell all
or any portion of their Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering
that is registered pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (each, an "
_Underwritten Shelf Takedown_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that in the case of
each such Underwritten Shelf Takedown, such Holder or Holders will be
entitled to make such demand only if the proceeds from the sale of Registrable
Securities in the offering (before the deduction of underwriting discounts) is
reasonably expected to exceed, in the aggregate, $175 million;  _provided_ ,
_further_ that the Company shall not be obligated to effect more than three
Underwritten Shelf Takedowns during any period of twelve consecutive months
and shall not be obligated to effect an Underwritten Shelf Takedown
within ninety days after the pricing of a previous Underwritten Shelf
Takedown. The Company shall not be deemed to have effected any Underwritten
Shelf Takedown if the Holders participating in such offering are not able to
sell at least 50% of the Registrable Securities desired to be sold in such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown.



   1  | To be 90 days after entry into the underwriting agreement for
Company common stock. 
---|--- 
 



5 (c) All requests (a " _Demand Request_ ") for Underwritten Shelf Takedowns
shall be made by the Holder or Holders making such request (the " _Requesting
Holder_ ") by giving written notice to the Company. Each Demand Request shall
specify the approximate number of Registrable Securities to be sold in the
Underwritten Shelf Takedown and the expected price range (net of underwriting
discounts and commissions) of such Underwritten Shelf Takedown. Within three
Business Days after receipt of any Demand Request, the Company shall send
written notice of such requested Underwritten Shelf Takedown to all other
Holders of Registrable Securities (the " _Company Notice_ ") and shall include
in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown all Registrable Securities with respect to
which the Company has received written requests for inclusion therein within
five Business Days after sending the Company Notice.

(d) The Company shall select one or more nationally prominent firms of
investment bankers reasonably acceptable to the Participating Majority to act
as the lead managing underwriter or underwriters in connection with such
Underwritten Shelf Takedown. All Holders proposing to distribute their
securities through such underwriting shall enter into an underwriting
agreement with such underwriter or underwriters in accordance with _Section
2.1(g)_. The Company shall not, without the written consent of
the Participating Majority, include in such Underwritten Shelf Takedown any
securities other than those beneficially owned by the participating Holders.
The " _Participating Majority_ " shall mean, with respect to any
particular Underwritten Shelf Takedown, the Holder(s) of a majority of the
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such Underwritten Shelf
Takedown; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that, with respect to any
particular Underwritten Shelf Takedown, either FR Rhino Holdings, LLC ("
_First Reserve_ ") or ZAM Ventures, LP and its affiliates (" _Ziff_ ")
proposes to sell in such offering 20% or more of the Registrable Securities
acquired by it at the Closing, then it shall constitute the "Participating
Majority" for purposes of such Underwritten Shelf Takedown; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that if each of First Reserve and Ziff proposes to
sell in such offering 20% or more of the Registrable Securities acquired by
it at the Closing, then they shall jointly constitute the Participating
Majority, provided, that if they shall fail to agree on any matter in such
capacity, the one of them that proposes to sell the largest number of
Registrable Securities in such offering shall be the "Participating Majority"
for purposes of such Underwritten Shelf Takedown.

 

(e) If the managing underwriters for such Underwritten Shelf Takedown advise
the Company and the participating Holders in writing that, in their opinion,
marketing factors require a limitation of the amount of securities to be
underwritten (including Registrable Securities) because the amount of
securities to be underwritten is likely to have an adverse effect on the
price, timing or the distribution of the securities to be offered, then the
Company shall so advise all Holders of Registrable Securities which would
otherwise be underwritten pursuant hereto, and the amount of Registrable
Securities that may be included in the underwriting shall be allocated among
participating Holders, (i) _first_ among the participating Holders as nearly
as possible on a pro rata basis based on the total amount of Registrable
Securities held by such Holders requested to be included in such underwriting
and (ii) _second_ to the extent all Registrable Securities requested to be
included in such underwriting by the participating Holders have been included,
to any securities to be included with the written consent of the
Participating Majority pursuant to the previous sentence allocated on such
basis as the Company shall determine. The Company shall prepare preliminary
and final prospectus supplements for use in connection with the Underwritten
Shelf Takedown, containing such additional information as may be reasonably
requested by the underwriter(s).

 



6 (f) Upon written notice to the Holders of Registrable Securities, the Company
shall be entitled to suspend, for a period of time (each, a " _Suspension
Period_ "), the use of any Registration Statement or Prospectus and shall not
be required to amend or supplement the Registration Statement, any related
Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference if the board of
directors, chief executive officer or chief financial officer of the Company
determines in its or his or her reasonable good faith judgment that the
Registration Statement or any Prospectus may contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or may omit any fact necessary to make the statements in the
Registration Statement or Prospectus not misleading; _provided_ , that the
Company shall use its good faith efforts to amend the Registration Statement
or Prospectus to correct such untrue statement or omission as promptly as
reasonably practicable, unless the Company determines in good faith that such
amendment would reasonably be expected to have a materially
detrimental effect on the Company. The Holders acknowledge and agree that
written notice of any Suspension Period may constitute material non-public
information regarding the Company and shall keep the existence and contents of
any such written notice confidential.

(g) If requested by the underwriters for an Underwritten Shelf Takedown, the
Company shall enter into an underwriting agreement with such underwriters for
such offering, such agreement to be form and substance (including with respect
to representations and warranties by the Company) as is customarily given by
the Company to underwriters in an underwritten public offering, and to
contain indemnities to the effect and to the extent provided in _Section
2.7_. The Holders of Registrable Securities participating in the Underwritten
Shelf Takedown shall be parties to such underwriting agreement;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no such Holder shall be required to (i) make any
representations or warranties in connection with any such registration other
than representations and warranties as to (A) such Holders ownership of his
or its Registrable Securities to be sold or transferred free and clear of all
liens, claims and encumbrances, (B) such Holders power and authority to
effect such transfer and (C) such matters pertaining to compliance
with securities laws as may be reasonably requested or (ii) undertake any
indemnification obligations to the Company or the underwriters with respect
thereto except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.7_. No Holder may
participate in the Underwritten Shelf Takedown unless such Holder agrees to
sell its Registrable Securities on the basis provided in such underwriting
agreement and completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities and other documents reasonably required under the terms of such
underwriting agreement. Each participating Holder may, at its option, require
that any or all of the representations and warranties by, and the other
agreements on the part of, the Company to and for the benefit of such
underwriters also be made to and for such participating Holders benefit and
that any or all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of such
underwriters under such underwriting agreement also be conditions precedent
to its obligations.

2.2 _Piggyback Registrations_.

 

(a) Each time the Company proposes to register any of its equity securities
(other than pursuant to an Excluded Registration) under the Securities Act
for sale to the public (whether for the account of the Company or the account
of any securityholder of the Company) and the form of registration statement
to be used permits the registration of Registrable Securities, the
Company shall give prompt written notice to each Holder of Registrable
Securities (which notice shall be given not less than 10 days prior to the
anticipated filing date), which notice shall offer each such Holder the
opportunity to include any or all of its or his Registrable Securities in

 



7  such registration statement, subject to the limitations contained in
_Section 2.2(b)_ hereof. Each Holder who desires to have its or his
Registrable Securities included in such registration statement shall so
advise the Company in writing (stating the number of shares desired to be
registered) within five days after the date of such notice from the Company.
Any Holder shall have the right to withdraw such Holders request for
inclusion of such Holders Registrable Securities in any registration
statement pursuant to this _Section 2.2(a)_ by giving written notice to the
Company of such withdrawal. Subject to _Section 2.2(b)_ below, the Company
shall include in such registration statement all such Registrable Securities
so requested to be included therein; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company
may at any time withdraw or cease proceeding with any such registration if
it shall at the same time withdraw or cease proceeding with the registration
of all other equity securities originally proposed to be registered. For the
avoidance of doubt, any registration or offering pursuant to this _Section
2.2_ shall not be considered an Underwritten Shelf Takedown for purposes of
_Section 2.1_ of this Agreement.

(b) With respect to any registration pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_, if the
managing underwriter advises the Company that the inclusion of Registrable
Securities requested to be included in the Registration Statement will
materially and adversely affect the price or success of the offering (a "
_Material Adverse Effect_ "), the Company will be obligated to include in the
Registration Statement (after all such shares for its own account), as to each
Requesting Holder, only a portion of the shares such Holder has requested be
registered equal to the product of: (i) the ratio which such Holders
requested shares bears to the total number of shares requested to be included
in such Registration Statement by all Persons (including Holders) who have
requested (pursuant to this Agreement or other contractual registration
rights) that their shares be included in such Registration Statement; and (ii)
the maximum number of Registrable Securities that the managing
underwriter advises may be sold in an offering covered by the Registration
Statement without a Material Adverse Effect. If, as a result of the provisions
of this _Section 2.2(b)_, any Holder shall not be entitled to include all
Registrable Securities in a registration that such Holder has requested to be
so included, such Holder may withdraw such Holders request to include
Registrable Securities in such Registration Statement. No Person may
participate in any Registration Statement pursuant to _Section 2.2(a)_
unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such persons Registrable Securities on
the basis provided in any underwriting arrangements approved by the Company
and (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of attorney,
indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents, each in customary
form, reasonably required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such Person shall be required to (A) make
any representations or warranties in connection with any such registration
other than representations and warranties as to (1) such Persons ownership of
his or its Registrable Securities to be sold or transferred free and clear of
all liens, claims and encumbrances, (2) such Persons power and authority to
effect such transfer and (3) such matters pertaining to compliance with
securities laws as may be reasonably requested or (B) undertake any
indemnification obligations to the Company or the underwriters with respect
thereto except as otherwise provided in _Section 2.7_.

 

2.3 _Holdback Agreement_. In connection with any Underwritten Shelf Takedown
or other registered underwritten offering of equity securities by the Company
(a "Company Underwritten Offering") commencing after the date of execution of
the Merger Agreement (other than any registration on Form S-8, S-4 or any
successor forms thereto), each Holder agrees, with respect to the Registrable
Securities owned by such Holder, to be bound by any and all

 



8  restrictions on the sale, disposition, distribution, hedging or other
transfer of any interest in Registrable Securities (except with respect to
such Registrable Securities as are proposed to be offered pursuant to the
Underwritten Shelf Takedown or other registered underwritten offering), or any
securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such
securities, as are imposed on the Company, without prior written consent
from the managing underwriter of such Company Underwritten Offering, for the
period commencing on and ending 90 days following the date of pricing of such
Company Underwritten Offering (subject to extension in connection with any
earnings release or other release of material information pursuant to FINRA
Rule 2711(f) to the extent applicable) (the "Lock-Up Period"). If requested by
the managing underwriter, each Holder agrees to execute a lock-up agreement in
favor of the Companys underwriters to such effect that the Companys
underwriters in any relevant Company Underwritten Offering shall be third
party beneficiaries of this Section 2.3. The provisions of this Section 2.3
will no longer apply to a Holder once such Holder ceases to hold at least 1%
of the Registrable Securities acquired as a result of the transactions
contemplated in the Merger Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
set forth in this _Section 2.3_, (i) each Holder may sell or transfer any
Registrable Securities to any Affiliate of such Holder, so long as such
Affiliate agrees to be and remains bound hereby, (ii) each Holder may enter
into a bona fide pledge of any Registrable Securities (and any foreclosure on
any such pledge shall also be permitted), and (iii) any hedging transaction
with respect to an index or basket of securities where the equity securities
of the Company constitute a de minimis amount shall not be prohibited
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.

2.4 _Registration Procedures_. In connection with the registration and sale
of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement, the Company will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to effect the registration and the sale of
such Registrable Securities in accordance with the intended method of
disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company will:

(a) if the Registration Statement is not automatically effective upon filing,
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such Registration Statement to
become effective as promptly as reasonably practicable;

(b) promptly notify each selling Holder, promptly after the Company receives
notice thereof, of the time when such Registration Statement has been declared
effective or a supplement to any prospectus forming a part of such
Registration Statement has been filed;

(c) after the Registration Statement becomes effective, promptly notify each
selling Holder of any request by the SEC that the Company amend or supplement
such Registration Statement or Prospectus;

(d) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements to the
Registration Statement and the Prospectus used in connection therewith as may
be reasonably necessary to keep the Registration Statement effective and to
comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the
disposition of all Registrable Stock covered by the Registration Statement
for the period required to effect the distribution of the Registrable
Securities as set forth in Section 2 hereof;

 



9 (e) furnish to the selling Holders such numbers of copies of such Registration
Statement, each amendment and supplement thereto, each Prospectus (including

necessary or advisable to enable the Holders and any underwriter(s) to
consummate the disposition of the Registrable Securities in such
jurisdictions; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be required
in connection therewith or as a condition thereto to qualify to do business
in or to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction,
unless the Company is already subject to service in such jurisdiction and
except as may be required by the Securities Act, or subject itself to taxation
in any such jurisdiction, unless the Company is already subject to taxation
in such jurisdiction;

(g) use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause all such Registrable
Securities to be listed on a national securities exchange or trading system
and each securities exchange and trading system (if any) on which similar
equity securities issued by the Company are then listed;

 

(h) provide a transfer agent and registrar for the Registrable Securities and
provide a CUSIP number for all such Registrable Securities, in each case not

of such registration, in form and substance as is customarily given to
underwriters by the Company in an underwritten public offering, addressed to
the underwriters, (ii) a letter dated as of such date, from the independent
public accountants of the Company, in form and substance as is customarily
given by independent public accountants to underwriters in an underwritten

the Company, in form and substance as is customarily given by independent
petroleum engineers to underwriters in an underwritten public offering,

(j) if requested by the Holders, cooperate with the Holders and the managing
underwriter (if any) to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of
certificates (which shall not bear any restrictive legends unless required
under applicable law) representing securities sold under the Registration
Statement, and enable such securities to be in such denominations and
registered in such names as such Holders or the managing underwriter (if any)
may request and keep available and make available to the Companys transfer
agent prior to the effectiveness of such Registration Statement a supply of
such certificates;

 



10 (k) in the event of any underwritten public offering, enter into and perform
its obligations under an underwriting agreement, in form and substance as is
customarily given by the Company to underwriters in an underwritten public
offering, with the underwriter(s) of such offering;

 

(l) upon execution of confidentiality agreements in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Company, promptly make available
for inspection by the selling Holders, any underwriter(s) participating in
any disposition pursuant to such Registration Statement, and any attorney or
accountant or other agent retained by any such underwriter or selected by the
selling Holders, all financial and other records, pertinent corporate
documents, and properties of the Company (collectively, " _Records_ "), and
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys officers,
directors, employees, and independent accountants to supply all information
reasonably requested by any such seller, underwriter, attorney, accountant, or
agent, in each case, as necessary or advisable to verify the accuracy of the
information in such Registration Statement and to conduct appropriate due
diligence in connection therewith; _provided_ , Records that the Company
determines, in good faith, to be confidential and that it notifies the selling
Holders are confidential shall not be disclosed by the selling Holders unless
the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena or other order
from a court of competent jurisdiction or is otherwise required by applicable
law. Each Holder agrees that information obtained by it as a result of
such inspections shall be deemed confidential and shall not be used by it or
its affiliates (other than with respect to such Holders due diligence) unless
and until such information is made generally available to the public, and
further agrees that, upon learning that disclosure of such Records is sought
in a court of competent jurisdiction, to the extent permitted and to the
extent practicable it shall give notice to the Company and allow the Company
to undertake appropriate action to prevent disclosure of the Records deemed
confidential;

(m) promptly notify the selling Holders and any underwriter(s) of the
notification to the Company by the SEC of its initiation of any proceeding
with respect to the issuance by the SEC of any stop order suspending the

Prospectus or suspending the qualification of any Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement for sale in any jurisdiction, use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain promptly the withdrawal of such
order;

(n) promptly notify the selling Holders and any underwriter(s) at any time
when a Prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the
Securities Act of the happening of any event as a result of which the
Prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in effect,
includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were made, and
at the request of any Holder promptly prepare and furnish to such Holder a
reasonable number of copies of a supplement to or an amendment of such
Prospectus, or a revised Prospectus, as may be necessary so that, as
thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such securities, such Prospectus
shall not include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which

 



11  they were made (following receipt of any supplement or amendment to any
Prospectus, the selling Holders shall deliver such amended, supplemental or
revised Prospectus in connection with any offers or sales of Registrable
Stock, and shall not deliver or use any Prospectus not so supplemented,
amended or revised);

(o) promptly notify the selling Holders and any underwriter(s) of the receipt
by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the applicable
securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction;

(p) make available to each Holder (i) promptly after the same is prepared and
publicly distributed, filed with the SEC, or received by the Company, one
copy of each Registration Statement and any amendment thereto, each
preliminary Prospectus and Prospectus and each amendment or supplement
thereto, each letter written by or on behalf of the Company to the SEC or
the staff of the SEC (or other governmental agency or self-regulatory body or
other body having jurisdiction, including any domestic or foreign securities
exchange), and each item of correspondence from the SEC or the staff of the
SEC (or other governmental agency or self-regulatory body or other body
having jurisdiction, including any domestic or foreign securities exchange),
in each case relating to such Registration Statement or to any of the
documents incorporated by reference therein, and (ii) such number of copies
of each Prospectus, including a preliminary Prospectus, and all amendments and
supplements thereto and such other documents as any Holder or any underwriter
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Securities. The Company will promptly notify the Holders of the
effectiveness of each Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment
or the filing of any supplement or amendment to such Registration
Statement or of any Prospectus supplement. The Company will promptly respond
to any and all comments received from the SEC, with a view towards causing
each Registration Statement or any amendment thereto to be declared effective
by the SEC as soon as practicable and shall file an acceleration request, if
necessary, as soon as practicable following the resolution or clearance of all
SEC comments or, if applicable, following notification by the SEC that any
such Registration Statement or any amendment thereto will not be subject to
review;

(q) take no direct or indirect action prohibited by Regulation M under the
Exchange Act;  _provided_ , that, to the extent that any prohibition is
applicable to the Company, the Company will take all reasonable action to make
any such prohibition inapplicable;

 

(r) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such Registrable Securities
not later than the effective date of such Registration Statement; and

(s) take all such other actions as are reasonably necessary in order to
facilitate the disposition of such Registrable Securities.

2.5 _Suspension of Dispositions_. Each Holder agrees by acquisition of any
Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of any notice (a " _Suspension
Notice_ ") from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in _Section 2.4(n)_ such Holder will forthwith discontinue
disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Registration Statement
until such Holders receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended
Prospectus, or until it is advised in writing (the " _Advice_ ") by the
Company that the use of the Prospectus may be resumed, and has

 



12  received copies of any additional or supplemental filings which are
incorporated by reference in the Prospectus. The Company shall extend the
period of time during which the Company is required to maintain the
Registration Statement effective pursuant to this Agreement by the number of
days during the period from and including the date of the giving of such
Suspension Notice to and including the date such Holder either receives
the supplemented or amended Prospectus or receives the Advice. If so directed
by the Company, such Holder will deliver to the Company all copies, other than
permanent file copies then in such Holders possession, of the Prospectus
covering such Registrable Securities current at the time of receipt of such
notice. The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts and take
such actions as are reasonably necessary to render the Advice as promptly as
practicable. The Holders acknowledge and agree that receipt of a Suspension
Notice may constitute material non-public information regarding the Company
and shall keep the existence and contents of any such Suspension Notice
confidential.

 

2.6 _Registration Expenses_. All Registration Expenses shall be borne by the
Company. In addition, for the avoidance of doubt, the Company shall pay its
internal expenses in connection with the performance of or compliance with
this Agreement (including, without limitation, all salaries and expenses of
its officers and employees performing legal or accounting duties),
the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the expense of any
liability insurance and the expenses and fees for listing the securities to be
registered on each securities exchange on which they are to be listed. All
Selling Expenses relating to Registrable Securities registered shall be borne
by the Holders of such Registrable Securities pro rata on the basis of the
number of Registrable Securities sold.

 

2.7 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and reimburse, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, each Holder that is a seller of Registrable Securities, and
each of its employees, advisors, agents, representatives, partners, officers,
and directors and each Person who controls such Holder (within the meaning of
the Securities Act or the Exchange Act) and any agent or investment
advisor thereof (collectively, the " _Seller Affiliates_ ") (i) against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses, joint or several
(including, without limitation, attorneys fees and disbursements except
as limited by _Section 2.7(c)_) based upon, arising out of, related to or
resulting from any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto, or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, (ii) against any and all losses, liabilities, claims, damages and
expenses whatsoever, as incurred, to the extent of the aggregate amount paid
in settlement of any litigation or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or of any claim
whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, and
(iii) against any and all costs and expenses (including reasonable fees and
disbursements of counsel) as may be reasonably incurred in investigating,
preparing or defending against any litigation, investigation or proceeding by
any governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever based upon, arising out of, related to or resulting from any such
untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission, or such
violation of the Securities Act or Exchange Act, to the extent that any such
expense or cost is not paid under subparagraph (i) or (ii) above; except
insofar as any such statements are made in reliance upon information
furnished to the Company in writing by such seller or any Seller Affiliate
expressly for use therein. The reimbursements required by this _Section
2.7(a)_ will be made by periodic payments during the course of the
investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or expenses incurred.

 



13 (b) In connection with any Registration Statement in which a Holder that is a
seller of Registrable Securities is participating, each such Holder will
furnish to the Company such information and affidavits as the Company
reasonably requests for use in connection with any such Registration Statement
or Prospectus and, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each such seller
will indemnify the Company and its directors and officers and each Person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of the Securities Act or the Exchange
Act) against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements
except as limited by _Section 2.7(c)_) resulting from any untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement, Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, but only to
the extent that such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission
or alleged omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished
by such seller or any of its Seller Affiliates in writing specifically for
inclusion in the Registration Statement; _provided_ that the obligation to
indemnify will be several, not joint and several, among such sellers of
Registrable Securities, and the liability of each such seller of Registrable
Securities will be in proportion to the amount of Registrable Securities
registered by them, and, _provided_ , _further_ , that such liability will be
limited to the net amount received by such seller from the sale of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such seller of Registrable Securities shall not be liable in any such
case to the extent that prior to the filing of any such Registration Statement
or Prospectus, such seller has furnished to the Company information expressly
for use in such Registration Statement or Prospectus or any amendment thereof
or supplement thereto which corrected or made not misleading information
previously furnished to the Company.

 

(c) Any Person entitled to indemnification hereunder will (i) give prompt
written notice to the indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which
it seeks indemnification ( _provided_ that the failure to give such notice
shall not limit the rights of such Person) and (ii) unless in such indemnified
partys reasonable judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified
and indemnifying parties may exist with respect to such claim, permit such
indemnifying party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the indemnified party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
any person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall have the right to
employ separate counsel and to participate in the defense of such claim, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such person
unless (A) the indemnifying party has agreed to pay such fees or expenses or
(B) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of such
claim and employ counsel reasonably satisfactory to such person. If such
defense is not assumed by the indemnifying party as permitted hereunder, the
indemnifying party will not be subject to any liability for any settlement
made by the indemnified party without its consent (but such consent will not
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If such defense is assumed
by the indemnifying party pursuant to the provisions hereof, such indemnifying
party shall not settle or otherwise compromise the applicable claim unless (i)
such settlement or compromise contains a full and unconditional release of
the indemnified party or (ii) the indemnified party otherwise consents in
writing (which

 



14  consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). An
indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim will not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with
respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified
party, a conflict of interest may exist between such indemnified party and
any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim, in which
event the indemnifying party shall be obligated to pay the reasonable fees and
disbursements of such additional counsel or counsels.

 

(d) Each party hereto agrees that, if for any reason the indemnification
provisions contemplated by _Section 2.7(a)_ or  _Section 2.7(b)_ are
unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party in
respect of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions in
respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, liabilities or expenses (or actions in respect
thereof) in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of
the indemnifying party and the indemnified party in connection with the
actions which resulted in the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
such indemnifying party and indemnified party shall be determined by
reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact relates to information supplied by such indemnifying party or
indemnified party, and the parties relative intent, knowledge, access to
information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable
if contribution pursuant to this _Section 2.7(d)_ were determined by pro
rata allocation (even if the Holders or any underwriters or all of them were
treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation
which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in
this _Section 2.7(d)_. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as
a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to above shall be deemed to include any legal or
other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or, except as provided in _Section 2.7(c)_,
defending any such action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
_Section 2.7(d)_, no Holder shall be required to contribute an amount greater
than the dollar amount by which the net proceeds received by such Holder with
respect to the sale of any Registrable Securities exceeds the amount of
damages which such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of any
and all untrue or alleged untrue statements of material fact or omissions or
alleged omissions of material fact made in any Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto related to such sale
of Registrable Securities. No person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled
to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation. The Holders obligations in this _Section 2.7(d)_ to
contribute shall be several in proportion to the amount of Registrable
Securities registered by them and not joint.

If indemnification is available under this _Section 2.7_, the indemnifying
parties shall indemnify each indemnified party to the full extent provided in
_Section 2.7(a)_ and _Section 2.7(b)_ without regard to the relative fault
of said indemnifying party or indemnified party or any other equitable
consideration provided for in this _Section 2.7(d)_ subject, in the case of
the Holders, to the limited dollar amounts set forth in _Section 2.7(b)_.

 



15 (e) The indemnification and contribution provided for under this Agreement
will remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or controlling
Person of such indemnified party and will survive the transfer of securities.

 

2.8 _Transfer of Registration Rights_. The registration rights of a Holder
under this Agreement with respect to any Registrable Securities may be
transferred or assigned to any purchaser or transferee of Registrable
Securities; _ provided_ _,_ _ however_, that (i) such Holder shall give
Parent written notice prior to the time of such transfer stating the name and
address of the transferee and identifying the securities with respect to which
the rights under this Agreement are being transferred; (ii) such transferee
shall agree in writing, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Parent, to be bound as a Holder by the provisions of this Agreement; (iii)
such transferee is not a direct competitor of the Company; and (iv)
immediately following such transfer the further disposition of such
securities by such transferee shall be restricted to the extent set forth
under applicable law.

2.9 _Current Public Information_. With a view to making available to the
Holders of Registrable Securities the benefits of Rule 144 and Rule 144A
promulgated under the Securities Act and other rules and regulations of the
SEC that may at any time permit a Holder of Registrable Securities to sell
securities of the Company to the public without registration, the Company
covenants that it will (i) use its reasonable best efforts to file in a timely
manner all reports and other documents required, if any, to be filed by it
under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
adopted thereunder and (ii) make available information necessary to comply
with Rule 144 and Rule 144A, if available with respect to resales of the
Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, at all times, all to the
extent required from time to time to enable such Holder to sell Registrable
Securities without registration under the Securities Act within the limitation
of the exemptions provided by (x) Rule 144 and Rule 144A promulgated under
the Securities Act (if available with respect to resales of the Registrable
Securities), as such rules may be amended from time to time or (y) any other
rules or regulations now existing or hereafter adopted by the SEC.

2.10 _Company Obligations Regarding Transfers_. In connection with any sale or
transfer of Registrable Securities by any Holder, including any sale or
transfer pursuant to Rule 144 and Rule 144A promulgated under the Securities
Act and other rules and regulations of the SEC that may at any time permit a
Holder of Registrable Securities to sell securities of the Company to the
public without registration, the Company shall, to the extent allowed by law,
take any and all action necessary or reasonably requested by such Holder in
order to permit or facilitate such sale or transfer, including,
without limitation, at the sole expense of the Company, by (i) issuing such
directions to any transfer agent, registrar or depositary, as applicable, (ii)
delivering such opinions to the transfer agent, registrar or depositary as are
requested by the same, and (iii) taking or causing to be taken such other
actions as are reasonably necessary (in each case on a timely basis) in order
to cause any legends, notations or similar designations restricting
transferability of the Registrable Securities held by such Holder to be
removed and to rescind any transfer restrictions (other than as may apply
pursuant to _Section 2.3)_ with respect to such Registrable Securities.

 



16 2.11 _No Conflict of Rights_. The Company represents and warrants that it has
not granted, and is not subject to, any registration rights that are superior
to, inconsistent with or that in any way violate or subordinate the rights
granted to the Holders hereby. The Company shall not, prior to the termination
of this Agreement, grant any registration rights that are superior to,
inconsistent with or that in any way violate or subordinate the rights granted
to the Holders hereby.

 

2.12 _Free Writing Prospectuses_. The Company shall not permit any officer,
director, underwriter, broker or any other person acting on behalf of the
Company to use any free writing prospectus (as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act) in connection with any registration statement covering
Registrable Securities, without the prior written consent of
each participating Holder and any underwriter. No Holder shall, or permit any
officer, manager, underwriter, broker or any other person acting on behalf of
such Holder to use any free-writing prospectus in connection with any
registration statement covering Registrable Securities, without the prior
written consent of the Company.

terminate and shall remain in effect until there shall no longer be any
Registrable Securities outstanding.

(a) This Agreement shall be constructed, interpreted and enforced in
accordance with, and the respective rights and obligations of the parties
shall be governed by, the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to
principles of conflicts of law.

 

(b) All actions and proceedings for the enforcement of or based on, arising
out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and
determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over the particular
matter, any other court of the State of Delaware, or any federal court sitting
in the State of Delaware), and each of the parties hereto hereby (i)
irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts (and, in the
case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such action or
proceeding, (ii) irrevocably waives the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of any such action or proceeding, (iii) agrees that it shall

(c) Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives any and all rights to
trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or related to this
Agreement.

4.3 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any
other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature
whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement; provided, however, the
parties hereto hereby acknowledge that the Persons set forth in _Section 2.3_
and _Section 2.7_ are express third-party beneficiaries of the obligations of
the parties hereto set forth in  _Section 2.3_ and _Section 2.7_,
respectively.

 



18 4.4 _Successors and Assigns_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and benefit the Company, each Holder and
their respective successors and assigns. The Company shall not, directly or
indirectly, enter into any merger, consolidation or reorganization in which
the Company shall not be the surviving entity unless the surviving entity
shall, prior to such merger, consolidation or reorganization, agree in writing
to assume the obligations of the Company under this Agreement, and for that
purpose references hereunder to "Registrable Securities" shall be deemed to
include the common equity interests or other securities, if any, which the
Holders would be entitled to receive in exchange for Registrable Securities
under any such merger, consolidation or reorganization, provided that, to the
extent the Holders receive securities that are by their terms convertible into
common equity interests of the issuer thereof, then any such common equity
interests as are issued or issuable upon conversion of said convertible
securities shall be included within the definition of "Registrable
Securities."

4.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed by the parties in separate
counterparts (including by means of executed counterparts delivered via
facsimile or other electronic means), each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument.

4.6 _Severability_. In case any provision in this Agreement shall be held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the
validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other
respect and the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.

 

4.7 _No Waivers; Amendments_.

 

(a) No failure or delay on the part of the Company or any Holder in exercising
any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor
shall any single or partial exercise of any such right, power or remedy
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, power or remedy. The remedies provided for herein are cumulative and
are not exclusive of any remedies that may be available to the Company or any
Holder at law or in equity or otherwise.

(b) Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if,
such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed by the Company and the
Required Holders; provided, however, that, so long as each of First Reserve or
Ziff, each together with its Affiliates, continues to own 20% or more of the
Registrable Securities acquired by it at the closing of the transactions
contemplated in the Merger Agreement, any such amendment or waiver shall
require the written consent of First Reserve and/or Ziff, as applicable.

4.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other writings referred to
herein or therein or delivered pursuant hereto or thereto, contain the entire
agreement between the Holders and the Company with respect to the subject
matter hereof and supersede all prior and contemporaneous arrangements or
understandings with respect thereto.

 



19 4.9 _Remedies; Specific Performance_.

 

(a) Each Holder shall have all rights and remedies reserved for such Holder
pursuant to this Agreement and all rights and remedies which such Holder has
been granted at any time under any other agreement or contract and all of the
rights which such Holder has under any law or equity. Any Person having any
rights under any provision of this Agreement will be entitled to enforce such
rights specifically, to recover damages by reason of any breach of any
provision of this Agreement and to exercise all other rights granted by law or
equity.

 

(b) The parties hereto recognize and agree that money damages may be
insufficient to compensate the Holders of any Registrable Securities
for breaches by the Company of the terms hereof and, consequently, that the

letter agreement, no party hereto is waiving or being required to waive any
Claim with respect to any fraud by any other person, or any right that cannot
be waived under applicable law, and nothing contained in this letter agreement

the Releasing Partys Affiliates and the Releasees relating to the subject
matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings among or
between any of those parties relating to the subject matter hereof. In the
event that any provision of this letter agreement, or the application of any
such provision to any person or entity or set of circumstances, shall be
determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable to any extent, the
remainder of this letter agreement, and the application of such provision to

determined to be invalid, unlawful, void or unenforceable, shall not be
impaired or otherwise affected and shall continue to be valid and enforceable
