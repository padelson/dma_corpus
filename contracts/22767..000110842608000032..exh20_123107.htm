1.2 Other Definitional and Interpretive Matters. Unless otherwise expressly
provided, for purposes of this Agreement, the following rules of
interpretation apply:

 

 

(a) Calculation of Time Period. When calculating the period of time before
which, within which, or following which any act is to be done or step taken
pursuant to this Agreement, the date that is the reference date in
calculating such period will be excluded. If the last day of such period is a
non-Business Day, the period in question will end on the next succeeding
Business Day.

 

 

(b) Dollars. Any reference in this Agreement to "dollars" or "$" means
U.S. dollars.

 

 

(c) "Exclusively in the Business". With reference to assets owned by Seller,
and liabilities of Seller, which are used by, in, or for, or relate to,
the Business, the phrases "exclusively in the Business," "exclusively to
the Business," and other statements of similar import will be construed to
refer to assets or liabilities that are devoted exclusively to (or in the
case of liabilities, are related exclusively to) the Business.

 

 

(d) Exhibits and Schedules. Unless otherwise expressly indicated, any
reference in this Agreement to an "Exhibit" or a "Schedule" refers to an
Exhibit or Schedule to this Agreement. The Exhibits and Schedules to this
Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part hereof as if set forth in
full herein and are an integral part of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms
used in any Schedule or Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein are defined
as set forth in this Agreement.

 

 

(e) Gender and Number. Any reference in this Agreement to gender includes
all genders, and the meaning of defined terms applies to both the singular
and the plural of those terms.

 

 

(f) Headings. The provision of a Table of Contents, the division of this
Agreement into Articles, Sections, and other subdivisions, and the insertion
of headings are for convenience of reference only and do not affect, and will
not be utilized in construing or interpreting, this Agreement. All references
in this Agreement to any "Section" are to the corresponding Section of this
Agreement unless otherwise specified.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

14  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) "Herein". The words such as "herein," "hereinafter," "hereof," and
"hereunder" refer to this Agreement (including the Schedules and Exhibits to
this Agreement) as a whole and not merely to a subdivision in which such
words appear unless the context otherwise requires.

 

 

(h) "Including". The word "including" or any variation thereof means
"including, without limitation" and does not limit any general statement that
it follows to the specific or similar items or matters immediately following
it.

 

 

(i) "To the extent". The words "to the extent" when used in reference to
a liability or other matter, means that the liability or other matter
referred to is included in part or excluded in part, with the portion
included or excluded determined based on the portion of such liability or
other matter exclusively related to the subject. For example, if 40 percent
of a liability is attributable to the Business, then a statement that Buyer
will assume the liability "to the extent related to the operation of the
Business" means that Buyer will assume 40 percent of the liability. As an
additional example, if a performance obligation attributable to the Business
is by its terms to be performed prior to and following the Effective Time, a
statement that Buyer will assume the obligation "to the extent such
obligation relates to the period from and after the Effective Time" means
that Buyer will assume all liability for the performance from and after the
Effective Time, and that Seller will remain liable for any failure to perform
such obligations prior to the Effective Time.

 

 

1.3 Joint Negotiation and Preparation of Agreement. The Parties and Parent
have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement
and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement will be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties
and Parent and no presumption or burden of proof favoring or disfavoring any
Party or Parent will exist or arise by virtue of the authorship of any
provision of this Agreement.

ARTICLE III

 

PURCHASE PRICE

 

 

3.1 Purchase Price. (a)The purchase price for the Purchased Assets (the
"Purchase Price") will be an amount equal to $620,000,000 (the "Base
Price"), adjusted as follows: (i) the Base Price will be increased by the
Adjustment Amount if the Adjustment Amount is a positive number; and (ii) the
Base Price will be reduced by the Adjustment Amount if the Adjustment Amount
is a negative number. The Adjustment Amount will be determined in accordance
with the requirements set forth on Exhibit 3.1.

 

 

(b) Within five Business Days of the settlement of any transaction involving
any matched Off-System Purchases and Sales with a settlement date after the
Closing Date, Buyer will for each such transaction pay Seller the Off-System
Net Payment Amount calculated in accordance with Exhibit 3.1. For purposes
of this Section 3.1(b), (i) "matched Off-System Purchases and Sales" means a
transaction in which the Business purchased physical gas and simultaneously
agreed to sell forward an equivalent volume of gas to a non-jurisdictional
customer as part of Seller's business of Off-System Purchases and Sales, (ii)
the settlement of any such transaction shall be the later of (A) the date of
delivery by the Business of the physical gas pursuant to such forward sale
and (B) the date of payment by the non-jurisdictional customer and (iii) only
Off-System Purchases and Sales pursuant to Business Agreements shall be taken
into account.

 

 

3.2 Determination of Purchase Price.

 

 

(a) No later than five days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will prepare in
good faith and deliver to Buyer a reasonably detailed estimate of the
Purchase Price, based on Seller's good faith estimate of the Adjustment
Amount (such estimated Purchase Price being referred to herein as the
"Closing Payment Amount").

 

 

(b) Within 120 days after the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver
to Buyer a statement (the "Post-Closing Adjustment Statement") that reflects
Seller's determination of (i) the Adjustment Amount, and (ii) the Purchase
Price based on the Adjustment Amount. In addition, Seller will provide Buyer
with supporting calculations, in reasonable detail, for such determinations
at the time it delivers the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. Buyer agrees
to cooperate with Seller in connection with Seller's preparation of
the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement and related information, and will
provide Seller with access to its books, records, information, and employees
as Seller may reasonably request.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) The amounts determined by Seller as set forth in the Post-Closing
Adjustment Statement will be final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes
unless, and only to the extent, that within 30 days after Seller has
delivered the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement Buyer notifies Seller of any
dispute with matters set forth in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement. Any
such notice of dispute delivered by Buyer (an "Adjustment Dispute Notice")
will identify with specificity each item in the Post-Closing Adjustment
Statement with respect to which Buyer disagrees, the basis of
such disagreement, and Buyer's position with respect to such disputed item.

 

 

(d) If Buyer delivers an Adjustment Dispute Notice in compliance with Section
3.2(c), then (i) the undisputed portion of the total proposed Adjustment
Amount set forth in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement will be paid by the
appropriate Party, in accordance with the payment procedures set forth in
Section 3.2(e); and (ii) Buyer and Seller will attempt to reconcile their
differences and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts will be
final, binding, and conclusive for all purposes on the Parties. If Buyer and
Seller are unable to reach a resolution with respect to all disputed items
within 45 days of delivery of the Adjustment Dispute Notice, Buyer and Seller
will submit any items remaining in dispute for determination and resolution
to the Independent Accounting Firm, which will be instructed to determine and
report to the Parties, within 30 days after such submission, upon such
remaining disputed items. The report of the Independent Accounting Firm will
be final, binding, and conclusive on the Parties for all purposes. The fees
and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm will be allocated
between Buyer and Seller so that Buyer's share of such fees and disbursements
will be in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such remaining
disputed items so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm that is
unsuccessfully disputed by Buyer (as finally determined by the Independent
Accounting Firm) bears to the total amount of such remaining disputed amounts
so submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm.

 

 

(e) Within five Business Days following the final determination of the
Purchase Price pursuant to Sections 3.2(c) and 3.2(d), (i) if the Purchase
Price is greater than the Closing Payment Amount, Buyer will pay the
difference (adjusted to reflect any payment pursuant to Section 3.2(d)(i)) to
Seller; or (ii) if the Purchase Price is less than the Closing Payment
Amount, Seller will pay the difference (adjusted to reflect any payment
pursuant to Section 3.2(d)(i)) to Buyer. Any amount, together with interest
thereon at a rate equal to JPMorgan's prime rate from time to time in effect,
from the Closing Date to the date of payment, to be paid under this Section
3.2(e) will be paid in cash by wire transfer of immediately available funds
to the account specified by the Party receiving payment.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

3.3 Allocation of Purchase Price. All amounts constituting consideration
within the meaning of, and for the purposes of, Section 1060 of the Code and
the regulations thereunder shall be allocated among the Purchased Assets in
the manner required by Section 1060 of the Code and the regulations
thereunder and all applicable Laws. Within 60 calendar days after the Closing
Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with a proposed schedule (the "Allocation
Schedule") allocating all such amounts as provided herein. The
Allocation Schedule shall become final and binding on the parties hereto 15
calendar days after Seller provides such schedule to Buyer, unless Buyer
objects in writing to Seller, specifying the basis for its objection and
preparing an alternative allocation. If Buyer does object, the Parties shall
in good faith attempt to resolve the dispute within 15 calendar days of
written notice to Seller of Buyer's objection. Any such resolution shall be
final and binding on the parties hereto. Any unresolved disputes shall
be promptly submitted to the Independent Accounting Firm for determination,
which shall be final and binding on the parties hereto. Buyer and
Seller will each pay one-half of the fees and expenses of the Independent
Accounting Firm. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with each other and
the Independent Accounting Firm in connection with the matters contemplated
by this Section 3.3, including, without limitation, by furnishing such
information and access to books, records (including, without limitation,
accountants work papers), personnel and properties as may be reasonably
requested. Each of the parties hereto agrees to (a) prepare and timely file
all Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594 (and all supplements thereto) in a
manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule as finalized and (b) act in
accordance with the Allocation Schedule for all tax purposes. The Parties
hereto will revise the Allocation Schedule to the extent necessary to reflect
any post-Closing payment made pursuant to or in connection with this
Agreement. In the case of any such payment, Seller shall propose a revised
Allocation Schedule, and the parties hereto shall follow the procedures
outlined above with respect to review, dispute and resolution in respect of
such revision.

 

 

3.4 Proration.

 

 

(a) All Taxes, utility charges, and similar items customarily prorated,
including those listed below, to the extent relating to the Business or the
Purchased Assets will be prorated as of the Effective Time, with Seller
liable to the extent such items relate to any period on or prior to the
Effective Time, and Buyer liable to the extent such items relate to any
period after the Effective Time. Such items to be prorated will include:

 

 

(i) personal property and real property Taxes, assessments, franchise fees,
and other similar charges, including charges for water, telephone,
electricity, and other utilities;

 

 

(ii) any permit, license, registration, and compliance assurance fees or
other fees with respect to any Transferable Permits, Transferable
Environmental Permit or other Purchased Asset; and

 

 

(iii) rents under the Real Property Leases or any personal property leases
included in the Purchased Assets.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) In connection with any real or personal property Tax prorations,
including installments of special assessments, as between Buyer and Seller,
Seller will be responsible for an amount equal to the amount of the current
real or personal property Tax or installment of special assessments, as the
case may be, multiplied by a fraction, in each instance (i) the numerator of
which is the number of days from the first day of the Taxable Period or
assessment period in which the Closing Date occurs to the Closing Date, and
(ii) the denominator of which is the total number of days in the Taxable
Period or assessment period in which the Closing Date occurs and Buyer will
be responsible to reimburse Seller for the balance of such amount. In
connection with any other prorations, in the event that actual amounts are
not available at the Closing Date, the proration will be based upon the
Taxes, assessments, charges, fees, or rents for the most recent period
completed prior to the Closing Date for which actual Taxes, assessments,
charges, fees, or rents are available. All prorations will be based upon the
most recent available Tax rates, assessments, and valuations. Any prorations
will be made so as to avoid duplication of any items, and will not include
items which are otherwise taken into account in determining the
Purchase Price, including the Adjustment Amount. Seller shall have the sole
right to contest, compromise or request and obtain refunds with respect to
all real and personal property Taxes allocable to periods ending on or prior
to the Closing Date or that are the responsibility of Seller pursuant to this
Section 3.4(b) ("Seller Property Taxes").

 

 

(c) The proration of all items under this Section 3.4 will be recalculated
by Buyer within 60 days following the date upon which the actual amounts
become available to Buyer. Buyer will notify Seller promptly of such
recalculated amounts, and will provide Seller with all documentation relating
to such recalculations, including tax statements and other notices from third
parties. The Parties will make such payments to each other as are necessary
to reconcile any estimated amounts prorated as of the Effective Time with the
final amounts to be prorated. Seller and Buyer agree to furnish each other
with such documents and other records as may be reasonably requested in order
to confirm all proration calculations made pursuant to this Section 3.4.

Sections only to the extent that the relevance of any such disclosure to any

Purchased Assets and to carry on the Business as presently conducted. Seller
is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation and is
in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the conduct of the Business,
or the ownership or operation of any Purchased Assets, by Seller makes

of Seller are necessary to authorize this Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
This Agreement has been, and upon Closing each of the Ancillary Agreements
will be, duly and validly executed and delivered by Seller, and constitutes
(or, with respect to each Ancillary Agreement, will constitute upon Closing)
a valid and binding agreement of Seller, enforceable against Seller in
accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar laws
affecting or relating to enforcement of creditors' rights generally or
general principles of equity (regardless of whether enforcement is considered
in a proceeding at law or in equity).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

28  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

5.3 Consents and Approvals; No Violation. Except as set forth in Schedule

(b) result in a default (including with notice, lapse of time, or both), or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, acceleration, or loss of
a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Encumbrance upon
any of the Purchased Assets, under any of the terms, conditions, or
provisions of any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, agreement, lease, or other
instrument or obligation to which Seller is a party or by which Seller or any
of the Purchased Assets may be bound, except for such defaults (or rights of
termination, cancellation, or acceleration) as to which requisite waivers or
consents have been, or will prior to the Effective Time be, obtained or which
if not obtained or made, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect;

 

 

(c) subject to obtaining the Seller Required Regulatory Approvals, conflict

specific regulatory status of Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) or as a result
of any other facts that specifically relate to any business or activities in
which Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) is or proposes to be engaged.

any ERISA Affiliate of Seller) or with respect to which Seller (or any ERISA
Affiliate of Seller) has any actual or contingent liability and (ii) covers

that such trust is so exempt. Nothing has occurred since the date of such
most recent determination letter that would materially adversely affect the
qualified or exempt status of such Benefit Plan or trust, nor will the
consummation of the transactions provided for by this Agreement have any
such effect. Each Benefit Plan with respect to which any assets
or liabilities are transferred to Buyer (or any ERISA Affiliate of Buyer) or

501(c)(9) of the Code has received notification from the Internal Revenue
Service that such funding vehicle qualifies for tax-exempt status under

tax-exempt notification that would materially adversely affect the exempt
status of such funding vehicle.

Section 412 of the Code with respect to any Benefit Plan that is subject to

from Seller to or under the Benefit Plans have been paid in a timely manner.

ERISA has occurred or exists in connection with any Benefit Plan.

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Seller shall:

 

 

(i) develop the capability to provide separate bills to customers of the
Business and of the Electric Business, such that each customer of the
Business can be sent a bill that invoices only gas purchased from and
services provided by the Business (a "Gas Bill") and that does not include
or invoice any amounts owed by such customer in respect of the Electric
Business or any other business of Seller (an "Electric Bill").

 

 

(ii) Upon application for and the receipt of approval from the NMPRC and
prior to such approval becoming a Final Regulatory Order, commence sending to
each customer that is a customer of the Business and the Electric Business, a
Gas Bill and an Electric Bill.

system for the allocation of payments by customers of both the Business and

joint bills attributable to the Electric Business ("Electric Accounts");

 

 

(B) payments received in respect of overdue amounts are allocated on a first-
in-first-out basis; and

 

 

(C) where partial payments are submitted in respect of amounts owed in
respect of a Gas Account and an Electric Account, such partial payments are
allocated on a pro rata basis among such accounts.

 

 

(d) Until the Closing Date, in connection with the Business Seller will
continue to make capital expenditures (i) at a rate of at least 85% of the
aggregate Capital Expenditure Budget and (ii) otherwise substantially in
accordance with the Capital Expenditure Budget.

 

 

(e) Until the Closing Date, Seller will continue in all material respects to

or not expired or lapsed.

 

 

7.2 Access to Information.

 

 

(a) Between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, Seller will,
during ordinary business hours and upon reasonable notice, (i) give Buyer,
Buyer's Representatives and its financing providers (including prospective
providers of financing) and their respective counsel, auditors and other
authorized representatives reasonable access to the Purchased Assets to which
Buyer is not denied access by Law and to which Seller has the right to grant
access without the consent of any other Person (and in the case where consent
of another Person is required, only on such terms and conditions as may be
imposed by such other Person); (ii) permit Buyer, Buyer's Representatives and
its financing providers

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(including prospective providers of financing) and their respective counsel,
auditors and other authorized representatives to make such reasonable
inspections thereof as they may reasonably request; (iii) furnish Buyer,
Buyer's Representatives and its financing providers (including prospective
providers of financing) and their respective counsel, auditors and other
authorized representatives with such financial and operating data and other
information with respect to the Business as such Persons may from time to
time reasonably request; (iv) furnish Buyer with a copy of each material
report, schedule, or other document relating to the Business filed by Seller
with, or received by Seller from, any Governmental Entity; (v) give Buyer and
Buyer's Representatives reasonable access to each member of the Transition
Advisory Team; and (vi) give Buyer and Buyer's Representatives reasonable
access to such personnel, information and assets of Seller as may be
necessary to fulfill Buyer's obligations under Section 3(a)(iv) of the
Transition Services Agreement; provided, however, that (A) any investigation
permitted by this Section 7.2(a) will be conducted in such a manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the operation of the Business or any other
Person, (B) Seller will not be required to take any action which would
constitute a waiver of the attorney client privilege, and (C) Seller need not
supply Buyer with any information which Seller is under a contractual or
other legal obligation not to supply. Notwithstanding anything in this
Section 7.2 to the contrary, (x) Buyer will not have access to personnel and
medical records if such access could, in Seller's good faith judgment,
subject Seller to risk of liability or otherwise violate the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, and (y) any investigation of
environmental matters by or on behalf of Buyer will be limited to visual
inspections and site visits commonly included in the scope of "Phase 1" level
environmental inspections, and Buyer will not have the right to perform or
conduct any other sampling or testing at, in, on, or underneath any of the
Purchased Assets.

 

 

(b) Unless and until the transactions contemplated hereby have been
consummated, each Party will, and will cause its Affiliates and Buyer's
Representatives and potential financing sources or Seller's Representatives,
as applicable, to, hold in strict confidence and not use or disclose to any
other Person all Confidential Information. As to each Party,
"Confidential Information" means all information in any form heretofore or
hereafter obtained from either Party in connection with such Party's
evaluation of the Business, the negotiation of this Agreement, or the
performance of the covenants and agreements of this Agreement, whether
pertaining to financial condition, results of operations, methods of
operation or otherwise, other than information that (i) was already in such
receiving Party's or its Representatives' or, in the case of Buyer, its
potential financing sources' possession; provided, that such information is
not known by such receiving Party, after due inquiry, to be subject to
another confidentiality agreement with or other obligation of secrecy to the
other Party or any other party, (ii) subsequently becomes generally available
to the public other than as a result of a disclosure by such receiving Party
or its Representatives or, in the case of Buyer, its potential
financing sources in breach of this Section 7.2(b) or the Confidentiality
Agreement or (iii) subsequently becomes available to such receiving Party on
a non-confidential basis from a source other than the other Party or its
Representatives or, in the case of Buyer, its potential financing sources;
provided, that such source is not known by such receiving Party, after due
inquiry, to be bound by a confidentiality agreement with or other obligation
of secrecy or non-disclosure to the other Party or any other

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

45  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each Party, its Affiliates, its
Representatives or, in the case of Buyer, its potential financing sources,
may disclose Confidential Information to the extent that such information is
required to be disclosed by it by Law, in connection with any proceeding by
or before a Governmental Entity, including any disclosure, financial or
otherwise, required to comply with any Required Regulatory Approvals or if
requested by any Governmental Entity having jurisdiction over the Party, its
Affiliates, its Representatives or, in the case of Buyer, its potential
financing sources. In the event that a Party receives a request (whether by
oral questions, interrogatories, requests for documents in legal proceedings,
under the terms of a subpoena or order issued by a court or governmental body
or other similar process or otherwise pursuant to applicable regulation
(including stock exchange) to disclose all or any part of the Confidential
Information, such Party agrees, and shall cause its Representatives, to
promptly notify the other Party of the existence, terms and circumstances
surrounding such a request, so that such other Party may seek, at its
expense, an appropriate protective order and/or waive such notifying
Party's compliance (or its Representatives' compliance, as the case may be)
with the provisions of this Section 7.2(b) and the Confidentiality Agreement
(and if such Party seeks such an order, to provide such cooperation as such
Party shall reasonably request). If disclosure of such information is
required in the opinion of a Party's counsel (or its Representatives'
counsel, as the case may be), who shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
other Party, the receiving Party agrees, and shall cause its Representatives
to, exercise commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, at the other Party's
expense, an order or other reliable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded to such of the disclosed information which the other Party
so designates. In addition, if a protective order is not obtained, such
receiving Party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential
Information which is legally required. In any event, any Party or its
Representatives may disclose Evaluation Material legally required to be
disclosed without liability hereunder. If the transactions contemplated
hereby are not consummated, each Party will promptly return to the other
Party all copies of any Confidential Information, including any
materials prepared by such Party or Buyer's Representatives or Seller's
Representatives, as applicable, incorporating or reflecting Confidential
Information, and an officer of such Party will certify in writing compliance
by such Party with the foregoing.

 

 

(c) Seller agrees that for the thirty (30) month period immediately following
the Closing Date, Seller will, and will cause its Affiliates and Seller's
Representatives to, hold in strict confidence and not disclose to any other
Person all Confidential Business Information. "Confidential
Business Information" means all commercially sensitive information in any
form heretofore or hereafter obtained by Seller to the extent relating to
the Business or the Purchased Assets, whether pertaining to financial
condition, results of operations, methods of operation or otherwise, other
than information which is in the public domain through no violation of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller may
disclose Confidential Business Information to the extent that such
information is required to be disclosed under contracts existing as of the
Closing Date, by Law, or in connection with any proceeding by or before a
Governmental Entity, including any disclosure, financial or otherwise,
required to comply with any rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission
(the "SEC") or Required 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Regulatory Approvals. In the event that Seller believes any such disclosure
is required by Law or in connection with any proceeding by or before a
Governmental Entity, Seller will give Buyer notice thereof as promptly as
possible and will cooperate with Buyer in seeking any protective orders or
other relief as Buyer may determine to be necessary or desirable. In no event
will Seller make or permit to be made any disclosure of Confidential Business
Information other than to the extent Seller determines in good faith to be
required pursuant to SEC rules, or rules governing required disclosure in
other regulatory proceedings, or its legal counsel has advised is required to
comply with the terms of a contract existing as of the Closing Date or
required by Law, or is required in connection with any proceeding by or
before a Governmental Entity, and Seller will use its commercially reasonable
efforts to assure that any Confidential Business Information so disclosed is
protected from further disclosure.

 

 

(d) Buyer agrees that, without Seller's written consent, except as otherwise
provided for in this Agreement, for two years from date of this Agreement,
neither it nor any of its Affiliates will, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit any suppliers, customers and/or any other person with whom Seller has
a business relationship, other than in the ordinary course of business or
(ii) solicit for employment or hire (or cause or seek to cause to leave the
employ of Seller) any person with whom Buyer had contact or who became known
to Buyer as a result of the provision of the Confidential Information and who
is an employee of Seller or any subsidiary thereof; provided, however, that
the foregoing clause (ii) of this Section 7.2(d) shall not preclude Buyer
from hiring individuals contacted through good faith
generalized solicitations for employees through advertisements which utilize
a public medium and are not directly or indirectly targeted at employees of
Seller or any of its Affiliates or from hiring any employee of Seller or its
Affiliates who has been terminated by Seller or its Affiliates prior to
commencement of employment discussions between Buyer and such employee.

 

 

(e) Buyer and Seller hereby terminate the Confidentiality Agreement. The
provisions of Sections 7.2(b) and 7.2(d) will survive for a period of two
years following the earlier of (i) the Closing Date or (ii) the termination
of this Agreement, except that if the Closing occurs, the provisions of
Section 7.2(b) will expire with respect to Buyer and its possession or use of
any information exclusively related to the Purchased Assets and the Business.

 

 

(f) For a period of seven years after the Closing Date, each Party and its
representatives will have reasonable access to all of the books and records
relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets, including the Documents and
all Transferred Employee Records, in the possession of the other Party to the
extent that such access may reasonably be required by such Party in
connection with the Assumed Obligations or the Excluded Liabilities, or other
matters relating to or affected by the operation of the Business and the
Purchased Assets or, in the case of access by Buyer and its representatives,
in connection with the preparation of audited financial statements as of or
for any period ending on a date prior to the Effective Time. Such access will
be afforded by the Party in possession of such books and records upon receipt
of reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours;

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

47  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

provided, however, that (i) any review of books and records will be conducted
in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the operation of the
business of any Party or its Affiliates, (ii) no Party will be required to
take any action which would constitute a waiver of the attorney-client
privilege, and (iii) no Party need supply the other Party with any
information which such Party is under a contractual or other legal obligation
not to supply. The Party exercising the right of access hereunder will be
solely responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by it pursuant to this
Section 7.2(f). If the Party in possession of such books and records desires
to dispose of any such books and records at any time, such Party will, prior
to such disposition, give the other Party a reasonable opportunity at such
other Party's expense to segregate and take possession of such books and
records as such other Party may select. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Section 7.2(f), following the expiration of the seven year
period set forth above, each Party agrees to provide reasonable access to all
of the books and records relating to the Business or the Purchased Assets,
including the Documents and all Transferred Employees Records, in the
possession of the other Party to the extent required to respond to any
proceeding before the NMPRC or the FERC.

 

 

(g) Not later than June 30, 2008, at Buyer's expense, Seller will prepare and
deliver to Buyer an audited statement of income of the Business for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2007. In the course of preparing such
audited statement of income, any judgment or determination as to materiality
shall be made in light of the Business and not in light of the operations of
Seller taken as a whole.

 

 

(h) Not later than 30 days following the date hereof, Seller will prepare and
deliver to Buyer Schedule 7.2(h), which schedule shall include a list of
each Business Agreement under which Seller has incurred Disclosed
Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount in excess of $100,000. Not
later than ten days prior to the Closing, Seller will prepare and deliver to
Buyer a supplemented Schedule 7.2(h) pursuant to Section 7.8, which schedule
shall include a list of each such Business Agreement as of such date.

 

 

7.3 Expenses. Except to the extent specifically provided herein, and
irrespective of whether the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated,
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be borne by the Party incurring such
costs and expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer will be
solely responsible for payment of (i) all filing fees in connection with any
Required Regulatory Approvals, and (ii) all other filing, recording,
transfer, or other fees or charges of any nature payable pursuant to any
provision of Law or any Order or Franchise in connection with the sale,
transfer, and assignment of the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Obligations.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.4 Further Assurances; Procedures with Respect to Certain Agreements and
other Assets.

 

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Parties will use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper, or advisable to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated hereby, including using commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain satisfaction of the conditions precedent to each Party's obligations
hereunder within its reasonable control. Neither Party will, without the
prior written consent of the other Party, take any action which would
reasonably be expected to prevent or materially impede, interfere with or
delay the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the
obtaining of the Required Regulatory Approvals). From time to time on or
after the Closing Date, Seller will, at its own expense, execute and deliver
such documents to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request in order to more
effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. From time to
time after the date hereof, Buyer will at its own expense (i) execute and
deliver such documents to Seller as Seller may reasonably request in order to
more effectively consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii)
without being required to make any payment to any third party or to incur any
economic burden, cooperate reasonably with Seller in connection with Seller
obtaining any releases or discharges of Seller from any of the Assumed
Obligations; provided, however, that if in the course of obtaining any
release or discharge contemplated by clause (ii) of this sentence any third
party shall require any payment or other form of consideration to be made or
delivered by Buyer, Seller agrees to fully reimburse Buyer therefor promptly
following notice thereof.

 

 

(b) Seller has easements, license agreements (including railroad crossing
rights), rights-of-way, and leases for rights-of-way, some of which relate
exclusively to the Business and Purchased Assets (the "Easements")
and others of which relate to both the Business and Purchased Assets and
Seller's Electric Business or other businesses (the "Shared Easements"). At
the Closing, Seller will convey and assign to Buyer, subject to the obtaining
of any necessary consents, (i) by the Assignment of Easements, all Easements,
and (ii) by separate sub-easement, partial assignment or other document,
sufficient rights under the Shared Easements to permit Buyer to use the same,
as presently used by Seller with respect to the Business, on a nonexclusive
basis (the "Shared Easement Rights").

 

 

(c) To the extent that Seller's rights under any asset described in Section
2.1(b), 2.1(c), 2.1(h), 2.1(i), 2.1(l), 2.1(m), 2.1(n), 2.1(p), 2.1(r), 2.1(u)
or 2.1(y) (each, a "Consent Asset") may not be assigned without the consent
of another Person which consent has not been obtained, this Agreement will
not constitute an agreement to assign the same if an attempted assignment
would constitute a breach thereof or be unlawful. Seller will use its
commercially reasonable efforts (without being required to make any payment
to any third party or to incur any economic burden) to obtain any such
required consent as promptly as possible. Upon receipt of the consent
required to transfer a Consent Asset, such Consent Asset shall become a
Purchased Asset and all liabilities and obligations under such Consent Asset
shall constitute Assumed Obligations. Buyer agrees to cooperate with Seller
in its efforts to obtain any such consent (including the submission of such
financial or other information concerning Buyer and the execution of any
assumption agreements or similar documents reasonably requested by a third
party) without being required to make any payment to any third party or to
incur any economic burden (other than the assumption of Seller's obligations
under the applicable Consent Asset). Seller and Buyer agree that if any
consent to an assignment of any such asset is not obtained or if any
attempted assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyer's rights and
obligations under such Consent Asset so that Buyer would not acquire the
benefit of all such rights and obligations, then (i) at the Closing the
Parties will, to the maximum extent permitted by Law and such Consent Asset,
enter into such arrangements with each other on commercially reasonable terms
as are reasonably necessary to provide Buyer with the benefits and
obligations of such Consent Asset from and after the Effective Time, and (ii)
all liabilities and obligations under such Consent Asset shall not constitute
Assumed Obligations.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Buyer and Seller agree that at Closing, Buyer and Seller will enter into
one or more back-to-back Contracts, in customary form, with appropriate
credit terms, pursuant to which Seller will transfer to Buyer, and Buyer will
acquire, the economic benefits and risks of Seller's entire portfolio at the
Effective Time of GSP Financial Hedges, such that under the PGAC the
customers of the Business and the Business remain in the same economic
position immediately following the entry into of such new Contracts as
immediately preceding the Effective Time. Any transaction costs incurred as a
result of such transactions will be borne by the Party that performs the
transaction.

 

 

(e) The agreements set forth on Schedule 7.4(e) (the "Shared
Agreements") will be governed by this Section 7.4(e) and are not Business
Agreements. Seller's rights and obligations under the Shared Agreements, to
the extent such rights and obligations relate to the Business, are described
on Schedule 7.4(e), and are referred to herein as the "Allocated Rights
and Obligations." Unless Seller elects to enter into Other Arrangements,
the Parties agree to cooperate with each other and use commercially
reasonable efforts to enter into agreements with the other party or parties
to each Shared Agreement providing for (i) assignment to and assumption by
Buyer, effective from and after the Effective Time, of the Allocated Rights
and Obligations, and (ii) retention by Seller of all rights and obligations
of Seller under the Shared Agreements other than the Allocated Rights and
Obligations (such agreements set forth in (i) and (ii) being referred to as
"Substitute Arrangements"); provided, that neither Seller nor Buyer will be
obligated to enter into or agree to any such Substitute Arrangements unless
such Substitute Arrangements have the effect of transferring to Buyer the
Allocated Rights and Obligations (and reserving to Seller the rights and
obligations which are not Allocated Rights and Obligations) on a fair and
equitable basis, as determined in the reasonable discretion of Seller and
Buyer. In connection with the foregoing, the Parties agree, as reasonably
requested, to submit such financial or other information concerning
themselves, and to execute such assumption agreements or similar documents
reasonably requested by a third party; provided, that neither Party will be
required to make any payment to any third party or to incur any economic
burden (other than the assumption of the Allocated Rights and Obligations by
Buyer, and the retention of the other rights and obligations under the Shared
Agreements by Seller). In the event that (x) the Parties are unable to enter
into Substitute Arrangements with respect to a Shared Agreement in accordance
with the foregoing, or (y) Seller notifies Buyer that it elects not to pursue
Substitute Arrangements with respect to such Shared Agreement, then in either
case at the Closing the Parties will, to the maximum extent permitted by Law
and such Shared Agreement, enter into such arrangements with each other on
commercially reasonable terms as are reasonably necessary to provide Buyer
with the benefits and obligations of the Allocated Rights and Obligations
under such Shared Agreement, including pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement, with Seller retaining the other benefits and obligations under
such Shared Agreement from and after the Effective Time (the
"Other Arrangements"). In the event the entry into any
Substitute Arrangement or Other Arrangement contemplated by this Section
7.4(e) gives rise to any filing, notice, reporting or any other obligation of
Buyer or Seller, including any obligation to appear before, make application
or provide information, to the NMPRC or any other regulatory entity
exercising jurisdiction over Seller or the Business (a "Regulatory
Entity"), Buyer and Seller will use their commercially reasonable efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper, or advisable to satisfy any such obligation.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) Seller from time to time provides collateral or other security to certain
other Persons in connection with the Business pursuant to certain Business
Agreements and Shared Agreements. Seller and Buyer agree to use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such collateral or other security to be returned
to Seller at the Closing (including in the case of a letter of credit a
return of the letter of credit to Seller), or released (in the case of other
credit support previously provided by Seller) at the Closing. In the event
that such collateral or other security is not returned to Seller or otherwise
released at the Closing, Buyer will (i) pay to Seller an amount equal to any
cash collateral posted by Seller; and (ii) in the case of a letter of credit,
provide to Seller a back-up letter of credit in the same amount and for a
period expiring no earlier than 10 days following the expiration of the
letter of credit previously provided by Seller. Buyer agrees to provide
substitute collateral and other security with respect to such Business
Agreements and Shared Agreements in amounts and on terms of no less quality
than previously provided by Seller. The provisions of this Section 7.4(f) will
apply only to collateral or other security provided in connection with (i)
Business Agreements assigned to Buyer at Closing, and (ii) Shared Agreements
to the extent such collateral or other security is related to the Allocated
Rights and Obligations assigned to Buyer at Closing under such
Shared Agreements.

 

 

(g)  Customers of Seller from time to time provide collateral or other
security to Seller in connection with the Business in the form of surety or
similar agreements (the "Surety Instruments"). Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that to the extent any such Surety Instruments are not related exclusively to
the Business ("Seller Common Surety Instruments") such Seller Common Surety
Instruments are not part of the Purchased Assets. If any Seller Common Surety
Instrument disproportionately secures obligations owed by a customer of the
Electric Business, Seller will upon request of Buyer release such security to
such customer to the extent appropriate to eliminate
such overcollateralization.

 

 

(h) Seller has tower lease and sub-lease agreements, licenses issued by the
FCC, franchise agreements, wireline telecommunications facilities, dark fiber
agreements including Indefeasible Right of Use Agreements, easements and
rights-of-way, and leases for rights-of-way, some of which relate exclusively
to the Business and Purchased Assets (the "Telecommunications
Network Elements") and others of which relate to both the Business and
Purchased Assets and Seller's Electric Business or other businesses (the
"Shared Telecommunications Network Elements"). At the Closing, Seller will
convey and assign to Buyer, subject to the obtaining of any necessary
consents, (i) by assignment or other appropriate document, all
Telecommunications Network Elements, and (ii) by separate sub-lease, sub-
easement, management agreement, private carriage agreement or other
appropriate document, sufficient rights under the Shared Telecommunications
Network Elements to permit Buyer to use the same, as presently used by Seller
with respect to the Business, on a nonexclusive basis for no more than two
(2) years following Closing (the "Shared Telecommunications Network Element
Rights").

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) Following the Closing, each Party will promptly remit to the other any
payments such Party receives that are in satisfaction of any rights or assets
belonging to the other Party.

 

 

7.5 Public Statements. Each Party will consult with the other prior
to issuing, and will consider in good faith any comments by the other to or
in respect of, any public announcement, statement, or other disclosure with
respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except as
may be required by Law or stock exchange rules and provided that any such
public announcement, statement, or other disclosure issued by Buyer will be
subject to Section 7.2(b).

 

 

7.6 Consents and Approvals.

 

 

(a) Seller and Buyer will each file or cause to be filed with the Federal
Trade Commission and the United States Department of Justice, Antitrust
Division any notifications required to be filed under the HSR Act and the
rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Parties will consult and cooperate with each other
as to the appropriate time of filing such notifications and will (i) make
such filings at the agreed upon time, (ii) respond promptly to any requests
for additional information made by either of such agencies, and (iii) use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the waiting periods under the
HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after the date
of such filings.

 

 

(b) Seller and Buyer will cooperate with each other and use commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) promptly prepare and file all necessary
applications, notices, petitions, and filings, execute all agreements and
documents and provide all relevant records and reports to the extent required
by Law or Order or to the extent requested by any Governmental Entity for
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
the Required Regulatory Approvals), (ii) obtain the transfer to Buyer of all
Transferable Permits and Transferable Environmental Permits, and the
reissuance to Buyer of all Permits that are not Transferable Permits and all
Environmental Permits that are not Transferable Environmental Permits, (iii)
obtain the consents, approvals, and authorizations of all Governmental
Entities to the extent required by Law or Order for consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Required
Regulatory Approvals), and (iv) obtain all consents, approvals,
and authorizations of all other Persons to the extent necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required by the terms of
any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, deed of trust, license, franchise,
permit, concession, contract, lease, or other instrument to which Seller or
Buyer is a party or by which either of them is bound. Seller and Buyer each
will have the right to review in advance all characterizations of the
information relating to it or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
which appear in any filing made by the other in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) In the course of obtaining, renewing or securing Franchises as may be
deemed necessary by the Parties in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein, (i) Buyer shall not be required to take any action, and
Seller shall not take or cause to be taken or agree to commit Buyer to take
any action, in any such case individually or in the aggregate which would (A)
materially impair the ability of Buyer to operate the Business immediately
following Closing in a manner substantially similar to that prevailing with
respect to the Business immediately prior to the date hereof or (B) impose
any additional substantially burdensome condition on Buyer and (ii) Seller
shall not be required to take any action, and Buyer shall not take or cause
to be taken or agree to commit Seller to take any action, in any such case
individually or in the aggregate which would (A) materially impair the
ability of Seller to operate the Electric Business immediately following
Closing in a manner substantially similar to that prevailing with respect to
the Electric Business immediately prior to the date hereof or (B) impose any
additional substantially burdensome condition on Seller. Any failure or
refusal by a Governmental Entity to renew or award any such Franchise will
not constitute a breach of this Agreement by either Party.

 

 

(d) In connection with applications and other filings for the Required
Regulatory Approvals, and the prosecution of any pending regulatory
proceedings material to the Business, Buyer and Seller shall jointly, and on
an equal basis, coordinate the overall development of the positions to be
taken and the regulatory actions to be requested in such applications and
filings for approval of the sale by Seller and the purchase by Buyer of the
Purchased Assets and the Business, of all other matters contemplated by this
Agreement which require regulatory approval and of all other regulatory
matters incidental thereto which are to be addressed in such applications and
filings.

 

 

(e) In connection with any communications, meetings, or other contacts,
formal or informal, oral or written, with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or any such declaration,
filing, registration, notice, authorization, consent, or approval, each Party
agrees: (i) to inform the other in advance of any such communication,
meeting, or other contact which such Party proposes or intends to make,
including the subject matter, contents, intended agenda, and other aspects of
any of the foregoing; (ii) to consult and cooperate with the other Party, and
to take into account the comments of such other Party in connection with any
of the matters covered by Section 7.6(e)(i); (iii) to arrange for
representatives of the other Party to participate to the maximum
extent possible in any such communications, meetings, or other contacts; (iv)
to notify the other Party of any oral communications with any Governmental
Entity relating to any of the foregoing; and (v) to provide the other Party
with copies of all written communications with any Governmental Entity
relating to any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 7.6 will apply to or restrict communications or other actions by
Seller with or with regard to Governmental Entities in connection with (x)
the Purchased Assets or the Business in the ordinary course of business, or
(y) the transactions contemplated by Section 7.9.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.7 Transfer Taxes. All transfer, documentary, stamp, registration,
gross receipts, compensating, sales and use Taxes, including real property
conveyance Taxes, incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby will be paid by Buyer, and Buyer, at its own
expense, will file, to the extent required by applicable Law, all necessary
Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such transfer or
sales and use Taxes, and, if required by applicable Law, Seller will join in
the execution of any such Tax Returns or other documentation.

 

 

7.8 Supplements to Schedules. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller may
supplement or amend the Schedules furnished by it under this Agreement except
for Schedule 7.1; provided, however, that the new disclosures made in any
supplement shall not have any effect on the determination of the satisfaction
of the conditions to Closing under Article VIII or any of Buyer's rights and
claims to indemnification under Article IX.

 

 

7.9 Employees and Employee Benefits.

 

 

(a) From and after the Effective Time, with respect to the Transferred
Employees, Buyer will recognize the union locals set forth on Schedule 7.9(a)
(the "Locals") as the exclusive bargaining representatives of the bargaining
units set forth on Schedule 7.9(a) that include Transferred Employees. Buyer
will assume the Collective Bargaining Agreements, with respect to the
Transferred Employees, at Closing and will provide to the Transferred
Employees covered thereby benefits consistent with the terms thereof in
addition to the other benefits that Buyer is obligated to provide to
Transferred Employees under this Section 7.9.

 

 

(b) Buyer shall make offers of employment to Business Employees and
Designated Employees in accordance with the following provisions:

 

 

(i) Buyer agrees to provide written offers of employment to the Business
Employees no later than 30 Business Days prior to the Closing Date and to
hire the Business Employees who wish to accept the offers of employment. All
offers of employment will be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing and
will remain open for a period expiring no earlier than 20 Business Days prior
to the Closing Date.

 

 

(ii) Buyer agrees to provide written offers of employment to the Designated
Employees in accordance with Section 5(b) of the Transition Services
Agreement. An offer of employment by Buyer pursuant to this Section
7.9(b)(ii) shall not be considered to be a violation of Section 7.2(c).

 

 

(iii) Any Business Employees or Designated Employees who accept such offers
of employment shall be considered to be "Transferred Employees."

 

 

(c) Buyer shall provide to Seller copies of all written offers of employment
made to the Business Employees within five days of providing such written
offers to the Business Employees. At least seven days prior to the Effective
Time, Buyer shall notify Seller in writing of the Business Employees who have
accepted offers of employment with Buyer.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

54  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(d) Buyer agrees to employ the Transferred Employees on terms that are (i)
substantially comparable in the aggregate to the Transferred Employees to
their current employment terms with respect to salary, annual bonus
opportunity, base hours, and vacation (excluding for this purpose any
benefits, enhancements or payments that are contingent upon a change in
control or similar transaction) and (ii) substantially comparable in the
aggregate with respect to benefits provided to the Transferred Employees
(including medical, retirement, and severance benefits and excluding for this
purpose any benefits, enhancements or payments that are contingent upon a
change in control or similar transaction and the value of equity incentives)
pursuant to Benefit Plans of Seller in effect as of the date hereof. Except
as provided in Section 7.9(f), Buyer's obligations pursuant to this Section
7.9(d) shall continue for a period of one year following the Effective Time.

 

 

(e) From and after the Transfer Date, the employment of the Transferred
Employees with Seller or Seller's Affiliates will terminate and the
Transferred Employees will not accrue any additional benefits under any
Benefit Plan. Except as provided in Section 7.9(f), Buyer shall not assume
any of the Benefit Plans and shall have no obligations or liabilities with
respect to the Benefit Plans. Seller or Seller's Affiliates will pay to each
Transferred Employee all salary or other compensation or employment benefits
(including any accrued paid-time off) which has accrued to such Transferred
Employee prior to the Transfer Date. Buyer or Buyer's affiliates will pay to
each Transferred Employee all salary or other compensation or employment
benefits which accrue to such Transferred Employee from and after the
Transfer Date, at such times as provided under the terms of the applicable
compensation or benefit programs.

 

 

(f) Buyer hereby assumes all liabilities, obligations, and responsibilities
of Seller and Seller's Affiliates to provide post-retirement health benefits
under the Benefit Plans set forth on Schedule 7.9(f) ("Post-Retirement
Welfare Benefits") to any Grandfathered Active Employee or his or her spouse
or other eligible dependents. For this purpose a "Grandfathered
Active Employee" is any Transferred Employee who, as of the Transfer
Date, satisfied the eligibility requirements for Post-Retirement Welfare
Benefits under the applicable Benefit Plan sponsored by Seller.
Included within Schedule 7.9(f) is a list of all Business Employees who are
currently eligible for Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits. At Closing, Seller
will provide Buyer with an updated Schedule 7.9(f) that lists the Business
Employees and Designated Employees who as of Closing are eligible for Post-
Retirement Welfare Benefits. Seller, Seller's Affiliates and the Benefit
Plans shall not have any liability on or after the Transfer Date for any
Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits of any Grandfathered Active Employee or
his or her spouse or other eligible dependents. Prior to the Closing Date,
Buyer shall establish a new welfare benefit plan or amend an existing welfare
benefit plan (in either case the "Successor Retiree Welfare Plan") which
shall expressly assume all of the liabilities, obligations, and
responsibilities of Seller, Seller's Affiliates and any Benefit Plan
to provide Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits to Grandfathered Active Employees
and their spouses and eligible dependents. Such liabilities, obligations and
responsibilities will be automatically transferred to the Successor
Retiree Welfare Plan as of the Transfer Date of each Grandfathered
Active Employee.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

55  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) The Successor Retiree Welfare Plan will recognize all Grandfathered
Active Employee's service with Seller or Seller's Affiliates prior to the
Transfer Date of the Grandfathered Active Employee for purposes of
determining Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits. The Successor Retiree Welfare
Plan also shall provide the Grandfathered Active Employees and their spouses
and eligible dependents with Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits that are
comparable to, or more favorable, in the aggregate than those Post-Retirement
Welfare Benefits provided to such Grandfathered Active Employees and their
spouses and eligible dependents by Seller and the Benefit Plans immediately
prior to the Closing Date, under cost-sharing structures that are at least as
favorable to the Grandfathered Active Employees as the cost-sharing
structures in effect from time to time under the Benefit Plans of Seller from
which the benefit obligations were assumed by the Successor Retiree Welfare
Plan.

 

 

(ii)  Effective as of the Closing Date and for a period continuing for at
least five years thereafter (the "Benefit Continuation Period"), Buyer will
continue the Successor Retiree Welfare Plan in compliance with the provisions
of Section 7.9(f)(i).

 

 

(iii) Following the Benefit Continuation Period, Buyer may amend or terminate
the Successor Retiree Welfare Plan and the Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits
for the Grandfathered Active Employees and their spouses and eligible
dependents; provided, however, that Seller must continue to provide Post-
Retirement Welfare Benefits to the Grandfathered Active Employees until the
Allocated Retiree Medical Assets transferred to Buyer's VEBA have been
exhausted.

 

 

(iv) On or prior to the Closing Date, Buyer will provide evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller that Buyer has established the Successor Retiree
Welfare Plan and is maintaining one or more trusts meeting the requirements
of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code (the "Buyer's VEBA").

 

 

(v) In accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.9(f)(v), Seller will
cause one or more of the trusts listed on Schedule 7.9(f) (collectively,
"Seller's VEBA") to transfer cash (or other assets as the Parties mutually
agree) to the Buyer's VEBA. The transfers will occur on the two dates
specified in Section 7.9(f)(vii). Each transfer will be equal to the
Allocated Retiree Medical Assets determined as of the last Business Day of
the month prior to the date of the transfer. The "Allocated Retiree
Medical Assets" as of either date shall equal the product of (a) the total
value of the retiree medical assets then held in trusts established by Seller
to fund its retiree medical liability for Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits
less assets set aside or otherwise allocated to fund the retiree medical
liability for Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits for current retirees, times
(b) a fraction, the numerator of which is Seller's retiree medical liability
for Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits for the Grandfathered Active Employees
and their spouses and eligible dependents and the denominator of which is
Seller's retiree medical liability for Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits for
all active participant's (including the Grandfathered Active Employees) and
their spouses and eligible 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

56  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

dependents (determined prior to the transfer). The liabilities will
be determined as of the last Business Day of the month prior to the transfer
by an actuary selected by Seller and reasonably acceptable to Buyer and in a
manner, and on the basis of actuarial and other assumptions, consistent with
those used in the most recent actuarial report for Seller's retiree medical
liability for Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits that is provided to Buyer.
Buyer and Seller agree that Watson Wyatt or any of its Affiliates shall
perform the actuarial services contemplated by this Section 7.9(f)(v).
In calculating the Allocated Retiree Medical Assets for the initial transfer,
the only Transferred Employees who will be considered to be Grandfathered
Active Employees are those with Transfer Dates occurring on or before the
later of the date on which the calculation is being made or the Effective
Time. In calculating the Allocated Retiree Medical Assets for the second
transfer, the only Transferred Employees who will be considered to be
Grandfathered Active Employees are those with Transfer Dates occurring after
the date as of which the initial transfer is calculated and on or before the
date as of which the second transfer is calculated. For purposes of
calculating the Allocated Retiree Medical Assets for the second transfer, the
liabilities included in the numerator of the fraction used in calculating the
amount of the initial transfer will be disregarded both in the numerator and
the denominator of the fraction. If Seller concludes, in the exercise of its
discretion, that it may not or should not transfer all or any portion of the
Allocated Retiree Medical Assets from Seller's VEBA to Buyer's VEBA, Seller
may elect to make a cash payment to Buyer equal to the difference between the
Allocated Retiree Medical Assets and the amount transferred Buyer's VEBA.

 

 

(vi) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller will provide Buyer with a copy
of the Internal Revenue Service letter for each of the trusts listed Schedule
7.9(f) indicating that such trust is exempt from tax pursuant to the
requirements of Section 501(c)(9) of the Code.

 

 

(vii) The initial transfer to Buyer's VEBA will occur as soon as
administratively practicable after both: (a) Seller either (i) receives a
ruling from the Internal Revenue Service that the transfer of the Allocated
Retiree Medical Assets to Buyer's VEBA will not cause Seller's VEBA to fail
to qualify under Section 501(c)(9) of the Code and will not result in taxable
income or an excise Tax to Seller or (ii) notifies Buyer in writing that
Seller has determined not to apply for such a ruling (and Buyer agrees that
no ruling should be required), and (b) Buyer provides evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller that Buyer's VEBA satisfies the requirements of
Section 501(c)(9) of the Code. The second transfer will occur on the first
anniversary of the first transfer or on such other date as may be mutually
agreed upon by Seller and Buyer.

 

 

(viii) The amounts transferred to Buyer's VEBA will be dedicated by Buyer
exclusively for the funding of Post-Retirement Welfare Benefits for the
Grandfathered Active Employees and their spouses and eligible dependents.

 

 

(ix) Prior to the Closing, Seller will make contributions to and
distributions from Seller's VEBA and Seller's other retiree medical funding
arrangements from time to time in accordance with Seller's normal policies
and past practice determined by Seller in the exercise of its reasonable
discretion.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

57  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(g) With respect to any group health plan or program of Buyer or Buyer's
Affiliates in which a Transferred Employee becomes eligible to participate as
of the Transfer Date or thereafter, Buyer shall take all commercially
reasonable steps to ensure that such Transferred Employee shall (i) receive
credit for any deductibles, co-pays or other out-of-pocket expenses paid
under the corresponding group health plan or program of Seller or Seller's
Affiliates, and (ii) not be subject to any pre-existing condition limitations
to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitation did not apply to
such Transferred Employee under the corresponding group health plan or
program of Seller or Seller's Affiliates.

 

 

(h) Buyer and Buyer's Affiliates shall credit each Transferred Employee with
the same number of years of service, including partial years of service, as
the Transferred Employee is credited with by Seller or Seller's Affiliates
(or any other employer service with which was previously recognized by
Seller), under the applicable benefit plan sponsored by Buyer or
Buyer's Affiliate. The service credit required by this Section 7.9(h)
shall apply for all purposes under any health, retiree medical, severance,
vacation, sick or any similar paid-time off program or other employee welfare
benefit plan (as such term is defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) of Buyer or
Buyer's Affiliates and for purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting,
eligibility for a particular form or type of benefit, and benefit accrual
(except for benefit accrual under a defined benefit pension plan) under any
pension, retirement, savings, or other employee pension benefit plan (as such
term is defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) of Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates.

 

 

(i) Claims of Transferred Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and
dependents for medical, dental, prescription drug, life insurance, and/or
other welfare benefits (except workers' compensation or long-term disability
benefits) that are incurred before the Transfer Date shall be the
responsibility of Seller and Seller's Affiliates. Claims of Transferred
Employees and their eligible beneficiaries and dependents for medical,
dental, prescription drug, life insurance, and/or other welfare benefits
(except workers' compensation or long-term disability benefits) that are
incurred on or after the Transfer Date shall be the responsibility of Buyer
and Buyer's Affiliates. For purposes of the preceding provisions of this
Section 7.9(i), a medical/dental claim shall be considered incurred on the
date when the medical/dental services are rendered or medical/dental supplies
are provided, and not when the condition arose or when the course of
treatment began.

 

 

(j) Claims of Transferred Employees and their eligible dependents for health
care and dependent care flexible spending account benefits submitted after
the Transfer Date for expenses incurred by Transferred Employees prior to the
Transfer Date shall be reimbursed by Seller's or Seller's Affiliates health
care and dependent care flexible spending account plan to the extent
permitted in accordance with the terms of such plan. Claims of Transferred
Employees and their eligible dependents for health care and dependent care
flexible spending account benefits submitted after the Transfer Date for
expenses incurred by Transferred Employees subsequent to the Transfer Date
shall be reimbursed by Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates health care and dependent
care flexible spending account plan to the extent permitted in accordance
with the terms of such plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

58  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(k) Claims for workers' compensation or long-term disability benefits arising
out of occurrences prior to the Transfer Date shall be the responsibility of
Seller and Seller's Affiliates. Claims for workers' compensation or long-
term disability benefits for Transferred Employees arising out of occurrences
on or subsequent to the Transfer Date shall be the responsibility of Buyer
and Buyer's Affiliates.

 

 

(l) Transferred Employees shall be permitted to rollover any account balances
and associated loans and promissory notes they may have under the PNM
Resources, Inc. Retirement Savings Plan to a Section 401(k) Plan sponsored by
Buyer or Buyer's Affiliates.

 

 

(m) If within the one year period following the Transfer Date, (i) a
Transferred Employee voluntarily terminates his or her employment with Buyer
or Buyer's Affiliates within 30 days after the date upon which the
Transferred Employee is notified that the principal place of the Transferred
Employee's employment will be 50 miles or more from the location of such
Transferred Employee's principal place of employment immediately prior to the
Transfer Date such that the commute of such Transferred Employee is
materially increased, or (ii) the employment of a Transferred Employee is
terminated for a reason other than "Cause" (as that term is defined in the
PNM Resources, Inc. Non-Union Severance Pay Plan as of the Transfer Date),
then Buyer shall provide such terminated Transferred Employee with severance
payments and benefits at least equal to the severance payments and benefits
that the Transferred Employee would have been entitled to receive as of the
Transfer Date if the terminated Transferred Employee had satisfied all of the
requirements to receive severance benefits under the PNM Resources, Inc. Non-
Union Severance Pay Plan. Whether the terminated Transferred Employee's
severance payments and benefits would have been equal to the
"Regular Severance Benefits" or the "Enhanced Severance Benefits" (as those
terms are defined in the PNM Resources, Inc. Non-Union Severance Pay Plan)
provided by the PNM Resources, Inc. Non-Union Severance Pay Plan will depend
on whether the terminated Transferred Employee signs a release that is
reasonably acceptable to Buyer.

 

 

(n) Buyer expressly agrees that it assumes all obligations to provide any
required notice under the WARN Act, or other applicable Laws, and to pay all
severance payments, damages for wrongful dismissal and related costs, with
respect to the termination of any Transferred Employee employed by Buyer or
Buyer's Affiliates that occurs on or after the Closing Date.

 

 

(o) Seller and Seller's Affiliates shall be responsible for compliance with
and liability under Section 4980B of the Code and Sections 601 through 608 of
ERISA ("COBRA") with respect to any COBRA-qualifying events that occur on or
prior to the Closing Date to the extent mandated by COBRA with respect to the
Business Employees, Designated Employees, Seller's former employees and the
dependents of both of the foregoing. Buyer shall be responsible for
compliance with and liability under COBRA with respect to any COBRA-
qualifying events that occur after the Transfer Date with respect to the
Transferred Employees, and with respect to the dependents of such Transferred
Employees.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

59  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(p) Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Seller or Seller's Affiliates,
in its sole discretion, from implementing any retention or other benefit
programs, at Seller's cost, for the benefit of any group of Business
Employees or any individuals that it deems appropriate.

 

 

(q) During the period from the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date,
Seller will work in good faith with Buyer, at Buyer's cost, to develop
retention or other benefit programs that are reasonably requested by Buyer.
Any such retention and other benefit programs implemented shall not be
considered to be in effect for any purpose under any other provision of this
Agreement, including but not limited to, the representations in Article V.

 

 

(r) Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to (i) give rise to any
rights, claims, benefits or causes of action to any Business Employee or
Designated Employee or (ii) prevent, restrict or limit Buyer or Seller or
their Affiliates from terminating the employment of any Business Employee or
Designated Employee or modifying or terminating its pension or other benefit
plans, programs or policies from time to time as they may deem appropriate.

 

 

7.10 Eminent Domain; Casualty Loss.

 

 

(a) If, before the Closing Date, any of the Purchased Assets are taken by
eminent domain or condemnation, or are the subject of a pending or, to
Seller's Knowledge, contemplated taking which has not been consummated,
Seller will (i) notify Buyer in writing of such fact and (ii) at the Closing
assign to Buyer all of Seller's right, title, and interest in and to any
proceeds or payments received, or to be received, in compensation for such
taking.

 

 

(b) If, before the Closing Date, all or any portion of the Purchased Assets
are damaged or destroyed by fire or other casualty, Seller will notify Buyer
in writing of such fact and, at the Closing (i) pay to Buyer all proceeds
from third-party insurers received by, and assign all of Seller's right,
title, and interest in and to any such insurance proceeds received, or to be
received, in compensation for such damage or destruction and (ii) reimburse
Buyer for any deductible or self-insured retention amount in connection with
such damage or destruction under any such insurance policy; provided,
however, that the amounts to be paid by Seller to Buyer under clause (i)
above shall be reduced by the amount of proceeds received by Seller and
applied with the consent of Buyer to the repair or restoration of the
applicable Purchased Asset and the amounts to be reimbursed by Seller under
clause (ii) above shall be reduced by the amounts incurred by Seller in
connection any such repair or restoration and not paid or reimbursed by such
insurance.

 

 

7.11 Transitional Use of Signage and Other Materials Incorporating Seller's
Name or other Logos. Buyer acknowledges that Seller has the absolute
and exclusive proprietary right to the Seller Marks, all rights to which and
the goodwill represented thereby and pertaining thereto are being retained
by Seller, and that it will have no ongoing claim or rights in or to the
Seller Marks, other than the right to use the Seller Marks for 180 days
following the date hereof. Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, Buyer will not use or permit the use of any Seller Marks,
and within 180 days following the Closing Date, Buyer will remove or cause
the removal the Seller Marks from all signage or other items relating to or
used in the Business or the Purchased Assets; provided, however, that,
Buyer will not be required to complete the removal of Seller Marks from gas
line markers until the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date. Except
as set forth in this Section 7.11, from and after the Closing Date neither
Buyer nor any of its Affiliates will utilize the name "Public Service Company
of New Mexico" or any Seller Marks in the conduct of the Business.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

60  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.12 Litigation and Regulatory Support. In the event and for so long as
either Party is actively contesting or defending against any third-party
Claim in connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this
Agreement or (ii) any fact, situation, circumstance, status, condition,
activity, practice, plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to
act, or transaction on or prior to the Closing Date involving Seller (or
Buyer, as successor in interest to the Business and the Purchased Assets),
the other Party will cooperate with the contesting or defending Party and its
counsel in the contest or defense, make available its personnel, and provide
such testimony and access to its books and records as is reasonably necessary
in connection with the contest or defense, all at the sole cost and expense
of the contesting or defending Party (unless the contesting or defending
Party is entitled to indemnification therefor under Article IX). In
addition, in the event that Buyer is involved in any proceeding before the
NMPRC or the FERC (or any appeal or other judicial proceeding relating
thereto) relating to any obligations (including payment obligations) for
which Seller could be liable or responsible under this Agreement, Buyer
agrees to consult with Seller concerning such obligations (including the
positions taken with respect thereto), to allow Seller to participate in the
proceeding to the extent necessary to protect or defend Seller's interests,
and to allow Seller, at Seller's cost but if necessary in Buyer's name, to
exhaust any appeals available to challenge any appealable decision that is
adverse to Seller's interests in respect of such obligation. The Parties
expressly agree that the types of proceedings to which the obligations in the
foregoing sentence relate include purchased gas adjustment or gas cost
recovery proceedings as well as any other proceedings involving rates charged
to customers of the Business. The obligations under this Section 7.12
shall survive the Closing.

 

 

7.13 Notification of Customers. As soon as practicable following the
Closing, Seller and Buyer will cause to be sent to customers of the Business
a notice of the transfer of the customers from Seller to Buyer (the
"Customer Notification"). The Customer Notification will contain
such information as is required by Law and approved by Buyer and Seller,
which approval will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

7.14 Title Insurance, Surveys, Estoppel Certificates, and Non-Disturbance
Agreements. At Buyer's option and at Buyer's sole cost and expense, Buyer may
obtain (i) title insurance policies in respect of the Owned Real Property,
insuring title to the applicable Owned Real Property as vested in Buyer (free
and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances), and in
form, substance, and amount reasonably satisfactory to Buyer (and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, with all requirements satisfied or
waived, with all exceptions deleted, and with all endorsements thereto, to
the extent reasonably desired by Buyer); (ii) all surveys desired by Buyer in
respect of the Owned Real Property, in form and

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

61  

 

 

 

 

 

 

substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer; and (iii) all estoppel
certificates and non-disturbance agreements desired by Buyer in respect of
any Real Property Leases, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer and to the parties providing such certificates and agreements. Seller
agrees to cooperate as reasonably requested by Buyer (and at Buyer's expense)
in its efforts to obtain any such items; provided, that Seller shall not be
required to make any payment to any third party or incur any economic burden
in connection therewith, and provided, further, that Buyer's obtaining any
such item shall not be a requirement of or a condition to the Closing. In
addition, with respect to Seller's cooperation with Buyer's reasonable
requests to obtain title insurance under subsection (i) above, Seller, except
to the extent required to satisfy the Closing condition set forth in Section
8.2(f) and as provided by Section 4.3(p), shall not be required to cure any
purported defects, cause any exceptions to be deleted, or provide any
indemnities, or representations to any title company issuing such title
insurance.

 

 

7.15 Central or Shared Functions for Transition Period. Seller and Buyer
acknowledge that the Business is currently dependent upon the Central or
Shared Functions. Seller and Buyer also acknowledge that the
Purchased Assets will not include the assets necessary for Buyer to perform
such functions and that the Designated Employees are not included in the
group identified as the "Business Employees."

 

 

7.16 Post-Closing Insurance. If Seller has any policies of general,
excess, umbrella, environmental impairment or pollution insurance with third-
party insurance providers (the "Seller Insurance Policies") that provide
coverage in respect of the Assumed Environmental Liabilities, Seller will
indemnify Buyer for any Losses incurred by Buyer in respect of the Assumed
Environmental Liabilities; provided, however, that such indemnification
obligation will be limited to (i) the amount of proceeds actually received by
Seller after the Effective Time under the Seller Insurance Policies in
respect of the Assumed Environmental Liabilities, less (ii)
Seller's reasonable costs incurred in recovering such proceeds, to the extent
allocated by Seller in a fair and equitable manner and otherwise in
accordance with Seller's historical practices to the receipt of the proceeds
described in clause (i) of this Section. Seller will use commercially
reasonable efforts to maximize the recovery of proceeds after the Effective
Time in respect of the Assumed Environmental Liabilities under the Seller
Insurance Policies; provided, however, that Seller will not be liable for the
failure to recover any specific amount of proceeds, and Seller will be under
no obligation to keep any of the Seller Insurance Policies in effect
following Closing.

 

 

7.17 Financing.

 

 

(a) Seller shall, and shall cause its Representatives to, cooperate as
reasonably requested by Buyer and take such actions as Buyer may reasonably
request in connection with the procurement and consummation of the financing

conditions contemplated in the Equity Commitment Letter, Buyer shall arrange
to obtain any such portion from alternative sources on comparable or more
favorable terms to Buyer. Buyer shall give Seller prompt notice upon becoming
aware of any breach by any party of the Equity Commitment Letter or Debt
Commitment Letter or any purported termination of the Equity Commitment
Letter or Debt Commitment Letter. Buyer shall not permit any material
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Equity Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification,
waiver or remedy reduces the aggregate amount of the funds to be provided
under the Equity Commitment Letter or is adverse to the interests of Seller
in any other respect.

position in any Tax Return, or reach any settlement or agreement on audit,
which is in any manner inconsistent with any position taken by Seller in any
filing, settlement or agreement made by Seller on or prior to the Closing
Date and such inconsistent position (i) requires the payment by Buyer of,
more Tax than would have been required to be paid had such position not been
taken or such settlement or agreement not been reached, (ii) affects the
determination of useful life, basis or method of depreciation, amortization
or accounting of any of the Purchased Assets, Assumed Obligations or any of

ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

 

9.1 Survival of Representations and Warranties. The representations and
warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement will survive the
Closing and will expire April 15, 2010, except that the representations and
warranties in Section 5.14 will survive the Closing and will expire upon the
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

66  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.2 Indemnification.

 

 

(a) Subject to Section 9.1 and Section 9.4, from and after the Closing,
Seller will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Buyer and its officers,
directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (and the officers, directors,
employees and agents of such Affiliates (each, a "Buyer Indemnitee") from and
against any and all Claims and Losses (each, an "Indemnifiable
Loss"), asserted against or suffered by any Buyer Indemnitee relating to,
resulting from, or arising out of (i) any breach by Seller of any covenant or
agreement of Seller contained in this Agreement, (ii) any breach by Seller of
the representations and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement, or
(iii) the Excluded Liabilities.

 

 

(b) Subject to Section 9.1 and Section 9.4, from and after the Closing,
Buyer will indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Seller and its officers,
directors, employees, agents and Affiliates (and the officers, directors,
employees and agents of such Affiliates, (each, a "Seller Indemnitee") from
and against any and all Indemnifiable Losses asserted against or suffered by
any Seller Indemnitee relating to, resulting from, or arising out of (i)
any breach by Buyer of any covenant or agreement of Buyer contained in
this Agreement, (ii) any breach by Buyer of the representations and
warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement, (iii) the Assumed
Obligations, or (iv) any and all liabilities and obligations (other than the
Excluded Liabilities) to the extent related to the ownership and operation of
the Purchased Assets and the Business from and after the Effective Time.

 

 

(c) Any Person entitled to receive indemnification under this Agreement (an
"Indemnitee") having a claim under these indemnification provisions will use
commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses, including
commercially reasonable efforts to recover all Losses from insurers of such
Indemnitee under applicable insurance policies so as to reduce the amount of
any Indemnifiable Loss hereunder, and will not take any action specifically
excluding from any of its insurance policies any Indemnifiable Losses if
Losses of such type are otherwise covered by such policies. The amount of any
Indemnifiable Loss will be reduced to the extent that Indemnitee receives any
insurance proceeds with respect to an Indemnifiable Loss.

 

 

9.3 Indemnification Procedures.

 

 

(a) Third Party Claims. If an Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion
or commencement of any Claim by any Person who is neither a Party to this
Agreement nor an Affiliate of a Party to this Agreement (a "Third Party
Claim") for which the Indemnitee claims a right to indemnification hereunder
from the other Party (the "Indemnifying Party"), the Indemnitee will
promptly give written notice of such Third Party Claim to the Indemnifying
Party. Such notice will describe the nature of the Third Party Claim in
reasonable detail and will indicate the estimated amount, to the extent
practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that the Indemnitee claims it has
sustained or may sustain as a result of such Third Party Claim. The
Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense, will have the right, upon
written notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the defense of the Third Party
Claim while reserving its right to contest the issue of whether it is liable
to the Indemnitee for any indemnification hereunder with respect to such
Third Party Claim.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

67  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Defense of Third Party Claims. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense of a Third Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.3(a), the Indemnifying
Party will appoint counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnitee for the
defense of such Third Party Claim, will diligently pursue such defense, and
will keep the Indemnitee reasonably informed with respect to such defense.
The Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel,
including permitting reasonable access to books, records, and personnel, in
connection with the defense of any Third Party Claim (provided, that any out-
of-pocket costs incurred by the Indemnitee in providing such
cooperation shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnitee will
have the right to participate in such defense, including appointing separate
counsel, but the costs of such participation shall be borne solely by
the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party will have full authority,
in consultation with the Indemnitee, to make all decisions and determine
all actions to be taken with respect to the defense and settlement of the
Third Party Claim, including the right to pay, compromise, settle, or
otherwise dispose of such Third Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party's
expense; provided, that any such settlement will be subject to the prior
consent of the Indemnitee, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim, which the
Indemnifying Party desires to accept and which acceptance requires the
consent of the Indemnitee pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, the
Indemnifying Party will give written notice to the Indemnitee to that effect.
If the Indemnitee fails to consent to such firm offer within 10 days after
its receipt of such notice, and such firm offer involves only the payment of
money, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party with respect to such
Third Party Claim will be the amount of such settlement offer, plus
reasonable costs and expenses paid or incurred by the Indemnitee up to the
date of such notice for which the Indemnifying Party is otherwise liable. In
no event will the Indemnifying Party have authority to agree to any relief
binding on the Indemnitee other than the payment of money damages by the
Indemnifying Party unless agreed to by the Indemnitee, which agreement will
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

 

 

(c) Failure of Indemnifying Party to Assume Defense. If the Indemnifying
Party does not assume the defense of a Third Party Claim in accordance with
the terms hereof within 20 Business Days after the receipt of notice thereof,
the Indemnitee may elect to defend against the Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable expenses of such defense
to the extent the Indemnifying Party is otherwise obligated hereunder to
indemnify Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim.

 

 

(d) Direct Losses. Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable
Loss which does not result from a Third Party Claim (a "Direct Loss") will
be asserted by giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof,
stating the nature of such Loss in reasonable detail and indicating the
estimated amount, if practicable. The Indemnifying Party will have a period
of 20 Business Days within which to respond to such claim of a Direct Loss.
If the Indemnifying Party rejects such claim, or does not respond within such
period, the Indemnitee may seek enforcement of its rights to indemnification
under this Agreement. Any failure by the Indemnifying Party to respond under
this Section 9.3(d) will not constitute an admission by the Indemnifying
Party with respect to the claim asserted.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

68  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(e) If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time subsequent to the
making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery,
settlement, or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or
pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement, or payment by or against any
other Person, the amount of such reduction, less any costs, expenses, or
premiums incurred in connection therewith, will promptly be repaid by the
Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any indemnity payment, the
Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such indemnity payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party in respect
of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the indemnity payment relates; provided,
however, that (i) the Indemnifying Party is then in compliance with its
obligations under this Agreement in respect of such Indemnifiable Loss and
(ii) until the Indemnitee recovers full payment of its Indemnifiable Loss,
any and all claims of the Indemnifying Party against any such third party on
account of said indemnity payment will be subordinated to the Indemnitee's
rights against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of
any other provision hereof, the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party will
duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence
and perfect the above described subrogation and subordination rights, and
otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims at the direction of the
Indemnifying Party.

 

 

(f) A failure to give timely notice as provided in this Section 9.3 will
affect the rights or obligations of a Party hereunder only to the extent
that, as a result of such failure, the Party entitled to receive such notice
was actually prejudiced as a result of such failure. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no claim for indemnification made after expiration of the
applicable time periods set forth in this Article IX will be valid.

 

 

9.4 Limitations on Indemnification.

 

 

(a) A Party may assert a claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(a)(ii)
or Section 9.2(b)(ii), as the case may be, only to the extent the Indemnitee
gives notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party prior to the expiration
of the applicable time period set forth in Section 9.1. Any claim pursuant
to Section 9.2(a)(i) or Section 9.2(b)(i) in respect of a covenant or
agreement which by its terms is to be performed prior to or at the Closing
must be asserted within one year following the Closing Date. Any claim for
indemnification not made in accordance with Section 9.3 by a Party on or
prior to the applicable date set forth in Section 9.1 or this Section 9.4(a),
and the other Party's indemnification obligations with respect thereto, will
be irrevocably and unconditionally released and waived.

 

 

(b)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX, except as
provided in the second sentence of this Section 9.4(b): (i) Seller will not
have any indemnification obligations for Indemnifiable Losses under Sections
9.2(a)(i) and 9.2(a)(ii) (A) for any individual item where the Loss relating
thereto is less than $50,000 and (B) in respect of each individual item where
the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than $50,000, unless the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price, and
then only to the extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event will the
aggregate indemnification to be paid by Seller under Sections 9.2(a)(i) and
9.2(a)(ii) exceed 10% of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the limitations set forth in Section 9.4(b)(i) and 9.4(b)(ii) will not
apply to claims asserted by Buyer arising from the intentional fraud
of Seller.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

69  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article IX, except as
provided in the second sentence of this Section 9.4(c): (i) Buyer will not
have any indemnification obligations for Indemnifiable Losses under Sections
9.2(b)(i) and 9.2(b)(ii) (A) for any individual item where the Loss relating
thereto is less than $50,000 and (B) in respect of each individual item where
the Loss relating thereto is equal to or greater than $50,000, unless the
aggregate amount of all such Losses exceeds 1% of the Purchase Price, and
then only to the extent of such excess; and (ii) in no event will the
aggregate indemnification to be paid by Buyer under Sections 9.2(b)(i) and
9.2(b)(ii) exceed 10% of the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the limitations set forth in Sections 9.4(c)(i) and 9.4(c)(ii) will not
apply to claims asserted by Seller arising from the intentional fraud
of Buyer.

 

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall
not be entitled to indemnification under this Article IX with respect to any
breach or inaccuracy of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
of Seller if (i) Seller provides written notice to Buyer at least
five Business Days prior to Closing describing in detail such breach or
inaccuracy, (ii) Seller simultaneously and irrevocably informs Buyer that,
because of such breach or inaccuracy Buyer is not required to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by reason of Section 8.2(b) or
8.2(c), as the case may be, and (iii) the Closing occurs.

 

 

(e)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
except for the representations and warranties contained in Article V, neither
Seller nor any other Person is making any other express or implied
representation or warranty, whether arising by operation of law or otherwise,
with respect to Seller, the Business, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Obligations or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
but in no way limited to, any representation or warranty, as to liabilities,
operations of the Purchased Assets, condition, merchantability, habitability
or fitness for a particular use, marketability, value or quality of the
Purchased Assets or the prospects (financial and otherwise), risks and other
incidents of the Purchased Assets. Except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article V, Seller expressly disclaims, whether made
by Seller or its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, agents, or
representatives, any representation or warranty of merchantability, usage,
suitability or fitness for any particular purpose with respect to the
Purchased Assets, or any part thereof, or as to the workmanship thereof, or
the absence of any defects therein, whether latent or patent, or compliance
with pipeline safety or environmental requirements, or the applicability of
any governmental requirements, including but not limited to any environmental
protection, pollution control and land use laws, rules, regulations, orders
and requirements, including but not limited to those pertaining to the use,
handling, generation, treatment, storage or disposal of any toxic or
hazardous waste or toxic, hazardous or regulated substance, or whether Seller
possesses sufficient owned real property or personal property to operate the
Purchased Assets. Except as otherwise expressly provided in Article V, Seller
further specifically disclaims any representation or warranty regarding the
absence of hazardous substances or liability or potential liability arising
under Environmental Laws with respect to the Purchased Assets.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

70  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f)  Any claims Buyer may have for breach of any representation or warranty
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement must be based solely on the
representations and warranties of Seller set forth in Article V.
In furtherance of the foregoing, except for the representations and
warranties contained in Article V, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that none
of Seller, any of its Affiliates or any other Person will have or be subject
to any liability to Buyer or any other Person for, and Seller hereby
expressly disclaims all liability and responsibility for, any representation,
warranty, projection, forecast, statement, or information made, communicated,
or furnished (orally or in writing) to Buyer or any of Buyer's
Representatives, including any confidential memoranda distributed on behalf
of Seller relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, or the
Assumed Obligations or other publications or data room information provided
to Buyer or Buyer's Representatives, or any other document or information in
any form provided to Buyer or Buyer's Representatives in connection with the
sale of the Purchased Assets, the assumption of the Assumed Obligations, and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including any opinion,
information, projection, or advice that may have been or may be provided to
Buyer or Buyer's Representatives by any of Seller's Representatives). BUYER
HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGES THAT, EXCEPT FOR THE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
EXPRESSLY SET FORTH IN ARTICLE V, THE BUSINESS AND THE PURCHASED ASSETS ARE
BEING PURCHASED ON AN "AS IS, WHERE IS" BASIS, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITH ALL
KNOWN AND UNKNOWN ENVIRONMENTAL CONDITIONS AND LIABILITIES (INCLUDING WITHOUT
LIMITATION STRICT LIABILITY).

 

 

9.5 Applicability of Article IX. For the avoidance of doubt, Seller and Buyer
agree that the remedies and obligations under this Article IX apply only
following the Closing, and that prior to the Closing or in the event
that this Agreement is terminated the Parties' remedies will be determined
by applicable Law and the provisions of Article X.

 

 

9.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Seller and Buyer agree to treat any
payment made pursuant to this Article IX as an adjustment to the Purchase
Price for federal, state, and local income Tax purposes.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

71  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9.7 No Consequential Damages. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
elsewhere in this Agreement or provided for under any applicable Law, except
as specifically provided in Sections 10.3(b), 10.3(c) and the proviso to
this Section 9.7, none of either Party or Parent will, in any event, be
liable to the other Party and Parent, or to the Parties, as the case may be,
either in contract or in tort, for any consequential, indirect, special, lost
profits or punitive damages, including loss of future revenue, income, or
profits, or loss of business reputation or opportunity of the other Party and
Parent, or of the other Parties, as the case may be, relating to the breach
or alleged breach hereof or otherwise, whether or not the possibility of such
damages has been disclosed to the other Party and Parent, or any one of them,
or to the Parties, or any one of them, as the case may be, in advance or
could have been reasonably foreseen by such other Party and Parent, or any
one of them, or such Parties, or any one of them, as the case may be;
provided, that the limitations contained in this Section 9.7 shall not apply
to any Claim for diminution in value.

and after the Closing, the sole and exclusive monetary remedy for any breach
or inaccuracy, or alleged breach or inaccuracy, of any representation or
warranty in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (other than the
Transition Services Agreement) or any covenant or agreement to be performed
hereunder or thereunder will be indemnification in accordance with this
Article IX. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller and Buyer hereby waive,
to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights,
claims, and causes of action (including rights of contributions, if any) that
may be based upon, arise out of, or relate to this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements (other than the Transition Services Agreement), or
the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements (other than the Transition Services Agreement)
(including any tort or breach of contract claim or cause of action based
upon, arising out of, or related to any representation or warranty made in or
in connection with this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreement (other than the
Transition Services Agreement) or as an inducement to enter into this
Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements (other than the Transition Services
Agreement)), known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may
arise in the future, that it may have against the other arising under or
based upon any Law (including any such Law under or relating to environmental
matters), common law, or otherwise.

(c) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if (i) any Required Regulatory
Approval (A) has been denied by the applicable Governmental Entity and all
appeals of such denial have been taken and have been unsuccessful, or (B) has
become a Final Regulatory Order and such Final Regulatory Order imposes
conditions or requirements that would result in the failure of the condition
in Section 8.2(e), or (ii) one or more courts of competent jurisdiction in
the United States or any State has issued an Order permanently restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Closing, and such Order has become
final and nonappealable.

 

 

(d) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if there has been a breach by
Seller as of the date of this Agreement of any representation or warranty or
any breach by Seller of any covenant, in each case made by it in this
Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Buyer to effect the Closing and such breach has not been cured
by Seller or waived by Buyer within 20 Business Days after all other
conditions to Closing have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied.

 

 

(e) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if there has been a breach by
Buyer as of the date of this Agreement of any representation or warranty or
any breach by Buyer of any covenant, in each case made by it in this
Agreement which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition to the
obligations of Seller to effect the Closing and such breach has not been
cured by Buyer or waived by Seller within 20 Business Days after all other
conditions to Closing have been satisfied or are capable of being satisfied.

 

 

(f) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if (i) any Required Regulatory
Approval (A) has been denied by the applicable Governmental Entity and all
appeals of such denial have been taken and have been unsuccessful, or (B) has
become a Final Regulatory Order and such Final Regulatory Order imposes
conditions or requirements that would result in the failure of the condition
in Section 8.3(d) or (ii) one or more courts of competent jurisdiction in the
United States or any State has issued an Order permanently restraining,
enjoining, or otherwise prohibiting the Closing, and such Order has become
final and nonappealable.

 

 

(g) This Agreement will terminate if (i) (A) the lenders under the Debt
Commitment Letter assert the failure of a condition precedent to the funding
of their commitments thereunder, assert that they would not be required to or
would not, fund their commitments thereunder were the Closing to occur at
that time, purport to terminate their commitments thereunder or assert that
their commitments have been terminated or (B) the Debt Commitment Letter is
otherwise terminated (collectively, a "Potential Financing Failure") and
(ii) Buyer fails to obtain a renewal of, or comparable substitute for, the
Debt Commitment Letter or otherwise resolve such Potential Funding Failure
within 30 days following such assertion, purported termination or
termination.

 

 

(h) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if any Required Regulatory
Approval has become an Order and Buyer asserts that the Order, if it becomes
a Final Regulatory Order, will not meet the closing condition in Section
8.2(e)(ii) and Buyer does not agree to waive such closing condition within 30
days of receipt of such Order.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

73  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if any Required Regulatory
Approval has become an Order and Seller asserts that the Order, if it becomes
a Final Regulatory Order, will not meet the closing condition in Section
8.3(d)(ii) and Seller does not agree to waive such closing condition within
30 days of receipt of such Order.

 

 

10.2 Procedure and Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either or both of the Parties pursuant to Section 10.1, subject
to any cure periods contemplated therein, written notice thereof will
forthwith be given by the terminating Party to the other Party and this
Agreement will terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby will be
abandoned, without further action by either Party, whereupon the liabilities
of the Parties and Parent hereunder will terminate, except as provided in
Section 10.3. If prior to Closing either Party resorts to legal proceedings
to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party in such proceedings shall be
entitled to recover all costs incurred by such Party, including reasonable
attorney's fees, in addition to any other relief to which such Party may be
entitled; provided, however, and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, in no event shall either Party be entitled under this Section
10.2 to receive any punitive, indirect or consequential damages.

 

 

10.3 Remedies upon Termination. If this Agreement is terminated as
provided herein:

 

 

(a) The obligations of the Parties under Article I, Article X and Article
XII, and Sections 7.2(b), 7.2(c), 7.2(d), 7.3, 7.5 and 11.1 will survive the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1.

 

 

(b) Buyer will pay to Seller a fee equal to $25,000,000 if Seller terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(e).

 

 

(c) Seller will pay to Buyer a fee equal to $25,000,000 if Buyer terminates
this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1(d).

 

 

(d) In view of the difficulty of determining the amount of damages which may
result to the non-terminating Party from a termination pursuant to any of the
Sections of this Agreement referenced in Section 10.3(b) or 10.3(c), and
the failure of the terminating Party to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or which may result to Seller from a
termination pursuant to Section 10.1(g), Buyer and Seller have mutually
agreed that each of the payments set forth in Sections 10.3(b) and 10.3(c)
shall be made to the non-terminating Party, or the payment set forth in
Section 10.3(f) shall be made to Seller, as liquidated damages, and not as a
penalty, and this Agreement shall thereafter terminate except for those
provisions which by their terms survive termination of this Agreement. In the
event of any termination of this Agreement, the Parties have agreed that each
of the payments set forth in Sections 10.3(b), 10.3(c), 10.3(e) and 10.3(f)
shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of each Party and Parent against the
other Party and Parent and their respective

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

74  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Affiliates. ACCORDINGLY, THE PARTIES HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT (1) THE EXTENT
OF DAMAGES TO THE NON-TERMINATING PARTY CAUSED BY THE FAILURE OF THIS
TRANSACTION TO BE CONSUMMATED WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO
ASCERTAIN, (2) THE AMOUNT OF THE LIQUIDATED DAMAGES PROVIDED FOR IN EACH OF
SECTIONS 10.3(b), 10.3(c) AND 10.3(f) ARE FAIR AND REASONABLE ESTIMATES OF
SUCH DAMAGES UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND (3) RECEIPT OF SUCH LIQUIDATED
DAMAGES BY THE NON-TERMINATING PARTY DOES NOT CONSTITUTE A PENALTY. THE
PARTIES HEREBY FOREVER WAIVE AND AGREE TO FOREGO TO THE FULLEST EXTENT UNDER
APPLICABLE LAW ANY AND ALL RIGHTS THEY HAVE OR IN THE FUTURE MAY HAVE TO
BRING ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING DISPUTING OR OTHERWISE OBJECTING TO ANY OR ALL
OF THE FOREGOING PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 10.3.

 

 

(e) (i) Buyer will pay to Seller a fee equal to $25,000,000 if (A) this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(b), 10.1(c) or 10.1(h)
primarily as a result of the failure to satisfy the condition set forth in
Section 8.2(e)(ii) or (B) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
10.1(b), 10.1(c) or 10.1(h), primarily as a result of the failure to satisfy
the conditions set forth in Section 8.2(a), 8.2(c) or 8.2(d) arising out of
Buyer\'s assertion that a Material Adverse Effect has occurred as a result of
a change in Law issued by, administered by or relating to the authority
or responsibilities of the NMPRC and (ii) Seller will pay to Buyer a fee
equal to $25,000,000 if this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
10.1(b), 10.1(f) or 10.1(i) primarily as a result of the failure to satisfy
the condition set forth in Section 8.3(d)(ii). Neither Buyer nor Seller shall
be obligated to pay any fee set forth in this Section 10.3(e) if the failure
to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 8.2(e)(ii) or 8.3(d)(ii), as the
case may be, primarily results from the failure to obtain, renew or secure
any Franchise as may be deemed necessary by the Parties in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby. Under no circumstances shall any Party
be entitled to receive a payment pursuant to this Section 10.3(e) and
a payment pursuant to Section 10.3(b), 10.3(c) or 10.3(f), as the case may
be.

 

 

(f) Buyer will pay to Seller a fee equal to $25,000,000 if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Section 10.1(g) unless, at the time of such
termination, the conditions set forth in Sections 8.2(a) and 8.2(c) shall
not be satisfied (determined as if the time of termination were the
Effective Time). Under no circumstances shall Seller be entitled to receive
a payment pursuant to this Section 10.3(f) and a payment pursuant to
Section10.3(b) or 10.3(e).

 

 

(g) All payments under this Section 10.3 shall be from payor to payee by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank account in the United
States of America designated in writing by payee not later than three (3)
Business Days following payor's receipt of such account designation from
payee.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

75  

 

 

 

 

 

 

(h) No amount shall be due by Buyer or Seller under Section 10.3(b) or
10.3(c) if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing and the Closing
does not occur primarily because a representation and warranty of a Party or
Parent that was true and correct on the date of this Agreement became not
true and correct thereafter not as a result of a breach of covenant by such
Party or Parent.

 

 

ARTICLE XI

 

PARENT GUARANTEE

 

 

11.1 Guarantee. (a) Parent hereby absolutely, unconditionally and irrevocably
guarantees to Seller, as primary obligor and not merely as a surety, (i) the
due and punctual payment of all monetary obligations of Buyer under this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements and (ii) the full and complete
performance of all covenants and agreements of Buyer under this Agreement and
the Ancillary Agreements (the obligations of Buyer specified in clauses (i)
and (ii) above, collectively, the "Guaranteed Obligations").

 

 

(b) The guarantee contained in this Article XI shall remain in full force
and effect until all of the Guaranteed Obligations shall have been satisfied
by payment in full.

 

 

11.2 Nature of Guarantee. Parent guarantees that the Guaranteed
Obligations will be duly and punctually paid and performed in accordance with
the terms of this Article XI. If for any reason Buyer shall fail or be
unable to duly and punctually pay or perform, or cause to be duly and
punctually paid or performed, the Guaranteed Obligations as and when the same
shall become due and payable, Parent shall, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Article XI, forthwith duly and punctually pay or perform,
or cause to be duly and punctually paid or performed, such Guaranteed
Obligations. Parent further agrees that the guarantee contained in this
Article XI (the "Parent Guarantee") constitutes a guarantee of payment and
performance when due and not of collection and is in no way conditioned or
contingent upon any attempt to collect from Buyer.

 

 

11.3 Representations and Warranties of Parent. Solely for the purpose of this
Article XI, Parent represents and warrants to Seller as follows:

 

 

(a) Organization. Parent is a limited liability company duly organized,
validly existing, and in good standing under the laws of the state of
Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease,
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as is now being
conducted.

 

 

(b) Authority Relative to this Agreement and the Parent Guarantee. Parent has
all corporate power and authority necessary to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform its obligations in connection with the Parent
Guarantee. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance
of the obligations under the Parent Guarantee have been duly and validly
authorized by the managing members of Parent and no other proceedings on the
part of Parent are necessary to authorize this Agreement or the performance
of Parent's obligations under the Parent Guarantee. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent, and constitutes a valid
and binding agreement of Parent, enforceable against Parent in accordance
with its terms, except as such enforceability may be limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar laws affecting or
relating to enforcement of creditors' rights generally or general principles
of equity.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

76  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(c) Consents and Approvals; No Violation. Except as set forth in Schedule
11.3(c), the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance by
Parent of its obligations under the Parent Guarantee, do not:

 

 

(i) conflict with or result in any breach of the Governing Documents of
Parent;

 

 

(ii) result in a default (including with notice, lapse of time, or both), or
give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration, under
any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, agreement, lease, or other instrument or obligation to which
Parent is a party or by which Parent or any of its assets may be bound,
except for such defaults (or rights of termination, cancellation, or
acceleration) as to which requisite waivers or consents have been, or will
prior to the Effective Time be, obtained or which if not obtained or made
would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
performance by Parent of its obligations under the Parent Guarantee;

 

 

(iii) violate any Law or Order applicable to Parent or any of its assets; or

 

 

(iv) require any declaration, filing, or registration with, or notice to, or
authorization, consent, or approval of any Governmental Entity, other than
such declarations, filings, registrations, notices, authorizations, consents,
or approvals which, if not obtained or made, would not, individually or in
the aggregate, prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the performance by Parent of
its obligations under the Parent Guarantee.

 

 

11.4 Sole Obligation of Parent. This Article XI contains the only provisions
in this Agreement that are applicable to Parent. Parent shall not have any
obligations under this Agreement other than those expressly set forth in this
Article XI.

 

 

ARTICLE XII

 

MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

 

 

12.1 Amendment and Modification. Except as provided in Section 7.8,
this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement may be amended, modified, or
supplemented only by written agreement of Seller, Buyer and Parent.

 

 

12.2 Waiver of Compliance; Consents. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, any failure of either Party or Parent to comply with any
obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition herein may be waived by the
Party or Parent, as the case may be, entitled to the benefits thereof only by
a written instrument signed by the Party or Parent, as the case may be,
granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon strict
compliance with such obligation, covenant, agreement, or condition will not
operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other
failure.

12.4 Assignment. This Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement and all of the
provisions hereof and thereof will be binding upon and inure to the benefit
of the Parties and Parent and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any Ancillary Agreement nor any of
the rights, interests, or obligations hereunder or thereunder may be assigned
by either Party or Parent, without the prior written consent of the other
Party and Parent, or the Parties, as the case may be, nor is this Agreement
or any Ancillary Agreement intended to confer upon any other Person except
the Parties and Parent any rights or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Buyer may assign any or all of its rights and obligations
hereunder to a Buyer Designee, or as security in connection with the
Financing or any other financing transaction. Upon receipt of notice by
Seller from Buyer of any such assignment to a Buyer Designee, such assignee
will be deemed to have assumed, ratified, agreed to be bound by and perform
all such obligations, and all references herein to "Buyer" shall thereafter
be deemed to be references to such assignee, in each case without the
necessity for further act or evidence by the Parties hereto or Parent or such
assignee; provided, however, that no such assignment shall relieve or
discharge Buyer from any of its obligations hereunder or under any of the
Ancillary Agreements. No provision of this Agreement creates any third party
beneficiary rights in any employee or former employee of Seller (including
any beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of continued employment or
resumed employment, and no provision of this Agreement creates any rights in
any such Persons in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any employee benefit plan or arrangement.

 

 

12.5 Governing Law. This Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement are governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New Mexico
(regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of law) as to all matters, including but not limited
to matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies. EACH
OF THE PARTIES AND PARENT AGREES THAT VENUE IN ANY AND ALL ACTIONS AND
PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY ANCILLARY
AGREEMENT (OTHER THAN THE TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT) SHALL BE IN THE
STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS IN AND FOR ALBUQUERQUE, NEW MEXICO WHICH
COURTS SHALL HAVE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION FOR SUCH PURPOSE, AND THE PARTIES
AND PARENT IRREVOCABLY SUBMIT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS
AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE THE DEFENSE OF AN INCONVENIENT FORUM TO THE MAINTENANCE
OF ANY SUCH ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS MAY BE MADE IN ANY
MANNER RECOGNIZED BY SUCH COURTS.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

79  

 

 

 

 

 

 

12.6 Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement that is invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any
jurisdiction will not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining
terms and provisions hereof or thereof or the validity or enforceability of
the offending term or provision in any other situation or in any other
jurisdiction.

 

 

12.7 Entire Agreement. This Agreement will be a valid and binding agreement
of the Parties and Parent only if and when it is fully executed and delivered
by the Parties and Parent, and until such execution and delivery no legal
obligation will be created by virtue hereof. This Agreement and the Ancillary
Agreements, together with the Schedules and Exhibits hereto and thereto and
the certificates and instruments delivered under or in accordance herewith or
therewith, embody the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties and
Parent in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. This
Agreement supersedes all prior agreements and understandings between the
Parties and Parent with respect to such transactions. All conflicts or
inconsistencies, if any, between the terms hereof and the terms of any of the
Ancillary Agreements shall be resolved in favor of this Agreement (except in
the case of any Special Warranty Deed, in which event such Special Warranty
Deed shall govern and control with respect to the matters addressed therein).

 

 

12.8 Bulk Sales or Transfer Laws. Buyer acknowledges that Seller will not
comply with the provision of any bulk sales or transfer laws of any
jurisdiction in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller with the provisions of
the bulk sales or transfer laws of all applicable jurisdictions.

 

 

12.9 Delivery. This Agreement, and any certificates and instruments delivered
under or in accordance herewith, may be executed in multiple counterparts
(each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument), and may be delivered by facsimile
transmission, with originals to follow by overnight courier or certified mail
(return receipt requested).

 

 

12.10 Waiver of Jury Trial. EACH OF THE PARTIES AND PARENT HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE ANCILLARY AGREEMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY OR THEREBY.
