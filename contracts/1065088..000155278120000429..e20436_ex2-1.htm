(c)  Except as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter, there
are no conditions precedent to the obligations of the Lenders to provide the
Debt Financing or any contingencies that would permit the Lenders to reduce
the aggregate principal amount of the Debt Financing, including any condition
or other contingency relating to the amount or availability of the Debt
Financing pursuant to any "flex" provision. Purchaser does not have any
reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy on a timely basis all
terms and conditions to be satisfied by it in any of the Commitment Letter on
or prior to the Closing Date, nor does Purchaser have knowledge that any
Lender will not perform its obligations thereunder. There are no side letters,
understandings or other agreements, contracts or arrangements of any kind
relating to the Commitment Letter that could affect the
conditionality, enforceability, availability, termination or aggregate
principal amount of the Debt Financing.

  

(d)  The Debt Financing, when funded in accordance with the
Commitment Letter and giving effect to any "flex" provision in or related to
the Commitment Letter (including with respect to fees and original issue
discount), shall provide Purchaser with cash proceeds on the Closing Date
sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Purchaser's obligations under this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Commitment Letter, including the
payment of, without duplication, the Classifieds DutchCo Indebtedness, the IP
Consideration, the Closing First Share Sale Consideration, the Closing Second
Share Sale Cash Consideration, the Closing Contribution Adjustment, the Post-

contemplated by, or required in connection with the transactions described
in, this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or the Commitment Letter (such
amounts, collectively, the " _Financing Amounts_ ").

  

(e)  The Commitment Letter constitutes the legal, valid, binding and
enforceable obligations of Purchaser and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, all
the other parties thereto and are in full force and effect. No event has
occurred which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) could
constitute a breach or failure to satisfy a condition by Purchaser under the
terms and conditions of the Commitment Letter. Purchaser has paid in full any
and all commitment fees or other fees required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of the Commitment Letter on or before the date hereof, and will pay in
full any such amounts due on or before the Closing Date. The Commitment
Letter has not been modified, amended or altered, and none of the respective
commitments thereunder have been terminated, reduced, withdrawn or rescinded
in any respect, and, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, no termination,
reduction, withdrawal or rescission thereof is contemplated. No modification
or amendment to the Commitment Letter that would adversely affect Purchaser's
ability to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, the Ancillary
Agreements and the Commitment Letter, including the payment of the Financing
Amounts, is currently contemplated.

(f)  In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or
financing (including the Debt Financing) by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates or any other financing or other transactions be a condition to any
of Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement.

  

Section 4.19   _Solvency_. As of the Closing, after giving effect to
any indebtedness being incurred on such date in connection herewith, and
assuming satisfaction of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_, each
of Purchaser and the Share Sale Purchasers will not (i) be insolvent (either
because its financial condition is such that the sum of its debts (including a
reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent liabilities) is greater
than the fair value of its assets, or because the present fair saleable value
of its assets will be less than the amount required to pay its probable
liability on its debts as they become absolute and matured), (ii) have
unreasonably small capital with which to engage in its business or (iii) have
incurred or plan to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become
absolute and matured.

investor" as defined in Regulation D of the Securities Act, is able to bear
the economic risk of its investment in the Shares and has such knowledge and
experience in financial and business matters that it is capable of evaluating

sale in connection with any distribution thereof, or with any present
intention of distributing or selling such Shares. Purchaser acknowledges that
the Shares have not been registered under the Securities Act or any other
federal, state, foreign or local securities Law, and agrees that such Shares
may not be sold, transferred, offered for sale, pledged, distributed,
hypothecated or otherwise disposed of without registration under the
Securities Act, except pursuant to an exemption from such
registration available under the Securities Act, and in compliance with any
other federal, state, foreign or local securities Law, in each case, to the
extent applicable.

  

Section 4.21   _Independent Investigation_. Purchaser has conducted
its own independent investigation, review and analysis of the business,
operations, assets, liabilities, results of operations, financial condition,
technology, management and prospects of the Transferred Entities and the
Business, which investigation, review and analysis was done by Purchaser and
its representatives. In entering into this Agreement, Purchaser acknowledges
that it has relied solely upon the aforementioned investigation, review and
analysis and not on any factual representations or opinions of any of the
Sellers, the Transferred Entities, their respective Affiliates or any of
their respective representatives (except for the representations and
warranties of Parent expressly set forth in _Article III_ and in any
certificate delivered pursuant to _Section 8.2(c)_). Purchaser hereby
acknowledges and agrees that none of the Sellers, the Transferred Entities,
their respective Affiliates or any of their respective representatives or any
other Person will have or be subject to any Liability to Purchaser, its
Affiliates or any of their respective representatives or equityholders or any
other Person resulting from the distribution to Purchaser, its Affiliates or
their respective representatives of, or Purchaser's, its Affiliates', or their
respective representatives' use of, any information relating to the Sellers,
the Transferred Entities or the Business, including any information,
documents or material made available to Purchaser, its Affiliates, or their
respective representatives, whether orally or in writing, in any data room,
any management presentations (formal or informal), functional "break-out"
discussions, responses to questions submitted on behalf of Purchaser or its
Affiliates or in any other form in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

Entities (other than pursuant to Permitted Transactions), (C) provide any
guarantee or other credit support for such indebtedness, or (D) make payments

For purposes of this _Section 4.22_, references to "Contribution Entities"
shall include any successors thereto, including Dutch Merger Sub.

Transferred Entities) to the extent that such access may be reasonably
requested for reasonable business purposes, including in connection with
financial statements, including in connection with _Section 2.4_ and
_Section 2.5_, any potential Action or investigation by or before a
Governmental Entity ((including in connection with the matters covered under
_Section 5.11_) and Governmental Entity or stock exchange
reporting obligations and compliance with applicable Laws or stock exchange
rules (in each case, other than relating to any dispute between the Parties
or their Affiliates); _provided_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall limit
any rights of discovery of Purchaser or its Affiliates.

  

(e)  Except for Tax Returns and other documents governed by _Section
7.5(b)_, Purchaser agrees to hold, and to cause the applicable Transferred
Entities to hold, all the books and records of each Transferred Entity or the
Business existing on the Closing Date and not to destroy or dispose of any
thereof for a period of six (6) years from the Closing Date or such longer
time as may be required by Law.

  

(f)  To the extent not prohibited by applicable Law, from and after
the date hereof and through the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, provide Parent and its Subsidiaries such cooperation, support,
documentation and information as Parent may reasonably request to prepare for
and facilitate sales by Parent at or after Closing of the Purchaser Ordinary
Stock or Purchaser Nonvoting Stock to be issued to Parent hereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, Parent shall be permitted to share such documentation and
information with potential third party acquiror pursuant to a customary
nondisclosure agreement.

  

(g)  Promptly after the date hereof, each of the Parties shall
appoint two or more of its representatives to a joint committee (the "
_Transaction Committee_ ") which shall consist of at least two (2) senior
employees of Parent (one (1) of whom shall be a senior employee of the
Business) and at least two (2) senior employees of Purchaser, which, for the
avoidance of doubt, may include a senior employee of Schibsted, if so
determined by Purchaser in its sole discretion, with each Party being
entitled to appoint an equal number of representatives. Either Party shall
have the right, at its discretion and at any time, to remove, replace or add
its representatives to the Transaction Committee _provided_ that there is
always an equal number of representatives appointed by Parent (including the
representative of the Business) and Purchaser (including any representative of
Schibsted). For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 5.1(g)_ does not give
and shall not be construed so as to give, the Transaction Committee any power
to participate in or influence the management of the Transferred Entities or
the Business prior to the Closing Date. The Transaction Committee will,
subject to applicable Law, coordinate the Parties' efforts with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ that, for the avoidance of
doubt, Parent shall direct and be solely responsible for the separation of
the Business and the Transferred Entities from the Retained Businesses prior
to the Closing and the Purchaser shall direct and be solely responsible for
the integration of the Business and the Transferred Entities with the
Purchaser Business following the Closing.

Business from and after the Closing or the Purchaser Business; _provided_ ,
that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to information (i) that becomes

the public domain through no breach of this _Section 5.2(b)_ by Parent, (iii)
to the extent used by Parent or any of its Affiliates to comply with the

Purchaser in writing unless not permitted by Law or such legal or regulatory
process to so notify, which notification shall include the nature of such
legal or regulatory requirement or request, as applicable, and the extent of
the required or requested disclosure, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Purchaser, at Purchaser's expense, to preserve to
the extent reasonably practicable the confidentiality of such information.

_provided_ , that with respect to Trade Secrets of the Retained Business
contained in any Sensitive Retained Business Information, the confidentiality
obligations in this _Section 5.2(c) _shall remain in effect for so long as
the relevant information remains a Trade Secret), Purchaser shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) to, hold in
confidence and not use for any purpose any nonpublic information that is
proprietary or competitively sensitive (" _Sensitive Retained Businesses
Information_ ") to the extent exclusively relating to the Retained
Businesses; _provided_ , that the foregoing restriction shall not apply to

Purchaser or any of its Affiliates from and after the Closing from a third
party source that is not known by Purchaser or its applicable Affiliates to be
under any obligations of confidentiality with respect to such information,

Section 5.3   _Required Actions_.

  

(a)  Purchaser and Parent shall take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under any applicable Laws to consummate and make effective in the
most expeditious manner possible the Transactions and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the preparation and filing of
all forms, registrations, notifications and notices required to be filed to
consummate the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (ii) taking all actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating
with each other in obtaining) any consent, clearance, expiration or
termination of a waiting period, authorization, Order or approval of, or any
exemption by, any Governmental Entity (which actions shall include furnishing
all information required under any applicable Competition Laws) required under
any applicable Laws and/or by this Agreement to be obtained or made by
Purchaser or Parent or any of their respective Subsidiaries in
connection with the Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (iii) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. Additionally, each of Parent and Purchaser shall
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under any applicable Laws to fulfill all
conditions precedent to this Agreement and shall not take any action after
the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to delay
the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any consent, clearance,
expiration or termination of a waiting period, authorization, Order or
approval of, or any exemption by, any Governmental Entity necessary to be
obtained at or prior to the Closing and, in the case of any Deferred Closing
Governmental Approval, after the Closing.

  

(b)  Prior to the Closing (or with respect to any Deferred Closing
Governmental Approval, prior to the Deferred Closing Date), to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, Purchaser and Parent shall each keep the other
apprised of the status of matters relating to the completion of the
Transactions and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
work cooperatively in connection with obtaining all required consents,
clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods, authorizations,
Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity. In
that regard, prior to the Closing (or with respect to any Deferred
Closing Governmental Approval, prior to the Deferred Closing Date), subject
to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.2_, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, each Party shall promptly consult with the other
Party to this Agreement to provide any necessary information with respect to
(and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other Party (or their
counsel) copies of) all filings made by such Party with any Governmental
Entity or any other information supplied by such Party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement,
the Transactions, and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement and _Section 5.2_, to the extent not
prohibited by applicable Law, each Party to this Agreement shall promptly
inform the other Party to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other
Party with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the
other Party of) any communication from any Governmental Entity regarding the
Transactions, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
permit the other Party to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good
faith the views of the other Party in connection with, any proposed written or
oral communication or submission with or to any such Governmental Entity. If
any Party to this Agreement or any Representative of such Party receives a
request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, then such Party will make, or
cause to be made, promptly and after consultation with the other Party to
this Agreement, a complete response in compliance with such request. No Party
shall participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in connection
with this Agreement, the Transactions, or with any other Person in
connection with any proceeding or Action by a private Party relating to any
applicable Competition Laws in connection with this Agreement, the
Transactions, or make oral submissions at meetings or in telephone or other
conversations, unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the
extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement and _Section 5.2_, to the extent not prohibited by applicable Law,
each Party shall furnish the other Party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, submissions and communications (and memoranda setting forth the
substance thereof) between it and any such Governmental Entity or other such
Person with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions, or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and furnish the other Party with
such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other Party may
reasonably request in connection with its preparation of necessary filings or
submissions of information to any such Governmental Entity or other such
Person. Purchaser and Parent may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the
other Party under this Agreement as "outside counsel/corporate in-house
counsel only." Such designated materials, and the information contained
therein, shall be given only to the outside legal counsel and corporate in-
house counsel of the recipient involved in the Transactions and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall not be disclosed by such
outside counsel and corporate in-house counsel to employees (other than
corporate in-house counsel), officers or directors of the recipient
unless express permission is obtained in advance from the source of the
materials (Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be) or its legal counsel; it
being understood that materials provided pursuant to this Agreement may be
redacted (i) to remove references concerning the valuation of the Business,
(ii) as necessary to comply with contractual arrangements and (iii) as
necessary to address reasonable privilege concerns. The Parties shall have
joint control and authority to direct and implement the regulatory strategy;
_provided_ , _however_ , that without limiting Purchaser's obligations
hereunder, Purchaser shall have final authority to direct and implement the
regulatory strategy; _provided_ that Purchaser shall consult in good faith
the views of Parent in advance of making any decisions with respect to such
strategy.

(c)  Purchaser and Parent shall file any filings and/or
notifications under applicable Competition Laws as promptly as possible.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Party shall
make any filings and/or notifications under applicable Competition Laws in
any jurisdiction, other than a Required Jurisdiction or the jurisdiction set
forth on _Section 5.3(c) _of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, unless
Purchaser and Parent mutually agree that such filing and/or notification is
necessary or advisable (and neither Purchaser nor Parent shall unreasonably
refuse to agree). In the event that the Parties receive any request for
information or documentary material from any Governmental Entity, including a
request for additional information or documentary materials pursuant to any
applicable Competition Laws, the Parties shall comply with such requests as
promptly as possible (and in any event within two (2) months after receipt
thereof, unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties) and produce documents,
responses to interrogatories, witnesses for deposition, or other information
on a rolling basis, and counsel for both Parties will closely cooperate
during the entirety of any such investigatory or review process.

  

(d)  Purchaser and Parent shall, by any means other than termination
of this Agreement, promptly resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by any Governmental Entity with respect to the Transactions, and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Competition Laws.
In connection therewith, if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the Transactions, or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any applicable Competition
Laws, Purchaser and Parent shall jointly initiate and/or participate in any
proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, to (i) initiate, oppose or
defend against any Action by any Governmental Entity to prevent or enjoin the
consummation of the Transactions, or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and/or (ii) take such action as necessary to overturn any
regulatory Action by any Governmental Entity to block consummation of the
Transactions, or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
each case to the extent necessary so as to enable the Closing to occur as
promptly as possible, including by defending any such Action brought by any
Governmental Entity to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, overturned or
terminated, including by appeal if necessary, any Order that makes illegal or
prohibits the consummation of the Transactions, or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement resulting from any such Action.

(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions
necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any
applicable Competition Laws so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly
as practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and/or to
obtain approvals, if any, in the jurisdiction set forth on _Section 5.3(c)_
of the Parent Disclosure Schedule as promptly as practicable, including (i)
proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold
separate Order, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any
businesses, product lines or assets of the Transferred Entities, Purchaser,
and their respective Subsidiaries, and (ii) otherwise taking or committing to
take actions that after the Closing would limit Purchaser's, the Transferred
Entities or their respective Subsidiaries' freedom of action with respect to,
or its or their ability to retain, any businesses, product lines or assets of
the Transferred Entities, Purchaser, and their respective Subsidiaries
(collectively, the " _Remedies_ "). In that regard Purchaser shall and, if
requested by Purchaser, Parent shall (but, subject to Purchaser's obligations
under this Agreement, including this _Section 5.3_, if not so requested by
Purchaser, Parent shall not), agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold
separate, or otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its
freedom of action with respect to, or Purchaser's or Parent's or their
respective Subsidiaries' ability to retain, any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the Transferred Entities, Purchaser, or any of
Purchaser's Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations of
Parent and its Affiliates shall be subject to the limitations set forth in the
second and third sentences of _Section 5.15(e)_ (which shall apply _mutatis
mutandis_ ) and _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent and its Affiliates shall
not be required to agree to retain any or all of the Transferred Entities or
the Business after the Closing. Purchaser shall reimburse, indemnify and hold
harmless Parent and its Affiliates and their respective representatives from
and against any out-of-pocket costs and expenses actually incurred by them in
connection with any actions taken at Purchaser's request to facilitate or
effectuate any divestiture, disposition or other remedy pursuant to this
_Section 5.3(e)_. All such efforts by Purchaser shall be unconditional, and
no actions taken pursuant to this _Section 5.3(e)_ nor the impact thereof on
the Business shall be considered for purposes of determining whether a
Business Material Adverse Effect has occurred or may occur. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, Parent shall not be obligated to take or
agree or commit to take any such action (A) that is not conditioned on the
Closing or (B) that relates to or impacts the Retained Businesses.

(f)  Purchaser agrees to provide such security and assurances as to
financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably
requested by any Governmental Entity or other third party whose consent or
approval is sought in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby.
Whether or not the Transactions are consummated, Purchaser shall be
responsible for all fees and payments (including filing fees and legal,
economist and other professional fees) to any third party or any Governmental
Entity to obtain any consent, clearance, expiration or termination of a
waiting period, authorization, Order or approval pursuant to this _Section
5.3_ or _Section 5.5_, other than the fees of and payments to Parent's legal

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Parent shall cause the

release or public announcement shall use reasonable efforts to provide the
other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment on such press release or
public announcement in advance of such publication or (b) to the extent the
contents of such release or announcement have previously been released
publicly by a Party or are consistent in all material respects with materials

out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including Taxes) imposed on Parent or any
of its Affiliates (including the Transferred Entities) in connection with the

Purchaser (in the case of the Parent Guarantees) or Parent (in the case of the
Transferred Entity Guarantees) meeting the applicable net worth and other

preceding sentence. For any Guarantees for which Purchaser or any Transferred
Entity (in the case of a Parent Guarantee) or Parent or any of its Affiliates
(in the case of a Transferred Entity Guarantee), as applicable, is not
substituted in all respects for the Guarantee Indemnified Party (or for which
the Guarantee Indemnified Party is not released) effective as of the Closing

(including to all claims and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds)
to cover any assets or any Liability of the Transferred Entities or arising
from the operation of the Business, in each case including with respect to all
known or incurred but not reported claims. The members of the Parent Group

Transferred Entities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, in the event
that the Parent Group and any of the Transferred Entities have competing
claims under an Occurrence Policy and there are insufficient coverage limits
remaining under that Occurrence Policy, then Parent Group shall have first
right of access to the remaining insurance limits.

(iii)  as promptly as practicable following entry into any definitive
agreements with respect to the Replacement Financing (the " _Replacement
Financing Documents_ "), the Purchaser shall deliver to the Parent a true,
complete and correct copy of such duly executed Replacement Financing
Document and any related condition precedent satisfaction letters (and,
reasonably in advance of entering into any Replacement Financing Documents,
Purchaser shall provide Parent with drafts thereof for review and comment).

  

(c)  Purchaser shall not without the prior written consent of
Parent: (A) permit any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision or remedy under, the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements
or the Replacement Financing Documents if such amendment, modification,
waiver or remedy (1) adds new (or adversely modifies any existing) conditions
to the consummation of all or any portion of the Debt Financing or
Replacement Financing (as applicable), (2) reduces the aggregate principal
amount of the Debt Financing or Replacement Financing (as applicable), (3)
adversely affects the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against
other parties to the Commitment Letter or the Definitive Agreements or
Replacement Financing Documents as so amended, replaced, supplemented or
otherwise modified, relative to the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights
against the other parties to the Commitment Letter as in effect on the date
hereof or the other parties to the Replacement Finance Document as in
effect as at the date such document is delivered to the Parent in accordance
with paragraph (b)(ii) above, or (4) could otherwise reasonably be expected

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or (B) terminate the Commitment
Letter, any Definitive Agreement or any Replacement Finance Document.
Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Parent copies of any such amendment,
modification, waiver or replacement.

  

(d)  In the event that any portion of the Debt Financing or
Replacement Financing becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason
therefor, Purchaser will (A) use reasonable best efforts to obtain
alternative debt financing (in an amount sufficient, when taken together with
the available portion of the Debt Financing or Replacement Financing (as
applicable), to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and to pay the Financing Amounts) from the same or other sources and which do
not include any conditions to the consummation of such alternative debt
financing that are more onerous than the conditions set forth in the Debt
Financing or Replacement Financing (as applicable) and (B) promptly notify
Parent of such unavailability and the reason therefor. In furtherance of and
not in limitation of the foregoing, in the event that (1) any portion of the
Debt Financing structured as permanent financing or Replacement Financing (as
applicable) is unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor, (2) all
conditions contained in _Section 8.1 _and _Section 8.2_ have been satisfied
or waived (other than (x) any such conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions at the Closing, and (y) those conditions the failure of which to
be satisfied is attributable to a breach by Purchaser of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement) and (3) the
bridge facilities contemplated by the Commitment Letter (or alternative
bridge facilities obtained in accordance with this _Section 5.15(d)_) (the "
_Bridge Facilities_ ") are available on the terms and conditions described in
the Commitment Letter, then Purchaser shall cause the proceeds of such bridge
financing to be used immediately in lieu of such affected portion of the
permanent financing. For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "
_Commitment Letter_ " shall be deemed to include any commitment letter (or
similar agreement) with respect to any alternative financing arranged in
compliance herewith (and any Commitment Letter remaining in effect at the time
in question). Purchaser shall provide Parent with prompt oral and written
notice of any actual or threatened breach, default, termination
or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter, any Definitive
Agreement or any Replacement Financing Document and a copy of any written
notice or other written communication from any Lender, Replacement Financing
Lender (as defined below), or other financing source with respect to any
actual or threatened material breach, material default, termination or
repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter, any Definitive Agreement
or any Replacement Financing Document of any provision thereof. Purchaser
shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis of the status of its
efforts to consummate the Debt Financing or Replacement Financing (as
applicable). The foregoing notwithstanding, compliance by Purchaser with this
_Section 5.15(d)_ shall not relieve Purchaser of its obligations to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement whether or not the
Debt Financing or Replacement Financing is available.

of Parent and its Subsidiaries with respect to cooperation in connection with
the arrangement of any financing (including the Debt Financing and any
Replacement Financing) to be obtained by Purchaser with respect to the

Section 5.16   _R andW Insurance Policy_. Purchaser will use its
reasonable best efforts to obtain a conditional binder to a
representation and warranty and pre-closing tax indemnity insurance policy
(the " _R andW Insurance Policy_") as promptly as possible after the date

necessary to complete the applicable conditions in the conditional binder
(other than the condition that the Closing has occurred) to the RandW Insurance
Policy within the times set forth therein to maintain the RandW Insurance
Policy in full force and effect. Following the final issuance of the RandW
Insurance Policy, Purchaser agrees to use reasonable best efforts to keep the
RandW Insurance Policy in full force and effect for the policy period set forth
therein. Upon its final issuance, Purchaser shall deliver the RandW
Insurance Policy to Parent. The Parties acknowledge that Purchaser obtaining
the RandW Insurance Policy is a material inducement to Parent entering into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and Parent is relying on
Purchaser's covenants and obligations set forth in this _Section 5.16_. The
RandW Insurance Policy shall include a provision whereby the insurer
expressly waives, and irrevocably agrees, except in the case of Actual Fraud,
not to pursue, directly or indirectly, any subrogation rights against Parent
or any of its Affiliates, or any former stockholders, managers, members,
directors, officers, employees, agents or Representatives of any of the
foregoing with respect to any claim made by any insured thereunder and such
Persons shall be express third-party beneficiaries of such provision. In
addition, the RandW Insurance Policy may not be amended or waived by Purchaser
in any manner that is adverse to Parent or any of its Affiliates without
Parent's prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed), and the subrogation provisions therein may
not be amended or waived in any manner that is adverse to Parent or any of
its Affiliates without Parent's prior written consent. In the event that
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates otherwise amends, waives, modifies, fails
to obtain, or cancels the terms of the RandW Insurance Policy, in no event
shall Parent be liable under _Article X_ for any liabilities or obligations
in excess of such liabilities or obligations as they would have under
_Article X_ if the RandW Insurance Policy had not been so amended, waived,
modified or cancelled.

their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a
majority of their respective properties and assets to any Person, then, and in
each such case, Purchaser shall procure that proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of such Transferred Entity or Purchaser,

this _Section 5.17_.

(e)  The obligations of Purchaser and the Transferred Entities under
this _Section 5.17_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as

set forth on _Section 5.18(a) _of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the "
_Pre-Closing Restructuring Plan_ "). Prior to the Closing, Parent and its
Subsidiaries may (i) modify or amend the Pre-Closing Restructuring Plan from
time to time, (ii) cause any of the Transferred Entities that is a "per se"

interests in any of the Transferred Entities to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (including Subsidiaries that may be newly formed after the date
hereof); provided, that, in the case of any modification or amendment
described in clause (i) or any transfer described in clause (iv) (to the
extent such transfer is inconsistent with the Pre-Closing Restructuring
Plan), Parent shall not undertake such modification, amendment, or transfer
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed, to the extent such modification, amendment
or transfer would reasonably be expected to materially adversely affect
Purchaser in any Post-Closing Tax Period (it being understood that any
modification or amendment relating to the U.S. entity classification of a
Transferred Entity shall not require Purchaser consent; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent shall provide prompt notice to Purchaser of any such
modification or amendment) or materially adversely affect the ability of the
Parties to consummate the Transactions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, prior to the Closing, Parent and its Subsidiaries may
transfer any Transferred Entity to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries if such
Transferred Entity would reasonably be expected to be a Deferred Transferred
Entity pursuant _Section 2.7(b)_, provided that such classification as a
Deferred Transferred Entity is not caused by such transfer.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, not later than
ten (10) Business Days before Closing, Parent may deliver a written notice to
Purchaser identifying changes to the allocation of Transferred Entities
between Contribution Entities and Second Share Sale Companies on _Schedule I
Part 2_. Any other changes to the allocation of Transferred Entities between
Contribution Entities, First Share Sale Companies and Second Share Sale
Companies may be made only with the written consent of Purchaser (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

its Organizational Documents, all necessary steps to call, give notice of,
convene and hold an extraordinary general meeting of the stockholders of
Purchaser (such meeting, or any adjournments or postponements thereof, the "
_Purchaser Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose of obtaining the
Purchaser Stockholder Approval and shall use best efforts to solicit its
stockholders to obtain the Purchaser Stockholder Approval, including by
recommending that Purchaser's stockholders approve each of the items
presented for the Purchaser Stockholder Approval; _provided_ , that Purchaser
may (with Parent's prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) adjourn, postpone and/or reconvene the Purchaser
Stockholders Meeting, and shall do so upon Parent's written request received
at least three (3) Business Days prior to the intended day of the
Purchaser Stockholders Meeting, (A) to allow reasonable additional time to
solicit additional proxies in favor of the Purchaser Stockholder Approval if,
as of the time of such delay, insufficient proxies have been received to
approve the Purchaser Stockholder Approval or (B) if Purchaser shall have
failed to obtain the Purchaser Stockholder Approval (such reconvened meeting
shall be deemed the Purchaser Stockholder Meeting for the purposes of this
Agreement, and this _Section 5.20_ shall apply _mutatis mutandis _ to such
reconvened meeting). In the event that the Purchaser Stockholders Meeting is
adjourned or postponed pursuant to the foregoing provision, Purchaser shall
duly give notice of and reconvene the Purchaser Stockholders Meeting on a date
scheduled by mutual agreement of Purchaser and Parent, acting reasonably, or,
in the absence of such agreement, as soon as practicable following the date
of such postponement. Purchaser shall, upon Parent's request, advise Parent no
more frequently than every other Business Day during each of the last ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date of the Purchaser Stockholders Meeting as
to the aggregate tally of proxies received by Purchaser with respect to the
Purchaser Stockholder Approval and at additional times upon the reasonable
request of Parent.

Purchaser Stockholder Approval, (ii) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose
publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any Competing Proposal, (iii)

Competing Proposal or that would reasonably be expected to lead to a
Competing Proposal or that would require Purchaser to abandon or fail to
consummate the Transactions or (iv) resolve, agree or publicly propose to do
any of the foregoing (any action described in clauses (i) to (iv) being
referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation_ "). Unless this Agreement is
terminated prior to the Purchaser Stockholders Meeting pursuant to, and in
accordance with, _Section 9.1_, Purchaser shall submit the Transactions to
the stockholders of Purchaser for the purpose of obtaining the Purchaser
Stockholder Approval.

  

(c)  Nothing in _Section 5.20_ _(b)_ or in _Section 5.21(a)_ shall
prohibit Purchaser from (i) to the extent strictly required by Norwegian Law,
engaging in or taking a view, expressing publicly an opinion to the
Purchaser's stockholders or taking other actions with respect to an
unsolicited Competing Proposal where such Competing Proposal requires either
acceptance by Purchaser's stockholders or approval by Purchaser's
stockholders in a general meeting, or (ii) disclosing to its stockholders any
fact or circumstance that is strictly required to be disclosed under Norwegian
Law (A) in making their decision on how to vote on the matters subject to the
Purchaser Stockholder Approval or (B) to take any action with respect to any
Competing Proposal; provided that to the extent that Purchaser reasonably
determines that such disclosure could have substantially the same effect as
an Adverse Recommendation, Purchaser shall publicly reaffirm its
recommendation to its stockholders to support the Purchaser Stockholder
Approvals, concurrently with making such disclosure. When determining what is
required by Norwegian law pursuant to (i) and (ii) above, Purchaser shall
consult with Parent and consider in good faith the views of Parent and its
counsel before taking any such action.

cause to be requested, that each Person that has received

Prospectus Regulation, Purchaser shall ensure that it at all times is in
compliance with any prospectus publication obligation that is required in
order to facilitate such prompt listing on the Oslo Stock Exchange.

Closing (the " _Liquidity and Information Rights Agreement_ ") and an
amendment to the Articles of Association of Purchaser, in each case,
containing terms substantially consistent with the terms set forth in the
Governance Term Sheet. Without limiting the Parties' obligations pursuant to
the immediately preceding sentence, if for any reason the Liquidity and

Rights Agreement or such an amendment to the Articles of Association of

the Transition Services Agreement) to provide additional detail in the
description of the Services (as defined in the Transition Services Agreement)

that is not less than that in effect for such Transferred Business Employee
immediately prior to the Closing, (ii) short-term and long-term (including

the severance benefits that would have been payable to each such Transferred
Business Employee under a Parent severance plan set forth in _Section 6.2_ of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule that applied to such Transferred Business
Employee immediately prior to the Closing. Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
shall, in addition to meeting the applicable requirements of Article VI,
comply with any additional obligations or standards arising under applicable
(x) Laws, (y) Contracts or (z) Transferred Entity Benefit Plans, in each case,

entitlement, in each case maintained or made available for the benefit
of Transferred Business Employees as of and after the Closing by Purchaser or

Transferred Business Employee's service prior to the Closing (or, in the case
of an LTD Employee who becomes a Transferred Business Employee, prior to the
date of such LTD Employee's commencement of employment with Purchaser or
an Affiliate thereof) with Parent and its applicable Affiliates (including
the Transferred Entities) and their respective predecessors, to the same
extent such service is recognized by Parent and its applicable Affiliates
(including the Transferred Entities) immediately prior to the Closing or, for

Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable best efforts, or shall cause its
applicable Subsidiaries to use commercially reasonable best efforts to, cause
the Purchaser Health Plans to (i) not limit or exclude coverage on the basis
of any pre-existing condition of such Transferred Business Employee or
dependent (other than any limitation already in effect under the corresponding
group health Seller Benefit Plan or Transferred Entity Benefit Plan) or on
the basis of any other exclusion or waiting period not in effect under the
applicable group health Seller Benefit Plan or Transferred Entity Benefit
Plan, and (ii) to the extent that such Transferred Business Employee becomes

out-of-pocket expenses already incurred by the Transferred Business Employee
under the applicable group health Seller Benefit Plan or Transferred Entity
Benefit Plan during such year for purposes of any deductible, co-payment or

its applicable Affiliates for any payments made by them to any Transferred
Business Employees in respect of accrued but unused vacation, sick leave and

established in accordance with the first sentence of this _Section 6.7 _in
accordance with the terms of the Parent Group programs in effect immediately
prior to the Closing Date (in addition to, and not in lieu of, any vacation,

(collectively, the " _Purchaser U.S. DC Plans_ ") for the benefit of the
Transferred Business Employees who participated, as of immediately prior to

or its Affiliates (other than the Transferred Entities) that are intended to

compensation from Parent and its Affiliates and their respective predecessors
as if it were service with and compensation from Purchaser for purposes of
determining eligibility and vesting under each respective Purchaser U.S. DC
Plan. The applicable Purchaser U.S. DC Plans shall be tax-qualified in the
same manner as the corresponding Parent U.S. DC Plans, and Purchaser shall
provide Parent any determination letters or similar documentation evidencing
such qualification. Each Purchaser U.S. DC Plan will provide for the receipt
in kind from the Transferred Business Employees of "eligible rollover

Works Councils Act with the competent works council of Marktplaats BV in the
Netherlands (the " _Dutch Works Council_ " and such consultation procedure,

completed upon the Dutch Works Council having rendered an
unconditional advice or an advice with conditions accepted by Parent and,
solely to the extent that such conditions impose obligations that have a
material detrimental impact on Purchaser and its Affiliates (including the
Transferred Entities) after the Closing, accepted by Purchaser (which
acceptance shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
permitting the Parties to effect the Closing in respect of Marktplaats BV and
its Subsidiaries and the documents related thereto.

  

(b)  To the extent the Dutch Works Council does not render an
unconditional advice or an advice with conditions accepted by Parent and, if
applicable, Purchaser in accordance with _Section 6.15(a)_, permitting the
Parties to effect the Closing in respect of Marktplaats BV and its
Subsidiaries and the documents related thereto, the Dutch Works Council
Consultation Procedure will be deemed completed upon the board of Marktplaats
BV adopting a resolution that deviates from the advice of the Dutch
Works Council, if rendered, and:

  

(i)  the Dutch Works Council having unconditionally waived (A) the
applicable waiting period in accordance with article 25 paragraph 6 of the
Dutch Works Councils Act ( _Wet op de Ondernemingsraden_ ) and (B) its right
to initiate legal proceedings pursuant to article 26 of the Dutch Works
Councils Act;

6 of the Dutch Works Councils Act having expired without the Dutch Works
Council having initiated legal proceedings pursuant to the Dutch Works

measures obstructing the Closing to the extent it affects Marktplaats BV or
its Subsidiaries and the documents related thereto are imposed and the
dismissal by the Enterprise Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeals (
_Ondernemingskamer van het gerechtshof Amsterdam_ ) has immediate effect (

(c)  In the event of an initiation of legal proceedings pursuant to
article 26 of the Dutch Works Councils Act that results in the Enterprise
Chamber of the Amsterdam Court of Appeals ( _Ondernemingskamer van het
gerechtshof Amsterdam_ ) issuing a final (non-appealable) order deciding in
favor of the Dutch Works Council, Parent shall re-open the consultation with
the Dutch Works Council and the Dutch Works Council Consultation Procedure
shall be deemed completed if and once the procedure set forth in _Section
6.15(a) _or _6.15(b)_ has subsequently been satisfied.

communication and consultations in respect thereof and shall provide
Purchaser with copies of any minutes of meetings or other written
communications received from the Dutch Works Council, and Purchaser shall
promptly provide all information reasonably requested by Parent for

and purpose of this Agreement, changes, if any, to this Agreement solely to
the extent required to address the advice and views of the Dutch Works
Council.

  

(g)  To the extent that any arrangements proposed to be agreed with
the Dutch Works Council pursuant to _Section 6.14(f) _impose any material

election or conversion shall be required to be made if it would reasonably be
expected to have an adverse effect on Purchaser or any of its Affiliates that
is material.

  

(g)  Purchaser agrees that it will not take or fail to take, and
will not cause or permit any of its Affiliates to take or fail to take, any
action where such action or failure to act would, or could reasonably be
expected to, prevent the qualification of the Contribution and the Merger,
taken together, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

  

Section 7.4   _Certain Tax Matters_. Parent and Purchaser shall,
and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, use their reasonable best
efforts to take all actions, and do and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary to permit the Contribution
and the Merger, taken together, to qualify as a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. For U.S. federal income Tax purposes,
this Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3. On the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its relevant Subsidiary
(including DutchCo Merger Sub) to, deliver to Parent's tax counsel or other
tax advisor(s) customary representations, reasonably satisfactory in form and
substance to such counsel or advisor(s) for purposes of allowing such
counsel or advisor(s) to deliver to Parent a written opinion, in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, dated as of the Closing Date,
regarding the qualification of the Contribution and the Merger, taken
together, as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code.

reasonably may request in (i) filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return or
claim for refund, (ii) determining a Liability for Taxes or a right to refund
of Taxes, (iii) conducting any Tax Proceeding or (iv) making any Tax

taxing authorities and relevant records concerning the ownership and Tax
basis of property and other information, which any such Party may possess.

nor any of such Transferred Entities, on the other hand, shall have any
rights or obligations to each other after the Share Sale Effective Time or the

(a)  Except to the extent otherwise required pursuant to a
"determination" (within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or any
similar provision of state, local or foreign Law), Parent, Purchaser, the
Transferred Entities and their respective Affiliates shall treat any and all
payments under _Section 2.6_, _Section 6.6_, _Section 6.15_ and  _Article
X_ and/or the Undertaking as an adjustment to the IP Consideration, the Final

Contribution. The Party responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax
Returns with respect to any such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file
such Tax Returns and promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other
Party. Parent and Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, cooperate to timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other
filings relating to such Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any such Transfer Taxes;
_provided_ , that, notwithstanding any of the foregoing, neither Parent nor
any of its Affiliates shall be required to file any claim for exemption or
exclusion from the application or imposition of any such Transfer Taxes, or
any claim for any reduction thereof, if Parent determines in its sole
discretion that the filing of such claim or any related action would have an
adverse effect on Parent or any of its Affiliates.

  

Section 7.9   _Straddle Periods._ For purposes of determining the
Pre-Closing Tax Amount, with respect to any Taxes that are payable for a
Straddle Period, the portion of such Taxes that are allocable to the portion
of such Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall (a) in the case of
any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or receipts,
sales or use, employment, withholding or similar items, be deemed to be the
amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date (or the day prior to Closing, as applicable) and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period
and (b) in the case of any Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or
receipts, sales or use, employment, withholding or similar items, be deemed
equal to the portion of such Taxes that are allocable to such period computed
on a closing of the books basis as if the relevant Tax period ended as of the
close of business on the Closing Date; provided that (i) except as required by
Law, the Share Sale, the Classifieds DutchCo Distribution (and any related
distribution of Share Sale proceeds by a Subsidiary of Classifieds DutchCo to
facilitate the Classifieds DutchCo Distribution), the transactions
contemplated by the Pre-Closing Restructuring Plan, and any actions
taken pursuant to _Section 5.7_ (Intercompany Accounts; Cash) or _Section
5.8_ (Termination of Intercompany Arrangements) shall, in each case, be
considered as occurring in the portion of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date, and (ii) any Tax item determined on an annual or periodic basis
(such as deductions for depreciation or real estate Taxes) shall be
apportioned on a daily basis.

Section 7.10   _Certain Transaction Tax Matters._

  

(a)  In connection with the preparation and filing of any Tax Return
that reflects a Transaction Tax, Purchaser shall provide a draft of the
relevant portion of such Tax Return to Parent for its review and comment at
least thirty (30) Business Days prior to the due date for such Tax Return
(taking into account any applicable extensions). Purchaser shall revise the
relevant portion of any such Tax Return to reflect any reasonable comments
received from Parent not later than fifteen (15) Business Days before the
due date thereof (taking into account any applicable extensions). Except as
required by Law, Purchaser shall not amend or revoke any such Tax Return that
reflects a Transaction Tax without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) to the
extent such action would reasonably be expected to increase a Tax liability of
Parent.

  

(b)  In connection with any Tax Proceeding (or the portion thereof)
that relates to a Transaction Tax (a " _Covered Tax Proceeding_ "), Purchaser
shall provide prompt notice to Parent of any written communication from a tax
authority regarding any pending or threatened Tax proceeding or assessment
related to Transaction Taxes of which it becomes aware. Parent may, at its
expense, assume the conduct and control of such Covered Tax Proceeding;
provided, that (i) Purchaser shall be permitted to participate, at its own
expense, in such proceedings, and (ii) Parent shall not enter into settlement
of, or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, such proceedings
without the prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) if such settlement or entry of
judgment would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse impact on
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries (including the Transferred Entities) for any
Post-Closing Tax Period.

  

(c)  Parent shall be entitled to (i) any refunds or credits of or
against any Taxes for which Parent is responsible pursuant to _Section
10.2(a)(iv) _and (ii) payment in respect of any amount by which the amount
included in the Pre-Closing Tax Amount in respect of Transaction Taxes
exceeds any Liabilities of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties or Transferred
Entities for Transaction Taxes. Purchaser shall pay over (or caused to be
paid over) to Parent the amount of any such refund or credit (including any
interest paid thereon and net of any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
(including Taxes) incurred by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries in connection with
obtaining such refund or credit), or the amount of any such excess, as
applicable within fifteen (15) calendar days after actual receipt of such
refund or credit or the application of such refund or credit against amounts
otherwise payable, or after payment of any such Transaction Taxes, as
applicable.

consent, authorization or approval required under _Section 8.1(a)_ or
_Section 8.3(e)_) or _Section 8.3(e)_ has not been satisfied and (B) all of
the conditions to the Closing, other than any condition set forth in _Section

respect of a consent, authorization or approval required under _Section
8.1(a)_ or _Section 8.3(e)_) or _Section 8.3(e)_, have been satisfied (or
in the case of conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, are capable of being satisfied if the Closing were to occur on the
date of such termination) or waived; _provided_ , that no Regulatory
Termination Fee shall be payable by Purchaser pursuant to this _Section
9.3(c)_ if the failure of any condition set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_, 
_Section 8.1(b)_ (to the extent that the Legal Restraint is in respect of a
consent, authorization or approval required under _Section 8.1(a)_ or
_Section 8.3(e)_) or _Section 8.3(e)_ to be satisfied is caused by
Parent's Willful Breach of _Section 5.3_. Any Regulatory Termination Fee due
under this _Section 9.3(c)_ shall be paid by wire transfer to the account
specified in writing by SwissCo (or another designee of Parent) of same-day

(e)  Each Party acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained in
this _Section 9.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and (ii) without these agreements, the Parties would not enter
into this Agreement. The Parties acknowledge and hereby agree that the
Purchaser Termination Fee if, as and when required to be paid pursuant to this
_Section 9.3_, shall not constitute a penalty but will be liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate SwissCo (or its
designee) such amount in the circumstances in which it is payable for the
efforts and resources expended and opportunities foregone while negotiating
this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the
consummation of the Transactions, which amount would otherwise be impossible
to calculate with precision. In no event shall Purchaser be required to pay
more than one Purchaser Termination Fee pursuant to this Agreement.

  

(f)  Each of Parent and Purchaser and their respective Affiliates
shall take the position that any amount payable pursuant to this  _Section
9.3_ is not subject to (reverse charged) VAT, and shall act in a manner
consistent therewith (including filing Tax Returns consistent therewith and
using reasonable best efforts to contest any contrary position in a Tax audit
or similar proceeding). In no event shall any (reverse charged) VAT be
deducted from any amount payable pursuant to this _Section 9.3_, and no
Party (or its Affiliates) shall be under any obligation to reimburse any other
Party (or its Affiliates) for any (reverse charged) VAT levied from or due by
such other Party in respect of any amount payable pursuant to this _Section
9.3_.

of the other contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant
to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions of the other contained in this Agreement. Any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by
the Party granting such extension or waiver.

Section 10.4   _Indemnification Procedures_.

  

(a)  A Person that may be entitled to be indemnified under this
Agreement (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall promptly notify the party
liable for such indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") in writing of
any pending or threatened claim or demand asserted, or any other matter or
circumstance that arises, that has given or could reasonably be expected to
give rise to a right of indemnification under this Agreement (including a
pending or threatened claim or demand asserted by a third party against the
Indemnified Party, such claim being a " _Third Party Claim_ "); _provided_ ,
that the failure to provide such notice shall not release the Indemnifying
Party from any of its obligations under this _Article X_, except if the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced by such failure. Any such notice shall
describe in reasonable detail the facts and circumstances with respect to the
subject matter of such claim, demand, matter or circumstance, the provisions
of this Agreement pursuant to which indemnification may be sought and an
estimate of the Indemnified Party's Losses and shall be delivered prior to
the expiration of any applicable survival period specified in _Section 10.1_.

  

(b)  Upon receipt of a notice of a Third Party Claim for indemnity
from an Indemnified Party pursuant to _Section 10.2 _or  _Section 10.3_
(other than a Third Party Claim relating to Tax matters that is governed by
_Section 7.10_), the Indemnifying Party will be entitled, by notice to the
Indemnified Party delivered within twenty (20) Business Days of the receipt
of notice of such Third Party Claim, to assume the defense and control of such
Third Party Claim (at the expense of such Indemnifying Party); _provided_ ,
that the Indemnifying Party shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its
own counsel and at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume
the defense and control of any Third Party Claim pursuant to this _Section
10.4(b)_, the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assume and control such
defense, but the Indemnifying Party may nonetheless participate in the defense
of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. If the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense and control of a Third Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to select counsel, contractors and
consultants. Purchaser or Parent, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause
each of their respective Subsidiaries and Representatives to, reasonably
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party
Claim, including by furnishing books and records, personnel and witnesses, as
appropriate for any defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party has assumed the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, it shall be
authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any Third Party Claim, in its sole discretion and without the consent
of any Indemnified Party; _provided_ , that such settlement or judgment does
not involve any injunctive relief or finding or admission of any violation of
Law or admission of any wrongdoing by any Indemnified Party. No Indemnified
Party will consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement
or compromise with respect to a Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party in its sole and absolute discretion.

  

(c)  Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, Parent shall have the
exclusive right to control in all respects, and neither Purchaser nor any of
its Affiliates shall be entitled to participate in, any Tax Proceeding with
respect to any Tax Return of (i) Parent or any of its Affiliates or (ii) a
consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group that includes Parent or any
of its Affiliates.

Section 10.5   _Exclusive Remedy; No Recourse_.

  

(a)  Purchaser and Parent acknowledge and agree that, except (i) in
connection with Actual Fraud, (ii) with respect to the matters covered by
_Section 2.4_ through _2.6_ and (iii) for the Parties' right to seek and
obtain any equitable relief pursuant to _Section 11.11_, from and after the
Closing, the indemnification provisions of _Sections 10.2 _and _10.3_ shall
be the sole and exclusive remedies of Parent and Purchaser for any Liabilities
or Losses (including any Liabilities or Losses from claims for breach of
contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including negligence) or otherwise
and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict liability or otherwise)
that either Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a
result of, or in connection with the Transactions or the other transactions
contemplated hereby, including any breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or the Local Share Transfer Agreements
(but excluding the other Ancillary Agreements and the Confidentiality
Agreement). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser
hereby irrevocably waives any right of rescission it may otherwise have or to
which it may become entitled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, (x) Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it is relying exclusively
on, and its sole recourse for any actual or alleged breach of any
representation or warranty (other than the Parent Fundamental Representations)
set forth in this Agreement (or any certificate or other document delivered
hereunder, excluding the Stockholder Agreement) will be, the Purchaser RandW
Insurance Policy and (y) Parent acknowledges and agrees that it is relying
exclusively on, and its sole recourse for any actual or alleged breach of any
representation or warranty (other than the Purchaser Fundamental
Representations) set forth in this Agreement (or any certificate or other
document delivered hereunder, excluding the Liquidity and Information
Rights Agreement) will be, any representations and warranties insurance
policy that Parent elects to obtain.

  

(b)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Purchaser (on
behalf of itself, its Subsidiaries (including, from and after the Closing,
the Transferred Entities) and its and its Subsidiaries' respective officers,
directors, employees, members, partners, stockholders, other equityholders,
Representatives and agents, and their respective successors and assigns
(collectively, but excluding Purchaser, the " _Purchaser Related Parties_ "))
hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all rights,
claims and causes of action against, and shall have no recourse of any kind to
any of Parent's Affiliates or any of Parent's or any of its Affiliates'
respective officers, directors, employees, members, partners,
stockholders, other equity holders, Representatives or agents, and their
respective successors and assigns (collectively, but excluding Parent, the "
_Parent Related Parties_ ") under any theory of law or equity, including under
any control person liability theory, for any Losses relating to or arising
from any actual or alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement set forth in this Agreement (or any certificate or other document
delivered hereunder) or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions
or the other transactions contemplated hereby, including by virtue of or based
upon any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement (or any certificate or other document delivered hereunder), the
subject matter of this Agreement, the ownership, operation, management, use
or control of the Business or any of the Transferred Entities prior to the
Closing, any of their respective assets or liabilities, or any actions or
omissions at or prior to the Closing, whether by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law.

(c)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Parent (on
behalf of the itself and the Parent Related Parties) hereby waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, any and all rights, claims and causes of
action against, and shall have no recourse of any kind to any of the
Purchaser Related Parties (other than any party to the Support Agreements),
under any theory of law or equity, including under any control person
liability theory, for any Losses relating to or arising from any actual or
alleged breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set
forth in this Agreement (or any certificate or other document delivered
hereunder) or in connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, including by virtue of or based upon
any alleged misrepresentation or inaccuracy in or breach of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or obligations set forth in this
Agreement (or any certificate or other document delivered hereunder) or the
subject matter of this Agreement, whether by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, or by virtue of any
statute, regulation or other applicable Law.

  

(d)  Parent and Purchaser agree that the limits imposed on remedies
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
constitute an integral part of the consideration provided to Parent hereunder,
were specifically bargained for between sophisticated parties and their
respective counsel and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to Parent hereunder.

  

Section 10.6   _Additional Indemnification Provisions_. With respect
to each indemnification obligation contained in this Agreement, all Losses
shall be increased to take into account any Tax costs actually incurred by the
Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection with the incurrence the
receipt of the indemnity payment (to the extent such Taxes are (x) not already
covered in the computation of the Losses and (y) payable in respect of the
taxable year in which such Losses are incurred or either of the two
succeeding taxable years) but shall be reduced by (a) any Tax benefits
actually realized by the Indemnified Party or its Affiliates in connection
with the incurrence of such Losses in the taxable year in which such Losses
are incurred or either of the two succeeding taxable years and (b) the amount
of any third-party insurance or reimbursement proceeds that have
been recovered by the Indemnified Party in connection with the facts giving
rise to the right of indemnification (it being agreed that if such proceeds
in respect of such facts are recovered by the Indemnified Party subsequent to
the Indemnifying Party's making of an indemnification payment in satisfaction
of its applicable indemnification obligation, such proceeds shall be
promptly remitted to the Indemnifying Party to the extent such reduction of
the Losses would have reduced the Indemnifying Party's indemnification
obligations), and the Indemnified Party shall use, and cause its Subsidiaries
to use, reasonable best efforts to seek full recovery under all insurance and
other indemnity and reimbursement provisions covering such Losses to the same
extent as it would if such Losses were not subject to indemnification
hereunder. Upon making any payment to the Indemnified Party for any
indemnification claim pursuant to this _Article X_, the Indemnifying Party
shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any rights or claims
which the Indemnified Party may have against any third parties with respect to
the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim, and the Indemnified
Party shall assign any such rights or claims to the Indemnifying Party or,
where such assignment is not permitted, use commercially reasonable efforts to
recover in respect of such rights or claims against the third parties on
behalf of the Indemnifying Party.

Section 10.7   _Limitation of Liability_. In no event shall any
Indemnifying Party have Liability to any Indemnified Party for, and Losses
shall not be deemed to include, any consequential, special, incidental,
exemplary, indirect, punitive or similar damages, or for any loss of future
revenue, profits or income, or for any diminution in value damages measured as
a multiple of earnings, revenue or any other performance metric, except for
any such damages to the extent actually awarded by a court of competent
jurisdiction and paid to a third party. No Indemnified Party shall have any
right to assert any claim against any Indemnifying Party with respect to any
Loss to the extent such alleged Loss is a possible or potential Loss the
Indemnified Party believes may be asserted rather than an actual Loss that
has, in fact, been actually paid or incurred by such Indemnified Party.
Neither the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, on the one hand, nor the Parent
Indemnified Parties, on the other hand, shall be entitled to recover more than
once in respect of any Loss. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, in no event shall any Indemnified Party be entitled to
indemnification pursuant to this _Article X_ to the extent any Losses were
attributable to such Indemnified Party's own Actual Fraud, gross negligence
or Willful Breach.

  

Section 10.8   _Mitigation_. Each Party agrees to use, and to cause
its Affiliates to use, its reasonable best efforts to mitigate its respective
Losses upon and after becoming aware of any event or condition that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that are indemnifiable
hereunder, and no Indemnifying Party shall be liable for any Losses to the
extent they arise out of or result from the Indemnified Party's failure to
use reasonable best efforts to mitigate such Losses.

(a)  Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, whether the

Section 11.8   _Successors and Assigns_ _._ This Agreement shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties to
this Agreement and their respective successors and assigns; _provided_ , that
no Party to this Agreement may directly or indirectly assign (whether by
operation of Law or otherwise) any or all of its rights or delegate any or all
of its obligations under this Agreement without the express prior written
consent of the other Party to this Agreement; _provided _ (i) Purchaser or
Parent (as applicable, the " _Assigning Party_ ") may assign any or all of its
rights and its related obligations hereunder to any of its Subsidiaries;
_provided_ , _further_ , that any such assignment shall not relieve the
Assigning Party of its obligations hereunder, and (ii) the Purchaser (or any
party to which the Purchaser has assigned its rights under this Agreement
pursuant to sub-paragraph (i) above) may charge and/or assign by way of
security the benefit of this Agreement to any Lender, Replacement Financing
Lender or source of Debt Financing or Replacement Debt Financing, in each
case, upon written notice to the Parent. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Purchaser shall be responsible for, and shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent and its Affiliates from and against, any
and all incremental Taxes that result from an assignment by Purchaser
pursuant to the proviso in the preceding sentence, for the avoidance of doubt
including any increase in the amount of Tax required to be deducted or
withheld pursuant to _Section 7.9_.

  

Section 11.9   _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement may not be
modified or amended, except by an instrument or instruments in writing signed
by each Party. Any Party to this Agreement may, only by an instrument in
writing, waive compliance by the other Party to this Agreement with any term
or provision of this Agreement on the part of such other Party to this
Agreement to be performed or complied with. The waiver by any Party to this
Agreement of a breach of any term or provision of this Agreement shall not
be construed as a waiver of any subsequent breach. No failure or delay by any
Party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as
a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power
or privilege.

Section 11.10   _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or
other authority to be invalid, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such a determination, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties
as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner so that the
transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

  

Section 11.11   _Specific Performance_. The Parties agree that
irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if available) would not
be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the Parties do not
perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance with its specified
terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they
are entitled in Law or in equity. Each Party agrees that it will not oppose
the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that any other Party has an adequate remedy at Law or that
any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason
at Law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
other security in connection with such order or injunction. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that any limitations on remedies of the Parties
following termination of this Agreement set forth in _Section 9.3_ shall not
limit the right of either Party to obtain specific performance pursuant to
this _Section 11.11_. If, prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings any
Action in accordance with _Section 11.3_ to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other Party, the
Outside Date shall automatically be extended by (x) the amount of time during
which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such
other time period established by the court presiding over such action.

  

Section 11.12   _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation;
Nonassertion of Attorney-Client Privilege_.

  

(a)  Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Transferred Entities, to waive and not to assert,
any conflict of interest arising out of or relating to the representation,
after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing Representation_ "), of Parent, any of
its Affiliates or any stockholder, officer, employee or director of Parent or
any of its Affiliates (any such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any
matter involving this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements or any other
agreements or transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, by Wachtell,
Lipton, Rosen and Katz, Quinn Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, LLP, Advokatfirmaet
Thommessen AS and De Brauw Blackstone Westbroek N.V. (the " _Current
Representation "_).

--- 

      

(b)  Purchaser waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause its
Subsidiaries, including the Transferred Entities, to waive and not to assert,
any attorney-client or other applicable legal privilege or protection with
respect to any communication between Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, Quinn
Emanuel Urquhart and Sullivan, LLP, Advokatfirmaet Thommessen AS and De Brauw
Blackstone Westbroek N.V. and any Designated Person occurring during the
Current Representation in connection with any Post-Closing Representation,
including in connection with a dispute with Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, and
following the Closing, with any Transferred Entity (including in respect of
any claim for indemnification by Purchaser), it being the intention of the
Parties that all such rights to such attorney-client and other applicable
legal privilege or protection and to control such attorney-client and other
applicable legal privilege or protection shall be retained by Parent and that
Parent, and not Purchaser, its Affiliates or the Transferred Entities, shall
have the sole right to decide whether or not to waive any attorney-client
or other applicable legal privilege or protection. Accordingly, from and
after Closing, none of Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or the Transferred
Entities shall have any access to any such communications or to the files of
the Current Representation, all of which shall be and remain the property of
Parent and not of Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or the Transferred Entities, or
to internal counsel of Parent and its Affiliates relating to such engagement,
and none of Purchaser, its Affiliates, the Transferred Entities or any Person
acting or purporting to act on their behalf shall seek to obtain the same by
any process on the grounds that the privilege and protection attaching to
such communications and files belongs to Purchaser, its Subsidiaries or the
Transferred Entities, or does not belong to Parent.

  

Section 11.13   _Financing Sources._

  

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent on behalf
of itself, its Subsidiaries and each of its controlled Affiliates hereby: (a)
agrees that any proceeding, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, involving the Financing Parties or Replacement
Financing Lenders, arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, the Replacement Financing or any of the agreements (including the
Commitment Letter and any Replacement Financing Document) entered into in
connection with the Debt Financing, Replacement Financing or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any
services thereunder shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, New York, so
long as such forum is and remains available, and any appellate court thereof
and each party hereto irrevocably submits itself and its property with
respect to any such proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such court,
(b) agrees that any such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the
State of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law
principles that would result in the application of the laws of another
state), except as otherwise provided in the Commitment Letter,
any Replacement Financing Document or other applicable definitive document
relating to the Debt Financing or Replacement Financing, as applicable, (c)
agrees not to bring or support or permit any of its Affiliates to bring or
support any proceeding of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Party in any way arising out of or relating to, this Agreement, the Debt
Financing, Replacement Financing, the Commitment Letter, the
Replacement Financing Documents or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder in any forum
other than any federal or state court in the Borough of Manhattan, New York,
New York, (d) agrees that service of process upon Parent or its controlled
Affiliates in any such proceeding shall be effective if notice is given in
accordance with _Section 11.7_, (e) irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent that it may effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to
the maintenance of such proceeding in any such court, (f) knowingly,
intentionally and voluntarily waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law trial by jury in any proceeding brought against the Financing
Parties and Replacement Financing Lenders in any way arising out of or
relating to, this Agreement, the Debt Financing, Replacement Financing, the
Commitment Letter, the Replacement Financing Documents or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services
thereunder, (g) agrees that none of the Financing Parties or Replacement
Financing Lenders will have any liability to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective Affiliates or representatives (in
each case, other than Purchaser and its Affiliates) relating to or arising
out of this Agreement, the Debt Financing, Replacement Financing, the
Commitment Letter, Replacement Financing Documents or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the performance of any services thereunder,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise and
(h) agrees that the Financing Parties and Replacement Financing Lenders are
express third party beneficiaries of, and may enforce, any of the provisions
of this _Section 11.13_ and _Section 9.3(d) _and _Section 11.9_, and that
such provisions shall not be amended in any way (i) adverse to the Financing
Parties without the prior written consent of the Financing Parties and (ii)
adverse to the Replacement Financing Parties without the prior written
consent of the Replacement Financing Parties.

Section 11.14   _No Admission_. Nothing herein shall be deemed an
admission by Purchaser, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, in any
Action or proceeding by or on behalf of a third party, that Purchaser, Parent
or any of their respective Affiliates, or that such third party or any of its
Affiliates, is or is not in breach or violation of, or in default in, the
performance or observance of any term or provisions of any Contract.

  

Section 11.15   _Release_.

  

(a)  Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser, on behalf of itself and
each Purchaser Related Party, hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and
completely waives and releases and forever discharges, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, Parent and each Parent Related Party (such
released Persons, the " _Purchaser Releasees_ "), in each case from all
demands, proceedings, causes of action, suits, accounts, covenants,
Contracts, Losses and Liabilities whatsoever of every name and nature, both in
law and in equity, arising out of or related to events, circumstances,
actions or omissions taken or not taken by the Purchaser Releasees, the
Business, the Retained Business or the Transferred Entities, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, managers, members,
partners, stockholders, other equityholders, Representatives or agents, in
each case, to the extent based upon facts, circumstances, occurrences or
omissions existing, occurring or arising at or prior to the Closing and
relating to or arising out of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, the Retained Business, the Transferred Entities or the
Business, or any of their respective assets or liabilities; _provided_ , that
such release will not cover and therefore will not affect any rights of
Purchaser or any Purchaser Related Party under this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, or any claims against any Purchaser Releasees for Actual Fraud.
Purchaser shall not make, and shall not permit any Purchaser Related Party to
make, any claim or demand, or commence any proceeding asserting any claim or
demand, including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against
any of the Purchaser Releasees with respect to any Liabilities released
pursuant to this _Section 11.15(a)_.

shall not make, and shall not permit any Parent Related Party to make, any
claim or demand, or commence any proceeding asserting any claim or demand,
including any claim of contribution or any indemnification, against any of
the Parent Releasees with respect to any Liabilities released pursuant to this
_Section 11.15(b)_.
