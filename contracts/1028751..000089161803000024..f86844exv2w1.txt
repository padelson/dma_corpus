                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER


      This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered
into as of January 5, 2003, by and among Automatic Data Processing, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), ADP Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and
indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and ProBusiness
Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY").

                                    RECITALS

      A.    The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and stockholders to consummate the Merger (as defined in Section
1.1), on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

      B.    The respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company have approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

      C.    The Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to recommend to
its stockholders approval and adoption of this Agreement and approval of the
Merger.

      D.    Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a
condition and inducement to Parent's, the Company's and Merger Sub's respective
willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain stockholders of the Company
are entering into Stockholder Support Agreements in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "STOCKHOLDER AGREEMENTS").

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises and
representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties agree
as follows:

                                   ARTICLE I
                                   THE MERGER

      1.1 The Merger. At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware
("DELAWARE LAW"), Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company (the
"MERGER"), the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the
Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the
surviving corporation after the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as
the "SURVIVING CORPORATION."

      1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement,
the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the
<PAGE>
"CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") (the time of such filing with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by the
Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger) being the
"EFFECTIVE TIME") as soon as practicable on the Closing Date (as defined below).
The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at the offices of
Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, 1285 Avenue of the Americas, New York,
NY 10019, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no
later than the second business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and location as
the parties hereto agree in writing (the "CLOSING DATE").

      1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger
shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Delaware
Law.

      1.4 Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and shall be amended and restated in
its entirety to be identical to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub,
as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended
in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate of
Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company shall be the
Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and shall be amended and restated in their
entirety to be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware
Law and as provided in such Bylaws.

      1.5 Directors and Officers. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed
and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the
officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their
respective successors are duly appointed.

      1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action
on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of any shares of
capital stock of the Company, the following shall occur:

            (a) Company Preferred Stock. In accordance with Section 4(d) of the
Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the 6.9% Senior
Convertible Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware on August 1, 2000 (the "CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION"), subject to the
election of the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the Company Preferred Stock (as
defined in Section 2.2(a)) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (which election has been obtained concurrently with the execution
of this Agreement), each share of Company Preferred Stock (including shares of
Company Preferred Stock issued or issuable immediately prior to the Closing in
accordance with Section 3 of the Certificate of Designation) (other than shares
of Company Preferred Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and any
Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 1.8)), will be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive $26.50 in
cash (the "PREFERRED PER SHARE LIQUIDATION AMOUNT") (such amount being an amount
equal to the liquidation preference set forth in Section 4(a) of the Certificate
of Designation).

            (b) Company Common Stock. Each share of the Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (together with the associated Company Right (as
defined in Section


                                      -2-
<PAGE>
2.2(a)) under the Company Rights Agreement (as defined in Section 2.2(a))
("COMPANY COMMON STOCK")) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and any Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and
extinguished and automatically converted into the right to receive $17 per share
(the "PER SHARE AMOUNT" and, together with the Preferred Per Share Liquidation
Amount referred to herein as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").

            (c) Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock. Each share of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held by the Company or Parent or
any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished
without any conversion thereof.

            (d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par
value $0.01, of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one
validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

            (e) Conversion of Dissenting Shares. The holders of Dissenting
Shares, if any, shall be entitled to payment for such shares only to the extent
permitted by and in accordance with the provisions of Delaware Law; provided,
however, that if, in accordance with Delaware Law, any holder of Dissenting
Shares shall forfeit such right to payment of the fair cash value of such
shares, such shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration provided in Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b), as
applicable.

            (f) Repurchase Rights. The Board of Directors of the Company,
without any further action by Parent, shall take all actions necessary pursuant
to the terms of the Company's 2002 Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 1997
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the "COMPANY PURCHASE PLANS") to
shorten all Offering Periods (as defined in the Company Purchase Plans) such
that all Offering Periods then in progress terminate no later than immediately
prior to the Effective Time.

            (g) Employee Stock Options. Each Company Option or Other Option
(both as defined in Section 2.2(b)) which is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall become a right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share subject
thereto, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over the per share
exercise or purchase price of such Company Option or such Other Option (such
amount being hereinafter referred to as the "OPTION MERGER CONSIDERATION") and
each Company Option and Other Option shall be canceled at the Effective Time.
The payment of the Option Merger Consideration to the holder of a Company Option
or Other Option shall be reduced by any income or employment tax withholding
required under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax (as
defined in Section 2.6) law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of such Company Option or Other Option. The Stock Option
Plans (as defined in Section 2.12(a)) shall terminate at the Effective Time.


                                      -3-
<PAGE>
            (h) Adjustments to the Merger Consideration. The Merger
Consideration shall be adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any
stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other
like change with respect to Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective
Time.

      1.7 Surrender of Certificates.

            (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall select
a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as the
exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement with Exchange Agent, reasonably
satisfactory to the Company.

            (b) Parent to Provide Cash. At or promptly following the Effective
Time (and in no event later than one (1) business day following the Effective
Time), Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in
accordance with this Article I, cash payable to the stockholders of the Company
pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b) in exchange for outstanding shares
of Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock, respectively. Any funds
deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
"EXCHANGE FUND."

            (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in
no event later than three (3) business days following the Effective Time),
Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of
the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "CERTIFICATES") which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock whose shares were converted into
the right to receive cash pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b): (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration to which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b) (without limiting the effect of Section
1.7(e)). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in
accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive promptly (and in no event later than three (3)
business days after receipt thereof) in exchange therefor the Merger
Consideration to which the holder of such certificate is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b) (less any withholding amount with respect to
the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock held by such
holder as provided by Section 1.7(e)), and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid on the amounts
payable pursuant to this Article I upon surrender of the Certificates.

            (d) Transfers of Ownership. If the payment of the amounts payable
pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b) is to be made to a person other
than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate formerly evidencing
shares of Company Common Stock or Company


                                      -4-
<PAGE>
Preferred Stock, as applicable, are registered, it will be a condition of
payment that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed and
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons (as defined in
Section 8.3(d)) requesting such payment will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 2.6)
required by reason of the payment of the amount specified in Section 1.6(a) or
Section 1.6(b) to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificates
surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent
designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

            (e) Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent and the
Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any
holder or former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock such
amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code
or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other
applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(d)). To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such consideration shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
to whom such consideration would otherwise have been paid.

            (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party
hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

            (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided that no such
investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to Company
stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any interest and other income resulting
from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts
in excess of the amounts payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this
Article I shall promptly be paid to Parent.

            (h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months after
the Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation, be
delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of the
Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have not
surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section 1.7 shall after
such delivery to the Surviving Corporation look only to the Surviving
Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar laws) for
payment, as general creditors thereof, of their claim for the Merger
Consideration, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled pursuant
to Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b). Any such portion of the Exchange Fund
remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in Section
2.3(c)) shall, to the extent permitted by law, become the property of Parent
free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled
thereto.

            (i) No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock.

            (j)At the close of business on the day of the Effective Time, there
shall be no further


                                      -5-
<PAGE>
registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares
of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock. From and after the Effective
Time, the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock except
as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent,
they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, as provided
in this Article I, subject to applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares.

such shares in accordance with Section 1.7.

            (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any demands
for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock,

accordance with GAAP) for the payment of, all Taxes required to be paid (whether
or not shown on any Tax Returns), and the most recent financial statements
contained in the Company SEC Reports reflect an adequate reserve (in accordance
with GAAP) for all Taxes payable by the Company and its Subsidiaries through the
date of such financial statements. No material deficiencies for any Taxes have
been asserted or assessed, or, to the Knowledge (as defined in Section 8.3(b))

notified of any request for such an audit or other examination.

the collection or assessment or reassessment of, Taxes due from the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries for any taxable period and no request for any such
waiver or extension is currently pending. There are no Liens for Taxes upon the
assets or properties of the Company or any Subsidiary except for statutory Liens
for current Taxes not yet due. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
is a party to any agreement relating to the sharing, allocation or
indemnification of Taxes, or any similar agreement, contract or arrangement,
(collectively, "TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS") or has any liability for Taxes of any
Person (other than members of the affiliated group, within the meaning of
Section 1504(a) of the Code, filing consolidated federal income tax returns of
which the Company is the common parent) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-6, Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-78 or similar provision of state,
local or foreign law, as a transferee or successor, by Contract, or otherwise.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has executed or entered into a

"IRS") or comparable ruling of any other Tax authority, and there is no
currently pending private letter ruling request to the IRS or comparable ruling
request to any other Tax authority, relating to either the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. The Company and its Subsidiaries have each withheld (or will
withhold) from their respective employees, independent contractors, creditors,
stockholders and third parties and timely paid to the appropriate Tax authority
proper and accurate amounts in all material respects for all periods ending on
or before the Closing Date in compliance with all Tax withholding and remitting
provisions of applicable laws. No claim in writing has been made by any
Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries files Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. The Company and its Subsidiaries have given or otherwise made
available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of all Tax Returns,
examination reports and statements of deficiencies for taxable periods, or
transactions consummated, for which the applicable statutory periods of
limitations have not expired. The Company and its Subsidiaries have, in all
material respects, charged their customers all sales, goods and services, and
other similar Taxes required to be charged under the laws and regulations of all
applicable taxing jurisdictions. All such Taxes have been collected and remitted
to the appropriate Tax authority in a timely manner in all material respects.

legally required, all permits, licenses, authorizations, franchises, variances,
exemptions, orders and approvals from Governmental Entities ("PERMITS") that are
required for the operation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries,
as currently conducted, the failure to hold which, individually or in the
aggregate, would have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company (collectively,
"COMPANY PERMITS"). As of the date hereof, no suspension or cancellation of any

threatened. The Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material
respects with the terms of the Company Permits.

that is under common control with the Company within the meaning of Section 414
of the Code (each an "ERISA AFFILIATE") has any present or future right to

equity based compensation plan, equity award to any Person (whether payable in
cash, shares or otherwise) (to the extent not issued pursuant to any of the
foregoing plans) or other plan or Contract of any nature with any Person
(whether or not an employee) pursuant to which any stock, option, warrant or
other right to purchase or acquire capital stock of the Company or right to
payment based on the value of the Company capital stock has been granted or
otherwise issued (collectively, "COMPANY STOCK OPTION PLANS"). The Company has
provided or made available to Parent with respect to each Plan, a true, correct
and complete copy thereof and to the extent applicable: (i) the most recent
documents (including all amendments and trusts or other funding instruments
constituting each Plan; (ii) the three most recent annual reports (Form Series
5500 and all schedules and financial statements attached thereto), if any,
required under ERISA or the Code in connection with each Plan; (iii) all IRS
determination, opinion, notification and advisory letters relating to any Plan;
(iv) if the Plan is funded, the most recent periodic accounting of the Plan

benefits provided under a Plan; (vi) for the last three years all material
correspondence with the IRS and the Department of Labor (the "DOL"); and (vii)
any other document reasonably requested by Parent.

            (b) Each Plan has been maintained and administered in material
compliance with its terms and with the requirements prescribed by any and all
statutes, orders, rules and regulations (foreign or domestic), including ERISA
and the Code, that are applicable to such Plans. No suit, action, Lien or other
litigation (excluding claims for benefits incurred in the ordinary course of
Plan activities) has been brought, or to the Knowledge of the Company is
threatened, against or with respect to any such Plan, except as would not result
in material liability to the Company. There are no audits, inquiries or
proceedings pending by the IRS or the DOL with respect to any Plans. Any Plan
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code and each trust
intended to qualify under Section 501(a) of the Code (i) has either applied for
or obtained a favorable determination, notification, advisory and/or opinion
letter, as applicable, as to its qualified status from the IRS or still has a
remaining period of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS
pronouncements in which to apply for such letter and to make any amendments
necessary to obtain a favorable determination, and (ii) incorporates or has been
amended to incorporate all provisions required to comply with the Tax Reform Act
of 1986 and subsequent legislation, unless the Plan still has a remaining period
of time under applicable Treasury Regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to
conform to such legislation, and to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no
facts or


                                      -16-
<PAGE>
circumstances that could reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such
qualification or the imposition of any material liability, penalty or tax under
ERISA, the Code or any other applicable laws, rules or regulations. With respect
to each Plan: (i) all reports, returns, notices and other documentation that are
required to have been filed with or furnished to the IRS and the DOL, the SEC or

Plan have been filed or furnished on a timely basis, and (ii) no individual who
has performed services for the Company or its Subsidiaries has been improperly
excluded from participation, except in each case for violations which would not
reasonably be expected to cause material harm to the Company. All contributions
(including all employer contributions and employee salary reduction
contributions) or premium payments required to be made by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in respect of any Plan have been timely paid or accrued, except as
would not result in material liability to the Company. Neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate have any liability, whether contingent or otherwise, with
respect to any plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code
which remains unsatisfied.

            (c) Neither the Company, its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of

requirements of ERISA, the Code or any other applicable laws in connection with
the administration or investment of the assets of any Plan.

            (d) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate has at any time ever
maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, contributed to, been
requested to contribute to, or had any liability, whether contingent or
otherwise, with respect to any "multiemployer plan," as such term is defined in
Section 3(37)(A) of ERISA. Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate have at
any time ever maintained, established, sponsored, participated in, contributed
to, or had any liability, whether contingent or otherwise, with respect to, (i)
any multiple employer plan, or to any plan described in Section 413 of the Code,
(ii) any "multiple-employer welfare arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40) of
ERISA, (iii) a Plan subject to Section 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, or (iv) a Plan
maintained outside of the jurisdiction of the United States. None of the Plans
promises or provides retiree medical or other retiree benefits to any person
except as required by applicable law, including without limitation, coverage
required under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as
amended.

            (e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is bound by or
subject to (and none of its respective assets or properties is bound by or
subject to) any arrangement with any labor union. No employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries is represented by any labor union or covered by any
collective bargaining agreement and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no
campaign to establish such representation is in progress. There is no pending
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened labor dispute, strike or work
stoppage involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and any group of its
employees. The Company is in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable foreign, federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations
respecting employment, employment and labor practices, terms and conditions of
employment and wages and hours, in each case, with respect to its current or
former employees, except in each case for


                                      -17-
<PAGE>
compliance violations which would not reasonably be expected to cause material
harm to the Company. The Company has not received written notice of any

contract by the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs or comparable
state agency (the "OFCCP"), (ii) has not received a notice to show cause from
the OFCCP, and (iii) does not have an action pending with the OFCCP.

            (f) Neither any payment or benefit which will or may be made by the
Company or its Subsidiaries, nor the execution and delivery of this Agreement
nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
combination of another event) shall (i) result in the payment of any amount
which could be characterized as a "parachute payment," within the meaning of
Code Section 280G(b)(2), (ii) result in any material payment becoming due, or
materially increase the amount of any compensation due, to any current or former
employee of the Company or its Subsidiaries, (iii) materially increase any
benefits otherwise payable under any Plan, (iv) result in the acceleration of
the time of payment or vesting of any such compensation or benefits, or (v)
result in the triggering or imposition of any restrictions or limitations on the
rights of the Company or its Subsidiaries to amend or terminate any Plan.

            (g) To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company and its
Subsidiaries nor any organization to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a

harm to the Company.

            (j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to
any Contract or other arrangement which could result in the payment of material
amounts that could be non-deductible by reason of Section 162(m) of the Code.

            (k) Each Plan which is a "group health plan" within the meaning of
Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code and Section 607(l) of ERISA has been administered

segregated tax accounts maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries on behalf

manner to the applicable Tax authorities all amounts that are required to be

periods then ended, except in the event that any failure to pay such amount to
such authorities was (i) caused solely by the refusal or inability of the
customer to pay such amount to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) caused
solely by the failure of the customer to provide accurate data to the Company
and its Subsidiaries or (iii) in the ordinary course of business. To the
Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries have timely filed
with the applicable Tax authorities all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed in connection with the Trust Tax Funds held in the Tax Accounts, except in
the event that any failure to timely file such Tax Returns with such authorities
was (i) caused solely by the failure of the customer to provide in a timely
manner the information necessary to make such filings or (ii) in the ordinary
course of business. The aggregate Assumed Customer Tax Obligations are equal to
the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of Trust Tax Funds held in the Tax Accounts
plus (ii) the relevant portion of Tax Account Receivables (as defined in Section
5.13), if any, with the exception of the realized loss in value of a financial
instrument described in Section 2.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter of which
corporate funds will ultimately be transferred into the Tax Account to remedy
the differential. "TRUST TAX FUNDS" shall mean, with respect to any date, all
federal and state payroll, social security, Medicare, unemployment and other
trust Taxes held in Tax Accounts that were (i) withheld by the Company or its
Subsidiaries from the payroll of employees of, or otherwise collected from, the
Company's or its Subsidiaries' customers in connection with the payroll
processing and tax filing services of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
such date and (ii) not yet remitted to the applicable Tax authorities as of such
date. "ASSUMED CUSTOMER TAX OBLIGATIONS" shall mean with respect to any date,
obligations of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries as of such date (i) to remit
to the Tax authorities on behalf of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' customers
after such date all federal and state payroll, social security, Medicare,
unemployment and other trust Taxes that are required to be paid and (ii) to
refund to the Company's or its Subsidiaries' customers after such date any Trust
Tax Funds over-impounded from such customers by the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with the payroll processing and tax
filing services performed by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries prior to such
date; provided that, for purposes hereof, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
shall only be regarded as having such an obligation if, and to the extent that,
a customer has paid, or Trust Tax Funds have been over-impounded by, the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries in respect thereof prior to such date. To the Company's
Knowledge, set forth on Section 2.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter is a true
and correct list as of December 20, 2002 of penalties and interest relating to
assessments with respect to payroll Tax Returns filed on behalf of the clients
of the Company or its Subsidiaries which, at the time the Company received
notice of such assessments, were deemed individually to represent potential
exposure to the Company and Subsidiaries, or their clients, in excess of
$250,000.

            (b) Trust Non-Tax Funds. All Trust Non-Tax Funds amounts have been
held in segregated non-tax accounts maintained by the Company or its
Subsidiaries on behalf of their customers (the "NON-TAX ACCOUNTS"). Such amounts
are not commingled with funds of the Company or its Subsidiaries and no amounts
have been paid out of such accounts other than (i) payments to the applicable
regulatory authorities of such withheld amounts on behalf of such


                                      -23-
<PAGE>
customers or to authorized recipients or (ii) payments returning any such
amounts (or any portion of such amounts) to such customers. To the Knowledge of
the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries have paid in a timely manner to
the applicable regulatory authorities (or authorized recipients) all amounts
that are required to be paid to such authorities (or authorized recipients) on
behalf of customers in respect of all payroll periods then ended, except in the
event that any failure to pay such amount to such authorities (or authorized
recipients) was (i) caused solely by the refusal or inability of the customer to
pay such amount to the Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) caused solely by the
failure of the customer to provide accurate data to the Company and its
Subsidiaries or (iii) in the ordinary course of business. To the Knowledge of
the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries have timely filed with the
applicable regulatory authorities or authorized recipients all filings, if any,
that are required to be filed in connection with the Trust Non-Tax Funds held in
the Non-Tax Accounts, except in the event that any failure to timely file such
filings with such authorities was (i) caused solely by the failure of the
customer to provide in a timely manner the information necessary to make such
filings or (ii) in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate Assumed
Customer Non-Tax Obligations are equal to the sum of (i) the aggregate amount of
Trust Non-Tax Funds held in the Non-Tax Accounts plus (ii) the relevant portion
of Trust Account Receivables, if any. "TRUST NON-TAX FUNDS" shall mean, with
respect to any date, (a) all customers' employees' net pay (in connection with
direct deposit services or check services) and (b) all workers' compensation or
other insurance premiums or contributions (whether on behalf of the employer or
employee) to 401(k) or other similar investment plans that were withheld by the
Company or its Subsidiaries from the payroll of employees of, or otherwise
collected from, the Company's or its Subsidiaries' customers in connection with
the payroll processing services of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to
such date, which in each case, were not yet remitted to the applicable
regulatory authorities or other authorized recipients as of such date and are
held in Non-Tax Accounts. "ASSUMED CUSTOMER NON-TAX OBLIGATIONS" shall mean with
respect to any date, obligations of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries as of
such date (i) to remit to the applicable regulatory authorities or other
authorized recipients on behalf of the Company's or its Subsidiaries' customers
after such date all workers' compensation or other insurance premiums or
contributions (whether on behalf of employer or employee) to 401(k) or other
similar investment plans or customers' employees' net pay (in connection with
direct deposit services or check services) that are required to be paid and (ii)
to refund to the Company's or its Subsidiaries' customers after such date any
Trust Non-Tax Funds over-impounded from such customers by the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with the payroll processing services
performed by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries prior to such date; provided
that, for purposes hereof, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall only be
regarded as having such an obligation if, and to the extent that, a customer has
paid, or Trust Non-Tax Funds have been over-impounded by, the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries in respect thereof prior to such date.

      2.24 Investment Policy. The Company is, in all material respects, in
compliance with the terms of the Investment Policy.

transactions would otherwise be consummated in the absence of the need for such
consent, approval, order, authorization, registration, declaration or filings.

                             ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

      5.1 Proxy Statement. Promptly after execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Company shall prepare and shall file with the SEC as soon as is
practicable a preliminary Proxy Statement, together with a form of proxy, with
respect to the Stockholders' Meeting at which the stockholders of the Company
will be asked to vote upon and approve this Agreement and the Merger and shall
use reasonable efforts to have the Proxy Statement and form of proxy cleared by
the SEC as promptly as practicable, and promptly thereafter shall mail the
definitive Proxy Statement and form of proxy to stockholders of the Company. The
term "PROXY STATEMENT" shall mean such proxy or information statement and all
amendments or supplements thereto, if any, similarly filed and mailed. Parent
will provide the Company with any information that may be required in order to
effectuate the preparation and filing of the Proxy Statement pursuant to this
Section 5.1. The Company will provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable
opportunity to review the Proxy Statement prior to its filing. The Company will
respond to, and provide Parent and its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to
participate in the response of the Company to, any comments from the SEC and
will notify Parent promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC in
connection with the filing of, or amendments or supplements to, the Proxy
Statement. Whenever any event occurs which is required to be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, the Company or Parent, as the
case may be, will promptly inform the other of such occurrence and cooperate in
filing with the SEC and/or mailing to stockholders of the Company such amendment
or supplement. Each of Parent and the Company shall cooperate and the Company
shall provide Parent (and its counsel) with a reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Proxy Statement and on any amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement prior to filing such with the SEC, and will


                                      -30-
<PAGE>
provide Parent with a copy of all such filings made with the SEC. The
information provided and to be provided by Parent, Merger Sub and the Company,
respectively, for use in Proxy Statement shall, on the date the Proxy Statement
is first mailed to the Company's stockholders, on the date of the Stockholders'
Meeting and as of the Effective Time, not contain an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make such
information, in light of the circumstances under which it was provided, not
misleading, and the Company, Parent and Merger Sub each agree to correct any
information provided by it for use in the Proxy Statement which shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect. The Proxy Statement shall
comply as to form in all material respects with all applicable requirements of
federal securities laws.

      5.2 Meetings of Stockholders; Board Recommendation.

            (a) Meeting of Stockholders. Promptly after the execution of this
Agreement, the Company will take all action necessary in accordance with
Delaware Law and its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to call, hold and
convene a meeting of its stockholders to consider the adoption and approval of
this Agreement and approval of the Merger (the "STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING") as soon
as practicable after the date hereof. Subject to Section 5.3(d), the Company
will use reasonable efforts to solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of
the adoption and approval of this Agreement and the approval of the Merger, and
will take all other action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent
of its stockholders required by Delaware Law to obtain such approval.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company may adjourn or postpone its Stockholders' Meeting to the extent
necessary to ensure that any necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement is provided to its stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and
this Agreement or, if as of the time for which the Stockholders' Meeting is
originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there are
insufficient shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
represented (either in person or by proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to
conduct the business of such Stockholders' Meeting.

            (b) Board Recommendation. Except to the extent expressly permitted
by Section 5.3(d): (i) the Board of Directors of the Company shall recommend
that its stockholders vote in favor of the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and approval of the Merger (the "RECOMMENDATION"), at the
Stockholders' Meetings, (ii) the Proxy Statement shall include a statement to
the effect that the Board of Directors of the Company has recommended that the
Company's stockholders vote in favor of adoption and approval of this Agreement
and approval of the Merger at the Stockholders' Meeting, and (iii) neither the
Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall withdraw,
amend or modify, or propose or resolve to withdraw, amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent, the Recommendation.

      5.3 Acquisition Proposals.

            (a) No Solicitation. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of
its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective officers, directors, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries), and any party to a Stockholder
Agreement shall, and that the Company shall use reasonable efforts to cause its
and its Subsidiaries' other employees and affiliates not to (and shall not
authorize any of them to) directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate,
encourage, knowingly facilitate or induce any inquiry with respect to,


                                      -31-
<PAGE>
or the making, submission or announcement of, any Acquisition Proposal (as
defined in Section 5.3(f)) with respect to itself, (ii) participate or engage in
any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any
nonpublic information with respect to, or take any other action to facilitate
any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes or may reasonably
be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal with respect to itself, (iii)
approve, endorse or recommend any Acquisition Proposal with respect to itself
(except to the extent specifically permitted pursuant to Section 5.3(d)), or
(iv) enter into any letter of intent or similar document or any Contract or
commitment contemplating or otherwise relating to any Acquisition Proposal or
transaction contemplated thereby with respect to itself. The Company and its
Subsidiaries and any of their respective officers, directors, agents and
representatives (including any investment banker, attorney or accountant
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries), and any party to a Stockholder
Agreement will immediately cease, and the Company shall use reasonable efforts
to cause its and its Subsidiaries' other employees and affiliates to cease, any
and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties
(other than Parent, Merger Sub and their representatives) conducted heretofore
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal with respect to itself.

            (b) Notification of Unsolicited Acquisition Proposals. As promptly
as practicable and in any event within one (1) business day after receipt of any
Acquisition Proposal or any request for nonpublic information or inquiry which
the Company reasonably believes would lead to an Acquisition Proposal the
Company shall provide Parent with oral and written notice of the material terms
and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry, and the
identity of the Person or group making any such Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry. The Company shall, upon receipt of an Acquisition Proposal, request or
inquiry, provide Parent as promptly as practicable oral and written notice
setting forth the terms of any material amendments or proposed material
amendments of any such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry.

            (c) Superior Offers. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 5.3(a), in the event that, prior to the adoption and
approval of this Agreement and the Merger by the required vote of the
stockholders of the Company, the Company receives an unsolicited, bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal with respect to itself from a third party that its
Board of Directors has in good faith concluded (after consultation with its
outside legal counsel and its financial advisor), is, or is reasonably likely to
result in, a Superior Offer (as defined in Section 5.3(f)) and the Company has
complied in full with all its obligations under Section 5.3(a) in connection
with such Acquisition Proposal, it may then take the following actions:

                  (i) Furnish nonpublic information to the third party making
such Acquisition Proposal, provided that (A) (1) concurrently with furnishing
any such nonpublic information to such party, it gives Parent written notice of
its intention to furnish nonpublic information and (2) it receives from the
third party an executed confidentiality agreement in substantially the form of
the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 5.4) prior to taking any
action under clause (1) above and (B) contemporaneously with furnishing any such
nonpublic information to such third party, it furnishes such nonpublic
information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic information has not been
previously so furnished);

                  (ii) Engage in negotiations with the third party with respect
to the Acquisition Proposal, provided that concurrently with entering into
negotiations with such third


                                      -32-
<PAGE>
party, it gives Parent oral and written notice of the its intention to enter
into negotiations with such third party; and

                  (iii) Approve or recommend, or propose to approve or
recommend, any Superior Offer and enter into any agreement with respect thereto;
provided, in each such case, that the Company has terminated this Agreement
pursuant to Section 7.1(g).

      Nothing in this Section 5.3(c) shall relieve the Company from its
obligation to comply with Section 5.3(b).

            (d) Changes of Recommendation. The Board of Directors of the Company
may not withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the Recommendation (any of the
foregoing actions, whether by a Board of Directors or a committee thereof, a
"CHANGE OF RECOMMENDATION"), unless, prior to the adoption and approval of this
Agreement and the Merger by the required vote of the stockholders of the
Company, the Board of Directors has concluded in good faith, after consultation
with its outside legal counsel, that such Change of Recommendation is required
by its fiduciary obligations to its stockholders under Delaware Law.

            (e) Compliance with Tender Offer Rules. Nothing contained in this
Agreement shall prohibit either party or its respective Board of Directors from
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rules 14d-9
and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act.

            (f) Certain Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement, the
following terms shall have the following meanings:

                  (i) "ACQUISITION PROPOSAL," with respect to a party, shall
mean any offer or proposal or public announcement of a proposal or plan,
relating to any transaction or series of related transactions involving: (A) any
purchase from such party or acquisition by any Person or "group" (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder) of more than a fifteen percent (15%) interest in the total
outstanding voting securities of such party or any of its Subsidiaries, directly
or indirectly, or any tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person or group beneficially owning fifteen percent (15%) or more
of the total outstanding voting securities of such party or any of its
Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly, or any merger, consolidation, business
combination or similar transaction involving such party or any of its
Subsidiaries, (B) any sale, lease (other than in the ordinary course of
business), exchange, transfer, license (other than in the ordinary course of
business), acquisition or disposition of more than fifteen percent (15%) of the
assets of such party (including its Subsidiaries taken as a whole), directly or
indirectly, or (C) any liquidation or dissolution of such party; and

                  (ii) "SUPERIOR OFFER," with respect to a party, shall mean an
unsolicited, bona fide written offer made by a third party to acquire, directly
or indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger, consolidation
or other business combination, all or substantially all of the assets of such
party or a majority of the total outstanding voting securities of such party and
as a result of which the stockholders of such party immediately preceding such
transaction would hold less than fifty percent (50%) of the equity interests in
the surviving or resulting entity of such transaction or any direct or indirect
parent or subsidiary thereof, on terms that the Board of Directors


                                      -33-
<PAGE>
of such party has in good faith concluded (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and its financial adviser) (i) to be more favorable from a
financial point of view, to such party's stockholders (in their capacities as
stockholders) than the terms provided pursuant to this Agreement, (ii) the
conditions to the consummation of which are reasonably capable of being
satisfied and (iii) financing for which, to the extent required, is then
committed or in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company
(after consultation with its independent financial advisors) reasonably
available.

      5.4 Confidentiality; Access to Information.

            (a) Confidentiality. The parties acknowledge that the Company and
Parent have previously executed a Non-Disclosure Agreement dated November 1,
2002 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), which Confidentiality Agreement will
continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms and Parent will
hold, and will cause its directors, officers, employees, agents and advisors
(including attorneys, accountants, consultants, bankers and financial advisors)
to hold, any Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
confidential in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

            (b) Access to Information. The Company will afford Parent and
Parent's accountants, counsel and other representatives reasonable access during
normal business hours to its properties, books, records and personnel during the
period prior to the Effective Time to obtain all information concerning its
business, including the status of product development efforts, properties,
results of operations and personnel, as Parent or its representatives may
reasonably request, and, during such period, upon request by Parent, the Company
shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, furnish promptly to Parent a
copy of any report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed by
it during such period pursuant to the requirements of federal or state
securities laws; provided, however, that the Company may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of any
Governmental Entity applicable to the Company requires the Company or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information.

      5.5 Public Disclosure. Neither the Company, Parent nor any of their
respective affiliates shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement with respect to the this Agreement or the other
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other
party, except as may be required by law or by any listing agreement with, or the
policies of, a national securities exchange in which circumstance reasonable
efforts to consult with the other party will still be required to the extent
practicable.

      5.6 Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts.

            (a) Regulatory Filings. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall coordinate and cooperate with one another and shall each use reasonable

would impede compliance with, all Legal Requirements, and as promptly as
practicable after the date hereof, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company
shall make all filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, application or submission of other documents
required by any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including, without


                                      -34-
<PAGE>
limitation: (i) Notification and Report Forms with the United States Federal
Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States
Department of Justice ("DOJ") as required by the HSR Act, (ii) any other filing
necessary to obtain any Necessary Consent, (iii) filings under any other
comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger notification or
control laws of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed by the parties hereto,
and (iv) any filings required under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
applicable state or securities or "blue sky" laws and the securities laws of any
foreign country, or any other Legal Requirement relating to the Merger. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall comply as promptly as practicable with
any request for additional information, documents or other materials received by
such party hereto or any of its Subsidiaries or affiliates from any Governmental
Entity. Each of Parent and the Company will cause all documents that it is
responsible for filing with any Governmental Entity under this Section 5.6(a) to
comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements.

            (b) Exchange of Information. Parent, Merger Sub and the Company each
shall promptly supply the other with any information which may be required in
order to effectuate any filings or application pursuant to Section 5.6(a).
Except where prohibited by applicable Legal Requirements, and subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, each of the Company and Parent shall consult with
outside counsel to the other prior to taking a position with respect to any such
filing, shall permit outside counsel to the other to review and discuss in
advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other in connection with
any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, white papers,
arguments, opinions and proposals before making or submitting any of the
foregoing to any Governmental Entity by or on behalf of any party hereto in
connection with any investigations or proceedings in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby (including
under any antitrust or fair trade Legal Requirement), coordinate with outside
counsel to the other in preparing and exchanging such information and promptly
provide outside counsel to the other with copies of all filings, presentations
or submissions (and a summary of any oral presentations) made by such party to
any Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated hereby, provided that with respect to any such
filing, presentation or submission, each of Parent and the Company need not
supply outside counsel to the other with copies (or in case of oral
presentations, a summary) to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation
of any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or
information.

            (c) Notification. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company will
notify the other promptly upon the receipt of: (i) any comments from any
officials of any Governmental Entity in connection with any filings made
pursuant hereto and (ii) any request by any officials of any Governmental Entity
for amendments or supplements to any filings made pursuant to, or information
provided to comply in all material respects with, any Legal Requirements.
Whenever any event occurs that is required to be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to any filing made pursuant to Section 5.6(a), Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company, as the case may be, will promptly inform the other of such
occurrence and cooperate in filing with the applicable Governmental Entity such
amendment or supplement.

            (d) Reasonable Best Efforts. Subject to the express provisions of
Section 5.2 and Section 5.3 hereof and upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, each of the


                                      -35-
<PAGE>
parties agrees to use reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the
other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate
and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to
cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the
obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, approvals,
orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all
necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations,
declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of
all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action,
investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of
all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, including all
Necessary Consents, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions,
investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any
court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, and (v) the execution or
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In
connection with and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and its Board of
Directors shall, if any takeover statute or similar Legal Requirement is or
becomes applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, use reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on
the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of
such Legal Requirement on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby.

            (e) Limitation on Divestiture. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to require Parent or the Company or any Subsidiary or affiliate thereof to take
or agree to take any Action of Material Divestiture (as defined below) which
would be reasonably likely to materially adversely impact the benefits expected
to be derived by Parent and its Subsidiaries (on a combined basis with the
Company and its Subsidiaries) as a result of the transactions contemplated
hereby or would be reasonably likely to materially adversely affect Parent and
its Subsidiaries (on a combined basis with the Company and its Subsidiaries)
following the Merger. For purposes of this Agreement, an "ACTION OF MATERIAL
DIVESTITURE" shall mean executing or carrying out agreements or submitting to
Legal Requirements providing for a material license, material sale or other
material disposition of any assets or categories of assets that are material to
the combined business of Parent's employer services business and the Company or
the holding separate of Company capital stock or imposing or seeking to impose
any material limitation on the ability of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full
rights of ownership of the Company's business or on the ability of Parent to
conduct the combined business of Parent's employer services business and the
Company.

      5.7 Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt notice
to Parent and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any
representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming
untrue or inaccurate or any failure of the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant,
condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this
Agreement, such that, (A) in


                                      -36-
<PAGE>
the case of the Company, the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or Section
6.2(b) would not be satisfied or (B) in the case of Parent or Merger Sub, the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or Section 6.3(b) would not be satisfied;
provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.7
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to any of
the parties sending or receiving such notice.

      5.8 Third-Party Consents. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, Parent and the Company will each use reasonable efforts to obtain (i)
all Necessary Consents and (ii) all consents, waivers and approvals under any
Company Material Contract as may be required to be obtained in connection with
the Merger.

      5.9 Company Employee Plans and Employee Benefits.

            (a) For the twelve (12) month period following the Effective Time,
Parent will provide to employees of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
who are employed by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent after the Effective Time
(the "CONTINUING EMPLOYEES") compensation (excluding bonuses, commissions, stock
options, restricted stock, other forms of equity compensation and benefits) that
is comparable to the compensation (excluding bonuses, commissions, stock
options, restricted stock, other forms of equity compensation and benefits)
provided to the Continuing Employees prior to the execution of this Agreement.
For the twelve (12) month period following the Effective Time, Parent will
maintain a severance pay practice for the benefit of each Continuing Employee
that is no less favorable than the severance pay practice provided by the
Company as of the date of this Agreement. On and after the Effective Time,
Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent shall provide to the Continuing Employees
participation in benefit plans offered to similarly situated employees of Parent
that are no less favorable than the Plans (the "PARENT PLANS"). Parent shall
take all necessary actions to provide that Continuing Employees will receive
full credit for years of service with the Company and any of its Subsidiaries
under the Parent Plans to the extent taken into account for such purposes under
the Plans prior to the Effective Time (other than with respect to benefit
accrual under tax qualified plans)). Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent
shall give credit under those of its Parent Plans that are welfare benefit plans
for all amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, and time
accrued against applicable waiting periods, by Continuing Employees (including
their eligible dependents), in respect of the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs. Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent shall waive all
requirements for evidence of insurability and pre-existing conditions otherwise
applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Parent Plans in which such
Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or following the
Effective Time.

            (b) Parent agrees that at the Effective Time, Company Employees may
participate in the employee stock purchase plan sponsored by Parent (the "PARENT
ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions of the Parent ESPP, and that service
with the Company shall be treated as service with Parent for determining
eligibility of the Continuing Employees under the Parent ESPP.

      5.10 Indemnification.

            (a) Indemnity. From and after the Effective Time, Parent will, and
will cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification and exculpation
provisions in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the
Company (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") under the Certificate of Incorporation or
Bylaws of the Company and any agreement between an Indemnified Party and the
Company or a Subsidiary of the


                                      -37-
<PAGE>
Company as in effect as of the date hereof that is listed in Section 5.10(a) of
the Company Disclosure Letter. The Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of
the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as
in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at
any time prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Company, unless such modification is required by law.

            (b) Insurance. For a period of six (6) years after the Effective
Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the
current policies of directors' and officers' liability insurance maintained by
the Company covering those persons (but only those persons) who are currently
covered by such policies; provided, however, that in no event will the Surviving
Corporation be required to pay an annual premium on such insurance policy that
is greater than 200% of the annual premium currently payable by the Company for
such coverage and provided, further, that notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event such coverage is no longer available (or is only available for an amount
in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such
coverage) Parent shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage as may
be obtained for such 200% amount. Parent may, however, satisfy its obligations
under the first sentence of this Section 5.10(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy
under the Company's existing directors' and officers' insurance policy which (i)
has an effective term of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers
those persons (but only those persons) who are currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' insurance policy in effect as of the date
hereof, and (iii) contains terms and conditions (including, coverage amounts)
which are no less advantageous that those contained in the terms and conditions
of the Company directors' and officers' insurance policies in effect as of the
date hereof. The Company shall take all actions necessary or advisable under its
existing directors' and officers' insurance policy to permit Parent to satisfy
its obligations hereunder, including but not limited to triggering any "tail"
policy.

            (c) Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Section 5.10 is intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the Indemnified Parties and
their heirs and personal representatives and shall be binding on Parent and the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. In the event Parent or the
Surviving Corporation or its successor or assign (i) consolidates with or merges
into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successor and assign of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, honor the obligations set forth with
respect to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this
Section 5.10.

      5.11 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Company shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted
under applicable law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or
acquisitions of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by
Article I of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the


                                      -38-
<PAGE>
Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

      5.12 Merger Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to comply with
all of Merger Sub's obligations under or relating to this Agreement. Merger Sub
shall not engage in any business which is not in connection with the Merger or
other transactions contemplated hereby.

      5.13 Tax Account and Non-Tax Account Reconciliation Report and Related
Data. The Company has delivered to Parent, in a form reasonably acceptable to
Parent, (A) (i) a Tax Account Reconciliation Report as of December 31, 2002 and
(ii) a statement of the Assumed Customer Tax Obligations, Tax Trust Funds, Tax
Account Receivables (shown in aggregate, as well as by aging category, e.g., 30
to 90 days, 91 to 180, 181 to 360, and one year or older) and the Tax Fund
Investment Portfolio (showing market value adjustments) balances, each as of
December 31, 2002, for each customer of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (B)
a Non-Tax Bank Account Reconciliation Report as of December 31, 2002. "TAX
ACCOUNT RECONCILIATION REPORT" shall mean a reconciliation report comparing the
aggregate amounts of the Tax Trust Funds and Tax Account Receivables to the
Assumed Customer Tax Obligations for each customer. "NON-TAX BANK ACCOUNT
RECONCILIATION REPORT" shall mean a report demonstrating the reconciliation of
the cash disbursement ledger to the bank account for only the COBRA account, the
flexible spending account (FSA), the health and welfare account (H&W) and the
ProCheck business account. "TAX ACCOUNT RECEIVABLES" shall mean, with respect to
any date, any amounts owed to the Company or its Subsidiaries by its customers
as of such date relating to previously assumed and fulfilled Assumed Customer
Tax Obligations, including, but not limited to, (i) rejected Collection Items in
Transit, (ii) items payable to the Company or its Subsidiaries by its customers
for reimbursement of overdeposits by Tax authorities (for which the customer has
received earlier credit or upon which it has relinquished any claim) or (iii)
any other amounts owed to the Company or its Subsidiaries by customers for the
past funding of bona fide Assumed Customer Tax Obligations. A "COLLECTION ITEM
IN TRANSIT" shall mean a pre-approved electronic impound from a customer's bank
account that was processed via an automated clearing house network or reverse
wire transfer initiated through the Company's or its Subsidiaries' banks but
that is not yet settled. "TAX FUND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO" shall mean that portion
of the Tax Trust Funds invested in bonds, securities, mutual funds, and other
non-cash financial instruments.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                       TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND WAIVER

      7.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the
Effective Time, by action taken or authorized by the Board of Directors of the
terminating party or parties, and except as provided below, whether before or
after the requisite approval of the stockholders of the Company:

            (a) by mutual written consent duly authorized by the Boards of
Directors of Parent and the Company;

            (b) by either Parent or the Company, if the Merger shall not have
been consummated on or before May 31, 2003 (which date shall be extended to
September 30, 2003, in the event that all waiting periods (and any extension
thereof) under the HSR Act relating to the Merger shall not have expired or been
terminated on or prior to May 31, 2003) (the "END DATE"); provided, however,
that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(b) shall
not be available to any party whose action or failure to act has been the
principal cause of or resulted in the failure of the


                                      -41-
<PAGE>
Merger to occur on or before the End Date, and such action or failure to act
constitutes a material breach of this Agreement;

            (c) (i) by either the Company or Parent if any court of competent
jurisdiction or other Government Entity shall have issued an order, decree, or
ruling enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transaction contemplated by this
Agreement and such order, decree or ruling shall have become final and
non-appealable (unless such order, decree, or ruling has been withdrawn,
reversed, or otherwise made inapplicable); or (ii) by the Company if any
litigation or proceeding is pending before any court of competent jurisdiction
or has been threatened to be instituted by any Person or governmental body,
which in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company is
reasonably likely to result in an order, decree, or ruling enjoining,
prohibiting, seeking substantial damages in respect of, or impairing the
benefits of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

            (d) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption and approval of
this Agreement and the Merger by the required vote of the stockholders of the
Company) if a Triggering Event (as defined below in this Section 7.1) with
respect to the Company shall have occurred;

            (e) by the Company by written notice to Parent, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Parent or Merger
Sub set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of Parent
or Merger Sub shall have become untrue or inaccurate, which untruths,
inaccuracies or breach would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth
in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b); provided that if such untruth or inaccuracy in
Parent's or Merger Sub's representations and warranties or breach by Parent or
Merger Sub is curable by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the End Date through the
exercise of reasonable efforts, then the Company may not terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(e) prior to such End Date, provided that Parent
continues to exercise reasonable efforts to cure such untruthfulness, inaccuracy
or breach through the End Date (it being understood that the Company may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this paragraph (e) if it shall have
materially breached this Agreement or if such untruthfulness, inaccuracy or
breach by Parent or Merger Sub is cured prior to the End Date);

            (f) by Parent by written notice to the Company, upon a breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Company set
forth in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of the Company
shall have become untrue or inaccurate, which untruths, inaccuracies or breach
would give rise to the failure of a condition set forth in Section 6.2(a) or
6.2(b) provided that if such untruth or inaccuracy in the Company's
representations and warranties or breach by the Company is curable by the
Company prior to the End Date through the exercise of reasonable efforts, then
Parent may not terminate this Agreement under this Section 7.1(f) prior to the
End Date, provided that the Company continues to exercise reasonable efforts to
cure such untruthfulness, inaccuracy or breach through the End Date (it being
understood that Parent may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
paragraph (f) if it shall have materially breached this Agreement or if such
untruthfulness, inaccuracy or breach by the Company is cured prior to the End
Date);

            (g) by the Company, if the Company receives a Superior Offer;
provided that, (i) the Company shall have notified Parent in writing prior to
terminating this Agreement pursuant to this


                                      -42-
<PAGE>
Section 7.1(g) that the Company has received a Superior Offer and intends to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g), attaching the most
current version of such Superior Offer to such notice, (ii) the Company shall
have afforded Parent the reasonable opportunity to make a revised offer
(including by negotiating the terms of such offer with Parent) and Parent shall
not have made, within three (3) business days after receipt of the Company's
written notice of its intention to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 7.1(g), an offer that the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith to be more favorable to the Company's stockholders than such
Superior Offer and (iii) the Company shall simultaneously with its termination
hereunder make all payments required by Section 7.3(b); and

            (h) by either the Company or Parent if the required approval of the
stockholders of the Company contemplated by this Agreement shall not have been
obtained by reason of the failure to obtain the required vote at a meeting of
the Company stockholders duly convened therefore or at any adjournment thereof;
provided, however, that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section
7.1(h) shall not be available to the Company where the failure to obtain the
Company stockholder approval shall have been caused by the action or failure to
act of the Company and such action or failure to act constitutes a material
breach by the Company of this Agreement.

      For the purposes of this Agreement, a "TRIGGERING EVENT," with respect to
the Company, shall be deemed to have occurred if: (i) its Board of Directors or
any committee thereof shall for any reason have withdrawn or shall have amended
or modified in a manner adverse to Parent the Recommendation, (ii) it shall have
failed to include the Recommendation in the Proxy Statement, (iii) its Board of
Directors or any committee thereof shall have approved or recommended any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) a tender or exchange offer relating to its
securities shall have been commenced by a Person unaffiliated with the Company
and it shall not have sent to its securityholders pursuant to Rule 14e-2
promulgated under the Securities Act, within ten (10) business days after such
tender or exchange offer is first published, sent or given, a statement
disclosing that the Board of Directors of the Company recommends rejection of
such tender or exchange offer.

      7.2 Notice of Termination; Effect of Termination. Except as otherwise set
forth in Section 7.1(g), any termination of this Agreement under Section 7.1
above will be effective immediately upon the delivery of a valid written notice
of the terminating party to the other party hereto. In the event of the
termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall
be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in Section 5.4(a),
this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII, each of which shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party
from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. No termination of this
Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of
this Agreement in accordance with their terms.

      7.3 Fees and Expenses.

            (a) General. Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether
or not the Merger is consummated.


                                      -43-
<PAGE>
            (b) Payments.

                  (i) Payment by the Company. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated by Parent or the Company, as applicable, pursuant to Section
7.1(d) or (g) the Company shall promptly, but (except as set forth in Section
7.1(g)) in no event later than two (2) business days after the date of such
termination, pay Parent a fee equal to $25 million in immediately available
funds.

                  (ii) Payment by Parent. In the event that this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company (A) pursuant to Section 7.1(c) primarily as
a result of issues relating to the antitrust or competition laws of any
applicable jurisdiction or (B) pursuant to Section 7.1(b) in the event the
applicable waiting period under the HSR Act not having expired or terminated
then, in any such event, Parent shall promptly, but in no event later than two
(2) business days after the date of such termination, pay the Company a fee
equal to $25 million in immediately available funds.

                  (iii) Interest and Costs; Other Remedies. Each of Parent and
the Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3(b)
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay in a timely manner
the amounts due pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(i) or Section 7.3(b)(ii),
respectively, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the Company, as
applicable, makes a claim that results in a judgment against the Company (in the
case of non-payment under Section 7.3(b)(i)) or Parent (in the case of
non-payment under Section 7.3(b)(ii)) for the amounts set forth in Section
7.3(b)(i) or Section 7.3(b)(ii), respectively, the Company (in the case of
non-payment under Section 7.3(b)(i)) or Parent (in the case of non-payment under
Section 7.3(b)(ii)) shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) in connection with
such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in Section 7.3(b)(i)
or Section 7.3(b)(ii), as applicable, at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in
effect on the date such payment was required to be made. Payment of the fees
described in this Section 7.3(b) shall not be in lieu of damages incurred in the
event of breach of this Agreement.

      7.4 Amendment. Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards of
Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented in
connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, provided, after
any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in accordance with
the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further approval by such
stockholders without such further stockholder approval. This Agreement may not
be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.

      7.5 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time either
party hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Board of
Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed: (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto,
(ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such
party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (iii)
waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of
such party contained herein. Any agreement on the


                                      -44-
<PAGE>
part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in
exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such
right.

                                  ARTICLE VIII
                               GENERAL PROVISIONS

Effective Time.

documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as
contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure Letter
and the Parent Disclosure Letter (i) constitute the entire agreement among the
parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and


                                      -47-

      8.6 Severability. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction
to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will
continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other
Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the
intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or
unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision
that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic, business and
other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.

      8.7 Other Remedies; Specific Performance.

            (a) Other Remedies. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with
and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon
such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

            (b) Specific Performance. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

      8.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, regardless of
the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of

the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery, with respect to
all actions and proceedings arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the

such action or proceeding shall be heard and determined in such courts and

such service to the address set forth in Section 8.2 hereof, and (e) agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law.

      8.9 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto agree that they have been
represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of
construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will

rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval
of the other parties; provided, however, that Parent or Merger Sub can assign
any of their respective rights and obligations to any direct or indirect

preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the
benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted
assigns.

RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER SUB OR THE COMPANY
IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
