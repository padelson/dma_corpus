-iii-   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER    This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER
(this "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of January 5, 2003, by and
among Automatic Data Processing, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT"), ADP
Merger Corp., a Delaware corporation and indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent ("MERGER SUB"), and ProBusiness Services, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "COMPANY").   RECITALS   A. The respective Boards of Directors of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have deemed it advisable and in the best
interests of their respective corporations and stockholders to consummate the
Merger (as defined in Section 1.1), on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement.   B. The respective Boards of
Directors of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have approved and declared
advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger.   C. The Board of Directors of the Company has resolved to
recommend to its stockholders approval and adoption of this Agreement and
approval of the Merger.   D. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to Parent\'s, the Company\'s and
Merger Sub\'s respective willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
stockholders of the Company are entering into Stockholder Support Agreements
in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "STOCKHOLDER
AGREEMENTS").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises
and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE MERGER   1.1 The Merger.
At the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement and the applicable provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DELAWARE LAW"), Merger Sub
shall be merged with and into the Company (the "MERGER"), the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue
as the surviving corporation. The Company, as the surviving corporation after
the Merger, is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the "SURVIVING
CORPORATION."   1.2 Effective Time; Closing. Subject to the provisions of
this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated
by filing a Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware in accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law
(the  "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") (the time of such filing with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware (or such later time as may be agreed in
writing by the Company and Parent and specified in the Certificate of Merger)
being the "EFFECTIVE TIME") as soon as practicable on the Closing Date (as
defined below). The closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at
the offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison, 1285 Avenue of the
Americas, New York, NY 10019, at a time and date to be specified by the
parties, which shall be no later than the second business day after the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such
other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the
"CLOSING DATE").   1.3 Effect of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the
effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of Delaware Law.   1.4 Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation of the
Company shall be the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation and shall be amended and restated in its entirety to be identical
to the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter amended in accordance with
Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate of Incorporation. At the
Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Company shall be the Bylaws of the
Surviving Corporation and shall be amended and restated in their entirety to
be identical to the Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with Delaware Law
and as provided in such Bylaws.   1.5 Directors and Officers. The initial
directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub
immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors
are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior
to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly
appointed.   1.6 Effect on Capital Stock. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of capital stock of the Company, the following shall
occur:   (a) Company Preferred Stock. In accordance with Section 4(d) of
the Certificate of Designations, Preferences and Rights of the 6.9%
Senior Convertible Preferred Stock filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware on August 1, 2000 (the "CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION"),
subject to the election of the holders of two-thirds (2/3) of the Company
Preferred Stock (as defined in Section 2.2(a)) issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (which election has been obtained
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement), each share of Company
Preferred Stock (including shares of Company Preferred Stock issued or
issuable immediately prior to the Closing in accordance with Section 3 of the
Certificate of Designation) (other than shares of Company Preferred Stock to
be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and any Dissenting Shares (as defined
in Section 1.8)), will be canceled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive $26.50 in cash (the "PREFERRED PER SHARE
LIQUIDATION AMOUNT") (such amount being an amount equal to the liquidation
preference set forth in Section 4(a) of the Certificate of Designation).  
(b) Company Common Stock. Each share of the Common Stock, par value $0.001
per share, of the Company (together with the associated Company Right
(as defined in Section    -2-  2.2(a)) under the Company Rights
Agreement (as defined in Section 2.2(a)) ("COMPANY COMMON STOCK")) issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c) and any
Dissenting Shares) will be canceled and extinguished and automatically
converted into the right to receive $17 per share (the "PER SHARE AMOUNT"
and, together with the Preferred Per Share Liquidation Amount referred to
herein as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION").   (c) Cancellation of Treasury and
Parent Owned Stock. Each share of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof.  
(d) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01,
of Merger Sub (the "MERGER SUB COMMON STOCK") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.   (e) Conversion of Dissenting
Shares. The holders of Dissenting Shares, if any, shall be entitled to
payment for such shares only to the extent permitted by and in accordance
with the provisions of Delaware Law; provided, however, that if, in
accordance with Delaware Law, any holder of Dissenting Shares shall forfeit
such right to payment of the fair cash value of such shares, such shares
shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to have become
exchangeable for, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive the Merger
Consideration provided in Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b),
as applicable.   (f) Repurchase Rights. The Board of Directors of the
Company, without any further action by Parent, shall take all actions
necessary pursuant to the terms of the Company\'s 2002 Employee Stock
Purchase Plan and the 1997 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (collectively, the
"COMPANY PURCHASE PLANS") to shorten all Offering Periods (as defined in the
Company Purchase Plans) such that all Offering Periods then in progress
terminate no later than immediately prior to the Effective Time.   (g)
Employee Stock Options. Each Company Option or Other Option (both as defined
in Section 2.2(b)) which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then exercisable or vested, shall by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the Parent, Merger Sub,
the Company or the holder thereof, be converted into and shall become a right
to receive an amount in cash, without interest, with respect to each share
subject thereto, equal to the excess, if any, of the Per Share Amount over
the per share exercise or purchase price of such Company Option or such Other
Option (such amount being hereinafter referred to as the "OPTION MERGER
CONSIDERATION") and each Company Option and Other Option shall be canceled at
the Effective Time. The payment of the Option Merger Consideration to the
holder of a Company Option or Other Option shall be reduced by any income or
employment tax withholding required under the Code or any provision of state,
local or foreign Tax (as defined in Section 2.6) law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of such Company
Option or Other Option. The Stock Option Plans (as defined in Section
2.12(a)) shall terminate at the Effective Time.    -3-   (h) Adjustments
to the Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be adjusted to
reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split,
stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities
convertible into Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with
respect to Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock having a record
date on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time.   1.7
Surrender of Certificates.   (a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to
the Company to act as the exchange agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the
Merger. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into an agreement
with Exchange Agent, reasonably satisfactory to the Company.   (b) Parent
to Provide Cash. At or promptly following the Effective Time (and in no event
later than one (1) business day following the Effective Time), Parent shall
make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this
Article I, cash payable to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b) in exchange for outstanding shares of
Company Preferred Stock and Company Common Stock, respectively. Any
funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as
the "EXCHANGE FUND."   (c) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the
Effective Time (and in no event later than three (3) business days following
the Effective Time), Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates
(the "CERTIFICATES") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock whose shares were converted into the right to receive cash pursuant to
Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall
specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration to
which the holder of such Certificate is entitled pursuant to Section 1.6(a)
or Section 1.6(b) (without limiting the effect of Section 1.7(e)). Upon
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together
with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such
Certificates shall be entitled to receive promptly (and in no event later
than three (3) business days after receipt thereof) in exchange therefor the
Merger Consideration to which the holder of such certificate is entitled
pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b) (less any withholding amount
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock
held by such holder as provided by Section 1.7(e)), and the Certificates so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest shall accrue or be paid
on the amounts payable pursuant to this Article I upon surrender of the
Certificates.   (d) Transfers of Ownership. If the payment of the amounts
payable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b) is to be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
formerly evidencing shares of Company Common Stock or Company   
-4-  Preferred Stock, as applicable, are registered, it will be a condition
of payment that the Certificates so surrendered will be properly endorsed
and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Persons (as defined
in Section 8.3(d)) requesting such payment will have paid to Parent or any
agent designated by it any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section
2.6) required by reason of the payment of the amount specified in Section
1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b) to a Person other than the registered holder of the
Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.   (e)
Required Withholding. Each of the Exchange Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock such amounts
as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or
under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any
other applicable Legal Requirement (as defined in Section 2.2(d)). To the
extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the amount of such
consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would otherwise
have been paid.   (f) No Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation
nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock for any amount properly paid to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.   (g) Investment of Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall invest
the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis; provided that no
such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to
Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the Exchange
Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company
stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to Parent.  
(h) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates six (6) months after the
Effective Time shall, at the request of the Surviving Corporation,
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or otherwise on the instruction of
the Surviving Corporation, and any holders of the Certificates who have
not surrendered such Certificates in compliance with this Section 1.7 shall
after such delivery to the Surviving Corporation look only to the
Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned property, escheat and similar
laws) for payment, as general creditors thereof, of their claim for the
Merger Consideration, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled
pursuant to Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b). Any such portion of the
Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Preferred Stock immediately prior to such time as such
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental
Entity (as defined in Section 2.3(c)) shall, to the extent permitted by law,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.   (i) No Further Ownership Rights in
Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock.   (j)At the close of
business on the day of the Effective Time, there shall be no further   
-5-  registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation
of shares of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, the holders of Company Common Stock or Company Preferred
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have
any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock except as otherwise provided herein or by applicable law. If,
after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration, as provided in this Article I, subject to
applicable law in the case of Dissenting Shares. All cash paid upon surrender
of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article I shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares previously represented by such Certificates.   (k) Lost, Stolen or
Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificates shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, the Merger Consideration to which the holder
thereof is entitled pursuant to this Article I; provided, however, that
Parent or the Surviving Corporation may, in their discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment thereof, require the owner of such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as they
may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent
with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.   (l) Applicability to Dissenting Shares. The provisions of
this Section 1.7 shall also apply to Dissenting Shares that lose their status
as such, except that the obligations of the Exchange Agent under this Section
1.7 shall commence only on the date of such loss of status.   1.8
Dissenting Shares.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock and Company Preferred Stock
for which the holder thereof has demanded an appraisal of their value in
accordance with, and has complied in all respects with, Section 262 of
Delaware Law (collectively, the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted
into or represent the right to receive cash in accordance with Section 1.6(a)
or Section 1.6(b), and the holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled
only to such rights as may be granted to such holder or holders in Section
262 of Delaware Law.   (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a),
if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall effectively withdraw or lose
(through failure to perfect or otherwise) such appraisal rights, then, as of
the occurrence of such event, such holder\'s shares shall no longer be deemed
to be "Dissenting Shares" and such shares shall automatically be converted
into and represent only the right to receive the applicable cash payment
provided in Section 1.6(a) or Section 1.6(b), without interest, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares in accordance with
Section 1.7.   (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock or Company
Preferred Stock, the withdrawals of such demands, and any other instrument
served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect
to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of    -6-  Parent, offer to make or make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal of the shares Company
Common Stock or Company Preferred Stock or offer to settle or settle any such
demands.   1.9 Further Action. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any
deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and things to
vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation
any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights,
properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.   ARTICLE II

Contract, or otherwise. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has

and timely paid to the appropriate Tax authority proper and accurate amounts

any ERISA Affiliate have at any time ever maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, contributed to, or had any liability, whether contingent or

arrangement" as defined in Section 3(40) of ERISA, (iii) a Plan subject to

(a) Trust Tax Funds. All Trust Tax Funds amounts have been held in segregated
tax accounts maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries on behalf of their
customers (the "TAX ACCOUNTS"). Such amounts are not commingled with funds of
the Company and its Subsidiaries and no amounts have been paid out of such
Tax Accounts other than (i) payments to the applicable Tax authorities
of such Taxes on behalf of such customers, (ii) payments returning any such
amounts (or any portion of such amounts) to such customers, (iii) the
interest income earned on investments which is subsequently transferred to
the Company\'s corporate cash account or (iv) fees mistakenly wired by
customers to the Tax Accounts which are transferred to the Company\'s
corporate cash account. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its
Subsidiaries have paid in a timely manner to the applicable Tax authorities
all amounts that are required to be paid to such authorities on behalf of
their customers in respect of all taxable periods then ended, except in the
event that any failure to pay such amount to such authorities was (i) caused
solely by the refusal or inability of the customer to pay such amount to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) caused solely by the failure of the
customer to provide accurate data to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(iii) in the ordinary course of business. To the Knowledge of the Company,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have timely filed with the applicable Tax
authorities all Tax Returns that are required to be filed in connection with
the Trust Tax Funds held in the Tax Accounts, except in the event that any
failure to timely file such Tax Returns with such authorities was (i) caused
solely by the failure of the customer to provide in a timely manner the
information necessary to make such filings or (ii) in the ordinary course of
business. The aggregate Assumed Customer Tax Obligations are equal to the sum
of (i) the aggregate amount of Trust Tax Funds held in the Tax Accounts plus
(ii) the relevant portion of Tax Account Receivables (as defined in
Section 5.13), if any, with the exception of the realized loss in value of a
financial instrument described in Section 2.23 of the Company Disclosure
Letter of which corporate funds will ultimately be transferred into the Tax
Account to remedy the differential. "TRUST TAX FUNDS" shall mean, with
respect to any date, all federal and state payroll, social security,
Medicare, unemployment and other trust Taxes held in Tax Accounts that were
(i) withheld by the Company or its Subsidiaries from the payroll of employees
of, or otherwise collected from, the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\'
customers in connection with the payroll processing and tax filing services
of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to such date and (ii) not yet
remitted to the applicable Tax authorities as of such date. "ASSUMED CUSTOMER
TAX OBLIGATIONS" shall mean with respect to any date, obligations of the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries as of such date (i) to remit to the Tax
authorities on behalf of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' customers after
such date all federal and state payroll, social security,
Medicare, unemployment and other trust Taxes that are required to be paid and
(ii) to refund to the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' customers after such
date any Trust Tax Funds over-impounded from such customers by the Company
and/or its Subsidiaries, in each case, in connection with the payroll
processing and tax filing services performed by the Company and/or its
Subsidiaries prior to such date; provided that, for purposes hereof, the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall only be regarded as having such an
obligation if, and to the extent that, a customer has paid, or Trust Tax
Funds have been over-impounded by, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries in
respect thereof prior to such date. To the Company\'s Knowledge, set forth on
Section 2.23 of the Company Disclosure Letter is a true and correct list as
of December 20, 2002 of penalties and interest relating to assessments with
respect to payroll Tax Returns filed on behalf of the clients of the Company
or its Subsidiaries which, at the time the Company received notice of such
assessments, were deemed individually to represent potential exposure to the
Company and Subsidiaries, or their clients, in excess of $250,000.   (b)
Trust Non-Tax Funds. All Trust Non-Tax Funds amounts have been held in
segregated non-tax accounts maintained by the Company or its Subsidiaries on
behalf of their customers (the "NON-TAX ACCOUNTS"). Such amounts are not
commingled with funds of the Company or its Subsidiaries and no amounts have
been paid out of such accounts other than (i) payments to the
applicable regulatory authorities of such withheld amounts on behalf of
such    -23-  customers or to authorized recipients or (ii) payments
returning any such amounts (or any portion of such amounts) to such
customers. To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company and its Subsidiaries
have paid in a timely manner to the applicable regulatory authorities (or
authorized recipients) all amounts that are required to be paid to such
authorities (or authorized recipients) on behalf of customers in respect of
all payroll periods then ended, except in the event that any failure to pay
such amount to such authorities (or authorized recipients) was (i) caused
solely by the refusal or inability of the customer to pay such amount to the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (ii) caused solely by the failure of the
customer to provide accurate data to the Company and its Subsidiaries or
(iii) in the ordinary course of business. To the Knowledge of the Company,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have timely filed with the applicable
regulatory authorities or authorized recipients all filings, if any, that are
required to be filed in connection with the Trust Non-Tax Funds held in the
Non-Tax Accounts, except in the event that any failure to timely file
such filings with such authorities was (i) caused solely by the failure of
the customer to provide in a timely manner the information necessary to make
such filings or (ii) in the ordinary course of business. The aggregate
Assumed Customer Non-Tax Obligations are equal to the sum of (i) the
aggregate amount of Trust Non-Tax Funds held in the Non-Tax Accounts plus
(ii) the relevant portion of Trust Account Receivables, if any. "TRUST NON-
TAX FUNDS" shall mean, with respect to any date, (a) all customers\'
employees\' net pay (in connection with direct deposit services or check
services) and (b) all workers\' compensation or other insurance premiums or
contributions (whether on behalf of the employer or employee) to 401(k) or
other similar investment plans that were withheld by the Company or its
Subsidiaries from the payroll of employees of, or otherwise collected from,
the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\' customers in connection with the payroll
processing services of the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to such date,
which in each case, were not yet remitted to the applicable regulatory
authorities or other authorized recipients as of such date and are held in
Non-Tax Accounts. "ASSUMED CUSTOMER NON-TAX OBLIGATIONS" shall mean
with respect to any date, obligations of the Company and/or its Subsidiaries
as of such date (i) to remit to the applicable regulatory authorities or
other authorized recipients on behalf of the Company\'s or its Subsidiaries\'
customers after such date all workers\' compensation or other insurance
premiums or contributions (whether on behalf of employer or employee) to
401(k) or other similar investment plans or customers\' employees\' net pay
(in connection with direct deposit services or check services) that are
required to be paid and (ii) to refund to the Company\'s or its
Subsidiaries\' customers after such date any Trust Non-Tax Funds over-
impounded from such customers by the Company and/or its Subsidiaries, in each
case, in connection with the payroll processing services performed by the
Company and/or its Subsidiaries prior to such date; provided that, for
purposes hereof, the Company and/or its Subsidiaries shall only be regarded
as having such an obligation if, and to the extent that, a customer has paid,
or Trust Non-Tax Funds have been over-impounded by, the Company and/or
its Subsidiaries in respect thereof prior to such date.   2.24 Investment

stockholders under Delaware Law.   (e) Compliance with Tender Offer Rules.

qualified plans)). Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent shall give credit
under those of its Parent Plans that are welfare benefit plans for all
amounts credited toward deductibles and out-of-pocket maximums, and
time accrued against applicable waiting periods, by Continuing Employees
(including their eligible dependents), in respect of the calendar year in
which the Effective Time occurs. Parent and/or any Subsidiary of Parent shall
waive all requirements for evidence of insurability and pre-existing
conditions otherwise applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Parent
Plans in which such Continuing Employees become eligible to participate on or
following the Effective Time.   (b) Parent agrees that at the Effective
Time, Company Employees may participate in the employee stock purchase plan
sponsored by Parent (the "PARENT ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions
of the Parent ESPP, and that service with the Company shall be treated as
service with Parent for determining eligibility of the Continuing Employees
under the Parent ESPP.   5.10 Indemnification.   (a) Indemnity. From and
after the Effective Time, Parent will, and will cause the Surviving
Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of the
Company pursuant to any indemnification and exculpation provisions in favor
of the current or former directors or officers of the Company (the
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") under the Certificate of Incorporation or Bylaws of
the Company and any agreement between an Indemnified Party and the Company or
a Subsidiary of the    -37-  Company as in effect as of the date hereof
that is listed in Section 5.10(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter. The
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will
contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are
at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company as in effect on the
date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who at any time
prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees or agents of
the Company, unless such modification is required by law.   (b) Insurance.
For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of
directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company
covering those persons (but only those persons) who are currently covered by
such policies; provided, however, that in no event will the
Surviving Corporation be required to pay an annual premium on such insurance
policy that is greater than 200% of the annual premium currently payable by
the Company for such coverage and provided, further, that notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event such coverage is no longer available (or is only
available for an amount in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently
paid by the Company for such coverage) Parent shall nevertheless be obligated
to provide such coverage as may be obtained for such 200% amount. Parent may,
however, satisfy its obligations under the first sentence of this Section
5.10(b) by purchasing a "tail" policy under the Company\'s existing
directors\' and officers\' insurance policy which (i) has an effective term
of six (6) years from the Effective Time, (ii) covers those persons (but only
those persons) who are currently covered by the Company\'s directors\' and
officers\' insurance policy in effect as of the date hereof, and (iii)
contains terms and conditions (including, coverage amounts) which are no less
advantageous that those contained in the terms and conditions of the Company
directors\' and officers\' insurance policies in effect as of the date
hereof. The Company shall take all actions necessary or advisable under
its existing directors\' and officers\' insurance policy to permit Parent to
satisfy its obligations hereunder, including but not limited to triggering
any "tail" policy.   (c) Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Section 5.10 is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by the
Indemnified Parties and their heirs and personal representatives and shall be
binding on Parent and the Surviving Corporation and its successors and
assigns. In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or its successor or
assign (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made
so that the successor and assign of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, honor the obligations set forth with respect to Parent or
the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, in this Section 5.10.   5.11
Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Company shall
take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable law) to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including
derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions
of Parent Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to
Parent Common Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by Article
I of this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the    -38-  Exchange Act
with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.   5.12 Merger Sub Compliance. Parent shall cause Merger
Sub to comply with all of Merger Sub\'s obligations under or relating to this
Agreement. Merger Sub shall not engage in any business which is not in
connection with the Merger or other transactions contemplated hereby.  
5.13 Tax Account and Non-Tax Account Reconciliation Report and Related Data.
The Company has delivered to Parent, in a form reasonably acceptable
to Parent, (A) (i) a Tax Account Reconciliation Report as of December 31,
2002 and (ii) a statement of the Assumed Customer Tax Obligations, Tax Trust

and Tax Account Receivables to the Assumed Customer Tax Obligations for each
customer. "NON-TAX BANK ACCOUNT RECONCILIATION REPORT" shall mean a report
demonstrating the reconciliation of the cash disbursement ledger to the bank

to the Company or its Subsidiaries by its customers as of such date relating
to previously assumed and fulfilled Assumed Customer Tax Obligations,
including, but not limited to, (i) rejected Collection Items in Transit, (ii)
items payable to the Company or its Subsidiaries by its customers for
reimbursement of overdeposits by Tax authorities (for which the customer
has received earlier credit or upon which it has relinquished any claim) or
(iii) any other amounts owed to the Company or its Subsidiaries by customers
for the past funding of bona fide Assumed Customer Tax Obligations. A
"COLLECTION ITEM IN TRANSIT" shall mean a pre-approved electronic impound
from a customer\'s bank account that was processed via an automated clearing
house network or reverse wire transfer initiated through the Company\'s or
its Subsidiaries\' banks but that is not yet settled. "TAX FUND INVESTMENT
PORTFOLIO" shall mean that portion of the Tax Trust Funds invested in bonds,
securities, mutual funds, and other non-cash financial instruments.

Agreement;   (d) by Parent (at any time prior to the adoption and approval

Sub\'s representations and warranties or breach by Parent or Merger Sub is
curable by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the End Date through the exercise of

or breach by the Company is curable by the Company prior to the End Date

to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 7.1(g), attaching the

pursuant to this Section 7.1(g), an offer that the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith to be more favorable to the Company\'s
stockholders than such Superior Offer and (iii) the Company shall
simultaneously with its termination hereunder make all payments required by
Section 7.3(b); and   (h) by either the Company or Parent if the required
approval of the stockholders of the Company contemplated by this Agreement

vote at a meeting of the Company stockholders duly convened therefore or at
any adjournment thereof; provided, however, that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 7.1(h) shall not be available to the Company
where the failure to obtain the Company stockholder approval shall have been
caused by the action or failure to act of the Company and such action or
failure to act constitutes a material breach by the Company of this
Agreement.   For the purposes of this Agreement, a "TRIGGERING EVENT," with
respect to the Company, shall be deemed to have occurred if: (i) its Board of

the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement
shall be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in Section
5.4(a), this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article VIII, each of which shall
survive the termination of this Agreement and (ii) nothing herein shall
relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. No

contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall
survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms.   7.3

Interest and Costs; Other Remedies. Each of Parent and the Company
acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3(b) are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that,
without these agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into
this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay in a
timely manner the amounts due pursuant to Section 7.3(b)(i) or Section
7.3(b)(ii), respectively, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or the
Company, as applicable, makes a claim that results in a judgment against the
Company (in the case of non-payment under Section 7.3(b)(i)) or Parent (in
the case of non-payment under Section 7.3(b)(ii)) for the amounts set forth
in Section 7.3(b)(i) or Section 7.3(b)(ii), respectively, the Company (in the
case of non-payment under Section 7.3(b)(i)) or Parent (in the case of non-
payment under Section 7.3(b)(ii)) shall pay to the other party its reasonable
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys\' fees and expenses) in
connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in
Section 7.3(b)(i) or Section 7.3(b)(ii), as applicable, at the prime rate of

Payment of the fees described in this Section 7.3(b) shall not be in lieu of
damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement.   7.4 Amendment.
Subject to applicable law, this Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective Boards
of Directors, at any time before or after approval of the matters presented
in connection with the Merger by the stockholders of the Company, provided,
after any such approval, no amendment shall be made which by law or in
accordance with the rules of any relevant stock exchange requires further
approval by such stockholders without such further stockholder approval. This
Agreement may not be amended except by execution of an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company.   7.5
Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time either party

Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a
waiver of such right.   ARTICLE VIII  GENERAL PROVISIONS   8.1 Non-

of this Agreement and (ii) are not intended to confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided, following
the Effective Time, in Section 5.10.   8.6 Severability. In the event that
any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is
declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or
unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force
and effect and the application of such provision to other Persons or
circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of
the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void
or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable
provision that will achieve, to the greatest extent possible, the economic,
business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.   8.7
Other Remedies; Specific Performance.   (a) Other Remedies. Except as
otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the
exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any
other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.   (b)
Specific Performance. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be
entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.   8.8 Governing Law; Jurisdiction. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York,
regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable
principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each party hereby (a) irrevocably and
unconditionally submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court
of Chancery, with respect to all actions and proceedings arising out of or
relating to this Agreement and the transaction contemplated hereby, (b)
agrees that all claims with respect to any such action or proceeding shall be
heard and determined in such courts and agrees not to commence an action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby

objection to the laying of venue of any action or proceeding arising out of

judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may
be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other
manner provided by law.   8.9 Rules of Construction. The parties hereto
agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law,
regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an
agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such
agreement or document.    -48-   8.10 Assignment. No party may assign
either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations
hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties; provided,
however, that Parent or Merger Sub can assign any of their respective rights
and obligations to any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent,
but no such assignment shall relieve Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may
be, of its obligations hereunder. Any purported assignment in violation of
this Section 8.10 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   8.11 Waiver
