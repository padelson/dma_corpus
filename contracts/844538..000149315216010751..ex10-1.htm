Assignor has the ability to assign, transfer and convey both its rights and

existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation;

     | (m)  | this  Agreement, when executed and delivered, will
constitute a legal, valid and binding obligation of the Assignor enforceable 
against it in accordance with its terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting creditors'  rights generally; 
     |   | 
     | (n)  | the  Assignor has the capacity to enter into this
Agreement and the execution of this Agreement and the completion of the
transactions  contemplated hereby does not violate the constating documents
of the Assignor, the provisions of any law, order, rule or regulation 
applicable to the Assignor or constitute a breach of any agreement to which
the Assignor is a party; and 
  



    



 

 | \- 3 -|

     |   | 
     | (e)  | neither  the Assignee's execution and delivery of this

and save the Assignee and each of the Assignee's affiliates and their 
respective directors, officers, employees, shareholders and representatives,
and the successors to the foregoing (collectively,  the "Indemnitees"),
harmless for and from any loss, damage, obligation, commitment, liability,
claim, demand,  deficiency, charge, cost or expense of any kind or nature
(including reasonable legal fees and disbursements and other costs  resulting
from any action, suit, investigation, claim or other proceeding) (each, a
"Loss") and from any  suits, claims or demands, cause of action, proceedings
arising on account of, relating to, in connection with, or as a result  of:
(a) any breach of any representation, warranty, obligation, commitment or
covenant contained in this Agreement on the  part of the Assignor or in any
certificate or document delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this  Agreement, whether or not the Assignee had or should
have had knowledge of such breach of representation or warranty, obligation, 
commitment or covenant; (b) any use by the Assignor of the Licensed

 | \- 4 -| 
---|---|--- 

    



     4.2  | _Notice  of Claim_. If the Assignee becomes aware of any
Loss for indemnification pursuant to Section 4.1 (a "Claim"),  the Assignee
shall promptly give notice of such Claim to the Assignor. Such notice shall
specify whether the Claim arises  as a result of a Claim by a person against
any of the Indemnitees (a "Third Party Claim") or whether the  Claim does not
so arise (an "Indemnitee Claim"), and shall also specify with reasonable
particularity (to  the extent that the information is available): 
---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | the  factual basis for the Claim; and 
---|---|--- 
     |   | 
     | (b)  | the  amount of the Claim, or, if an amount is not then
determinable, an approximate and reasonable estimate of the likely amount  of
the Claim. 
     |   | 
     | The  failure to give prompt written notice as provided in this
Section 4.2 shall not affect the rights and obligations of either  party
except and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, a party which
was entitled to receive such notice was  directly prejudiced as a result of
such failure 
  



     4.3  | _Procedure  for Indemnification_. 
---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | _Indemnitee  Claims_. With respect to any Indemnitee
Claim, following receipt of notice from any Indemnitee of a Claim, the
Assignor  shall have 30 days to make such investigation of the Claim as the
Assignor considers necessary or desirable. For the purpose  of such
investigation, such Indemnitee shall make available to the Assignor the
information relied upon by such Indemnitee  to substantiate the Claim. If
such Indemnitee and the Assignor agree at or prior to the expiration of such
30-day period (or  any mutually agreed upon extension thereof) to the
validity and amount of such Claim, the Assignor shall immediately pay to  the
Indemnitee the full agreed upon amount of the Claim. 
---|---|--- 
     |   | 
     | (b)  | _Third  Party Claims_. With respect to any Third Party
Claim, the Assignor shall, after having admitted in writing liability
towards  the Indemnitee, have the right, at its own expense, to participate
in or assume control of the negotiation, settlement or  defense of such Third
Party Claim and, in such event, the Assignor shall reimburse the Indemnitee
for all of the Indemnitee's  out-of-pocket expenses as a result of such
participation or assumption. If the Assignor elects to assume such control,
the  Indemnitee shall cooperate with the Assignor, shall have the right to
participate in the negotiation, settlement or defense  of such Third Party
Claim at its own expense and shall have the right to disagree on reasonable
grounds with the selection  and retention of counsel, in which case counsel
satisfactory to the Assignor and the Indemnitee shall be retained by the
Assignor.  If the Assignor refuses to assume such control or, having elected
to assume such control thereafter fails to defend any such  Third Party Claim
within a reasonable time, the Indemnitee shall be entitled to assume such
control and the Assignor shall  be bound by the results obtained by the
Indemnitee with respect to such Third Party Claim. The Assignor shall pay
expenses  of the Indemnitee monthly in advance of being incurred if the
Assignor is not immediately assuming satisfactory defense of  any Third Party
Claim, in the amounts reasonably estimated by the Indemnitee to be incurred in
the next month; provided, however,  that the Indemnitee shall within a
reasonable time following the conclusion of such month promptly return to the
Assignor  any amounts advanced to the Indemnitee in accordance with the
foregoing in excess of the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by  the
Indemnitee. 
  



     4.4  | _Additional  Rules and Procedures_. The obligations of the
Assignor to indemnify any Indemnitee in respect of Claims shall also be
subject  to the following: 
---|--- 
  



       | (a)  | In  the event that any Third Party Claim is of a
nature such that the Indemnitee is required by applicable law to make a
payment  to any person (a "Third Party") with respect to such Third Party
Claim before the completion of settlement  negotiations or related legal
proceedings, the Indemnitee may make such payment and the Assignor shall,
forthwith after demand  by the Indemnitee, reimburse the Indemnitee for any
such payment. If the amount of any liability of the Indemnitee under the 
Third Party Claim in respect of which such a payment was made, as finally
determined, is less than the amount which was paid  by the Assignor to the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitee shall, forthwith after receipt of the difference
from the Third Party, pay  the amount of such difference to the Assignor. 
---|---|--- 
  



    



 

 | \- 5 -| 
---|---|--- 

    



       | (b)  | Except  in the circumstance contemplated by Section
4.3(b), including in the event that the Assignor fails or refuses to take
control  of the negotiation, settlement or defense of any Third Party Claim,
the Indemnitee shall not negotiate, settle, compromise  or pay any Third
Party Claim except with the prior written consent of the Assignor (which
consent shall not be unreasonably  withheld). 
---|---|--- 
     |   | 
     | (c)  | The  Indemnitee shall not permit any right of appeal in
respect of any Third Party Claim to terminate without giving the Assignor 
notice thereof and an opportunity to contest such Third Party Claim. 
     |   | 
     | (d)  | The  Indemnitee and the Assignor shall cooperate fully
with each other with respect to Third Party Claims, and shall keep each 
other fully advised with respect thereto (including supplying copies of all
relevant documentation promptly as it becomes  available). 
     |   |

     | 
   B.  | The  Corporation desires to engage the Consultant to provide

NOW THEREFORE in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants contained

follows:

  



     1.  | ENGAGEMENT  AND DURATION 
---|--- 
     | 
   1.1  | The  Corporation hereby engages the Consultant, though its
principal, [●], to act in the capacity of a [●] and the  Consultant agrees to
act as such to the best of its ability and in accordance with the terms and

     | 
   1.2  | The  term of the Consultant's engagement shall commence on the
date hereof and shall continue for a period of 10 years, with  successive

Corporation for the performance of the Services;

Services to the Corporation and otherwise discharging its duties and
responsibilities  to the Corporation. 
  



     2.3  | The  relationship between the Consultant and the Corporation
is intended to be, and shall be construed as, that of independent 
contracting parties only and not that of employment, partnership, joint
venture, agency or any other association whatsoever.  Nothing whatsoever
contained in this Agreement shall constitute either party as having authority
to bind the other in any  manner whatsoever, and nothing whatsoever contained
herein shall give or is intended to give any rights of any kind to any  third
party. For clarity, the Consultant shall be solely responsible for deciding
the time, place and manner in which it provides  the Services, subject to
Sections 2.2(c) and 2.2(e), and supplying any and all materials, equipment and
work space that may  be required in order to provide the Services, including,
but not limited to, electronic storage devices. 
---|--- 
     | 
   2.4  | The  Consultant shall refer to the Board all matters and

capital reorganizations and similar events  relating to such stock occurring
after the date hereof, and pay the Consultant $250,000 plus HST in cash by
cheque, bank draft  or wire transfer of immediately available funds. For
clarity, the Consultant shall be entitled to receive the foregoing bonus  for
each $0.05 in EPS generated by the Corporation in a fiscal year, such that,
for example, if the Corporation generates  $0.15 in EPS in one fiscal year,
the Corporation shall pay the Consultant an aggregate of $750,000 plus HST in
cash and issue  the Consultant an aggregate of 3,000,000 shares of the
Corporation's common stock.

prior to the transaction will hold less than 50% of the voting securities of
the resulting entity upon the completion of the  transaction; 
     |   | 
     | (c)  | any  direct or indirect change in the beneficial ownership
of the voting securities of the Corporation where the change in beneficial 
ownership is sufficient to allow any person or group of persons acting jointly
or in concert to elect or appoint a majority  of the Board; 
     |   | 
     | (d)  | any  person or combination of persons acting jointly or in
concert, acquiring or becoming the beneficial owner, directly or indirectly, 
of more than 50% of the voting securities of the Corporation whether through
the acquisition of previously issued and outstanding  voting securities of

proposal by a shareholder group not supported by management of the

does not apply to a change  in the composition of the Board supported by
management.

with the performance of the Services. In order for such expenses  or
disbursements to be eligible for reimbursement, the Consultant must obtain
written approval from the President of the Corporation  in advance of
incurring them. For all such expenses and disbursements the Consultant shall
supply the Corporation with originals  of all receipts, invoices or
statements in respect of which the Consultant seeks reimbursement, in such
form as may reasonably  be required by the Corporation and at such times or
intervals as may be required by the Corporation. 
     | 
   3.6  | _Deductions_.  All payments by the Corporation under this
Agreement shall be less any deductions or withholdings required by applicable
law. 
     | 
   3.7  | _Restrictive  Legends_. The Consultant acknowledges and agrees
that upon the issuance thereof, and until such time as the same is no  longer
required under applicable securities laws, regulations, rules and policies,
