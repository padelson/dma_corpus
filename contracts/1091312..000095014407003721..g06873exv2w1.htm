 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company (in the case of the Company acting on the approval and the recommendation of a special committee (the " _Special Committee_ ") formed for the purpose of representing the Company in connection with the possible transactions contemplated hereby) has deemed it advisable and in the best interests of their respective stockholders for Acquisition to merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") pursuant to Section 251 of the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Parent, Acquisition and the Company has each adopted resolutions approving and declaring advisable this Agreement, the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, and as a condition to the willingness of the Company to enter into this Agreement, Crestview Capital Partners, L.P. (" _Guarantor_ ") has provided the Company with an executed copy of its limited guarantee (the " _Guarantee_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, Parent, Acquisition and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

  

AGREEMENT 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements herein contained, the parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows: 

  

ARTICLE I 

   

THE MERGER 

   

 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL, Acquisition shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Acquisition shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation under the name "Symbion, Inc." (the " _Surviving Corporation_ ") and shall succeed to and assume all of the rights and obligations of the Company and Acquisition in accordance with the DGCL. 

   ##### 

  

  

 1.2. _Closing_. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated and the Merger shall have been abandoned pursuant to Section 7.1, the consummation of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as promptly as practical following the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions (other than those conditions which by their nature are to be satisfied at Closing) set forth in Article VI (and, in any event, not more than two business days following the satisfaction or waiver of all such conditions, subject to the last paragraph of Section 6.1), at the offices of Akin Gump Strauss Hauer and Feld LLP, 590 Madison Avenue, New York, New York 10022, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_ ". 

  

 1.3. _Effective Time of the Merger_. At Closing, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as provided in the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective upon such filing or at such time thereafter as Parent, Acquisition and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). 

  

 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. 

   

 (a) The Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger and the applicable provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers, franchises, licenses and authorities of the Company and Acquisition shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of each of the Company and Acquisition shall become the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions and duties of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) The directors of Acquisition and the officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial directors and officers, respectively, of the Surviving Corporation until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Surviving Corporations certificate of incorporation and bylaws. 

   

 (c) At the Effective Time, (i) the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be amended in its entirety to be the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Acquisition as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Symbion, Inc." and the provisions relating to the Companys registered agent and indemnification and advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability in the Certificate of Incorporation of the Company shall be unchanged from that in effect as of the date hereof, and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and the DGCL, and (ii) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended so as to read in their entirety as the Bylaws of Acquisition as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, except that the references to Acquisitions name shall be replaced by references to "Symbion, Inc." and, as so amended, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation following the Effective Time until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms, the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation and the DGCL.

ARTICLE II 

   

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE OUTSTANDING SECURITIES 
 OF THE COMPANY AND ACQUISITION; EXCHANGE PROCEDURES 

   

 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Acquisition, the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), the holder of any limited liability company interests of Parent, or the holder of any shares of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Acquisition (" _Acquisition Common Stock_ "): 

   

 (a) _Common Stock of Acquisition_. Each share of Acquisition Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted. 

   

 (b) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Company Common Stock Owned by Parent or Acquisition_. Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by Parent or Acquisition or held in the treasury of the Company (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "), shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares, shall be canceled and converted into the right to receive in cash an amount equal to $22.35 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). 

   

 (d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a holder who was entitled to and has validly demanded appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders appraisal rights under the DGCL, but instead shall be converted into the right to receive payment from the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the DGCL. If any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such appraisal right pursuant to the DGCL, each Dissenting Share of such holder shall be treated as a share of Company Common Stock that had been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any demands, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company for appraisal of shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written 

   ##### 

  

  

consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

    

 (e) _Cancellation and Retirement of Company Common Stock_. As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock (other than Dissenting Shares) that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") being converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable therefor pursuant to Section 2.1(c) shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Merger Consideration per share multiplied by the number of shares so represented, to be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with Section 2.2(b). 

   

 (f) _Certain Adjustments_. In the event that after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time, solely as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), combination or exchange of shares, stock dividend or stock distribution thereon with a record date during such period which in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all holders of Company Common Stock, there is a change in the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of securities or rights convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event. 

  

 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates; Paying Agent_  

   

 (a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall (i) appoint a bank or trust company that is reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ ") and (ii) enter into a paying agent agreement, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company, with such Paying Agent to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of Certificates upon surrender of such Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Article II from time to time after the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit (or cause to be deposited) with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the holders of such surrendered Certificates, for use in the payment of the Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article II, as needed, cash sufficient to make all payments pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such cash consideration being hereinafter referred to as the " _Merger Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable instructions of the Surviving Corporation given on the Closing Date, make payments of the Merger Consideration out of the Merger Fund. The Merger Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or deliver to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of Company Common Stock and whose shares are being converted into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1(c) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or effective 

   ##### 

  

  

affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) to the Paying Agent, and shall otherwise
be in a form and have such other provisions as the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably specify) containing instructions for use by holders of Company
Common Stock to effect the exchange of their shares of Company Common Stock
for the Merger Consideration as provided herein. Upon surrender to the Paying
Agent of such Certificate or Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in
lieu thereof) and such letter of transmittal duly executed and completed
in accordance with the instructions thereto (together with such other
documents as the Paying Agent may reasonably request) (or, if such shares are
held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the entry through a
book-entry transfer agent of the surrender of such shares of Company Common
Stock on a book-entry account statement (it being understood that any
references herein to " _Certificates_ " shall be deemed to include
references to book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of
shares of Company Common Stock)), be entitled to payment of an amount of cash
(payable by check or wire transfer, at the election of the Surviving
Corporation) equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the number of
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate
or Certificates. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates upon
compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may
impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal
exchange practices. If payment is to be remitted to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered for payment is registered,
it shall be a condition of such payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed, with signature guaranteed, or
otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Paying Agent any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered, or shall establish to
the satisfaction of the Paying Agent that such tax either has been paid or
is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b),
at any time after the Effective Time, each Certificate shall be deemed to
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable for the
shares represented thereby upon such surrender as contemplated by Section
2.1. No interest will be paid or will accrue on any cash payable as Merger
Consideration.

    

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock Exchanged for Cash_. All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates representing shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock exchanged for cash theretofore represented by such Certificates, and after the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Merger Fund_. Any portion of the Merger Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for twelve months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand, and any holders of Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look 

   ##### 

  

  

only to the Surviving Corporation and only as general creditors thereof for
payment of the Merger Consideration, subject to escheat and abandoned
property and similar Laws.

    

 (e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Acquisition, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash from the Merger Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of shares of Company Common Stock immediately prior to the time when the amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Merger Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash in the Merger Fund, as directed by the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) no such investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common Stock and following any losses Parent shall promptly provide (or cause to be provided) additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of the stockholders of the Company in the amount of any such losses and (ii) such investments shall be in short-term obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no more than 30 days or guaranteed by the United States of America and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America or in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (g) _Withholding Rights_. The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or Restricted Shares such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 (h) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in customary amount as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.3. _Effect of the Merger on Company Stock Options and Restricted Shares_. 

   

 (a) At, or immediately prior to, the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee administering each of the Companys equity-based compensation or stock option plans (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ") shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents necessary so that all outstanding options (whether or not then vested) to acquire shares of Company Common Stock under the Stock Plans (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") heretofore granted under any Stock Plan shall become fully vested and exercisable at the Effective Time and any Company Stock Options which have not been exercised immediately, prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled in exchange for the right to receive a cash payment by the Surviving Corporation of an amount equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (x) the Merger Consideration over (y) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option. Payment of the amount contemplated hereunder shall be made at the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) At, or immediately prior to, the Effective Time the Board of Directors of the Company or any committee administering each of the Stock Plans shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents necessary so that each share of Company Common Stock granted subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Stock Plan (collectively, " _Restricted Shares_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (except with respect to Restricted Shares that the holders thereof and Parent shall have otherwise agreed) shall vest and become free of such restrictions as of the Effective Time to the extent provided by the terms thereof (as such plans may be amended prior to the Effective Time in accordance with the terms hereof) and, at the Effective Time, the holder thereof shall, subject to this Article II, be entitled to receive the Merger Consideration with respect to each such Restricted Share in accordance with Section 2.1(b). 

   

 (c) The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Section 2.3 to any holder of Company Stock Options such amounts as the Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Surviving Corporation, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation. 

  

ARTICLE III 

   

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES 

   

 3.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Acquisition that, except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to Parent and Acquisition concurrently with 

   ##### 

  

 

entering into this Agreement (it being agreed that disclosure of any item in
any section or subsection of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
to be disclosed with respect to any other section or subsection to which the
relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent) (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") or, subject to Section 9.15, as disclosed in the
Company SEC Documents filed prior to the date of this Agreement: 

    

 (a) _Organization, Standing and Power_. Each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and, to the Companys knowledge, its Joint Ventures is a corporation, partnership or a limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective jurisdiction of organization (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) and has all requisite corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where any such failure to be so organized, existing and in good standing or to have such power or authority would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company, its Subsidiaries and, to the Companys knowledge, its Joint Ventures is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited liability company and in good standing to conduct business (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize the concept of good standing) in each jurisdiction in which the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to so qualify or be licensed to do business as a foreign corporation, partnership or limited liability company or to be in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore made available to Parent and Acquisition (or Parent and Acquisition have otherwise had access to) and Acquisition complete and correct copies of the certificates of incorporation and bylaws (or other organizational documents, as applicable) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and, to the Companys knowledge, Joint Ventures.

   #####

exercisable for, capital stock of the Company have been issued, other than

 (b) Subject to Sections 5.2(c), 5.2(d) and 5.2(e), the Company shall, and shall cause any of its Subsidiaries and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives, to (i) on the No-Shop Period Start Date, immediately cease any discussions or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to a Company Acquisition Proposal; and (ii) from the No-Shop Period Start Date until the Effective Time or the earlier termination of this Agreement, not (A) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage (including by way of providing information) the submission of any inquiries, proposals or offers or any other efforts or attempts that constitute, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal or engage in any discussions or negotiations with respect thereto or otherwise knowingly cooperate with or knowingly assist or participate in, or knowingly facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions or negotiations, or (B) grant any release or waiver under any standstill or similar agreement relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiary.

   ##### 

  

  

Agreement at such time as any Company Acquisition Proposal made by such Person
is withdrawn.

    

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.2(b) that would otherwise restrict any of the Companys and its Subsidiaries or their Representatives actions, if at any time after the No-Shop Period Start Date but prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, (i) the Company or any of its Representatives has received a Company Acquisition Proposal from a Person not solicited in violation of this Section 5.2 that the Board of Directors of the Company or Special Committee determines in good faith to be bona fide, and (ii) the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Company Acquisition Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal from such Person and that the failure to take such action could violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, then the Company may (x) furnish information with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such Company Acquisition Proposal regarding such Company Acquisition Proposal;  _provided_ , that with respect to such Person the Company (A) will not, and will not allow its Subsidiaries or its or their Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such Person without first entering into an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (B) will promptly provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries provided to such other Person which was not previously provided to Parent. Nothing contained in this Section 5.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Board of Directors of the Company from taking and disclosing to the Companys stockholders a position with respect to a tender or exchange offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any other disclosure required by applicable Law, but if such disclosure constitutes an Adverse Recommendation Change, it shall have the effects applicable to an Adverse Recommendation Change as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (d) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall directly or indirectly (i) (A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent and Acquisition), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to Parent and Acquisition), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any such committee thereof that the stockholders of the Company adopt this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, any alternative Company Acquisition Proposal, including any Permitted Alternative Agreement (any action described in this clause (A) and (B) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Acquisition Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement). 

   ##### 

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at any time prior
to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors of the
Company may make an Adverse Recommendation Change (regardless of whether or
not in connection with a Company Acquisition Proposal) if the Board of
Directors (or the Special Committee, as applicable) determines in good faith
(after consultation with outside counsel) that the failure to take such
action would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and such
Adverse Recommendation Change shall have the effects applicable to an Adverse
Recommendation Change as contemplated by this Agreement. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Company shall
not be prohibited from taking the action contemplated by clause (ii) above in
connection with the entering into of a Permitted Alternative Agreement in
accordance with and subject to Section 5.2(e).

    

 (e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, at any time prior to obtaining Company Stockholder Approval, the Company receives a Company Acquisition Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee determines in good faith (after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside counsel) constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the adjustments which may be offered by Parent pursuant to clause (ii) below, the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee may (x) effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) cause the Company to terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal (a " _Permitted Alternative Agreement_ ") if the Board of Directors of the Company or the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action would violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ that the Company shall not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to foregoing clause (x) or terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y), unless concurrently with and as a precondition to the effectiveness of such termination the Company pays the Termination Fee payable pursuant to Section 5.3(b); and _provided_ , _further_ , that on or after May 8, 2007, the Board of Directors may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) with respect to a Permitted Alternative Agreement unless: (i) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Acquisition, at least five days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ "), of its intention to so terminate this Agreement (which notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such Superior Proposal), or to make an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection therewith; and (ii) prior to so terminating this Agreement or making an Adverse Recommendation Change in connection with a Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and Acquisition in good faith (to the extent Parent and Acquisition desire to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such Company Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to such Superior Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and Acquisition and to comply anew with the requirements of this Section 5.2(e) with respect such new written notice. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) After the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall notify Parent promptly after receipt by the Company (or any of its advisors) of any Company Acquisition Proposal received after the No-Shop Period Start Date (including from a Excluded Person the Company remains in discussions with regarding a Company Acquisition Proposal after the No-Shop Period Start Date), any indication that a third party is considering making a Company Acquisition Proposal or of any request for information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or for access to the business, properties, assets, books or records of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any third party that may be considering making, or has made, a Company Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide such notice orally and in writing and shall identify the third party making, and the general terms and conditions of, any such Company Acquisition Proposal, indication or request. The Company shall keep Parent informed, on a reasonably current basis, of the status and material details of any such Company Acquisition Proposal. 

   

 (g) On and after the No-Shop Period Start Date, the Company shall promptly request that each third party (other than Excluded Parties and such other Persons acquiring confidential information of the Company and its Subsidiaries permitted by Section 5.2(c)), if any, that has executed an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement within the 12-month period prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Company Acquisition Proposal return or destroy all confidential information previously furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and all analyses and other materials prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contains, reflects or analyzes that information). If any such Person fails to provide, as required by the terms of the applicable Confidentiality Agreement between such Person, any certification of the destruction of all confidential information of the Company furnished to such Person and the Company within the time period allotted in the relevant confidentiality agreement (or if no such period is specified, then within a reasonable time period after the date hereof), then the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to secure its rights and ensure the performance of such other partys obligations thereunder as promptly as practicable. 

  

 5.3. _Fees and Expenses_. 

   

 (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.3 and except with respect to claims for damages incurred as a result of a material and willful breach of this Agreement, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

 (c) In the event of any termination of this Agreement by Parent or the Company under Section 7.1(h) under circumstances in which the Termination Fee is not payable, then the Company shall reimburse Parent as promptly as practicable (but in any event within two business days) following receipt of an invoice and supporting documentation reasonably acceptable to the Company of all of Parents actual and reasonably documented third party out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including legal fees and expenses) actually incurred by Parent and its affiliates prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Parent Expenses_ ");  _provided_ that in no event shall the amount of Parent Expenses to be reimbursed by the Company hereunder exceed $3,000,000. 

   

 (d) The Company shall pay the Termination Fee to Parent (x) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(g), on the day and as a precondition to the effectiveness of termination of this Agreement, and (y) in the case of a termination pursuant to Section 7.1(f) as promptly as possible (but in any event within five business days) following termination of this Agreement.

 (a) After the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law) each present and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any actual or threatened claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related to such Indemnitees service as a director or officer of the Company or its Subsidiaries or services performed by such Indemnitee at the request of the Company or its Subsidiaries at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or 

   ##### 

  

  

claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

    

 (b) The certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnitees than are presently set forth in the Companys Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and Restated Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified, except as required by applicable Law, in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any of the Indemnitees. 

   

 (c) As of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall either (i) obtain and maintain "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six years from the Effective Time with respect to officers and directors liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, to the extent available covering Indemnitees who are currently covered by the Companys existing officers and directors or fiduciary liability insurance policies or (ii) maintain such type of insurance (the " _D andO Insurance_") for a period of six years after the Effective Time, in each case in amount and scope, and on other terms no less advantageous in the aggregate to such Indemnitees than such existing insurance (copies of which policies have been made available to Parent and Acquisition (or Parent and Acquisition have otherwise had access to)); _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation will not be required to pay an amount therefor in excess of the multiple set forth on _Section 5.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule of the last annual premium paid prior to the date hereof, which the Company represents and warrants to be equal to the amount set forth in  _Section 5.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _Current Premium_ ");  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the existing DandO Insurance expires, is terminated or canceled during such six-year period, the Surviving Corporation will use reasonable efforts to obtain as much DandO Insurance as can be obtained for the remainder of such period for an amount not in excess of such multiple of the Current Premium as set forth on  _Section 5.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule. At the election of the Company, the Company may, with the consent of Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) obtain the "tail" insurance contemplated by (i) above on or prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person (including by dissolution), proper provisions shall be made so that such Person assumes the obligations set forth in this Section 5.5. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (wither arising before, at or after the Effective Time) is made against any Indemnitee on or prior to the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.5 shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (f) This Section 5.5, which shall survive the consummation of the Merger at the Effective Time and shall continue for the periods specified herein, is intended to benefit the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnitees, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 5.5 (whether or not parties to this Agreement). The indemnification provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which an Indemnitee is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, honor and perform under all indemnification agreements entered into by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. 

  

 5.6. _Reasonable Best Efforts_. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including the provisions of Section 5.2), each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable, under applicable Law or otherwise, to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

   

 (b) Parent and Acquisition shall use reasonable best efforts to arrange the Debt Financing as promptly as practicable taking into account the Termination Date on the terms and conditions described in the Debt Commitment Letter, including their reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained therein (including any related flex provisions) or on other terms and conditions no less favorable to Parent and Acquisition, including with respect to conditionality, (ii) maintain in effect the Financing commitments, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable to Parent and Acquisition in such definitive agreements that are within their respective control (including by consummating the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter), (iv) consummate the Financing at or prior to the Closing, and (v) enforce their rights under the Debt Commitment Letter. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms, taken as whole, that are no more adverse to Parent and the Company as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event but in no event later than the last day of the Marketing Period. In furtherance of the provisions of this Section 5.6(b), one or more Debt Commitment Letters may be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or superseded at the option of Parent after the date of this Agreement but prior to the Effective Time by instruments (the " _New Financing Letters_ ") which replace the existing Debt Commitment Letters and/or contemplate co-investment by or financing from one or more other or additional parties;  _provided_ , that the terms of the New Financing Letters (a) shall not expand upon the conditions precedent to the Debt Financing as set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters, (b) shall not reasonably be expected to delay or hinder the Closing, (c) reduce the aggregate amount of available Debt Financing and (d) are no less favorable to Parent, the Surviving Corporation or Acquisition in any material respect than the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. In such event, the term "Debt Commitment Letters" as used herein shall be deemed to include the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so superseded at the time in question and the New Financing Letters to the extent then in

shall have the Required Information that the Company is required to provide
Parent pursuant to Section 5.6(c) (the 45 day period specified in subclause

this definition of "Marketing Period") and (2) no event has occurred and no
conditions exist that would cause any of the conditions set forth in
Section 6.2 to fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled
for any time during such 20 consecutive business day period, and (B) the
conditions set forth in Section 6.1 have been satisfied (other than
conditions that by their nature can only be satisfied at the Closing).

    

 (c) The Company agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its Representatives to provide, all cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested by Parent (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries), including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions, "road shows" and sessions with rating agencies, (ii) furnishing Parent and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (the " _Required Information_ ") as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including audited financial statements for the Company for each of the three fiscal years ended December 31, 2004, 2005 and 2006, and unaudited financial statements for each fiscal quarter ended after December 31, 2006 and at least 45 days prior to the Effective Time (and the comparable period in the prior year), which interim financial statements shall have been reviewed by the independent accountants of the Company as provided in Statement of Auditing Standards No. 71 or 100 and all other financial data of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of type and form customarily included in the offering memoranda for private placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act, (iii) reasonably assisting Parent and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) any offering document for any financing to be raised to complete the Merger and (B) materials for rating agency presentations, (iv) reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral, (v) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants comfort letters, legal opinions, surveys, and title insurance as may be reasonably requested by Parent, and (vii) providing and executing customary documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent, including a customary solvency certificate by the executive financial officer of the Company at Closing. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries and their Representatives in connection with such cooperation. 

  

 5.7. _Publicity_. Except with respect to any Adverse Recommendation Change or any action taken pursuant to, and in accordance with, Section 5.2 or Article VII, so long as this Agreement is in effect, the parties will, to the maximum extent practicable, consult with each other before issuing any press release or other public announcement or releasing or using any document or taking any action that would require a filing obligation under Rule 14a-6(b) or Rule 14a-12(b) of the Exchange Act, in each case, pertaining to the Merger, the Financing or this

_provided_ ,  _however_ , that, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, the parties hereto understand and agree that the reasonable
best efforts of any party hereto shall not be deemed to include and no party

consent of Parent) (i) enter into any settlement, undertaking, consent

 9.5.  _Interpretation_. As used herein, the words "hereof", "herein", "herewith" and words of similar import shall, unless otherwise stated, be construed to refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and the words "Article" and "Section" are references to the articles and sections of this Agreement unless otherwise specified. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". Unless otherwise provided herein, each accounting term used in this Agreement has the meaning given to it in accordance with GAAP. As used in this Agreement, the term "affiliate" shall have the meaning set forth in Rule 12b-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act. When used herein, the phrase "to the Companys knowledge" means the actual knowledge of the persons set forth in _Section 9.5_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, and the phrase "to the knowledge of" when made with respect to a Person other than the Company means the actual knowledge of the officers and directors of such Person and such Persons Subsidiaries and other individuals who have similar powers and duties as the officers of such Persons. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such terms. Any agreement or statute referred to herein means such agreement or statute as from time to time amended, qualified or supplemented, including, in the case of statutes, by succession of comparable successor statutes. References to the Securities Act and to the Exchange Act are also references to the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder. References to a Person are also to its successors and permitted assigns. The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 9.6. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts (and may be delivered by facsimile), each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 9.7. _Entire Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, including the schedules and exhibits hereto, together with the confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guarantee, constitutes the entire agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof (other than the confidentiality and nondisclosure provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement which shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement). This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of each party hereto and to their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except as provided in Section 5.5 nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any other right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. 

  

 9.8. _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended, modified or supplemented, only by written agreement of Parent, Acquisition and the Company at any time prior to the Effective Time with respect to any of the terms contained herein; _provided_ that after Company Stockholder Approval is obtained, no term or condition contained in this Agreement shall be amended or 

   ##### 

  

 

modified in any manner that by Law requires further approval by the
stockholders of the Company without so obtaining such further stockholder
approval; and _provided_   _further_ , that on and after the Effective Time,
Section 5.5 may not be amended without the consent of each Indemnitee. 

   

 9.9. _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, either party hereto (for the purposes of this Section 9.9 treating the Company as one party and Parent and Acquisition, together, as another party) may, to the extent legally allowed (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts required hereby by the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto by the other party and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein by the other party. Any agreement on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by such party. No failure or delay by either party in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law. 

  

 9.10. _Governing Law_. This Agreement, and all claims arising hereunder or relating hereto or to the negotiation or performance hereof, shall be governed and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of Law thereof that would cause the Law of any other jurisdiction to be applied. 

  

 9.11. _Submission to Jurisdiction_. In any proceeding, between any of the parties hereto arising out of and relating to this Agreement, each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Delaware Court of Chancery or, in the event (but only in the event) such court does not have complete subject matter jurisdiction, any other court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding between the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if such court does not have complete subject matter jurisdiction, any other state court of the State of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such court. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.4 in connection with such action between the parties. Nothing in this Section 9.11 shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by Law. 

  

 9.12. _WAIVER OF TRIAL BY JURY_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF 

   ##### 

  

 

ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT, OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY
CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF
ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER
PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK OR ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER, (II) EACH PARTY UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF
THIS WAIVER, (III) EACH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) EACH
PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.12. 

   

 9.13. _Assignment_. No party hereto shall assign or otherwise transfer this Agreement or any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, except that any party may transfer or assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to (i) one or more of their affiliates at any time and (ii) after the Effective Time, to any Person; provided that such transfer or assignment (x) shall not relieve such party of its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other party hereto or due to such party and (y) such assignment shall not inhibit or delay the Closing. Any attempted assignment or transfer in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void. 

  

 9.14. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, by final judgment no longer subject to review, to be invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as neither the economic nor legal substance of the transactions contemplated herein is affected in any manner materially adverse to any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner. 

  

 9.15. _Certain Other Matters_. 

  

 Notwithstanding the lead-in to Article III hereof, in no event (a) shall any information solely contained in any section of any Company SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof entitled "Risk Factors" or "Forward-Looking Statements" (without additional disclosure otherwise set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule) be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) any representation(s) and warranty(ies) of the Company that is contained in this Agreement and (b) shall any other information contained in any section of any Company SEC Document filed prior to the date hereof be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure for purposes of) and representation(s) and warranty(ies) of the Company that is contained in this Agreement, except for factual statements included in the Company SEC Documents (excluding subjective opinions or judgments of management).
