delivered pursuant hereto by the other party and (c)&nbsp;waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein by the other party. Any agreement on the part of either party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed by

that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding between
the parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement in the Delaware Court of Chancery or, if
such court does not have complete subject matter jurisdiction, any other state court of the State
of Delaware or the United States District Court for the District of Delaware. Each of the parties
hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any
such court. Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in the manner
provided for notices in Section&nbsp;9.4 in connection with such action between the parties. Nothing in
this Section&nbsp;9.11 shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.
