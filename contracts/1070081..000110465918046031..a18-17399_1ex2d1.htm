terms of the Escrow Agreement for payment

 



      
 

 



 

to the holders thereof (which amount shall be paid by the Surviving
Corporation to such holders, subject to any applicable withholding as provided
in Section 2.9). The Company Equityholder Representative shall, prior to any
disbursement of funds for the benefit of Company Equityholders pursuant to
this Section 2.1(e)(ii) and/or the Escrow Agreement, deliver to the Buyer a
Post-Closing Disbursement Certificate in respect of such disbursement.

 



 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement to the contrary, but
subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in Section 8.5, the Buyer
shall withhold, in order to satisfy indemnification obligations owed to Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Article VIII hereto and any Final Closing
Adjustment in excess of the Escrow Funds, (A) the first $25,000,000 of
Contingent Consideration that becomes actually due and payable to Company
Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement and (B) 12.5% of any Contingent
Consideration, in excess of the first such $25,000,000, in each case, that
becomes actually due and payable under this Agreement prior to the date that
is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (collectively, the " _Holdback
Amount_ "). Any remaining Holdback Funds shall be disbursed by the Buyer
pursuant to this Agreement for the benefit of the Company Equityholders in
accordance with, and on the date(s) specified by, this Section 2.1(e)(iii) and
Section 8.5(d). A portion of such disbursed amount equal to the aggregate of
the Pro Rata Shares of such disbursed amount represented by all shares of
Company Stock converted pursuant to Section 2.1(c) or any Company Warrant
converted pursuant to Section 2.5 shall be paid by the Buyer to the Exchange
and Paying Agent pursuant to the terms of this Agreement for payment to the
holders thereof. A portion of such disbursed amount equal to the aggregate of
the Pro Rata Shares of such disbursed amount represented by all Vested Company
Options shall be paid by the Buyer to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement for payment to the holders thereof (which amount
shall be paid by the Surviving Corporation to such holders, subject to any
applicable withholding as provided in Section 2.9). The Company Equityholder
Representative shall, prior to any disbursement of funds for the benefit of
Company Equityholders pursuant to this Section 2.1(e)(iii), deliver to the
Buyer a Post-Closing Disbursement Certificate in respect of such disbursement.

 



 

(f) _Certain Adjustments to Per Share Amounts_. All per share amounts payable
to the Company Equityholders pursuant to this Article II shall be adjusted, as
applicable and appropriate, to reflect fully the effect of any
reclassification, stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any
dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Company Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Company
Stock occurring (or for which a record date is established) after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

(g) _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of Buyer Common Stock shall be issued in
exchange for any Company Stock, Company Equity Awards or Company Warrants, and
no holder of any of the foregoing shall be entitled to receive a fractional
share of Buyer Common Stock; provided, that in lieu of such fraction of a
share, the holder of such Company Stock, Company Options or Company Warrants
for which a fraction of a share of Buyer Common Stock would otherwise be
payable hereunder shall be entitled to an amount in cash (rounded to the
nearest whole cent) determined by multiplying such fraction by the Buyer
Closing Stock Price.

 



      
 

 



 

2.2 _Payment Fund_. The procedures for exchanging outstanding shares of
Company Stock for the consideration to be paid to the holders of such Company
Stock in connection with the Merger are as follows:

 



 

(a) _Exchange and Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer
shall (in accordance with Section 2.1(d)(ii)(F)) deposit the Payment Fund with
the Exchange and Paying Agent for payment to the Company Equityholders in
accordance with this Section 2.2 and the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. The
Exchange and Paying Agent shall, pursuant to instructions from the Buyer in
accordance with the Exchange and Paying Agent Agreement and the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule, deliver the applicable portion of the Aggregate Closing
Consideration out of the Payment Fund for payment in respect of Company Stock
and Company Warrants. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than as specified in this Section 2.2(a).

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall
cause the Exchange and Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of
Company Stock that was issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (i) a Letter of Transmittal and (ii) instructions for effecting
the surrender of such Certificate in exchange for the applicable Aggregate
Consideration that is or may become payable with respect thereto pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. Upon (A) proper surrender of a Certificate for
cancellation to the Exchange and Paying Agent and (B) delivery of a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal, the holder of such Certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor cash and Buyer Common Stock
in an amount equal to the Aggregate Closing Consideration payable in respect
of the shares of Company Stock represented by such Certificate, as determined
in accordance with Section 2.1 and reflected on the Closing Date Allocation
Schedule attached to the Closing Payment Certificate. If payment in respect of
any Certificate is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
such Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the
Certificate so surrendered shall be transferable and be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer, that the signatures on such
Certificate or any related stock power shall be properly guaranteed and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have established to the satisfaction
of the Buyer and the Exchange and Paying Agent that any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate have been paid or are not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.2(b), each Certificate shall be
deemed at all times after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the applicable portion of the Aggregate Closing
Consideration and the applicable portion of any Future Payments that become
payable pursuant to this Agreement in respect of such Certificate. Holders of
Certificates shall not be entitled to receive any portion of the Aggregate
Consideration to which they would otherwise be entitled until such
Certificates are properly surrendered. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a
Certificate is held in electronic form, then surrender of such Certificate
shall be effected upon delivery to Buyer of a confirmation of cancellation of
such Certificate from the CompanyÂ’s transfer agent, eShares, Inc. (DBA Carta,
Inc.).

 



 

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All consideration paid
following the surrender for exchange of Certificates evidencing shares of
Company Stock (including any Future Payments payable with respect thereto) in
accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stock, and from and after the Effective Time there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Stock which were outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange and
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided
in this Article II, subject to Section 2.2(e).

 



 

(d) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any amount deposited with the Exchange and
Paying Agent that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Stock or
Company Warrants until nine (9) months after the Effective Time shall be
delivered to the Buyer (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law), upon demand, and any holder of Company Stock or Company Warrants who is
entitled to such amount under this Section 2.2 shall (subject to Section
2.2(e)) be entitled to seek payment of such amount from the Buyer only as a
general creditor thereof.

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. To the extent permitted by applicable Law, none of the
Buyer, the Transitory Subsidiary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange and Paying Agent shall be liable to any Company Equityholder for
any amount delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificates shall not have been
exchanged prior to the fourth (4th) anniversary of the Closing Date (or
immediately prior to such earlier date on which the related consideration
payable pursuant to this Article II would otherwise escheat to or become the
property of any Governmental Entity), any such consideration in respect
thereof shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property
of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 



 

(f) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact and a customary
indemnification of the Company and the Buyer in a form reasonably satisfactory
to the Buyer by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed, the Exchange and Paying Agent shall pay in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Aggregate Consideration payable in respect
thereof pursuant to this Agreement. The Exchange and Paying Agent or the Buyer
may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment thereof,
require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to agree to an
indemnity in favor of the Exchange and Paying Agent and/or the Buyer against
any claim that may be made against the Exchange and Paying Agent or the Buyer
with respect to the Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or
destroyed; _provided_ , that no such indemnity shall require the posting of a
bond by the owner of such Certificate so long as the Aggregate Closing
Consideration to be received by such owner (assuming, for this purpose, that
the value of the Closing Stock Consideration included within such Aggregate
Closing Consideration equals the applicable number of shares of Buyer Common
Stock multiplied by the Buyer Closing Stock Price) does not exceed $50,000 in
the aggregate.

 



 

2.3 _Dissenting Shares_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent the right to
receive any portion of the

 



      
 

 



 

Aggregate Consideration in accordance with Section 2.1, but shall be entitled
only to such rights as are granted by the DGCL to a holder of Dissenting
Shares.

 



 

(b) If any Dissenting Shares shall lose their status as such (through failure
to perfect or otherwise), then, as of the later of the Effective Time or the
date of loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive any portion of the Aggregate
Consideration otherwise payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement,
without interest thereon, upon surrender of the Certificate formerly
representing such shares.

 



 

(c) The Company shall give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any written demand
for appraisal received by the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL, any withdrawal of any such demand and any other demand, notice or
instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to
the DGCL that relates to such demand and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not settle or make any payment or settlement
offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument unless the Buyer shall have given its written consent to such
settlement, payment or settlement offer (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

2.4 _Company Equityholder Representative_.

 



 

(a) By their execution of this Agreement or the Letter of Transmittal,
approval of the Merger and adoption of this Agreement and/or their acceptance
of any consideration pursuant to this Agreement, each Company Equityholder
shall be deemed to have approved, and shall have approved, the appointment of,
and hereby irrevocably (subject only to Section 2.4(e)) appoints, the Company
Equityholder Representative as the representative, attorney-in-fact and agent
of the Company Equityholders for all purposes in connection with delivering
Post-Closing Disbursement Certificates pursuant to Section 2.1(e), Section
2.4(c), Section 2.7(a), and Section 2.7(c), determining the Final Closing
Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6, amending or modifying the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule pursuant to Section 2.7(a), matters relating to Contingent
Payments pursuant to Section 2.8, receiving notices regarding Registration
Statements pursuant to Section 6.10(d), addressing indemnification claims
under Article VIII, handling tax matters under Section 9.3 and privilege
matters pursuant to Section 12.11, in each case pursuant to this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, including the Exchange and Paying Agent
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and in any related litigation or
arbitration. In connection therewith, the Company Equityholder Representative
is authorized to do or refrain from doing all further acts and things, and to
execute all such documents as the Company Equityholder Representative shall
deem necessary or appropriate, and shall have the power and authority to:

 



 

(i) act for some or all of the Company Equityholders with regard to all
matters pertaining to this Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto,
including the Exchange and Paying Agent Agreement or the Escrow Agreement;

 



 

(ii) act for the Company Equityholders to transact matters of litigation;

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) execute and deliver all amendments, waivers, ancillary agreements,
certificates and documents that the Company Equityholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in connection therewith, including delivering any
update to or correction, amendment or modification of the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule permitted by Section 2.7(a);

 



 

(iv) receive the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount, make
payments from such amount, and give receipts for such payments;

 



 

(v) do or refrain from doing, on behalf of the Company Equityholders, any
further act or deed that the Company Equityholder Representative deems
necessary or appropriate in the Company Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s
discretion relating to such matters, in each case as fully and completely as
the Company Equityholders could do if personally present;

 



 

(vi) give and receive all notices required to be given or received by the
Company Equityholders under this Agreement and any agreements ancillary
hereto, including the Exchange and Paying Agent Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement;

 



 

(vii) give any written direction to the Exchange and Paying Agent or the
Escrow Agent;

 



 

(viii) agree to, negotiate and/or comply with the determination of the Final
Closing Adjustment Statement, the Final Closing Adjustment Items and the Final
Closing Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6, and to agree to, negotiate, comply
with and/or enter into settlement and compromises regarding any Contingent
Consideration pursuant to Section 2.8;

 



 

(ix) agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises and/or comply
with arbitration awards and court orders with respect to claims for
indemnification made by the Buyer under Article VIII; and

 



 

(x) receive service of process in connection with any claims under this
Agreement and any agreements ancillary hereto, including the Exchange and
Paying Agent Agreement and/or the Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) All decisions and actions of the Company Equityholder Representative on
behalf of the Company Equityholders shall be deemed to be facts ascertainable
outside of this Agreement and shall be binding upon all Company Equityholders,
and no Company Equityholder shall have the right to object, dissent, protest
or otherwise contest the same.

 



 

(c) At the Effective Time, the Buyer shall pay the Company Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount to the Company Equityholder Representative,
which will be used for the purposes of paying directly, or reimbursing the
Company Equityholder Representative for, any third party expenses pursuant to
this Agreement and the agreements ancillary hereto. In no event shall the
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation (or any of their respective Affiliates) be
obligated to reimburse the Company Equityholder Representative for any such
expenses. The Company Equityholders will not receive any interest or earnings
on the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount and irrevocably
transfer and assign to the Company Equityholder Representative any ownership
right that they may otherwise have had

 



      
 

 



 

in any such interest or earnings. The Company Equityholder Representative will
not be liable for any loss of principal of the Company Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount other than as a result of its bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct. The Company Equityholder Representative will
hold these funds separate from its corporate funds in a segregated account,
will not use these funds for its operating expenses or any other corporate
purposes and will not voluntarily make these funds available to its creditors
in the event of bankruptcy. As soon as practicable following the completion of
the Company Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s responsibilities, the Company
Equityholder Representative shall deliver any then remaining portion of the
Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount (the " _Company
Equityholder Representative Account Payment_ ") to the Buyer, which will
promptly pay (i) a portion thereof equal to the Pro Rata Share that is
represented by each share of Company Stock converted pursuant to Section
2.1(c) to the Exchange and Paying Agent for payment to the holder thereof,
(ii) a portion thereof equal to the Pro Rata Share that is represented by each
Company Warrant converted pursuant to Section 2.5 to the Exchange and Paying
Agent for payment to the holder thereof, and (iii) a portion thereof equal to
the Pro Rata Share that is represented by each Company Equity Award to the
Surviving Corporation for payment to the holder thereof (which amount shall be
paid by the Surviving Corporation to such holder, in accordance with Section
2.5, subject to any applicable withholding as provided in Section 2.9). The
Company Equityholder Representative shall prior to any disbursement of funds
for the benefit of Company Equityholders pursuant to this Section 2.4(c),
deliver to the Buyer a Post-Closing Disbursement Certificate in respect of
such disbursement. The Company Equityholder Representative shall hold the
Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount for the benefit of all of
the Company Equityholders, and the Company Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount shall not be used for any other purpose not expressly set forth herein
and shall not be available to the Buyer to satisfy any claims hereunder.

 



 

(d) The Company Equityholder Representative shall act for the Company
Equityholders on all of the matters set forth in this Agreement, the Exchange
and Paying Agent Agreement and the Escrow Agreement in the manner the Company
Equityholder Representative believes to be in the best interest of the Company
Equityholders. The Company Equityholder Representative is authorized to act on
behalf of the Company Equityholders notwithstanding any dispute or
disagreement among the Company Equityholders. In taking any action as Company
Equityholder Representative, the Company Equityholder Representative may rely
conclusively, without any further inquiry or investigation, upon any
certification or confirmation, oral or written, given by any Person whom the
Company Equityholder Representative reasonably believes to be authorized
thereunto. The Company Equityholder Representative may, in all questions
arising hereunder, rely on the advice of counsel, and the Company Equityholder
Representative shall not be liable to any Company Equityholder for anything
done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the Company Equityholder
Representative based on such advice. The Company Equityholder Representative
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Agreement and no implied covenants or obligations shall be read
into this Agreement against the Company Equityholder Representative. The
Company Equityholder Representative will incur no liability of any kind to
Company Equityholders with respect to any action or omission by the Company
Equityholder Representative in connection with the Company Equityholder
RepresentativeÂ’s services pursuant to this Agreement and any agreements
ancillary hereto, except in the event of liability directly resulting from the
Company Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. Each Company

 



      
 

 



 

Equityholder, severally and not jointly in accordance with its Pro Rata Share,
will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company Equityholder
Representative from and against any and all losses, liabilities, damages,
claims, penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs and expenses
(including the fees and expenses of counsel and experts and their staffs and
all expense of document location, duplication and shipment) (collectively, "
_Representative Losses_ ") arising out of or in connection with the Company
Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s execution and performance of this Agreement and
any agreements ancillary hereto, in each case as such Representative Loss is
suffered or incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such
Representative Loss is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by the
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Company Equityholder
Representative, the Company Equityholder Representative will reimburse the
Company Equityholders the amount of such indemnified Representative Loss to
the extent attributable to such bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct. If not paid directly to the Company Equityholder Representative by
the Company Equityholders, any such Representative Losses may be recovered by
the Company Equityholder Representative from (i) the Company Equityholder
Representative Expense Amount and (ii) any Future Payments at such time as
remaining amounts would otherwise be distributable to the Company
Equityholders; provided, that while this section allows the Company
Equityholder Representative to be paid from the aforementioned sources of
funds, this does not relieve the Company Equityholders from their obligation
to promptly pay such Representative Losses as they are suffered or incurred,
nor does it prevent the Company Equityholder Representative from seeking from
the Company Equityholders any remedies available to it at law or otherwise. In
no event will the Company Equityholder Representative be required to advance
its own funds on behalf of the Company Equityholders or otherwise.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any restrictions
or limitations on liability or indemnification obligations of, or provisions
limiting the recourse against non-parties, otherwise applicable to the Company
Equityholders set forth elsewhere in this Agreement are not intended to be
applicable to the indemnities provided by the Company Equityholders to the
Company Equityholder Representative under this section. The foregoing
indemnities will survive the Closing, the resignation or removal of the
Company Equityholder Representative or the termination of this Agreement. In
no event will the Buyer or Surviving Corporation be responsible for any fees,
costs or expenses of the Company Equityholder Representative.

 



 

(e) In the event the Company Equityholder Representative becomes unable to
perform the Company Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s responsibilities hereunder
or resigns from such position, the Company Equityholders (acting by a written
instrument signed by holders of Company Stock who held, as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time, a majority (by voting power) of the then
outstanding shares of Company Stock) shall select another representative to
fill the vacancy of the Company Equityholder Representative, and such
substituted representative shall be deemed to be the Company Equityholder
Representative for all purposes of this Agreement. The Company Equityholder
Representative may be removed only upon delivery of written notice to the
Buyer signed by Persons who, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
held a majority (by voting power) of the then outstanding shares of Company
Stock; provided that no such removal shall be effective until such time as a
successor Company Equityholder Representative shall have been validly
appointed hereunder. The Company Equityholder Representative shall provide the
Buyer prompt written notice of any replacement of the Company Equityholder
Representative, including the identity and address of the new Company
Equityholder Representative. Upon any replacement of the Company Equityholder

 



      
 

 



 

Representative, the Company Equityholder Representative being replaced shall
transfer to the new Company Equityholder Representative the balance of any
unexpended Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount.

 



 

(f) For all purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) the Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the instructions and
decisions of the Company Equityholder Representative as to the settlement of
any disputes or claims under this Agreement or any agreements ancillary
hereto, including the Exchange and Paying Agent Agreement or the Escrow
Agreement, or any other actions required or permitted to be taken by the
Company Equityholder Representative hereunder, and no party hereunder or any
Company Equityholder shall have any cause of action against the Buyer for any
action taken by the Buyer in reliance upon the instructions or decisions of
the Company Equityholder Representative;

 



 

(ii) the provisions of this Section 2.4 are independent and severable, are
irrevocable (subject only to Section 2.4(e)) and coupled with an interest and
shall be enforceable notwithstanding any rights or remedies that any Company
Equityholder may have in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and

 



 

(iii) the provisions of this Section 2.4 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successor trustees and
successors of each Company Equityholder, and any references in this Agreement
to a Company Equityholder shall mean and include the successors to the rights
of each applicable Company Equityholder hereunder, whether pursuant to
testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and distribution or otherwise.

 



 

2.5 _Treatment of Company Equity Awards and Company Warrants._

 



 

(a) _Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(i) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Option that is
then outstanding (but not to the extent it has theretofore been exercised)
shall be cancelled and each Company Option that is vested as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (including any such Company Option that shall
become vested in connection therewith) (each, a " _Vested Company Option_ ")
shall be converted, in settlement and cancellation thereof, into the right to
receive an amount equal to (A) such Vested Company OptionÂ’s Closing Waterfall
Per Share Amount minus the per share exercise price of such Vested Company
Option, plus (B) such Vested Company OptionÂ’s Pro Rata Share of the portion of
all Future Payments that become payable pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, in each case subject to withholding as provided in Section 2.9;
_provided_ , _however_ , that notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
no portion of the Aggregate Consideration shall be payable to any holder of
any such Vested Company Option unless and until such holder shall have
executed and delivered to the Buyer a Surrender Agreement; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that all payments to holders of Vested Company Options pursuant to
this Section 2.8(a)(i) shall be composed entirely of cash in lieu of any
shares of Buyer Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable in respect of
such Vested Company Options, and the Closing Cash Consideration and Closing
Stock Consideration payable to

 



      
 

 



 

Company Stockholders and holders of Company Warrants shall be adjusted
proportionately, in each case as reflected on the Closing Date Allocation
Schedule. Each Company Option other than a Vested Company Option (an "
_Unvested Company Option_ ") shall be cancelled without the payment of any
consideration therefor. For purposes of clarification, for any outstanding
awards of Company Options that are partially vested (or that shall be
partially vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time), only the
vested portion of such grants shall be considered Vested Company Options, and
the unvested portions of such grants shall be considered Unvested Company
Options.

 



 

(ii) As of immediately prior to the Effective Time, each Company Restricted
Stock Award that is unvested in whole or in part shall vest in full (and all
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock issued in connection with such
Company Restricted Stock Award shall be converted pursuant to Section
2.1(c)(iii)).

 



 

(iii) Upon the conversion and cancellation of any Company Equity Award
pursuant to this Section 2.5(a), such Company Equity Award shall no longer
represent the right to acquire any shares of Company Stock or other Equity
Interests, but shall entitle the holder thereof to receive only the
consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this Section 2.5(a).

 



 

(iv) Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall provide to (i) each
holder of Company Equity Awards a letter, in the form of _Exhibit I_ hereto,
describing the treatment of such Company Equity Awards pursuant to this
Section 2.5(a) and (ii) each holder of Company Restricted Stock Awards a
letter, in the form of _Exhibit K_ hereto, describing the treatment of such
Company Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to this Section 2.5.

 



 

(v) Subject to the BuyerÂ’s receipt from a holder of Company Options of a
Surrender Agreement, the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay as
promptly as practicable after the later of (1) the Effective Time and (2) the
date on which the Buyer receives from the applicable holder of Company Options
an executed Surrender Agreement, to each holder of such Company Options the
portion of the Aggregate Closing Consideration payable to such holder pursuant
to this Section 2.5(a), subject to any applicable withholding as provided in
Section 2.9, in accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. The
Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to pay to each holder of Company
Equity Awards any amounts payable with respect to each Future Payment (subject
to any applicable withholding as provided in Section 2.9) in accordance with
Section 2.7 hereof.

 



 

(vi) The Company shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all actions
reasonably necessary in connection with the treatment of Company Equity Awards
contemplated by this Section 2.5(a), including obtaining the consent from each
holder of any Company Equity Award (unless such consent is not required under
the terms of the applicable agreement, instrument or plan). The Company shall
also use Reasonable Best Efforts prior to the Effective Time to obtain (A) an
Investor Representation Letter from each holder of Company Equity Awards and
(B) a Surrender Agreement, which shall be effective as of the Effective Time,
duly executed by each holder of a Company Equity Award.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, each Company Warrant that is
then outstanding (but not to the extent it has theretofore been exercised)
shall be cancelled and shall be converted, in settlement and cancellation
thereof, into the right to receive an amount equal to (A) such Company
WarrantÂ’s Closing Waterfall Per Share Amount minus the per share exercise
price of such Company Warrant, plus (B) such Company WarrantÂ’s Pro Rata Share
of the portion of all Future Payments that become payable pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, in each case subject to withholding as provided in
Section 2.9. As soon as practicable following the execution of this Agreement,
the Company shall provide to each holder of a Company Warrant a letter, in the
form of _Exhibit J_ hereto, describing the treatment of such Company Warrant
pursuant to this Section 2.5(b). (A) Prior to the date of this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company has adopted the necessary resolutions and
taken such other actions, and (B) promptly following the date of this
Agreement (but in any event prior to the Closing Date), the Company shall take
all other actions as may be required, in each case to effect the treatment
described in this Section 2.5(b) prior to the Effective Time.

 



 

2.6 _Adjustment Before and After the Closing_. The Estimated Closing
Adjustment and the Final Closing Adjustment shall be determined as set forth
below in this Section 2.6:

 



 

(a) Not later than four (4) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a statement (the " _Estimated
Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the Estimated Closing
Adjustment, including an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and the Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, together
with all relevant backup materials, in detail reasonably acceptable to the
Buyer. The Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement and such consolidated
balance sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a basis
consistent with the application thereof to the most recent audited financial
statements included in the Company Financial Statements (to the extent
consistent with GAAP). _Schedule 2.6(a)_ attached hereto reflects the Closing
Adjustment Items to be included in the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement,
including estimated amounts in respect thereof as of the date of this
Agreement. From the delivery of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement
until such time as the calculation of the Estimated Closing Adjustment has
been finally determined pursuant to this Section 2.6(a), the Buyer and its
accountants shall, upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours, be
permitted to discuss with the Company and its accountants the Estimated
Closing Adjustment Statement and shall be provided complete and accurate
copies of, and have reasonable access, upon reasonable notice at reasonable
times during normal business hours, to the work papers and supporting records
of the Company and its accountants so as to allow the Buyer and its
accountants to verify the accuracy of the Estimated Closing Adjustment
Statement. If the Buyer objects to the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement,
the Company and the Buyer will work together in good faith to resolve the
issues in dispute. If all disputed issues are resolved, the amounts as agreed
upon by the Buyer and the Company shall be used to determine the Estimated
Closing Adjustment. If the Buyer and the Company are unable to resolve all
such disputed issues within four (4) Business Days following the BuyerÂ’s
receipt of the Estimated Closing Adjustment Statement, the Estimated Closing
Adjustment shall be as determined by the Company.

 



 

(b) Not later than 60 calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
deliver to the Company Equityholder Representative the Closing Adjustment
Statement, including a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and the
Subsidiaries as of immediately

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time. The Closing Adjustment Statement and such
consolidated balance sheet shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a basis consistent with the application thereof to the most recent audited
financial statements included in the Company Financial Statements (to the
extent consistent with GAAP). The Closing Adjustment Statement delivered
pursuant to this Section 2.6(b) shall be accompanied by a statement setting
forth the amount, if any, by which the total of the Closing Adjustment Items
is greater than, or less than, the Estimated Closing Adjustment. The Closing
Adjustment Statement, as proposed by Buyer pursuant to this Section 2.6(b),
shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 2.6 to be the " _Final Closing
Adjustment Statement_ ," the Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall
be deemed for purposes of this Section 2.6 to be the " _Final Closing
Adjustment Items_ " and each shall be final and binding on all parties to this
Agreement and on all Company Equityholders, unless the Company Equityholder
Representative timely delivers to the Buyer an Objection Notice in accordance
with Section 2.6(c).

 



 

(c) In the event that the Company Equityholder Representative disputes the
Closing Adjustment Statement or the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items,
the Company Equityholder Representative shall notify the Buyer in writing (the
" _Objection Notice_ ") of the amount, nature and basis of such dispute,
within 30 calendar days after delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement
pursuant to Section 2.6(b). Any such Objection Notice shall specify those
items or amounts as to which the Company Equityholder Representative
disagrees, and the Company Equityholder Representative shall be deemed to have
agreed with all other items and amounts contained in the Closing Adjustment
Statement and the amount of the Closing Adjustment Items delivered pursuant to
Section 2.6(b). In the event of such a dispute, the Buyer and the Company
Equityholder Representative shall first negotiate in good faith to reach
agreement on the disputed items or amounts in order to determine the amount of
the Closing Adjustment Items, which amount shall not be more than the BuyerÂ’s
calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.6(b) nor less than the Company
Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s calculation delivered pursuant to this Section
2.6(c). If the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative reach a final
resolution on the Closing Adjustment Statement within 30 days after the
BuyerÂ’s receipt of the Objection Notice (or within any additional period as
mutually agreed to between the Buyer and the Company Equityholder
Representative), then the Closing Adjustment Statement agreed upon by the
Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative shall be deemed for purposes
of this Section 2.6 to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Statement_ ," the
Closing Adjustment Items reflected thereon shall be deemed for purposes of
this Section 2.6 to be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Items_ " and each shall
be final and binding on all parties to this Agreement and on all Company
Equityholders.

 



 

(d) If the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative are unable to
resolve the dispute within 30 calendar days after delivery of the Objection
Notice, then any remaining items in dispute shall be submitted to the Neutral
Accountant. All determinations and calculations pursuant to this Section
2.6(d) shall consider only those Closing Adjustment Items that are set forth
in the Objection Notice and remain in dispute, shall be a value that is not
more than the BuyerÂ’s calculation delivered pursuant to Section 2.6(b) nor
less than the Company Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s calculation delivered
pursuant to Section 2.6(c), shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the
Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative as promptly as practicable.
Absent fraud or manifest error, the Closing Adjustment Statement as finally
determined by the Neutral Accountant shall be deemed for purposes of this
Section 2.6 to

 



      
 

 



 

be the " _Final Closing Adjustment Statement_ ," the Closing Adjustment Items
reflected thereon shall be deemed for purposes of this Section 2.6 to be the "
_Final Closing Adjustment Items_ " and each shall be final and binding on all
parties to this Agreement and on all Company Equityholders. In determining the
Closing Adjustment Statement and the Closing Adjustment Items, the Neutral
Accountant shall act as an expert and not as arbitrator. A judgment on the
determination made by the Neutral Accountant pursuant to this Section 2.6 may
be entered in and enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereover.

 



 

(e) Subject to Section 2.6(f), the fees and expenses of the Neutral Accountant
in connection with the resolution of disputes pursuant to Section 2.6(d) shall
be borne by the Company Equityholders (in each case, in accordance with their
Pro Rata Share), on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other hand, in
proportion to the amounts by which the proposals of the Buyer and the Company
Equityholder Representative differed from the Neutral AccountantÂ’s final
determination.

 



 

(f) The " _Final Closing Adjustment_ " shall be equal to (i) the amount of the
Final Closing Adjustment Items, minus (ii) the Estimated Closing Adjustment.
For the avoidance of doubt, the Final Closing Adjustment may be a positive or
negative number. If the Final Closing Adjustment is greater than zero (0),
then the Buyer shall be entitled to receive payment of the Final Closing
Adjustment from the Company Equityholders, together with any fees and expenses
of the Neutral Accountant to be borne by the Company Equityholders pursuant to
Section 2.6(e) to the extent advanced by Buyer, promptly (and in no event
later than two (2) Business Days) after the date of determination of the Final
Closing Adjustment; _provided_ that the BuyerÂ’s recourse with respect to any
such Final Closing Adjustment shall be limited to, without duplication, (a)
the then-current balance of the Escrow Fund, (b) subject to Section
2.1(e)(iii) and Section 8.5(d), the Holdback Funds (if any) and (c) the
Adjusted Guaranteed Amount; _provided_ , _further_ , that as among any then-
current balance of the Escrow Fund, the Holdback Funds and the Adjusted
Guaranteed Amount, the Buyer shall seek recourse first against the Escrow
Fund. For the avoidance of doubt, except in the case of fraud (but subject to
the limitations set forth in Section 8.5(e)), the Buyer shall not be entitled
to direct recourse against any Company Equityholder with respect to any Final
Closing Adjustment. If the Final Closing Adjustment is less than zero (0),
then promptly (and in no event later than two (2) Business Days) after the
date of determination of the Final Closing Adjustment: (1) a portion thereof
equal to the aggregate of the Pro Rata Shares of such Final Closing Adjustment
represented by all shares of Company Stock converted pursuant to Section
2.1(c) and all Company Warrants converted pursuant to Section 2.5 shall be
paid by the Buyer to the Exchange and Paying Agent for payment to the holders
thereof and (2) a portion thereof equal to the aggregate of the Pro Rata
Shares of such Final Closing Adjustment represented by all Vested Company
Options shall be paid by the Buyer to the Surviving Corporation for payment to
the holders thereof (subject to any applicable withholding as provided in
Section 2.9); _provided_ , that all such payments by the Buyer under clauses
(1) and (2) of this Section 2.6(f) shall be composed of one-hundred percent
(100%) cash. The percentage of the Final Closing Adjustment, if any, to be
distributed to each Company Equityholder is set forth opposite such Company
EquityholderÂ’s name on the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if (A) the Final Closing Adjustment is a positive number and is
less than $100,000, or (B) the Final Closing Adjustment is a negative number
and is greater than ($100,000), then no Final Closing Adjustment payments
shall be made pursuant to this Section 2.6(f).

 



      
 

 



 

(g) From the delivery of the Closing Adjustment Statement until such time as
the calculation of the Final Closing Adjustment has been finally determined
pursuant to this Section 2.6, the Company Equityholder Representative and its
accountants (at the Company Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s expense on behalf of
the Company Equityholders) shall, upon reasonable notice and during normal
business hours, be permitted to discuss with the Buyer and its accountants the
Closing Adjustment Statement and shall be provided complete and accurate
copies of, and have reasonable access, upon reasonable notice at reasonable
times during normal business hours, to the work papers and supporting records
of the Buyer and its accountants so as to allow the Company Equityholder
Representative and its accountants to verify the accuracy of the Closing
Adjustment Statement.

 



 

(h) The parties agree that the procedures set forth in this Section 2.6 shall
be the sole and exclusive method for resolving any disputes with respect to
the determination of the Final Closing Adjustment Statement, the Final Closing
Adjustment Items and the Final Closing Adjustment; _provided_ , that this
provision shall not prohibit the Buyer or the Company Equityholder
Representative from instituting litigation to enforce the determination of the
Neutral Accountant and shall not limit any remedy of any party under Article
VIII.

 



 

2.7 _Allocation Schedules; Payments of Future Payments_.

 



 

(a) The Preliminary Closing Date Allocation Schedule sets forth a true,
correct and complete summary of the allocation (estimated as of the date
hereof) of the amounts payable to the Company Equityholders pursuant to this
Agreement. The Company shall deliver to the Buyer and the Exchange and Paying
Agent, at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule (attached as an exhibit to the Closing Payment
Certificate). From time to time after the Effective Time, the Company
Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders) may, with
the written agreement of the Buyer, update, correct or otherwise amend or
modify the Closing Date Allocation Schedule in any manner that is consistent
with the express provisions of this Article II, including by delivering a
Post-Closing Disbursement Certificate that supersedes such Closing Date
Allocation Schedule. The Buyer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the
Closing Date Allocation Schedule as in effect from time to time and/or any
Post-Closing Disbursement Certificate, as applicable, and, as between the
Company Equityholders, on the one hand, and the Buyer and the Surviving
Corporation, on the other hand, any amounts delivered by the Buyer to any
Company Equityholder (or delivered by the Buyer to the Exchange and Paying
Agent for delivery) in accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule
and/or Post-Closing Disbursement Certificate, as applicable, in effect from
time to time shall be deemed for all purposes to have been delivered to the
applicable Company Equityholder in full satisfaction of the obligations of the
Buyer and the Surviving Corporation under this Article II.

 



 

(b) The Exchange and Paying Agent shall make all payments constituting
Aggregate Consideration to the applicable Company Equityholders in accordance

the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation shall pay the portion of the Closing
Cash Consideration payable to the holders of Company Equity Awards pursuant to
Section 2.5(a) to the holders thereof in accordance with the Closing Date
Allocation Schedule (subject to any applicable withholding as provided in

(c) The portion of any Future Payment payable in respect of Company Stock and
any Company Warrant shall be paid by the Buyer or the Surviving Corporation to
the Exchange and Paying Agent for the benefit of the holders thereof, and the
portion of any Future Payment payable in respect of Company Equity Awards
shall be paid (subject to any applicable withholding as provided in Section
2.9) by the Surviving Corporation to the holders thereof, in each case in
accordance with the Closing Date Allocation Schedule. The Company Equityholder
Representative shall, prior to any disbursement of funds for the benefit of
Company Equityholders pursuant to this Section 2.7(c), deliver to the Buyer a
Post-Closing Disbursement Certificate in respect to such disbursement.

 



 

(d) The parties understand and agree that (i) the Company Equityholders have
no rights as a security holder of the Surviving Corporation or the Buyer as a
result of their right to receive the Future Payments, (ii) without limiting
the generality of Section 12.4, no right to receive any Future Payment may be
assigned or otherwise transferred without the prior written consent of the
Buyer and any purported assignment or transfer in the absence of such consent
shall be null and void _ab initio_ , and (iii) no interest is payable as
additional consideration with respect to any of the Future Payments.

 



 

2.8 _Contingent Payments_. Subject to Section 2.1(e)(iii), Section 8.5(d) and

amount of any Net Sales Payments and any other payments due under this
Agreement for any applicable Calendar Quarter, in which case, the Buyer shall
bear the cost of such audit and shall reasonably promptly remit to the
Exchange and Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for the
benefit of the Company Equityholders, the amount of any such underpayment. Any
overpayment by Buyer revealed by an audit shall be credited against or set-off
against Future Payments owed by the Buyer to the Company Equityholders

to Contingent Consideration (i) shall not be evidenced by a certificate or
other instrument, (ii) shall not be assignable or otherwise transferable by
such Company Equityholder, except by will, upon death or by operation of Law,

provide Buyer with access or information that the Company is expressly
prohibited by applicable Law from granting or disclosing, or (ii) take any
action that would, in the advice of counsel, constitute a waiver of the
attorney-client privilege or the attorney work product privilege in the event

Subsidiaries.

by the Buyer, use its Reasonable Best Efforts to introduce the Buyer to

Company shall promptly deliver to the Buyer notice (including a reasonably
detailed description) of any fact, circumstance or development that

material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant set forth herein,
any material misstatement in or omission from the Disclosure Statement or the

6.7 _280G Covenant_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain a waiver from each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section
280G(c) of the Code) with respect to the Company who would reasonably be
expected to receive or have received any payment or benefits that would
constitute a "parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(2)(A)
of the Code) of such disqualified individualÂ’s rights to some or all of such
payments or benefits (the " _Waived 280G Benefits_ " and, each such waiver, a
" _280G Waiver_ ") so that all remaining payments and/or benefits, if any,
shall not be "excess parachute payments" (within the meaning of Section 280G
of the Code), and, not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing
Date, the Company shall submit to a stockholder vote, in a manner that is
intended to satisfy the stockholder approval requirements under Section

the right of any such "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c)
of the Code) that has entered into a 280G Waiver to receive or retain such
Waived 280G Benefits. Such vote shall establish such disqualified individualsÂ’
right to the payment or other compensation if approved by the Company
Stockholders. In addition, the Company shall provide adequate disclosure to
Company Stockholders that hold voting Company Stock of all material facts
concerning all payments to any such disqualified individual that, but for such
vote, could be deemed "parachute payments" under Section 280G of the Code in a
manner that satisfies Section 280G(b)(5)(B)(ii) of the Code and regulations
promulgated thereunder. At least four (4) Business Days prior to the vote, the
Buyer and its counsel shall be given the right to review and comment on all
documents required to be delivered to the Company Stockholders in connection
with such vote and any required disqualified individual waivers or consents,
and the Company shall reasonably consider all comments of the Buyer or its
counsel thereon. Buyer and its counsel shall be provided copies of all
documents executed by the stockholders and disqualified individuals in
connection with the vote.

IRS on behalf of the Company after the Closing, or (b) each of the Company
Stockholders shall deliver to the Buyer

Business Days before such action is taken.

consolidated financial statements for the Company and the Subsidiaries for the
fiscal years ended 2016 and 2017, and for the relevant quarterly periods of
2017 and 2018 (reviewed by an independent registered accounting firm in
accordance with applicable review standards), in a form that complies with the
requirements of Item 9.01 of Form 8-K and Rule 3-05 of Regulation S-X of the
SEC for a business acquisition required to be described in answer to Item 2.01
of Form 8-K, including information required for the Buyer to prepare the pro
forma financial information required by Item 9.01 of Form 8-K and opening
balance sheet balances and detailed support thereof, (ii) an unqualified
report from the CompanyÂ’s independent accounting firm stating that such fiscal
year 2016 and 2017 financial statements present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position, as well as the consolidated
results of operations and cash flows, comprehensive income (loss) and
shareholderÂ’s equity of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the periods
covered by the such financial statements, in conformity with GAAP ( _provided_
, that the Buyer acknowledges that such unqualified report may contain a
statement that the opinion of the CompanyÂ’s independent accounting firm and
the accompanying financial statements were prepared and delivered subject to
an assumption that the Company will continue as a going concern) and (iii)
such other audited historical and/or pro forma financial statements or other
information of the Company that the Buyer may reasonably request in connection
with the BuyerÂ’s reporting and accounting obligations related to this
Agreement or the Merger to the extent required by Article 3 or 11 of
Regulation S-X of the SEC or pursuant to the CompanyÂ’s reporting requirements
under the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act, including consent(s) from
the CompanyÂ’s independent accounting firm regarding the inclusion of the
financial statements and the reports described in clauses (i) and (ii) in the
Registration Statement (collectively, the " _Required Company Information_ ").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer the
Final Company Financial Statements at least ten (10) Business Days prior to
the Closing. Attached as Schedule 6.10(a) hereto is a list of the Required
Company Information (other than the financial statements and related financial
information, reports and certifications included or required to be included
therein) as of the date of this Agreement to the extent BuyerÂ’s need for such
information is known to it based on the information shared by the Company with
the Buyer prior to the date of this Agreement.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall provide the Buyer with such
additional information, including reliance letters from the CompanyÂ’s
independent accounting firm, as the Buyer may reasonably request in order to
comply with the requirements for financial statements included in Annual
Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q and/or Current Reports on
Form 8-K filed under the Exchange Act, as applicable, including with respect
to the Company and its Subsidiaries as well as BuyerÂ’s preparation of pro
forma financial statements in respect of the acquisition of the Company and
its Subsidiaries by Buyer, in each case in compliance with BuyerÂ’s reporting
obligations under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.

 



 

(c) Following (i) the Closing and (ii) receipt of the Required Company
Information, the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to file with
the SEC a registration statement with respect to the public resale by the
Company Equityholders of the Closing Stock Consideration on a continuous or
delayed basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act, in respect of
which the Buyer may use a registration statement on Form S-3 (or any successor
form registration statement available for such resale which permits
incorporation by reference of the BuyerÂ’s filings with the SEC to at least the
same extent as such form) to the extent the Buyer is then eligible for its use
(the " _Registration Statement_ "), and cause the Registration Statement to
become automatically effective upon filing if eligible to do so or if not
eligible to do so, then use commercially reasonable efforts to take such
actions as are necessary to cause such Registration Statement to become
effective. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the Company
delivers the Required Company Information on or prior to the date that is ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Buyer shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to file the Registration Statement on the Closing Date and
cause the Registration Statement to become effective.

 



 

(d) The Buyer shall keep the Registration Statement effective under the
Securities Act (and maintain the current status of the prospectus or
prospectuses contained therein) until the date that is the six month
anniversary of the Closing Date or such earlier time as all of the shares of
Buyer Common Stock covered by the Registration Statement have been sold
pursuant thereto; _provided_ , that the obligation to keep such Registration
Statement effective under this Section 6.10(d) shall not apply during the
pendency of any Force Majeure Event to the extent such Force Majeure Event is
the reason for or cause of an inability to keep such Registration Statement
effective. Buyer will promptly notify the Company Equityholder Representative
of the time the Registration Statement became effective or a supplement to any
prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement has been filed.

 



 

(e) The Buyer may, by written notice to the Company Equityholders, suspend the
use of the Registration Statement after effectiveness and require that the
Company Equityholders immediately cease sales of shares pursuant to the
Registration Statement, in the event that (A) the Buyer engages in a public
offering of its securities (an " _Offering Suspension_ ") or (B) the Buyer is
engaged in any activity, matter or transaction or preparations or negotiations
for any activity, matter or transaction that the Buyer desires to keep
confidential for business reasons, if the Buyer determines in good faith, upon
advice of counsel, that the public disclosure requirements imposed on the
Buyer under the Securities Act in connection with the Registration Statement
would require disclosure of such activity, transaction, preparations or
negotiations (a " _Confidentiality Suspension_ "). Each Company Equityholder
agrees to keep and hold

 



      
 

 



 

confidential the fact of, and any information contained or referenced in, any
such notice described in this Section 6.10(e). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Buyer may not suspend the use of the Registration Statement by requiring
Company Equityholders to cease sales of shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant
to the Registration Statement on or prior to September 30, 2018, except to the
extent that the BuyerÂ’s engagement in such activity, matter or transaction is
related to a development with respect to regulatory, product or research and
development matters with respect to any product or product candidate of the
Buyer and is not within the BuyerÂ’s control and discretion, in which case any
suspension under this paragraph of Section 6.10(e) shall not exceed more than
three (3) consecutive trading days. After September 30, 2018 the Buyer may
suspend the use of the Registration Statement by requiring Company
Equityholders to cease sales of shares of Buyer Common Stock upon notice to
such Company Equityholders of an Offering Suspension or a Confidentiality
Suspension, provided that such suspensions, taken together, are not used more
than three times in the aggregate or for more than thirty (30) Business Days
in the aggregate.

 



 

(f) If the Buyer suspends the use of the Registration Statement by notice to
the Company Equityholders and requires the Company Equityholders to cease
sales of shares pursuant to this Section 6.10, the Buyer shall, as promptly as
practicable following the termination of the circumstance which entitled the
Buyer to do so, take such actions as may be necessary to reinstate the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement and/or give written notice to all
Company Equityholders authorizing them to resume sales pursuant to the
Registration Statement. If as a result thereof the prospectus included in the
Registration Statement has been amended to comply with the requirements of the
Securities Act, the Buyer shall enclose such revised prospectus with the
notice to Company Equityholders given pursuant to this Section 6.10(f), and
the Company Equityholders shall make no offers or sales of shares pursuant to
the Registration Statement other than by means of such revised prospectus.

 



 

(g) Promptly following the filing by the Buyer of the Registration Statement,
the Buyer shall furnish to each Company Equityholder a copy of the prospectus,
including a preliminary prospectus, in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act. The Buyer shall promptly provide (and in any event within the
time periods specified in Section 6.10 (e)) the Company Equityholders with
revised or supplemented prospectuses and, following receipt of the revised or
supplemented prospectuses, the Company Equityholders shall be free to resume
making offers and sales under the Registration Statement. The Buyer shall pay
the expenses incurred by it in complying with its obligations under this
Section 6.10, including all registration and filing fees, exchange listing
fees, fees and expenses of counsel for the Buyer, and fees and expenses of
accountants for the Buyer, but excluding (i) any brokerage fees, selling
commissions or underwriting spread or discounts incurred by the Company
Equityholders in connection with sales under the Registration Statement and
(ii) the fees and expenses of any counsel retained by or on behalf of the
Company Equityholders.

 



 

(h) The Buyer shall not be required to include any shares of Closing Stock
Consideration in the Registration Statement unless:

 



 

(i) the Company Equityholder owning such shares furnishes to the Buyer in
writing such information regarding such Company Equityholder and the proposed
sale of Buyer Common Stock by such Company Equityholder as the Buyer may
reasonably request in

 



      
 

 



 

writing in connection with the Registration Statement or as shall be required
in connection therewith by the SEC or any state securities law authorities;

 



 

(ii) such Company Equityholder shall have provided to the Buyer its written
agreement in substantially the form attached as _Exhibit E_ hereto:

 



 

(A) to indemnify the Buyer and each of its directors and officers against, and
hold the Buyer and each of its directors and officers harmless from, any
losses, claims, damages, expenses or liabilities (including reasonable
attorneyÂ’s fees) to which the Buyer or such directors and officers may become
subject by reason of any statement or omission in the Registration Statement
made in reliance upon, or in conformity with, a written statement by such
Company Equityholder furnished pursuant to this Section 6.10; and

 



 

(B) to report to the Buyer sales made pursuant to the Registration Statement.

 



 

(i) Solely for purposes of Section 6.10, if any Buyer Common Stock is included
in the Registration Statement under this Section 6.10, the Buyer agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Company Equityholder whose shares are
included in the Registration Statement against any Damages, to which such
Company Equityholder may become subject by reason of any untrue statement of a
material fact contained in the Registration Statement or any omission to state
therein a fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, except insofar as such losses, claims,
damages, expenses or liabilities arise out of or are based upon information
furnished to the Buyer by or on behalf of the Company or a Company
Equityholder for use in the Registration Statement. The Buyer shall have the
right to assume the defense and settlement of any claim or suit for which the
Buyer may be responsible for indemnification under this Section 6.10.

 



 

6.11 _Product Regulatory Meetings_. During the Pre-Closing Period, the Company
shall provide the Buyer with advance notice of all meetings, conferences, and
discussions scheduled with Regulatory Authorities concerning any regulatory
matters relating to any Product not later than five (5) days after the Company
receives notice of the scheduling of such meeting, conference, or discussion.
The Buyer shall be entitled to have reasonable representation present at all
such meetings; _provided_ , _however_ , that except with the prior written
consent of the Buyer, the Company shall not, at any time following the date of
this Agreement, (a) request any meeting regarding any Product with any
Regulatory Authority; (b) accept any such meetings; and (c) attend any such
meetings with Regulatory Authorities.

 



 

6.12 _Employee Benefits Matters_. The Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall treat, and shall cause each
employee benefit plan, program, arrangement, agreement, policy or commitment
sponsored or maintained by Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates following the Closing Date and in which
any Person who is, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, an employee
of the Company or the Subsidiaries (regardless of whether any such employee is
actively at work as of the Closing Date or is not actively at work as of the
Closing Date as a result of disability or illness, an approved leave of
absence (including military leave with reemployment rights under federal law
and leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act of

result in a duplication of benefits), all service with the Company (and
predecessor employers to the extent that the Company or any Company Plan
provides past service credit) as service with Buyer, the Surviving Corporation
and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates. The Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause each Buyer Benefit Plan that is a
medical benefit plan, within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) to
waive any and all eligibility waiting periods, actively-at-work requirements,
evidence of insurability requirements, pre-existing condition limitations and

of-pocket maximums under such Buyer Benefit Plan any deductible, co-payment
and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Employee and his or her spouse, domestic
partner and dependents under the corresponding Company Plan during the plan
year of such Company Plan in which occurs the Closing Date. This Section 6.12
shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each of the parties
to this Agreement, and nothing in this Section 6.12, express or implied, shall
confer upon any other Person, including any Employee, any rights or remedies
of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Section 6.12. Nothing
contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend
or modify any Company Plan or any other plan, program, arrangement, agreement,
policy or commitment. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms
set forth in this Section 6.12 shall not create any right in any Employee or
any other Person to continued employment with the Company, Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 **INDEMNIFICATION**

 



 

8.1 _Indemnification by the Company Equityholders_. Subject to the terms and
limitations set forth in this Article VIII, from and after the Effective Time,
the Company Equityholders shall, on a several and not joint basis (except as
otherwise provided in Section 8.5), defend and indemnify the Buyer in respect
of, and hold it harmless against and will compensate and reimburse the Buyer
for, its Pro Rata Share of any and all Damages incurred or suffered by any
Buyer Indemnified Party (regardless of whether such Damages relate to any
Third Party Action) resulting from, relating to or constituting:

 



 

(a) any breach, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the Closing Date, of
any representation or warranty of the Company contained in this Agreement, the

(b) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the Company contained
in this Agreement, the Company Certificate or the Closing Payment Certificate;

 



 

(c) the Employee Amount, any Closing Indebtedness (including any Pre-Closing

in each case to the extent in excess of the amounts, if any, included in the

Adjustment;

 



 

(d) any failure of any Company Stockholder to have good, valid and marketable
title to the issued and outstanding shares of Company Stock issued in the name
of such Company Stockholder, free and clear of all Liens;

 



 

(e) any claim by a stockholder or former stockholder of the Company or current
or former holder of Company Equity Awards or Company Warrants, or any other

of doubt, excluding any disputes with respect to exchange procedures described
in Section 2.2(b)): (i) the ownership or rights to ownership of any shares of
stock of the Company; (ii) any rights of a stockholder or holder of Company
Equity Award or Company Warrants (other than the right to receive the

or rights to notice or to vote; (iii) any rights under the Organizational
Documents of the Company; (iv) any claim that his, her or its shares were
wrongfully repurchased by the Company; or (v) any claim for appraisal or
dissenters rights, including any payment in respect of Dissenting Shares in
excess of the amount of payments otherwise payable to the stockholder seeking

(f) any inaccuracy in the Closing Date Allocation Schedule, as in effect from
time to time; and

 



 

(g) any fraud or knowing misrepresentation in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

8.2 _Indemnification by Buyer_. Subject to the terms and limitations set forth
in this Article VIII, from and after the Effective Time, the Buyer shall,
indemnify the Company Equityholders in respect of any and all Damages incurred
or suffered by any Equityholder Indemnified Party (regardless of whether such

constituting:

 



 

(a) any breach of any representation or warranty of the Buyer or Transitory
Subsidiary contained in this Agreement or the Buyer Certificate;

 



 

(b) any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of Buyer or Transitory
Subsidiary contained in this Agreement or the Buyer Certificate; or

 



 

(c) any fraud or knowing misrepresentation on the part of the Buyer or
Transitory Subsidiary, in each case, in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

8.3 _Indemnification Claims_.

 



 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall give written notification to the Indemnifying
Party of the commencement of any Third Party Action. Such notification shall
be given within 20 days after receipt by the Indemnified Party of the notice
of such Third Party Action, and shall describe in reasonable detail (to the
extent then known by the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis
for such Third Party Action and the amount of the claimed damages. No delay or
failure on the part of an Indemnified Party in so notifying the Indemnifying
Party shall relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability or obligation
hereunder except to the extent of any damage, prejudice or liability caused by
or arising out of such delay or failure. Within 30 days after delivery of such
notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such Third Party Action
with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ that
(i) the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such defense if (A) it
acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any damages, fines,
costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the Indemnified Party
in connection with such Third Party Action constitute Damages for which the
Indemnified Party shall be indemnified pursuant to this Article VIII, (B) in
the case where the Indemnified Party is the Buyer, the _ad damnum_ in such
Third Party Action, taken together with the estimated costs of defense thereof
and the Claimed Amount with respect to any unresolved claims for
indemnification then pending, is less than or equal to the current balance,
without duplication, of the Escrow Fund, the Holdback Funds (if any) and the
Adjusted Guaranteed Amount, taken together, and (C) in the case where the
Indemnified Party is the Buyer, an adverse resolution of the Third Party
Action would not have a material adverse effect on the goodwill or reputation
of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or the business,
operations or future conduct of the Buyer and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense
of any Third Party Action involving any Governmental Entity (other than any
such Third Party Action involving Taxes) or criminal liability or in which
equitable relief is sought. If the Indemnifying Party does not, or is not
permitted under the terms hereof to, so assume control of the defense of a
Third Party Action, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The Non-
controlling Party may participate in such defense at its own expense. The
Controlling Party shall keep the Non-controlling Party advised of the status
of such Third Party

 



      
 

 



 

Action and the defense thereof and shall consider in good faith
recommendations made by the Non-controlling Party with respect thereto. The
Non-controlling Party shall furnish the Controlling Party with such
information as it may have with respect to such Third Party Action (including
copies of any summons, complaint or other pleading which may have been served
on such party and any written claim, demand, invoice, billing or other
document evidencing or asserting the same) and shall otherwise cooperate with
and assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such Third Party Action.
The fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party with respect to a
Third Party Action that is ultimately determined to be indemnifiable pursuant
to this Article VIII shall be considered Damages for purposes of this
Agreement if (x) the Indemnified Party controls the defense of such Third
Party Action pursuant to the terms of this Section 8.3(a) or (y) the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
have conflicting interests or different defenses available with respect to
such Third Party Action. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any
settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party
Action without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, which shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided_ that the
consent of the Indemnified Party shall not be required if the Indemnifying
Party agrees in writing to pay, and does in fact pay (or, if applicable,
permit the Buyer to offset from any amounts then due and payable under this
Agreement) any amounts payable pursuant to such settlement or judgment and
such settlement or judgment includes a complete release of the Indemnified
Party from further liability and would not have any other adverse effect on
the Indemnified Party and/or result in any injunctive relief against the
Indemnified Party. Except as provided in Section 8.3(e), the Indemnified Party
shall not agree to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising
from, any such Third Party Action without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed. Notwithstanding anything else herein to the contrary, to the extent
there is any conflict between the provisions of this Section 8.3(a) and
Section 9.3(c) with regard to any Third Party Action involving Taxes, Section
9.3(c) shall govern.

 



 

(b) In order to seek indemnification under this Article VIII, the Indemnified
Party shall deliver a Claim Notice to the Company Equityholder Representative
(acting on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and Buyer (in the case of
indemnification sought against the Buyer).

 



 

(c) Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party
shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a Response, in which the Indemnifying
Party, shall: (i) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all
of the Claimed Amount (in the case where the Company Equityholders are the
Indemnifying Party, the Response shall be accompanied by a letter from the
Company Equityholder Representative instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse
to the Buyer from the Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the Claimed
Amount) and the Buyer to offset or setoff against any Holdback Funds (if any)
or Adjusted Guaranteed Amount (in all cases subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.5), (ii) agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
receive a specified amount of the Claimed Amount, which may be all or a
portion of the Claimed Amount (such specified amount, an " _Agreed Amount_ ")
in the case where the Company Equityholders are the Indemnifying Party, the
Response shall be accompanied by a letter from the Company Equityholder
Representative instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to the Buyer from the
Escrow Fund an amount in cash equal to the Claimed

 



       
 

 



 

Amount and the Buyer to offset or set-off against any Holdback Funds (if any)
or Adjusted Guaranteed Amount (in each case subject to the limitations set
forth in Section 8.5) or (iii) dispute that the Indemnified Party is entitled
to receive any of the Claimed Amount. If no Response is delivered within such
30-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have agreed that,
subject to the limitations on liability set forth herein, all of the Claimed
Amount is owed to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party may contest
the payment of all or a portion of the Claimed Amount to the extent it
believes in good faith that the Claimed Amount does not constitute Damages for
which the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article
VIII. Acceptance by the Indemnified Party of partial payment of any Claimed
Amount shall be without prejudice to the Indemnified PartyÂ’s right to claim
the balance of any such Claimed Amount.

 



 

(d) Subject to Section 2.6(h), any Dispute shall be resolved in accordance
with Section 12.10. If the Buyer seeks to enforce the claim that is the
subject of the Dispute pursuant to the Escrow Agreement, the Company
Equityholder Representative and the Buyer shall deliver to the Escrow Agent,
promptly following the resolution of the Dispute (whether by mutual agreement,
judicial decision or otherwise), a written notice executed by both parties
instructing the Escrow Agent as to what (if any) portion of the Escrow Fund
shall be distributed to the Buyer (which notice shall be consistent with the
terms of the resolution of the Dispute).

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section 8.3, if a third party
asserts (other than by means of a lawsuit) that any Buyer Indemnified Party is
liable to such third party for a monetary or other obligation which may
constitute or result in Damages for which a Buyer Indemnified Party may be
entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII, and the Buyer
reasonably determines that it has a valid business reason to fulfill such
obligation, then (i) the Buyer shall be entitled to satisfy such obligation,
without prior notice to or consent from the Company Equityholder
Representative or the Company Equityholders, (ii) the Buyer may subsequently
make a claim for indemnification in accordance with the provisions of this
Article VIII, and (iii) the Buyer shall be reimbursed, in accordance with the
provisions of this Article VIII, for any such Damages for which it is entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article VIII (subject to the right of the
Company Equityholder Representative, on behalf of the Company Equityholders,
to dispute the applicable Buyer Indemnified PartyÂ’s entitlement to
indemnification, or the amount for which it is entitled to indemnification,
under the terms of this Article VIII).

 



 

(f) Without limitation of Section 2.4, the Company Equityholder Representative
shall have full power and authority on behalf of each Company Equityholder (as
an Indemnifying Party and an Indemnified Party) to take any and all actions on
behalf of, execute any and all instruments on behalf of, and execute or waive
any and all rights of, the Company Equityholders under this Article VIII. The
Company Equityholder Representative shall have no liability to any Company
Equityholders for any action taken or omitted on behalf of the Company
Equityholders pursuant to this Article VIII.

 



 

(g) The Indemnified Party shall make available to the Indemnifying Party that
assumes control of the defense of a claim under this Article VIII and its
Representatives (including, in the case of the Company Equityholders as the
Indemnifying Party, to the Company Equityholder Representative) such books,
records and other documents and materials as are

 



      
 

 



 

under such Indemnified PartyÂ’s control and that are reasonably necessary in
connection with the defense of any Third Party Action, in each case, solely to
the extent such books, records and other documents are not subject to
attorney-client privilege, the work produce doctrine or any other available
privilege.

 



 

8.4 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_.

 



 

(a) Unless otherwise specified in this Section 8.4 or elsewhere in this
Agreement, all provisions of this Agreement shall survive the Closing and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with their terms until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ , _however_ , that, except
with respect to claims based on fraud or knowing misrepresentation, all
representations and warranties that are covered by the indemnification
obligations in Section 8.1(a) shall expire, and no claims may be made with
respect thereto by any Indemnified Party thereafter, on the date 15 months
following the Closing Date (the " _Non-Fundamental Expiration Date_ "), after
which time such representations and warranties will terminate; _provided
further_ , _however_ , that (i) the representations and warranties set forth
in Sections 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4(a),3.9, 3.17 (to the extent related to Tax),
3.25, 4.1, 4.2(a) and 4.4 shall survive until the date that is 60 days after
the expiration of the longest statute of limitations applicable to the subject
matter of the applicable representation or warranty (collectively, the "
_Fundamental Representations_ ") and (ii) the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 3.12 shall survive until the date that is 30 months
following the Closing Date, after which time such representations and
warranties will terminate. The parties further acknowledge that the time
periods set forth in this Article VIII for the assertion of claims under this
Agreement are the result of armsÂ’ length negotiation among the parties and
that they intend for the time periods to be enforced as agreed by the parties.
As such, it is the express intent of the parties hereto that, if an applicable
survival period as contemplated by this Section 8.4(a) is shorter than the
statute of limitations that would otherwise apply, then, by contract, the
applicable statute of limitations shall be reduced to the survival period
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) If the Buyer delivers to the Company Equityholder Representative or the
Company Equityholder Representative delivers to the Buyer, as applicable,
before expiration of a representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, either
a Claim Notice based upon a breach of such representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement or an Expected Claim Notice based upon a breach of such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement then the applicable
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall survive until, but only
for purposes of, the resolution of the matter covered by such notice. If the
legal proceeding or written claim with respect to which an Expected Claim
Notice has been given is definitively withdrawn or resolved in favor of the
Buyer or the Company Equityholder Representative, the Buyer or the Company
Equityholder Representative, as applicable, shall promptly so notify the
Company Equityholder Representative or the Buyer, as applicable.

 



 

8.5 _Limitations and other Indemnification Matters_.

 



 

(a) With respect to claims for Damages arising under Section 8.1(a), (A) the
Company Equityholders shall not be liable for any such Damages unless and
until the aggregate amount of Damages with respect to the particular event or
occurrence giving rise to such claim

 



      
 

 



 

(and all other events or occurrences arising from the same or similar
circumstances) exceed $10,000 (at which point the Company Equityholders shall
become liable for all such Damages, subject to clause (B) below and the other
limitations set forth herein) and (B) the Company Equityholders shall not be
liable for any such Damages until the aggregate amount of all such Damages
exceeds $1,000,000 the (" _Deductible Amount_ ") (at which point the Company
Equityholders shall become liable for all Damages under Section 8.1(a) in
excess of the Deductible Amount subject to the other limitations set forth
herein); _provided_ that the limitation set forth in this sentence shall not
apply to (i) claims based on fraud or knowing misrepresentation or (ii) any
claim pursuant to Section 8.1(a) relating to a breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations.

 



 

(b) With respect to claims for Damages arising under Section 8.2(a), (A) the
Buyer shall not be liable for any such Damages unless and until the aggregate
amount of Damages with respect to the particular event or occurrence giving
rise to such claim (and all other events or occurrences arising from the same
or similar circumstances) exceed $10,000 (at which point the Buyer shall
become liable for all such Damages, subject to clause (B) below and the other
limitations set forth herein) and (B) the Buyer shall not be liable for any
such Damages until the aggregate amount of all such Damages exceeds $1,000,000
(the " _Buyer Deductible Amount_ ") (at which point the Buyer shall become
liable for all Damages under Section 8.2(a) in excess of the Buyer Deductible
Amount subject to the other limitations set forth herein); _provided_ that the
limitation set forth in this sentence shall not apply to (1) claims based on
fraud or knowing misrepresentation or (2) any claim pursuant to Section 8.2(a)
relating to a breach by Buyer or Transitory Subsidiary of any of the
Fundamental Representations.

 



 

(c) Except in the case of claims (i) with respect to breaches of any
Fundamental Representations or (ii) based on fraud or knowing
misrepresentation, (A) the aggregate liability of the Company Equityholders
for Damages under Section 8.1(a) shall not exceed the Non-Fundamental Cap, (B)
without limiting the preceding clause (A), and without duplication, the Escrow
Funds, the Holdback Funds (if any) and the Adjusted Guaranteed Amount shall be
the exclusive source and means for the Buyer to collect any Damages for which
it is entitled to indemnification under Section 8.1(a) from any Company
Equityholder and (C) solely in the case of a claim for indemnification
pursuant to Section 8.1(d), the Buyer may only seek recovery from the Escrow
Funds, the Holdback Funds and/or the Adjusted Guaranteed Amount, without
duplication, to the extent of the applicable breaching Company StockholderÂ’s
Pro Rata Share of the Escrow Funds, the Holdback Funds and/or the Adjusted
Guaranteed Amount, without duplication, as applicable (but without limitation
of the aggregate amount that may be recovered from such Company Stockholder).
In addition, in all cases, the Buyer shall not attempt to collect any Damages
directly from any Company Equityholder unless there are insufficient (1)
unclaimed Escrow Funds, Holdback Funds (if any) and Adjusted Guaranteed
Amount, without duplication, and (2) other available Contingent Consideration
that is then due and payable and remains available to satisfy Damages
hereunder.

 



 

(d) Promptly following the Non-Fundamental Expiration Date (and in any event
within five (5) Business Days), the Buyer shall, in accordance with Section
2.1(e)(iii) and Section 2.7(c), distribute to the Exchange and Paying Agent or
the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for the benefit of the Company
Equityholders, any then remaining Holdback Funds. Any portion of the Holdback
Funds that are not disbursed pursuant to the preceding sentence that

 



      
 

 



 

are finally determined pursuant to this Article VIII not to constitute Agreed
Amounts or otherwise upon resolution of such claim hereunder shall be
distributed by the Buyer to the Exchange and Paying Agent or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, for the benefit of Company Equityholders, pursuant
to Section 2.1(e)(iii) and Section 2.7(c).

 



 

(e) Subject to this Section 8.5, the aggregate liability of each Company
Equityholder for Damages under this Article VIII shall not exceed the
aggregate amount of Aggregate Consideration such Company Equityholder has
received (or would have received but for the indemnification or holdback
obligations set forth in this Article VIII) pursuant to this Agreement. The
foregoing limitation on liability set forth in this Section 8.5(e) shall not
apply to a Company Equityholder with respect to fraud or a knowing
misrepresentation committed by such Company Equityholder in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(f) The aggregate liability of the Buyer for Damages under this Article VIII
shall not exceed $150,000,000 in the aggregate; _provided_ , that any
indemnification obligations under Section 8.2(a) with respect to
representations that are not Fundamental Representations of the Buyer or the
Transitory Subsidiary shall be limited to $26,000,000 in the aggregate.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the foregoing limitation on
liability set forth in this Section 8.5(f) shall not apply with respect to
Damages under (A) Section 8.2(c) or (B) a breach of Section 2.8.

 



 

(g) No Company Equityholder shall have any right of contribution against the
Company or the Surviving Corporation with respect to any breach by the Company
of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements.

 



 

(h) The rights to indemnification set forth in this Article VIII shall not be
affected by (i) any investigation conducted by or on behalf of any Buyer
Indemnified Party or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) by
any Buyer Indemnified Party, whether before or after the date of this
Agreement or the Closing Date, with respect to the inaccuracy or noncompliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation which is the subject
of indemnification hereunder, or (ii) any waiver by the Buyer of any closing
condition relating to the accuracy of representations and warranties or the
performance of or compliance with agreements and covenants.

 



 

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, for purposes
of determining (i) whether there has been a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Article III or the Company Certificate and (ii) the
amount of Damages for which any Buyer Indemnified Party may be entitled to
indemnification under this Article VIII, each such representation or warranty
(other than the representations and warranties set forth in clause (a) of
Section 3.6, Section 3.13(a)(xii) and in Section 3.27) shall be deemed to have
been made without any qualifications or limitations as to materiality
(including any qualifications or limitations made by reference to a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as applicable). For
the avoidance of doubt, all qualifications and limitations as to materiality
(including any qualifications or limitations made by reference to a Company
Material Adverse Effect or Buyer Material Adverse Effect, as applicable) shall
be given full effect for the purposes of determining whether there has been
any fraud or knowing misrepresentation (but not, for the

 



      
 

 



 

avoidance of doubt, the amount of Damages which any Buyer Indemnified Party
may be entitled to recovery under this Article VIII).

 



 

(j) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement (including Sections
8.4, 8.5(b) and 8.5(c)), the Buyer shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to set off, in whole or in part, against any obligation or payment
it owes to any Company Equityholder under this Agreement (including by
deducting from or withholding any Contingent Consideration that is or may
become payable pursuant to this Agreement), amounts owed or described in a
Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice as owed by such Company Equityholder to
any Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement; _provided_ , that such
right of set off shall only apply for so long as and to the extent that the
claims asserted in such Claim Notice or Expected Claim Notice remain
unresolved hereunder (or are determined to be Damages owed to Buyer
hereunder), and all other amounts determined not to be Damages owed to Buyer
hereunder shall (subject to Section 2.1(e)(iii) and Section 8.5(d)), promptly
after such determination, be distributed by the Buyer to the Exchange and
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, for the benefit of
Company Equityholders, pursuant to Section 2.1(e)(iii) and Section 2.7(c).

 



 

(k) Except (i) for specific performance, (ii) as set forth in Section 2.6 and
(iii) to the extent any claim based on fraud may as a matter of Law only be
recovered in an alternative form of action, after the Closing, the rights of
the parties under this Article VIII shall be the exclusive remedy of the
parties with respect to claims resulting from or relating to any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty or failure to perform any covenant or
agreement (including the indemnities in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2) of the
other parties contained in this Agreement and claims based on fraud or knowing
misrepresentation.

 



 

(l) Any payments made to a party pursuant to this Article VIII or pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Aggregate
Consideration for Tax purposes to the extent permitted by Law.

 



 

(m) The amount of Damages that the Indemnified Parties (or any of them) may
recover pursuant to this Article VIII shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar
basis, by (i) amounts actually received by such Indemnified Parties (or any of
them) in respect of the Damages forming the basis of such claim for recovery
from a third party pursuant to any indemnification or other similar right (net
of costs of recovery), and (ii) any amounts actually received by such
Indemnified Parties (or any of them) in respect of the Damages forming the
basis of such claim for recovery from a third party under any insurance policy
or other similar arrangement (net of expenses (including costs of collection)
and increased premiums), it being understood and hereby agreed that such
Indemnified Parties shall have no obligation to recover any amounts available
from third parties (whether under insurance policies or similar arrangements
or otherwise) prior to or as a condition to recovering any amounts pursuant to
this Article VIII.

 



 

(n) For the avoidance of doubt, no Damages may be claimed by any Buyer
Indemnified Party under this Article VIII to the extent that such Damages are
expressly accounted for in the calculation of Aggregate Closing Consideration
or Contingent Consideration.

 



      
 

 



 

 **ARTICLE IX**

 



 

 **OTHER POST-CLOSING AGREEMENTS**

 



 

9.1 _No Claims_. Effective as of the Closing, each Company Stockholder, by its
execution and delivery of this Agreement and/or the Written Consent, hereby
(a) waives any and all rights of indemnification, contribution and other
similar rights against the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary (whether arising pursuant to any charter document of the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary, any contract, applicable Law or
otherwise) arising out of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement and/or out of the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, and agrees that any claim of the
Buyer, whether for indemnity or otherwise, may be asserted directly against
the Company Stockholders or any Company Stockholder (solely to the extent, and
subject to the limitations, provided in this Agreement), without any need for
any claim against, or joinder of, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary and (b) forever waives, releases and discharges (and hereby
agrees to cause each of its representatives to forever waive, release and
discharge) with prejudice the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each
Subsidiary from any and all claims, rights (including rights of
indemnification, contribution and other similar rights, from whatever source,
whether under contract, applicable Law or otherwise), causes of action,
protests, suits, disputes, orders, obligations, debts, demands, proceedings,
contracts, agreements, promises, liabilities, controversies, costs, expenses,
fees (including attorneysÂ’ fees), or damages of any kind, arising by any means
(including subrogation, assignment, reimbursement, operation of law or
otherwise), whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, accrued or not
accrued, foreseen or unforeseen, or mature or unmature related or with respect
to, in connection with, or arising out of, directly or indirectly, any event,
fact, condition, circumstance, occurrence, act or omission that was in
existence (or that occurred or failed to occur) at or prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , this clause (b) shall not be construed as releasing
(a) any party hereto from its obligations otherwise expressly set forth in
this Agreement or any agreement delivered pursuant hereto or (b) the Company,
the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary from (i) their respective
obligations (subject to Section 9.2) under the director and officer
indemnification provisions expressly set forth in their respective
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof or included in the
agreements listed on _Schedule 9.2_ as in effect on the date hereof or (ii)
any obligation to pay to any Person any wages or benefits arising in the
Ordinary Course of Business solely from such PersonÂ’s employment with the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary. Each Company Stockholder
hereby expressly waives any and all provisions, rights and benefits conferred
by Â§1542 of the California Civil Code (or any similar, comparable or
equivalent provision or law of any applicable jurisdiction) which section
provides:

 



 

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

 



      
 

 



 

9.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) From the Effective Time until the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Closing
Date, all rights to indemnification, exculpation and the advancement of
expenses by the Company existing in favor of those Persons who were prior to,
or who are as of, the Closing Date, directors or officers of the Company (the
" _D andO Indemnified Persons_") for their acts and omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time (the " _D andO Provisions_") shall survive the Merger and
shall be observed by the Surviving Corporation (and its successors, if any,
during such period) to the fullest extent available under the DGCL.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, the Company may, at its
own expense, purchase, prior to the Effective Time, a six-year prepaid "tail
policy" covering claims asserted within six years after the Closing arising
from facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time
(including consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement),
which names as insureds all DandO Indemnified Persons. Following the Closing,
the Buyer shall cause the Surviving Corporation to abide by and honor the
Surviving CorporationÂ’s contractual obligations, if any, under such "tail
policy." For the avoidance of doubt, any costs, expenses, liabilities or other
amounts owed or payable with respect to such "tail policy" that remain unpaid
as of the Closing shall be deemed to be "Company Transaction Expenses" for all

9.3 _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes_.

 



 

(i) The Company, at its expense, shall prepare and timely file or shall cause
to be prepared and timely filed all Tax Returns of the Company and the
Subsidiaries required to be filed (taking into account extensions) prior to
the Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent
with the CompanyÂ’s or such SubsidiaryÂ’s past practice.

 



 

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file or shall cause to be prepared and
timely filed all other Tax Returns for the Company and the Subsidiaries that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date (" _Buyer Prepared Returns_
").

 



 

(iii) All Buyer Prepared Returns that relate to Pre-Closing Tax Periods
(including Straddle Periods), in each case, shall (1) be prepared and filed in
a manner consistent with past practice of the Company or its applicable
Subsidiary unless otherwise required by applicable Law and (2) to the extent
such Tax Return is an income Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, include
all Transaction Deductions to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.
Buyer shall provide drafts of any such Tax Returns described in the preceding
sentence to

 



      
 

 



 

the Company Equityholder Representative at least 30 days prior to the
applicable due date for filing thereof (or, if such due date is within 30 days
of the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date)
and shall permit the Company Equityholder Representative to review and comment
on any such Tax Return prior to filing. Buyer shall consider in good faith all
comments reasonably requested by the Company Equityholder Representative. To
the extent Taxes are due with respect to any Buyer Prepared Returns that
relate to any Pre-Closing Tax Periods (including Straddle Periods) and such
Taxes were not taken into account in Closing Indebtedness to reduce the
Aggregate Consideration, Buyer may recover such Taxes pursuant to Article
VIII.

 



 

(iv) All transfer, sales, use, stamp, conveyance, real property transfer,
recording, registration, documentary, filing and other non-income Taxes and
administrative fees (including, without limitation, notary fees) arising in
connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne fifty percent by the Company
Equityholders and fifty percent by Buyer. The party responsible by applicable
law for filing any Tax Return relating to Transfer Taxes shall be responsible
for filing such Tax Return and the other party shall cooperate with the filing
party in the filing of any such Tax Returns with respect to Transfer Taxes,
including promptly supplying any information in its possession that is
reasonably necessary to complete such Tax Returns.

 



 

(b) _Allocation of Certain Taxes_.

 



 

(i) The Buyer and the Company Equityholders agree that if the Company or any
Subsidiary is permitted but not required under applicable foreign, state or
local Tax Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period,
the Buyer and the Company Equityholders shall treat such day as the last day
of a taxable period.

 



 

(ii) Subject to Section 9.3(b)(iii) below, the amount of any Taxes for a
Straddle Period allocable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be deemed to equal
(i) in the case of Taxes that (x) are based upon or related to income,
receipts or payroll or (y) imposed in connection with any sale or other
transfer or assignment of property (other than Transfer Taxes described in
Section 9.3(a)), the amount which would be payable if the taxable year ended
with the Closing Date, and (ii) in the case of other Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis (including property Taxes), the amount of such Taxes for the
entire period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the number of
calendar days in the period ending with the Closing Date and the denominator
of which is the number of calendar days in the entire period. For purposes of
computing the Taxes attributable to the two portions of a taxable period
pursuant to this Section 9.3(b), any exemptions, allowances, deductions
(including depreciation or amortization) and credits that are calculated on an
annual basis shall be allocated between the portion of the Straddle Period
ending on the Closing Date and the portion beginning after the Closing Date in
proportion to the number of days in each such portion of the taxable period.

 



 

(iii) Transactions that occur on the Closing Date but after the Closing and
that are not incurred in the Ordinary Course of Business of the Company or its
Subsidiaries (other than as specifically contemplated by this Agreement) shall
be considered to be attributable to the period that commences on the day
following the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) _Cooperation on Tax Matters; Tax Audits_.

 



 

(i) The Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Equityholder
Representative and their respective Affiliates shall (i) cooperate in the
preparation of all Tax Returns and the conduct of all Tax Contests relating to
the determination of any Tax for any Tax periods for which one party could
reasonably require the assistance of the other party in obtaining any
necessary information, (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished, upon reasonable
request, as promptly as practicable, such information and assistance relating
to Taxes in such partyÂ’s possession (including access to applicable books and
records) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax Returns by
Buyer, the Surviving Corporation, and their respective Affiliates, the making
of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any Tax Contest and the
prosecution or defense of any Tax Contest, and (iii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any
Governmental Entity as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any
Tax that could be imposed with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(ii) If, subsequent to the Closing, Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their Affiliates (including the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries) receives notice of a
Tax Contest with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period with respect to which
Company Equityholders may be required to provide indemnification under this
Agreement, then within ten (10) Business Days after receipt of such notice,
the Buyer shall notify the Company Equityholder Representative of such notice.
No delay or failure in so notifying the Company Equityholder Representative
shall relieve the Company Equityholders of any liability or obligation
hereunder except to the extent of any damage, prejudice or liability caused by
or arising out of such delay or failure.

 



 

(A) The Company Equityholder Representative may elect to control the conduct
and resolution of such Tax Contest to the extent that such Tax Contest relates
solely to a Pre-Closing Tax Period of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(a " _Pre-Closing Tax Contest_ "), provided that (i) the Company Equityholder
Representative shall permit Buyer to participate in such Pre-Closing Tax
Contest (using counsel of its own choosing), (ii) the Company Equityholder
Representative shall keep Buyer reasonably informed of all material
developments on a timely basis with respect to any such Pre-Closing Tax
Contest, and (iii) the Company Equityholder Representative shall not enter
into any settlement of, otherwise compromise or abandon any Pre-Closing Tax
Contest without the prior written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(B) With respect to any Tax Contest (i) involving Tax matters or items that
could reasonably be expected to form the basis for a claim of indemnification
against the Company Equityholders pursuant to this Agreement and (ii) that the
Company Equityholder Representative does not or cannot elect to control
pursuant to the preceding Section 9.3(c)(ii)(A), Buyer will control such Tax
Contest, including the defense and settlement thereof; _provided_ that, (i)
the Buyer shall permit the Company Equityholder Representative to participate
in such Tax Contest (using counsel of its own choosing), (ii) Buyer shall keep
the Company Equityholder Representative reasonably informed of all material
developments on a timely basis with respect to any such Tax Contest, and (iii)
Buyer shall not enter into any settlement of, otherwise compromise or abandon
any such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the Company
Equityholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

 



      
 

 



 

conditioned or delayed.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or
similar arrangements with respect to or involving the Company or any
Subsidiary shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date.

 



 

(e) _Post-Closing Restrictions_. Buyer and the Company will not (and will not
permit their respective Affiliates, including the CompanyÂ’s Subsidiaries, to)
(i) except for Tax Returns prepared and filed in accordance with Section
9.3(a), file or amend any Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) with respect to Tax Returns
prepared and filed in accordance with Section 9.3(a) after the date such Tax
Returns are filed, amend any such Tax Returns, (iii) make or change any Tax
election or change any method of accounting that has retroactive effect to any
Tax Return of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (including any election pursuant to Section 338 or 336 of the Code),
(iv) voluntarily approach any Tax authority regarding any Tax or Tax Return of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (v)
agree to extend or waive the statute of limitations with respect to Taxes of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, in each
such case, if such action could reasonably be expected to form the basis for a
claim of indemnification against the Company Equityholders pursuant to this
Agreement, except with the prior written consent of the Company Equityholder
Representative (which will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

(f) _Tax Treatment_. Except as may be required pursuant to a "determination"
(as defined in Section 1313 of the Code or any similar provision of state,
local, or foreign Tax law), for all applicable Tax purposes, the parties to
this Agreement agree to, and no party shall take any action or filing position
inconsistent with, the following Tax treatment of the items specified below:

 



 

(i) The Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount shall be treated as
having been received and voluntarily set aside by the Company Equityholders on
the Closing Date. For the avoidance of doubt, any applicable withholding Taxes
in respect of the portion of the Company Equityholder Representative Expense
Amount borne by a Company Equityholder shall be withheld from such Company
EquityholderÂ’s share of the consideration paid in connection with the Closing,
and any portion of the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount
remaining that is returned to Company Equityholders shall not be subject to
information reporting or Tax withholding a second time.

 



 

(ii) The contingent rights of the Company Equityholders to their Pro Rata
Share of the Future Payments (excluding any Company Equityholder
Representative Account Payments), in each case, in respect of their Company
Stock and Company Warrants (i) shall be treated as deferred contingent
purchase price potentially eligible for installment sale treatment under
Section 453 of the Code and any corresponding provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Law as appropriate, and (ii) if and to the extent any such amount is
released or paid in respect of Company Stock or Company Warrants, as
applicable, interest may be imputed on such amount if required by Section 483
or 1274 of the Code.

 



       
 

 



 

(iii) Any payments made in respect of Company Options shall be treated for Tax
purposes as compensation paid and deducted by the Company, as and when
received by the recipient thereof (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be
the Closing Date with respect to the Company Equityholder Representative
Expense Amount, and when released to the holder in the case of any other
Future Payments). The payment of such amounts shall (A) in case of payments
made in respect of Employee Options, be paid through the CompanyÂ’s standard
payroll procedures and reported on IRS Form W-2, and (B) in the case of
payments made in respect of Non-Employee Options, be paid through the
CompanyÂ’s standard accounts payable procedures and reported on IRS Form
1099-MISC.

 



 

(iv) Except for amounts described in Section 9.3(f)(iii) above, the entirety
of the Aggregate Consideration payable by Buyer to the Company Equityholders
pursuant to this Agreement (including the any Future Payments) shall be
allocated to Company Stock or Company Warrants, as applicable, and none shall
be treated as compensation.

 



 

(g) The Merger shall be treated for federal and applicable state and local
income Tax purposes as a sale or exchange of the Company Stock subject to
Section 1001 of the Code and any corresponding provision under applicable
state or local Tax Law.

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including personal delivery, messenger
service, ordinary mail or electronic mail), but no such notice or other
communication shall be deemed to have been duly

 



      
 

 



 

given unless and until it actually is received by the party for whom it is
intended. Any party to this Agreement may change the address to which notices
and other communications hereunder are to be delivered by giving the other
parties to this Agreement notice in the manner herein set forth.

 



 

12.2 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to in this Agreement that
are to be delivered at the Closing) and the Company Equityholder
RepresentativeÂ’s engagement letter constitute the entire agreement among the
parties to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements
or representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; _provided_ that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

 



 

12.3 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and shall
not, confer upon any other Person any rights or remedies hereunder, except
that the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be third-party beneficiaries of
Article VIII.

 



 

12.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void, except that the
Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary may transfer or assign its rights and
obligations under this Agreement, in whole or from time to time in part, to
one (1) or more of their Affiliates; _provided_ , that such transfer or
assignment shall not relieve the Buyer or the Transitory Subsidiary of its
primary liability for its obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change
any obligation of any other party hereto or due to the Buyer or the Transitory
Subsidiary; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Buyer and Transitory Sub may
transfer or assign all or any part of their respective rights, in whole or in
part, under this Agreement to MidCap Financial Trust, the administrative agent
under that certain Credit and Security Agreement, dated as of May 5, 2017, by
and among MidCap Financial Trust, the Buyer and certain other financial
institutions as lenders thereunder or any other any lender of the Buyer (or
any administrative or collateral agent on behalf of itself and such lender(s))
as collateral security (it being understood that such transfer or assignment
shall not relieve the Buyer and the Transitory Sub of their respective
obligations hereunder or enlarge, alter or change any obligation of any other
party hereto). Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

12.5 _Severability._ Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted

 



      
 

 



 

to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid
or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 



 

12.6 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two (2)
or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of
which together shall be considered one (1) and the same agreement and shall
become effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties
hereto and delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart. This Agreement may be executed and
delivered by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered by electronic
transmission.

 



 

12.7 _Interpretation_. Except where expressly stated otherwise in this
Agreement, the following rules of interpretation apply to this Agreement: (a)
"either" and "or" are not exclusive and "include," "includes" and "including"
are not limiting; (b) "hereof," "hereto," "hereby," "herein" and "hereunder"
and words of similar import when used in this Agreement refer to this
Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement;
(c) "date of this Agreement" refers to the date set forth in the initial
caption of this Agreement; (d) "extent" in the phrase "to the extent" means
the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase does not
mean simply "if"; (e) the descriptive headings and table of contents included
herein are included for convenience only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning or interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof; (f)
definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the singular as well
as the plural forms of such terms; (g) references to a contract or agreement
mean such contract or agreement as amended or otherwise supplemented or
modified from time to time; (h) references to a Person are also to its
permitted successors and assigns; (i) references to an "Article," "Section,"
"Exhibit" or "Schedule" refer to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or
Schedule to, this Agreement; (j) references to "$" or otherwise to dollar
amounts refer to the lawful currency of the United States; (k) solely for
purposes of Article III, "written notice" or "notice in writing" or words to
similar effect shall include electronic notice, including delivered by
electronic mail; (l) references to a federal, state, local or foreign Law
include any rules, regulations and delegated legislation issued thereunder;

electronic data room no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern time, on the first (1st)
Business Day prior to the date of this Agreement or (ii) delivered to the
Buyer or its counsel. The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to
be the language chosen by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent,
and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any party hereto.
No summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement. If any date on which a party is required to
make a payment pursuant to the terms hereof is not a Business Day, then such
party shall make such payment on the next succeeding Business Day. Time shall
be of the essence in this Agreement.

 



 

12.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out
of or related hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or to the
inducement of any party to enter herein, whether for breach of contract,
tortious conduct or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or
otherwise) shall be governed in all respects, including validity,
interpretation, and effect, by and construed in accordance with the internal
Laws of the State of

 



       
 

 



 

Delaware (including in respect of the statute of limitations or other
limitations period applicable to any claim, controversy or dispute) without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of
the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the
application of Laws of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of
Delaware.

 



 

12.9 _Remedies_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5(j) with respect to the period
from and after the Closing, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred
upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other
remedy conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise
by a party of any one (1) remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other
remedy.

 



 

(b) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event
that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that (i) the party seeking such remedy has an adequate
remedy at Law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity.

 



 

12.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court
of Chancery of the State of Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court
does not have jurisdiction, a federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims
in respect of such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any
such court, (c) agrees that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such
personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (d) agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in any other court, and (e) waives any right it may have to a trial
by jury with respect to any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to
this Agreement. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any
bond, surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in Section 12.1. Nothing
in this Section 12.10, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

12.11 _Privilege Matters_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding that the Company has, from time to time prior to the date
hereof, been represented by Cooley LLP (the " _Firm_ "), each of Buyer and the
Company agrees that, after the Closing, the Firm may represent any stockholder
of the Company, any other

 



      
 

 



 

Company Equityholder, the Company Equityholder Representative and/or any of
the Affiliates of the Company Equityholder Representative in all matters
related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including
in respect of any indemnification claims pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) In the event that a dispute arises between Buyer, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation and a third party other than the Company Equityholder
Representative, and such dispute relates to a matter for which Buyer may seek
recovery pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation shall assert the attorney-client privilege on behalf of the
Company Equityholder Representative to prevent disclosure of privileged
materials to such third party and such privilege may be waived only with the
prior written consent of the Company Equityholder Representative.

 



 

(c) Buyer further agrees, on behalf of itself and, after the Closing, on
behalf of the Surviving Corporation, that all communications in any form or
format whatsoever between or among any of the Firm, the Company, any of the
Company Equityholders, or any of the respective directors, officers employees
or other representatives of the Company Equityholders or the Firm that relate
solely to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any dispute arising under this Agreement
(collectively, the " _Deal Communications_ ") shall be deemed to be retained
and owned collectively by the Company Equityholders, shall be controlled by
the Company Equityholder Representative on behalf of the Company Equityholders
and shall not pass to or be claimed by Buyer or the Surviving Corporation. All
Deal Communications that are attorney-client privileged (the " _Privileged
Deal Communications_ ") shall remain privileged after the Effective Time and
the privilege and the expectation of client confidence relating thereto shall
belong solely to the Company Equityholder Representative and the Company
Equityholders, shall be controlled by the Company Equityholder Representative
on behalf of the Company Equityholders and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Buyer or the Surviving Corporation.

 



 

(d) Buyer agrees that it will not, and that it will cause the Surviving
Corporation not to, knowingly and purposefully, (i) access or use the Deal
Communications, including by way of review of any electronic data,
communications or other information, or by seeking to have the Company
Equityholder Representative or any Company Equityholder waive the attorney-
client or other privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Buyer or the
Surviving Corporation has the right to waive the attorney-client or other
privilege or (ii) seek to obtain the Deal Communications from the Firm. In
furtherance of the foregoing, it shall not be a breach of any provision of
this Agreement if prior to the Closing the Company, the Company Equityholder
Representative and/or any Company Equityholder, or any of their respective
directors, officers employees or other representatives, takes any action to
protect from access or remove from the premises of the Company (or any offsite
back-up or other facilities) any Deal Communications, including by
segregating, encrypting, copying, deleting, erasing, exporting or otherwise
taking possession of any Deal Communications; _provided_ , that none of the
Company, the Company Equityholder Representative and/or any Company
Equityholder, or any of their respective directors, officers employees or
other representatives, may prevent access to or otherwise remove, any
materials, documents or other information not constituting Deal
Communications.

 



      
 

 



 

(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that this Section 12.11 shall not limit
or otherwise prohibit the BuyerÂ’s ability to (i) compel discovery of
information that is not subject to an attorney-client privilege in the event
that such information is relevant to a dispute that arises after the Closing,
or (ii) in the event that Buyer or the Surviving Corporation receives a
subpoena or other discovery request pursuant to Law that calls for the search
for documents that may include Deal Communications, comply with its legal
obligations.

 **EXHIBIT A**

 



 

FORM OF CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION OF THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 



 

AGILIS BIOTHERAPEUTICS, INC.

 



 

FIRST: The name of the Corporation is: Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc.

 



 

SECOND: The address of the CorporationÂ’s registered office in the State of
Delaware is Corporation Trust Center, 1209 Orange Street, in the City of
Wilmington, County of New Castle, Delaware 19801. The name of its registered
agent at such address is The Corporation Trust Company.

 



 

THIRD: The nature of the business or purposes to be conducted or promoted by
the Corporation is to engage in any lawful act or activity for which
corporations may be organized under the Delaware General Corporate Law ("
_DGCL_ ").

 



 

FOURTH: The total number of shares of stock which the Corporation shall have
authority to issue is 1,000 shares of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share
(" _Common Stock_ ").

 



 

The number of authorized shares of Common Stock may be increased or decreased
(but not below the number of shares thereof then outstanding) by the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the stock of the Corporation
entitled to vote, irrespective of the provisions of Section 242(b)(2) of the
DGCL.

 



 

FIFTH: In furtherance of and not in limitation of powers conferred by statute,
it is further provided:

 



 

1. The business and affairs of the Corporation shall be managed by or under the direction of the Board of Directors.

 



 

2. Election of directors need not be by written ballot.

 



 

3. The Board of Directors is expressly authorized to adopt, amend, alter or repeal the By-Laws of the Corporation.

 



 

SIXTH: Except to the extent that the DGCL prohibits the elimination or
limitation of liability of directors for breaches of fiduciary duty, no
director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or
its stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty as a
director, notwithstanding any provision of law imposing such liability. No
amendment to or repeal of this provision shall apply to or have any effect on
the liability or alleged liability of any director of the Corporation for or
with respect to any acts or omissions of such director occurring prior to such
amendment. If the DGCL is amended after the Filing Date to authorize corporate
action further eliminating or limiting the personal liability of directors of
the Corporation, then the liability of a director of the Corporation shall be
eliminated or limited to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL as so
amended.

 



 

SEVENTH: The following indemnification provisions shall apply to the persons
enumerated below:

      
 

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists
or may hereafter be amended, the Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless
any person (an "Indemnified Person") who was or is made or is threatened to be
made a party or is otherwise involved in any action, suit or proceeding,
whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative (a "Proceeding"), by
reason of the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the
legal representative, is or was a director or officer of the Corporation or,
while a director or officer of the Corporation, is or was serving at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, employee or agent
of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect
to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and
expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees) reasonably incurred by such Indemnified
Person in such Proceeding; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall
not require the Corporation to indemnify any Indemnified Person in connection
with any action, suit, proceeding or claim initiated by or on behalf of such
person or any counterclaim against the Corporation initiated by or on behalf
of such person. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, the Corporation shall
be required to indemnify an Indemnified Person in connection with a Proceeding
(or part thereof) commenced by such Indemnified Person only if the
commencement of such Proceeding (or part thereof) by the Indemnified Person
was authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

 



 

(b) The Corporation shall pay the expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees)
incurred by an Indemnified Person in defending any Proceeding in advance of
its final disposition; _provided_ , _however_ , that, to the extent required
by law, such payment of expenses in advance of the final disposition of the
Proceeding shall be made only upon receipt of an undertaking by the
Indemnified Person to repay all amounts advanced if it should be ultimately
determined that the Indemnified Person is not entitled to be indemnified under
this Article Seventh or otherwise.

 



 

(d) The Corporation may indemnify any person who was or is made or is
threatened to be made or is otherwise involved in any Proceeding by reason of
the fact that such person, or a person for whom such person is the legal
representative, is or was an employee or agent of the Corporation or, while an
employee or agent of the Corporation, is or was serving at the request of the
Corporation as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation
or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust,
enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with respect to employee
benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered and expenses (including
attorneyÂ’s fees) reasonably incurred by such person in connection with such
Proceeding. The ultimate determination of entitlement to indemnification of
persons who are non-director or officer employees or agents shall be made in
such manner as is determined by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion.
Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, the Corporation shall not be required
to indemnify a person in connection with a Proceeding initiated by such person
if the Proceeding was not authorized in advance by the Board of Directors.

 



 

(e) The Corporation may pay the expenses (including attorneyÂ’s fees) incurred
by an employee or agent in defending any Proceeding in advance of its final
disposition on such terms and conditions as may be determined by the Board of
Directors.

      
 

 



 

(f) The rights conferred on any person by this Article Seventh shall not be
exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire
under any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these by-
laws, agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise.

 



 

(g) The CorporationÂ’s obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or
is serving at its request as a director, officer or employee of another
Corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust,
organization or other enterprise shall be reduced by any amount such person
may collect as indemnification from such other Corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture, trust, organization or other
enterprise.

 



 

(h) The Board of Directors may, to the full extent permitted by applicable law
as it presently exists, or may hereafter be amended from time to time,
authorize an appropriate officer or officers to purchase and maintain at the
CorporationÂ’s expense insurance: (a) to indemnify the Corporation for any
obligation which it incurs as a result of the indemnification of directors,
officers and employees under the provisions of this Article Seventh; and (b)
to indemnify or insure current or former directors, officers and employees
against liability in instances in which they may not otherwise be indemnified
by the Corporation under the provisions of this Article Seventh.

 



 

(i) Any repeal or modification of the foregoing provisions of this Article
Seventh shall not adversely affect any right or protection hereunder of any
person in respect of any act or omission occurring prior to the time of such
repeal or modification. The rights provided hereunder shall inure to the
benefit of any Indemnified Person and such personÂ’s heirs, executors and
administrators.

 



 

EIGHTH: The Corporation reserves the right to amend, alter, change or repeal
any provision contained in this Certificate of Incorporation, in the manner
now or hereafter prescribed by statute and this Certificate of Incorporation,
and all rights conferred upon stockholders herein are granted subject to this
reservation.

 **EXHIBIT C**

 



 

 **FORM OF ESCROW AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS ESCROW AGREEMENT (as the same may be amended or modified from time to
time pursuant hereto, this " _Escrow Agreement_ ") is made and entered into as
of [ ], 2018, by and among: PTC Therapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the " _Buyer_ "); Shareholder Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited
liability company, solely in its capacity as the representative of the Company
Equityholders (the " _Company Equityholder Representative_ "); and JPMorgan
Chase Bank, N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "). The Buyer and the Company
Equityholder Representative are sometimes referred to individually as a "
_Party_ " and together as the " _Parties_."

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Buyer, the Company Equityholder Representative, Agilis
Biotherapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and Agility
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), have entered into
the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of July 19, 2018 (the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, on the terms set forth therein, Merger Sub
is merging with and into the Company, with the Company as the surviving
corporation and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of the Buyer;

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , pursuant to the Merger Agreement, the Parties have agreed to
deposit in escrow certain funds in the Escrow Fund (as defined below); and

 



 

 **WHEREAS** , the Parties wish such deposit to be subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and herein.

 



 

 **NOW THEREFORE** , in consideration of the foregoing and of the mutual
covenants hereinafter set forth, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

1. ** **_Capitalized Terms_. ** **As between the Parties, capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement. It is understood that the Escrow Agent shall be bound by and look only to the terms defined within this Escrow Agreement.

 



 

2. ** **_Establishment of Escrow_. The Merger Agreement provides for the establishment of the escrow arrangements set forth in this Escrow Agreement.

 



 

3. ** **_Appointment_. The Parties hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such appointment and agrees to act as escrow agent in accordance with and under the terms and conditions set forth herein.

 



 

4. ** **_Escrow Amounts_. The Buyer agrees to deposit with the Escrow Agent an amount equal to $2,500,000 in cash (the " _Escrow Amount_ "). The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Amount in a separate account for the benefit of the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders) and, subject to the terms and conditions hereof, shall invest and reinvest, as directed in Section 5, the Escrow Amount and the proceeds thereof. As used herein, " _Escrow Fund_ " means, as of any time, the Escrow Amount, including any interest or other amounts earned thereon prior to such time, less (a) any investment losses thereon incurred prior to such time and (b) disbursements therefrom prior to such time in accordance with this Escrow Agreement.

      
 

 



 

5. ** **_Investment of Escrow Fund_. During the term of this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Fund shall be invested in an interest bearing demand deposit account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or a successor investment offered by the Escrow Agent. Interest bearing demand deposit accounts have rates of compensation that may vary from time to time as determined by the Escrow Agent. No other investment is permitted hereunder. The Escrow Agent will not provide supervision, recommendations or advice relating to Funds invested in the interest bearing demand deposit account. The Escrow Agent shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as a result of any investment made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of the investment prior to its maturity or for the failure of an Authorized Representative of the Parties to give the Escrow Agent instructions to invest or reinvest the Fund.

 



 

6. ** **_Disposition and Termination_.

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise set forth in Sections 6(c) and 11(b) below, the Escrow
Agent shall disburse the Escrow Fund in accordance with either (i) a joint
written instruction signed by an Authorized Representative of each Party or
(ii) written instructions delivered to the Escrow Agent by an Authorized
Representative of the instructing Party given to effectuate an attached copy
of a final, non-appealable order or judgment by a court of competent
jurisdiction as to the disbursement of all or some of the Escrow Fund
accompanied by written certification from counsel for the instructing Party
attesting that such order or judgment is final and not subject to further
proceedings or appeal (collectively " _Court Order_ "). The Escrow Agent shall
be entitled conclusively to rely upon any such certification and instruction
and shall have no responsibility to review the attached order/judgment to
which such certification and instruction refers or to make any determination
as to whether such order/judgment is final, not subject to further proceedings
or appeals or otherwise binding upon the Parties.

 



 

(b) At any time, but no later than 5:00 p.m., Eastern Time on the date of the
final determination of the Final Closing Adjustment pursuant to Section 2.6 of
the Merger Agreement (the " _Escrow Expiration Date_ ") for which the Escrow
Agent has received prior written notice from Authorized Representatives of the
Parties of such date, the Buyer may deliver to the Escrow Agent, with a copy
concurrently delivered to the Company Equityholder Representative, a written
notice in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_, making a
claim for payment of the Final Closing Adjustment, pursuant to Section 2.6 of
the Merger Agreement, or all or a portion of the Escrow Fund with respect to
any claim for indemnification by the Buyer under the Merger Agreement. The
Escrow Agent shall hold the amount of the Final Closing Adjustment or any
Damages claimed in any such claim for indemnification (the " _Claimed Amount_
") until the Escrow Agent receives either (i) a joint written instruction
signed by an Authorized Representative of each Party or (ii) a Court Order.
For the avoidance of doubt, the joint written instruction contemplated by
clause (i) of the immediately preceding sentence may provide for release of
all, or only a portion of, the Claimed Amount.

 



 

(c) On the first Business Day after the Escrow Expiration Date, the Escrow
Agent pursuant to written instructions from the Company Equityholder
Representative shall disburse to American Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC,
as paying and exchange agent (for

 



      
 

 



 

disbursement in respect of all shares of Company Stock and any Company
Warrants in accordance with the Merger Agreement, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof) and to the Company (for disbursement to former holders of
Vested Company Options in accordance with the Merger Agreement, subject to the
terms and conditions thereof), any amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund, less
any Pending Claim Amount (as defined below). For avoidance of doubt, the
Escrow Agent shall rely solely upon the written instructions that it receives
from the Company Equityholder Representative without determining whether any
such instructions and disbursement in connection with such instructions are in
accordance with the Merger Agreement. The " _Pending Claim Amount_ " means (i)
the aggregate Claimed Amount set forth in any and all notices timely delivered
by the Buyer pursuant to Section 6(b) above with respect to claims for payment
of the Final Closing Adjustment or indemnification under the Merger Agreement
that remain unresolved as of the Escrow Expiration Date and (ii) any portion
of the Escrow Fund that has been finally determined to be payable to the Buyer
but that has not been paid as of the Escrow Expiration Date. Thereafter, the
Pending Claim Amount shall be disbursed as and to the extent provided in
Section 6(b)(i) or (ii) above, and an Authorized Representative of the Company
Equityholder Representative shall submit to the Escrow Agent an updated letter
of instruction in connection with any such subsequent disbursement payable for
the benefit of the Company Equityholders.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6, the
Escrow Agent may assume that any notice of claim, notice of dispute or other
notice of any kind required to be delivered to the Escrow Agent and any other
person has been received by such other person on the date it has been received
by the Escrow Agent, but the Escrow Agent need not inquire or verify such
receipt. Upon delivery of the entire amount of the Escrow Fund by the Escrow
Agent in accordance with this Escrow Agreement, this Escrow Agreement shall
terminate, and the related account shall be closed, subject to the provisions
of Sections 9 and 10.

 



 

7. ** **_Escrow Agent_.

 



 

(a) The Escrow Agent shall have only those duties as are specifically and
expressly provided herein, which shall be deemed purely ministerial in nature,
and no other duties, including but not limited to any fiduciary duty, shall be
implied. The Escrow Agent shall neither be responsible for, nor chargeable
with, knowledge of, nor have any requirements to comply with, the terms and
conditions of any other agreement, instrument or document between the Parties,
in connection herewith, or court order delivered pursuant to Section 6, if
any, including without limitation the Merger Agreement, nor shall the Escrow
Agent be required to determine if any person or entity has complied with any
such agreements or court order, nor shall any additional obligations of the
Escrow Agent be inferred from the terms of such agreements or Court Order,
even though reference thereto may be made in this Escrow Agreement. In the
event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of this Escrow
Agreement, those of the Merger Agreement, any schedule or exhibit attached to
the Escrow Agreement, or any other agreement among the Parties, as between the
Parties (or either of them), on the one hand, and the Escrow Agent, on the
other hand, the terms and conditions of this Escrow Agreement shall control.
The Escrow Agent may conclusively rely upon and shall not be liable for acting
or refraining from acting upon any written notice, document, instruction or
request furnished to it by a Party hereunder and believed by it to be genuine
and to have been signed by an Authorized Representative of such Party, without
inquiry and without requiring substantiating evidence of

 



      
 

 



 

any kind. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party, any beneficiary
or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction setting forth,
claiming, containing, objecting to, or related to the transfer or distribution
of the Escrow Fund, or any portion thereof, unless such fund transfer
instruction shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent in accordance with
Section 13 below and the Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable
security procedures as may be required thereunder. The Escrow Agent shall be
under no duty to inquire into or investigate the validity, accuracy or content
of any such document, notice, instruction or request. The Escrow Agent shall
provide to the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative monthly
statements identifying transactions, transfers or holdings of the Escrow Fund.

 



 

(b) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken, suffered or
omitted to be taken by it in good faith except to the extent that a final
adjudication of a court of competent jurisdiction determines that the Escrow
AgentÂ’s fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct caused any
direct loss to either Party. The Escrow Agent may execute any of its powers
and perform any of its duties hereunder directly or through affiliates, agents
or attorneys, and shall be liable only for the fraud, bad faith, gross
negligence or willful misconduct (as finally adjudicated in a court of
competent jurisdiction) of any such affiliate or agents. The Escrow Agent may
consult with counsel, accountants and other skilled persons to be selected and
retained by it. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any action taken,
suffered or omitted to be taken by it in accordance with, or in reasonable
reliance upon, the advice or opinion of any such counsel, accountants or other
skilled persons. In the event that the Escrow Agent shall be uncertain or
believe there is some ambiguity as to its duties or rights hereunder or shall
receive instructions, claims or demands from any Party which, in its opinion,
conflict with any of the provisions of this Escrow Agreement, it shall be
entitled to refrain from taking any action and its sole obligation shall be to
keep safely all property held in escrow until it shall be given a direction in
writing signed by the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative which
eliminates such ambiguity or uncertainty to the reasonable satisfaction of
Escrow Agent or by a final and non-appealable order or judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction. The Parties agree to pursue any redress or recourse in
connection with any dispute without making the Escrow Agent a party to the
same, other than to the extent such relates to the actual or alleged fraud,
bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Escrow Agent.
Anything in this Escrow Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, in no event
shall the Escrow Agent be liable for special, incidental, punitive, indirect
or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever (including but not
limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has been advised of the
likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of the form of action.

 



 

8. ** **_Succession; Removal_.

 



 

(a) The Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties or
obligations hereunder by giving not less than thirty (30) daysÂ’ advance notice
in writing of such resignation to the Parties specifying a date when such
resignation shall take effect, and upon such notice, the Company Equityholder
Representative and the Buyer may appoint a successor escrow agent. The Company
Equityholder Representative and the Buyer agree that a successor escrow agent
they appoint will be a banking or trust company having capital and surplus in
excess of One Billion Dollars ($1,000,000,000) and will be organized under the
laws of the United States of America. If the Parties have failed to appoint a
successor escrow agent prior to the expiration of thirty (30) days following
receipt of the notice of resignation, the Escrow Agent may either (i)
interplead

 



      
 

 



 

the remaining Escrow Fund with a court located in the State of New York and
the costs, expenses and reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees which are incurred in
connection with such proceeding may be charged against and withdrawn from the
Escrow Fund, or (ii) petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
appointment of a successor escrow agent or for other appropriate relief, and
any such resulting appointment shall be binding upon all of the Parties. The
Escrow AgentÂ’s sole responsibility after such thirty (30) day notice period
expires shall be to hold any remaining Escrow Fund (without any obligation to
reinvest the same) and to deliver the same to a designated substitute escrow
agent, if any, or in accordance with the directions of a final order or
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, at which time of delivery the
Escrow AgentÂ’s obligations hereunder shall cease and terminate, subject to the
provisions of Sections 9 and 10 hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall have the
right to withhold an amount equal to any amount due and owing to the Escrow
Agent, plus any costs and expenses the Escrow Agent shall reasonably believe
may be incurred by the Escrow Agent in connection with the termination of the
Escrow Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative, acting together,
shall have the right to terminate the appointment of the Escrow Agent, at any
time after giving not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to the
Escrow Agent, specifying the date upon which such termination shall take
effect. After such date, the Escrow Agent shall have no further obligation
hereunder except to hold any remaining Escrow Fund as depository. The Buyer
and the Company Equityholder Representative agree that they will jointly
appoint a successor escrow agent effective with the termination of the Escrow
Agent hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall refrain from taking any action until
it shall receive joint written instructions from the Buyer and the Company
Equityholder Representative designating the successor escrow agent. The Escrow
Agent shall deliver all amounts remaining in the Escrow Fund to such successor
escrow agent in accordance with such instructions and upon receipt of the
Escrow Fund, the successor escrow agent shall be bound by all of the
provisions hereof.

 



 

(c) Any entity into which the Escrow Agent may be merged or converted or with
which it may be consolidated, or any entity to which all or substantially all
the escrow business may be transferred, shall be the Escrow Agent under this
Escrow Agreement without further act.

 



 

9. ** **_Compensation and Reimbursement_. The Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders) shall be responsible for (a) paying the Escrow Agent for the services to be rendered hereunder, along with any fees or charges for accounts, including those levied by any governmental authority which the Escrow Agent may impose, charge or pass-through, which unless otherwise agreed by the Parties in writing shall be as described in _Schedule 1_ attached hereto, and (b) paying or reimbursing the Escrow Agent upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, disbursements and advances, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees and expenses, incurred or made by it in connection with the performance, modification and termination of this Escrow Agreement. All amounts payable to the Escrow Agent under this Section 9 shall be paid fifty percent (50%) by the Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by the Company Equityholder Representative (as Company Transaction Expenses, to the extent known on the date hereof, or otherwise from the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount). Each Party further agrees to the disclosures and agreements set forth in _Schedule 1_.

 



      
 

 



 

10. ** **_Indemnity_. The Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative (solely on behalf of the Company Equityholders and in its capacity as the Company Equityholder Representative, not in its individual capacity) shall jointly and severally indemnify, defend and save harmless the Escrow Agent and its affiliates and their respective successors, assigns, agents and employees (the " _indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, liabilities, penalties, judgments, settlements, litigation, investigations, costs or expenses (including, without limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of outside counsel) (collectively " _Escrow Agent Damages_ ") arising out of or in connection with (a) the Escrow AgentÂ’s execution and performance of this Escrow Agreement, tax reporting or withholding, the enforcement of any rights or remedies under or in connection with this Escrow Agreement, or as may arise by reason of any act, omission or error of the indemnitee, except in the case of any indemnitee to the extent that such Escrow Agent Damages are finally adjudicated by a court of competent jurisdiction to have been primarily caused by the fraud, bad faith, gross negligence or willful misconduct of any indemnitee, or (b) its following any instructions or other directions, whether joint or singular, from the Parties, except to the extent that its following any such instruction or direction is expressly forbidden by the terms hereof. As agreed to between only the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative, such Escrow Agent Damages shall be divided equally between the Buyer, on the one hand, and Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders), on the other hand. The Parties hereto acknowledge that the foregoing indemnities shall survive the resignation, replacement or removal of the Escrow Agent or the termination of this Escrow Agreement. The Buyer, on the one hand, and the Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders), on the other hand, shall have a right of contribution against the other (including enforcement costs) for any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Section 10 or any other payment hereunder as to which the Buyer and the Company Equityholder Representative (on behalf of the Company Equityholders) are each responsible for one-half of the payment. Any party entitled to indemnification under this Section 10 (the " _Indemnified Party_ ") shall give prompt written notice to the other party that is obligated to provide indemnification (the " _Indemnifying Party_ "), of any suit, claim, proceeding, demand or liability (collectively, a " _Claim_ "), and will reasonably cooperate with the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s expense, in the defense or settlement thereof. Failure to provide prompt notice shall not affect the indemnification provided hereunder except that the Indemnifying Party has actually been materially prejudiced as a result of such failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to have sole control of the defense of any Claim and of all negotiations for its settlement or compromise; provided, that if the Indemnifying Party elects not to assume the defense of such Claim, the Indemnified Party may pay, compromise and defend such Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or relating to such Claim. In conjunction with the Indemnifying PartyÂ’s handling of Claims in accordance with this subsection, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at its sole option, to be represented in any action or proceeding by independent counsel of the Indemnified PartyÂ’s own choice, provided that the exercise of such right shall not affect the obligations of the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Section 10\. For the avoidance of doubt, it is understood and agreed that the intent of the parenthetical "(solely on behalf of the Company Equityholders and its capacity as Company Equityholder Representative and not in its individual capacity)" in this Agreement, it is to clarify that the Buyer and the Company Equityholders are the parties with economic interests in the Merger Agreement, and the Company Equityholders shall ultimately be responsible to the Company Equityholder Representative for any indemnification obligations or

 



      
 

 



 

liabilities that the Company Equityholder Representative has to the Escrow
Agent hereunder. Accordingly, such clauses clarify the Company Equityholder
RepresentativeÂ’s recourse to the Company Equityholders and are not meant to
limit the Company Equityholder RepresentativeÂ’s capacity or liability as
between itself and the Escrow Agent under the Indemnity in this Section or
under any other provision in this Agreement. The Parties hereby grant a right
of set off against the Fund for the payment of any claim for indemnification,
fees, expenses and amounts due to the Escrow Agent or an Indemnitee.

 



 

11. ** **_Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) Each Party has provided the Escrow Agent with its fully executed Internal
Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") Form W-9, the appropriate IRS Form W-8, whichever
is appropriate, and/or other required documentation reasonably requested to
validate the form provided or, to the extent required, of any Person on whose
behalf such Party may receive payments under this Agreement. All interest or
other income earned from the investment of the Escrow Fund under this Escrow
Agreement shall be allocated to the Buyer and reported, as and to the extent
required by law, by the Escrow Agent to the IRS, or any other taxing
authority, and to the Buyer, on IRS Form 1099 or IRS Form 1042-S (or other
appropriate form) as income earned from the Escrow Fund by the Buyer whether
or not said income has been distributed during such year. The Escrow Agent
shall withhold any taxes it reasonably determines to be required in the
absence of a properly executed IRS Form W-9 (or Form W-8, as applicable) or as
otherwise required by applicable law, and shall remit such taxes to the
appropriate authorities. The Parties hereby agree that no other tax
withholding or information reporting of any kind is required to be performed

after the end of such calendar quarter for the purpose of making the
applicable tax payments for such income.

Notwithstanding the above, in the case of communications delivered to the
Escrow Agent, such communications shall be deemed to have been given on the
date received by an officer of the Escrow Agent or any employee of the Escrow
Agent who reports directly to any such officer at the above-referenced office.
In the event that the Escrow Agent, in its sole discretion, shall determine
that an emergency exists, the Escrow Agent may use such other means of
communication as the Escrow Agent deems appropriate. " _Business Day_ " shall
mean any day other than a Saturday, Sunday or any other day on which the
Escrow Agent located at the notice address set forth above is authorized or
required by law or executive order to remain closed.

 



 

13. ** **_Security Procedures_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 12, any instructions setting forth, claiming, containing, objecting to, or in any way related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Fund, must be in writing or set forth in a Portable Document Format (" _PDF_ "), executed by the appropriate Party or Parties as evidenced by the signatures of the person or persons signing this Escrow Agreement or one of its designated persons as set forth on its Designation of Authorized Representative attached hereto as _Schedule 2-A_ and _Schedule 2-B_ (each an " _Authorized Representative_ "). Each Designation of Authorized Representatives, as applicable, shall be signed by the Secretary, any Assistant Secretary or other duly authorized officer of the named Party. No instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Fund shall be deemed delivered and effective unless the Escrow Agent actually shall have received it on a Business Day by facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email only at the fax number or email address set forth in Section 12 and as evidenced by a confirmed transmittal to the PartyÂ’s or PartiesÂ’ transmitting fax number or email address, and the Escrow Agent has been able to satisfy any applicable security procedures as may be required hereunder. The Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party or other person for refraining from acting upon any instruction for or related to the transfer or distribution of the Escrow Fund if delivered to any other fax number or email address, including but not limited to a valid email address of any employee of Escrow Agent. The Parties acknowledge that there are certain security, corruption, transmission error or access availability risks associated with using open networks such as the Internet and the Parties hereby expressly assume such risks.

 



 

In the event funds transfer instructions are set forth in a permitted
instruction from a Party or the Parties in accordance with the above, the
Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such instructions by a
single telephone call-back to an Authorized Representative of the Buyer or the
Company Equityholder Representative, as applicable, and the Escrow Agent may
rely upon the confirmation of such person. The persons designated as
Authorized Representatives and telephone numbers for same may be changed only
in a writing executed by an Authorized Representative of the Buyer or the
Company Equityholder Representative, or one of their duly authorized officers,
as applicable, and actually received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent via
facsimile or as a PDF attached to an email. No funds will be disbursed to a
Party until an Authorized Representative of each such Party, as applicable, is
able to confirm such instructions by telephone call-back. The Escrow Agent,
any intermediary bank and the beneficiaryÂ’s bank in any funds transfer may
rely upon the identifying number of the beneficiaryÂ’s bank or any intermediary
bank included in funds transfer instructions provided by the Buyer and/or the
Company Equityholder Representative, as applicable, and confirmed by an
Authorized Representative of such Party. Further, the beneficiaryÂ’s bank in
the funds transfer instructions

 



      
 

 



 

may make payment on the basis of the account number provided in such PartyÂ’s
instructions and confirmed by such PartyÂ’s Authorized Representative, even
though it identifies a person different from the named beneficiary. The
Parties acknowledge that these security procedures are commercially
reasonable.

 



 

14. ** **_Confidentiality_. By executing this Escrow Agreement, the Buyer, the Company Equityholder Representative and the Escrow Agent acknowledge that this Escrow Agreement (including related attachments) contains certain information that is sensitive and confidential in nature and, except as otherwise provided by Section 17 below, agree that such information needs to be protected from improper disclosure, including the publication or dissemination of this Escrow Agreement and related information to individuals or entities not a party to this Escrow Agreement.

 



 

15. ** **_Compliance with Court Orders_. In the event that a legal garnishment, attachment, levy, restraining notice or court order is served with respect to the Escrow Fund, or the delivery thereof shall be stayed or enjoined by an order of a court, or any order, judgment or decree shall be made or entered by any court order affecting the property deposited under this Escrow Agreement, the Escrow Agent is hereby expressly authorized, in its sole discretion, to obey and comply with all writs, orders or decrees so entered or issued, whether with or without jurisdiction, and in the event that the Escrow Agent obeys or complies with any such writ, order or decree it shall not be liable to any of the Parties or to any other person, entity, firm or corporation, by reason of such compliance notwithstanding such writ, order or decree be subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside or vacated.

 



 

16. ** **_Miscellaneous_. Except for changes to funds transfer instructions as provided in Section 13, the provisions of this Escrow Agreement may be waived, altered, amended or supplemented, in whole or in part, only by a writing signed by the Escrow Agent and the Parties. Neither this Escrow Agreement nor any right or interest hereunder may be assigned in whole or in part by the Escrow Agent or any Party, except as provided in Section 8, without the prior consent of the Escrow Agent and the other Parties. This Escrow Agreement shall be governed by and construed under the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to the conflict of law rules thereof. To the extent that in any jurisdiction either Party may now or hereafter be entitled to claim for itself or its assets, immunity from suit, execution attachment (before or after judgment), or other legal process, such Party shall not claim, and it hereby irrevocably waives, such immunity. Each Party and the Escrow Agent irrevocably waives any objection on the grounds of venue, forum _non conveniens_ or any similar grounds and irrevocably consents to service of process by mail or in any other manner permitted by applicable law and consents to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the State of Delaware. Each Party and the Escrow Agent further hereby waives any right to a trial by jury with respect to any lawsuit or judicial proceeding arising or relating to this Escrow Agreement. No party to this Escrow Agreement is liable to any other party for losses due to, or if it is unable to perform its obligations under the terms of this Escrow Agreement because of acts of God, fire, war, terrorism, floods, strikes, electrical outages, equipment or transmission failure, or other causes reasonably beyond its control. This Escrow Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. All signatures of the parties to this Escrow Agreement may be transmitted by facsimile or as a PDF or other attachment to an electronic transmission, and such facsimile or PDF or other attachment will, for all purposes, be deemed to

 



       
 

 



 

be the original signature of such party whose signature it reproduces, and
will be binding upon such party. If any provision of this Escrow Agreement is
determined to be prohibited or unenforceable by reason of any applicable law
of a jurisdiction, then such provision shall, as to such jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions thereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provisions in any other jurisdiction. A person who is not a
party to this Escrow Agreement shall have no right to enforce any term of this
Escrow Agreement. Each party represents, warrants and covenants that (i) to
its knowledge, each document, notice, instruction or request provided by such
Party to the Escrow Agent shall comply with applicable laws and regulations;
(ii) such Party has full corporate or limited liability company (as
applicable) power and authority to enter into, execute and deliver this Escrow
Agreement and to perform all of the duties and obligations to be performed by
it hereunder; and (iii) the person(s) executing this Escrow Agreement on such
PartyÂ’s behalf and certifying Authorized Representative of such Party has been
duly and properly authorized to take the actions specified for such person in
the applicable _Schedule 2_. Where, however, the conflicting provisions of any
such applicable law may be waived, they are hereby irrevocably waived by the
parties hereto to the fullest extent permitted by law, to the end that this
Escrow Agreement shall be enforced as written. Except as expressly provided in
Section 10 above, nothing in this Escrow Agreement, whether express or
implied, shall be construed to give to any person or entity other than the
Escrow Agent and the Parties any legal or equitable right, remedy, interest or
claim under or in respect of this Escrow Agreement or any funds escrowed
hereunder.

 



 

17. _Information_. Notwithstanding Section 14 above, the Parties authorize the Escrow Agent to disclose information with respect to this Escrow Agreement and the account(s) established hereunder, the Parties, or any transaction hereunder if such disclosure is: (a) necessary, in the Escrow AgentÂ’s opinion, for the purpose of allowing the Escrow Agent to perform its duties and to exercise its powers and rights hereunder; (b) to a proposed assignee of the rights of Escrow Agent; (c) to a branch, affiliate, subsidiary, employee or agent of the Escrow Agent or to their auditors, regulators or legal advisers or to any competent court; (d) to the auditors of any of the Parties; or (e) permitted or required by applicable law, regardless of whether the disclosure is made in the country in which each Party resides, in which the Escrow Fund is maintained, or in which the transaction is conducted. The Parties agree that such disclosures by the Escrow Agent and its affiliates may be transmitted across national boundaries and through networks, including those owned by third parties.

![](g173991kc32ai001.jpg)

 



 

Schedule of Fees for Escrow Agent Services

 



 

Based upon our current understanding of your proposed transaction, our fee
proposal is as follows:

 



    

 **Account Acceptance Fee**

 |  

 **waived** 

---|--- 
 



 

Encompassing review, negotiation and execution of governing documentation,
opening of the account, and completion of all due diligence documentation.
Payable upon closing.

 



    

 **Annual Administration Fee**

 **$2,500 per annum** 

---|--- 
 



 

The Administration Fee covers our usual and customary ministerial duties,
including record keeping, distributions, document compliance and such other
duties and responsibilities expressly set forth in the governing documents for
each transaction. Payable upon closing and annually in advance thereafter

 **Extraordinary Services and Out-of Pocket Expenses**

 



 

Any additional services beyond our standard services as specified above, and
all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses including attorneyÂ’s or accountantÂ’s
fees and expenses will be considered extraordinary services for which related
costs, transaction charges, and additional fees will be billed at the Escrow
AgentÂ’s then standard rate. Disbursements, receipts, investments or tax
reporting exceeding 25 items per year may be treated as extraordinary services
thereby incurring additional charges _._ The Escrow Agent may impose, charge,
pass-through and modify fees and/or charges for any account established and
services provided by the Escrow Agent, including but not limited to,
transaction, maintenance, balance-deficiency, and service fees, agency or
trade execution fees, and other charges, including those levied by any
governmental authority.

 



 

 **Fee Disclosure and Assumptions**: Please note that the fees quoted are based
on a review of the transaction documents provided and an internal due
diligence review. The Escrow Agent reserves the right to revise, modify,
change and supplement the fees quoted herein if the assumptions underlying the
activity in the account, level of balances, market volatility or conditions or
other factors change from those used to set our fees. Payment of the invoice
is due upon receipt.

 



 

The escrow deposits shall be continuously invested in an interest bearing
demand deposit account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA. No other investment will be
permitted during the duration of this Agreement. Interest bearing demand
deposit accounts have rates of interest or compensation that may vary from
time to time as determined by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

 **Disclosures and Agreements**

 



 

 **Taxes.** **The Parties shall duly complete such tax documentation or other
procedural formalities necessary for Escrow Agent to complete required tax
reporting and for the relevant Party to receive interest or other income
without withholding or deduction of tax in any jurisdiction. Should any
information supplied in such tax documentation change, the Parties shall
promptly notify Escrow Agent. Escrow Agent shall withhold any taxes it deems
appropriate in the absence of proper tax documentation or as required by law,
including without limitation, the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act
("FATCA"), and shall remit such taxes to the appropriate authorities.**

 



 

 **Representations Relating to Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (Rule 15Ba1-1 et seq.) (the "Municipal Advisor Rule).** Buyer
**represents and warrants to the Escrow Agent that for purposes of the
Municipal Advisor Rules, none of the funds (if any) currently invested, or
that will be invested in the future, in money market funds, commercial paper
or treasury bills under this Agreement constitute or contain (i) proceeds of
municipal securities (including investment income therefrom and monies pledged
or otherwise**

      
 

 



 

 **legally dedicated to serve as collateral or a source or repayment for such
securities) or (ii) municipal escrow investments (as each such term is
defined in the Municipal Advisor Rule). Buyer also represents and warrants to
the Escrow Agent that the person providing this certification has access to
the appropriate information or has direct knowledge of the source of the funds
to be invested to enable the forgoing representation to be made. Further,
Buyer acknowledges that the Escrow Agent will rely on this representation
until notified in writing otherwise.**

 



 

 **Patriot Act Disclosure.** Section 326 of the Uniting and Strengthening
America by Providing Appropriate Tools Required to Intercept and Obstruct
Terrorism Act of 2001 ("USA PATRIOT Act") requires Escrow Agent to implement
reasonable procedures to verify the identity of any person that opens a new
account with it. Accordingly, you acknowledge that Section 326 of the USA
PATRIOT Act and Escrow AgentÂ’s identity verification procedures require Escrow
Agent to obtain information which may be used to confirm your identity
including without limitation name, address and organizational documents
("identifying information"). You agree to provide Escrow Agent with and
consent to Escrow Agent obtaining from third parties any such identifying
information required as a condition of opening an account with or using any
service provided by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

 **OFAC Disclosure**. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with the
laws and regulations of various jurisdictions relating to the prevention of
money laundering and the implementation of sanctions, including but not
limited to regulations issued by the U.S. Office of Foreign Assets Control.
Escrow Agent is not obligated to execute payment orders or effect any other
transaction where the beneficiary or other payee is a person or entity with
whom the Escrow Agent is prohibited from doing business by any law or
regulation applicable to Escrow Agent, or in any case where compliance would,
in Escrow AgentÂ’s opinion, conflict with applicable law or banking practice or
its own policies and procedures. Where Escrow Agent does not execute a payment
order or effect a transaction for such reasons, Escrow Agent may take any
action required by any law or regulation applicable to Escrow Agent including,
without limitation, freezing or blocking funds. Transaction screening may
result in delays in the posting of transactions.

 



 

 **Abandoned Property**. Escrow Agent is required to act in accordance with
the laws and regulations of various states relating to abandoned property
escheatment or similar law and, accordingly, shall be entitled to remit
dormant funds to any state as abandoned property in accordance with such laws
and regulations. Without limitation of the foregoing, notwithstanding any
instruction to the contrary, Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any Party for
any amount disbursed from an account maintained under this Agreement to a
governmental entity or public official in compliance with any applicable
abandoned property, escheatment or similar law.

 



 

Foreign Exchange. If Escrow Agent accepts a funds transfer instruction under
this Agreement for payment in a currency (the "Non-Account Currency") other
than the currency of the account (the "Account Currency"), Escrow Agent is
authorized to enter into a foreign exchange transaction to sell to the Party
or Parties the amount of Non-Account Currency required to complete the funds
transfer and debit the account for the purchase price of the Non-Account
Currency. If Escrow Agent accepts payment to the account in a Non-Account
Currency, Escrow Agent is authorized to purchase the Non-Account Currency from
the Party or Parties, and to credit the purchase price to the account in lieu
of the Non-Account Currency. The purchase price for the foregoing transactions
shall be at a rate and spread as Escrow Agent determines in its discretion and
may differ from rates at which comparable transactions are entered into with
other customers or the range of foreign exchange rates at which Escrow Agent
otherwise enters into foreign exchange transactions on the relevant date.
Further, (i) Escrow Agent has full discretion to execute such foreign exchange
transactions in such manner as Escrow Agent determines in its sole discretion
and (ii) Escrow Agent may manage the associated risks of Escrow AgentÂ’s own
position in the market in a manner it deems appropriate without regard to the
impact of such activities on the Parties. Imbedded within the applicable
foreign exchange rate or otherwise generated in connection with Escrow AgentÂ’s
execution of any such transaction or management of its risk related thereto
may be a profit to Escrow Agent. Any such foreign exchange transaction will be
between Escrow Agent and a Party or Parties as principals, and Escrow Agent
will not be acting as agent or fiduciary for the Parties.

 



 

Acknowledgment of Compensation and Multiple Roles. Escrow Agent is authorized
to act under this Agreement notwithstanding that Escrow Agent or any of its
subsidiaries or affiliates (such subsidiaries and affiliates hereafter
individually called an "Affiliate" and collectively called "Affiliates") may
(A) receive fees or derive earnings (float) as a result of providing an
investment product or account on the books of Escrow Agent pursuant to this
Agreement or for providing services or referrals with respect to investment
products, or (B) (i) act in the same transaction in

      
 

 



 

multiple capacities, (ii) engage in other transactions or relationships with
the same entities to which Escrow Agent may be providing escrow or other
services under this Agreement (iii) refer clients to an Affiliate for services
or (iv) enter into agreements under which referrals of escrow or related
transactions are provided to Escrow Agent. JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. may earn
compensation from any of these activities in addition to the fees charged for
services under this Agreement.

 



 

 **THE FOLLOWING DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED UNDER APPLICABLE U.S.
REGULATIONS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FEDERAL RESERVE REGULATION D.
WHERE SPECIFIC INVESTMENTS ARE NOTED BELOW, THE DISCLOSURES APPLY ONLY TO
THOSE INVESTMENTS AND NOT TO ANY OTHER INVESTMENT.**

 



 

 **Demand Deposit Account Disclosure**. Escrow Agent is authorized, for
regulatory reporting and internal accounting purposes, to divide an escrow
demand deposit account maintained in the U.S. in which the Fund is held into a
non-interest bearing demand deposit internal account and a non-interest
bearing savings internal account, and to transfer funds on a daily basis
between these internal accounts on Escrow AgentÂ’s general ledger in accordance
with U.S. law at no cost to the Parties. Escrow Agent will record the
internal accounts and any transfers between them on Escrow AgentÂ’s books and
records only. The internal accounts and any transfers between them will not
affect the Fund, any investment or disposition of the Fund, use of the escrow
demand deposit account or any other activities under this Escrow Agreement,
except as described herein. Escrow Agent will establish a target balance for
the demand deposit internal account, which may change at any time. To the
extent funds in the demand deposit internal account exceed the target balance,
the excess will be transferred to the savings internal account, unless the
maximum number of transfers from the savings internal account for that
calendar month or statement cycle has already occurred. If withdrawals from
the demand deposit internal account exceeds the available balance in the
demand deposit internal account, funds from the savings internal account will
be transferred to the demand deposit internal account up to the entire balance
of available funds in the savings internal account to cover the shortfall and
to replenish any target balance that Escrow Agent has established for the
demand deposit internal account. If a sixth transfer is needed during a
calendar month or statement cycle, it will be for the entire balance in the
savings internal account, and such funds will remain in the demand deposit
internal account for the remainder of the calendar month or statement cycle.

 



 

 **MMDA Disclosure and Agreement**. If a money market deposit account ("MMDA")
is the investment for the escrow deposit as set forth above or anytime in the
future, you acknowledge and agree that U.S. law limits the number of pre-
authorized or automatic transfers or withdrawals or telephonic/electronic
instructions that can be made from an MMDA to a total of six (6) per calendar
month or statement cycle or similar period. Escrow Agent is required by U.S.
law to reserve the right to require at least seven (7) daysÂ’ notice prior to a
withdrawal from a money market deposit account.

 



 

 **Unlawful Internet Gambling**. The use of any account to conduct
transactions (including, without limitation, the acceptance or receipt of
funds through an electronic funds transfer, or by check, draft or similar
instrument, or the proceeds of any of the foregoing) that are related,
directly or indirectly, to unlawful Internet gambling is strictly prohibited.

 



 

Use of Electronic Records and Signatures. As used in this Agreement, the terms
"writing" and "written" include electronic records, and the terms "execute",
"signed" and "signature" include the use of electronic signatures.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement or the attached
Exhibits, any electronic signature that is presented as the signature of the
purported signer, regardless of the appearance or form of such electronic
signature, may be deemed genuine by Escrow Agent in Escrow AgentÂ’s sole
discretion, and such electronic signature shall be of the same legal effect,
validity and enforceability as a manually executed, original, wet-inked
signature; provided, however, that any such electronic signature must be an
actual and not a typed signature. Any electronically signed agreement shall be
an "electronic record" established in the ordinary course of business and any
copy shall constitute an original for all purposes. The terms "electronic
signature" and "electronic record" shall have the meanings ascribed to them in
15 USC Â§ 7005. This Agreement and any instruction or other document furnished
hereunder may be transmitted by facsimile or as a PDF file attached to an
email.

 ** _INSTRUCTIONS FOR SURRENDERING CERTIFICATES_**

 

( _Please read carefully the instructions below_ )

 



 

1\. **_Required Documents_**. Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan
of Merger, dated as of July 19, 2018, by and among PTC Therapeutics, Inc.
("Buyer"), Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc. ("Company") and the other persons and
entities parties thereto (the "Merger Agreement"), in order to receive your
merger consideration under the Merger Agreement, you must properly complete,
duly execute (as applicable) and deliver this Letter of Transmittal (and the
documents required hereby), together with your Company share certificate(s) or
confirmation of cancellation of certificate(s) held in electronic form. As set
forth in more detail in the Merger Agreement, you will receive, in exchange
for your shares of Company Stock, cash and shares of common stock of Buyer, in
each case, at the times and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
the Merger Agreement. You have been provided with a copy of the Merger
Agreement as an attachment to the Disclosure Statement the Company provided to
you in connection with the Merger. Capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings given to them in the Merger
Agreement.

 



 

2\. **_Method of Delivery_** : Evidence of your securities (whether
certificated or held electronically) and the Letter of Transmittal must be
sent or delivered to American Stock Transfer and Trust Company (the "Exchange
and Paying Agent"). __Do not send such evidence of your securities to PTC
Therapeutics, Inc. or Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc.__ The method of delivery
of securities to be surrendered to the Exchange and Paying Agent at the
address set forth on the front of this Letter of Transmittal is at the option
and risk of the surrendering stockholder. Delivery will be deemed effective
only when received. If you submit this Letter of Transmittal by facsimile, you
must also send or deliver your certificate(s) or evidence of cancellation of
securities held electronically in order to receive payment. If the
certificate(s) are sent by mail, registered mail with return receipt requested
and proper insurance is suggested. If your securities are held in electronic
form, then surrender of such securities shall be effected upon delivery to
Exchange and Paying Agent of a confirmation of cancellation of such securities
from the CompanyÂ’s transfer agent, eShares, Inc. (DBA Carta, Inc.).

 



 

3\. **_Payment in the Same Name_**: If the check or wire transfer and stock
certificate are issued in the same name as the surrendered certificate is
registered, the Letter of Transmittal should be completed and signed exactly
as the surrendered certificate is registered. __Do not sign the stock
certificate(s_ )_. _ Signature guarantees are not required_ if the
certificate(s) surrendered herewith are submitted by the registered owner of
such shares who has not completed the section entitled "Special Payment
Instructions" or are for the account of an Eligible Institution. If any of the
shares surrendered hereby are owned by two or more joint owners, all such
owners must sign this Letter of Transmittal exactly as written on the face of
the certificate(s). If any shares are registered in different names on several
certificates, it will be necessary to complete, sign and submit as many
separate Letters of Transmittal as there are different registrations. Letters
of Transmittal executed by trustees, executors, administrators, guardians,
attorneys-in-fact, officers of corporations, or others acting in a fiduciary
capacity who are not identified as such in the registration must be
accompanied by proper evidence of the signerÂ’s authority to act.

 



 

4\. **_Payment in Different Name_** _:_ If the section entitled "Special
Payment Instructions" is completed, then signatures on this Letter of
Transmittal must be guaranteed by a firm that is a bank, broker, dealer,
credit union, savings association or other entity that is an Eligible
Institution. If the surrendered or cancelled certificates are registered in
the name of a person other than the signer of this Letter of Transmittal, or
if payment is to be made to a person other than the signer of this Letter of
Transmittal, or if the payment is to be made to a person other than the
registered owner(s), then the surrendered or cancelled certificates must be
endorsed or accompanied by duly executed stock powers, in either case signed
exactly as the name(s) of the registered owners appear on such certificate(s)
or stock power(s), with the signatures on the certificate(s) or stock power(s)
guaranteed by an Eligible Institution as provided herein.

 



 

5\. **_Special Payment and Delivery Instructions_** : Indicate the name in
which and address to which the check or wire transfer and stock certificate
are to be sent if different from the name and/or address of the person(s)
signing this Letter of Transmittal. If Special Payment Instructions have been
completed, an IRS Form W-9 or appropriate version of IRS Form W-8, as
applicable, must also be completed for the person named therein, and that
person will be considered the record owner.

 



 

6\. **_Letter of Transmittal Required; Surrender of Certificate(s); Lost
Certificate(s_** _)_ : You will not receive your check or wire transfer and
shares represented in book entry unless and until you deliver this Letter of
Transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, to the Exchange and Paying
Agent, together with the certificate(s) or evidence of cancellation of
securities held electronically and any required accompanying evidences of
authority. ** If your certificate(s) has been lost, stolen, misplaced or
destroyed, contact the Exchange and Paying Agent for instructions at (877)
248-6417 or (718) 921-8317 prior to submitting your certificates for exchange.
** Any Company stockholder who has lost certificates should make arrangements
(which may include the posting of a bond or other satisfactory indemnification
and an affidavit of loss) to replace lost certificates. Such arrangements
should be made with Exchange and Paying Agent.

 



 

7\. **_Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Forms_** : Under the federal income
tax law, each non-exempt stockholder who is a "U.S. person" (as defined in the
General Instructions to IRS Form W-9) is required to provide the Exchange and
Paying Agent with such stockholderÂ’s correct taxpayer identification number
("TIN") on the enclosed IRS Form W-9. If the certificate(s) are in more than
one name or are not in the name of the actual owner, consult the enclosed
instructions to IRS Form W-9 for additional guidance on which TIN to report.
Additionally, each stockholder that is not such a U.S. person is required to
provide a properly executed applicable IRS Form W-8. Please see "IMPORTANT TAX
INFORMATION," below. _Failure to provide the information on the applicable
form may subject the surrendering stockholder to 24% backup withholding on any
payment made to him or her in connection with the Merger._ If a stockholder
does not provide the Exchange and Paying Agent with a TIN before payment is
made, the Exchange and Paying Agent will withhold 24% on all payments to such
surrendering stockholder of any consideration due for such stockholderÂ’s
former Company shares.

 



 

8. **_Stock Transfer Taxes. _**If payment is to be made to any person other than the registered holder, or if surrendered certificates are registered in the name of any person other than the person(s) signing the Letter of Transmittal, the amount of any stock transfer taxes (whether imposed on the registered holder or such person) payable as a result of the transfer to such person will be deducted from the

      
 

 



 

payment for such securities if satisfactory evidence of the payment of such
taxes, or exemption therefrom, is not submitted. Except as provided in this
Instruction 8, it will not be necessary for transfer tax stamps to be affixed
to the certificates listed in the Letter of Transmittal.

 



 

All questions as to the validity, form and eligibility of any surrender of
certificates will be determined by the Exchange and Paying Agent and Buyer and
such determination shall be final and binding. Exchange and Paying Agent and
the Company reserve the right to waive any irregularities or defects in the
surrender of any certificates. A surrender will not be deemed to have been
made until all irregularities have been cured or waived.

 



 

9. **_Indemnification; Joinder_**. You hereby acknowledge that you have read and understand the Merger Agreement and agree to be bound by Section 2.1, Section 2.4, Section 2.6, Section 2.9, Section 3.4, Section 6.10, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI and Article XII of the Merger Agreement, and all other provisions of the Merger Agreement that by their terms purport to bind you or that are related to Section 2.1, Section 2.4, Section 2.6, Section 2.9, Section 3.4, Section 6.10, Article VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI and Article XII of the Merger Agreement and applicable to you (collectively, the " _Relevant Provisions_ "), subject to the limitations and qualifications contained in such provisions of the Merger Agreement and herein, as if a signatory to the Merger Agreement, and you shall comply with, and be subject to, all of the terms, conditions, covenants, agreements and obligations set forth in such the Relevant Provisions, and, without limiting the foregoing, expressly consent to the withholding of the Escrow Amount, the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount and, if applicable, any Holdback Amount, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 **IMPORTANT TAX INFORMATION**

 



 

Under current U.S. federal income tax law, a stockholder who tenders Agilis
Biotherapeutics, Inc. stock certificates that are accepted for exchange may be
subject to backup withholding, currently at a rate of 24%. In order to avoid
such backup withholding, each stockholder that is a U.S. person (as defined in
the General Instructions to IRS Form W-9) must provide the Exchange and Paying
Agent with such StockholderÂ’s correct taxpayer identification number ("TIN")
and certify that such stockholder is not subject to such backup withholding by
completing the Internal Revenue Service ("IRS") Form W-9 provided herewith. In
general, if a Stockholder is an individual, the TIN is the Social Security
number of such individual. If the Exchange and Paying Agent is not provided
with the correct TIN, the stockholder may be subject to a $50 penalty imposed
by the IRS, and any consideration such stockholder receives in the Merger may
be subject to U.S. federal backup withholding. For further information
concerning backup withholding and instructions for completing the IRS Form W-9
(including how to obtain a TIN if you do not have one and how to complete the
IRS Form W-9 if the Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc. stock certificates are held
in more than one name), consult the enclosed General Instructions to IRS Form
W-9.

 



 

Certain stockholders (including, among others, certain corporations and
certain foreign stockholders) are not subject to these backup withholding and
reporting requirements. Exempt stockholders who are U.S. persons should
indicate their exempt status on an IRS Form W-9. See the enclosed copy of the
IRS Form W-9 and the General Instructions to IRS Form W-9.

 



 

In order to satisfy the Exchange and Paying Agent that a foreign stockholder
qualifies as an exempt recipient, such stockholder must submit a properly
completed, applicable IRS Form W-8, or other applicable form, to the Exchange
and Paying Agent, certifying under penalties of perjury to that stockholderÂ’s
non-United States status, or otherwise establish an exemption. IRS Forms W-8,
or other applicable forms, may be obtained from the Exchange and Paying Agent
or the IRS at its Internet website: www.irs.gov.

 



 

Failure to complete the IRS Form W-9 or relevant IRS Form W-8, as applicable,
will not, by itself, cause the Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc. stock certificates
to be deemed invalidly tendered, but may require the Exchange and Paying Agent
to withhold a portion of the amount of any payments made pursuant to the
Merger. Backup withholding is not an additional federal income tax. Rather,
the federal income tax liability of a person subject to backup withholding
will be reduced by the amount of tax withheld provided that the required
information is timely furnished to the Internal Revenue Service. If
withholding results in an overpayment of taxes, a refund may be obtained
provided that the required information is timely furnished to the Internal
Revenue Service.

 



 

NOTE: FAILURE TO COMPLETE AND RETURN THE IRS FORM W-9, OR RELEVANT IRS FORM
W-8, AS APPLICABLE, MAY RESULT IN BACKUP WITHHOLDING OF A PORTION OF ANY
PAYMENTS MADE TO YOU PURSUANT TO THE MERGER. IN THE EVENT OF BACKUP
WITHHOLDING CONSULT YOUR TAX ADVISOR TO DETERMINE IF YOU ARE ENTITLED TO ANY
TAX CREDIT, TAX REFUND OR OTHER TAX BENEFIT AS A RESULT OF SUCH BACKUP
WITHHOLDING. PLEASE CONSULT YOUR ACCOUNTANT OR OTHER TAX ADVISOR FOR FURTHER
GUIDANCE REGARDING THE COMPLETION OF IRS FORM W-9 OR THE APPROPRIATE IRS FORM
W-8 TO CLAIM EXEMPTION FROM BACKUP WITHHOLDING. PLEASE REVIEW THE ENCLOSED
GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS TO IRS FORM W-9 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS.

Stockholder shall have no obligation hereunder to keep confidential or not use
any such information to the extent disclosure thereof (x) is required by Law;

Stockholder from disclosing the fact that discussions regarding the Merger
have taken place or that the Merger has occurred to the Principal
StockholderÂ’s immediate family members who are required to hold such
information in confidence or (B) limit or interfere with a Principal
StockholderÂ’s right, if required by Law, without notice to or authorization of
the Company, to communicate in good faith with any Governmental Entity for the
purpose of reporting a possible violation of Law, or to participate in any
investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by any Governmental Entity,
including by providing documents or other information, or for the purpose of

" _Proprietary Information_ ") including, but not limited to: (i)
specifications, manuals, software in various stages of development, and other
technical data; (ii) customer and prospect lists, details of agreements and
communications with customers and prospects, and other customer information;

otherwise identified as Proprietary Information, as well as such information
that is the subject of meetings and discussions and not recorded. Proprietary
Information shall not include such information that the Principal Stockholder
can demonstrate (A) is generally available to the public (other than as a
result of a disclosure by the Principal Stockholder in violation of the terms
of this Agreement or any other obligation owed to Buyer), (B) was disclosed to
the Principal Stockholder by a third party under no obligation to keep such
information confidential, or (C) was independently developed by the Principal
Stockholder without reference to Proprietary Information. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Principal Stockholder shall have no obligation hereunder to (1)
keep confidential any of the Proprietary Information to the extent disclosure
thereof is required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event

in connection with, and only to the extent required for, enforcement of rights
or defense of claims by the Principal Stockholder under the Merger Agreement
or this Agreement.

 



 

(c) The Principal Stockholder agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach of
this Section 5 would be inadequate and that the Buyer or the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to injunctive relief, without the requirement of
posting any bond or other security, in addition to any other remedy it may
have upon breach of any provision of this Section 5.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Merger Agreement to the
contrary, the Principal Stockholder, the Company and Buyer acknowledge and
agree that, upon execution and delivery of this Agreement, the provisions of
this Section 5 shall be deemed to supersede for all purposes the provisions in
Section 5.2(b) of the Merger Agreement with respect to the Principal
Stockholder and thereafter the provisions of Section 5.2(b) purporting to bind
any Principal Stockholder as a Company Equityholder thereunder shall be of no
force and effect.

 



 

Section 6. _No Solicitation or Hiring of Former Employees_. Except as provided
by Law, during the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on the one
year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Principal Stockholder agrees that it
shall not, nor shall the Principal Stockholder permit any of its controlled
Affiliates to, recruit, solicit or induce any person who was an employee of
the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries on the date hereof or the
Closing Date (a " _Covered Person_ ") to terminate his or her employment with,
or otherwise cease their relationship with, the Buyer (or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries, as the case may be) or to
become an employee of the Principal Stockholder or Affiliate. In addition, the
Principal Stockholder agrees that it shall not hire or employ or use in any
subcontracting arrangement any Covered Person for a period of one year from
the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

without the prior written consent of an executive officer of the Buyer.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Agreement will prohibit or
otherwise restrict a Principal Stockholder or any of its Representatives or
Affiliates from publishing general advertisements or making general
solicitations for employment (including through newspaper or other
publications of general circulation or in trade publications or through
recruiting or search firms or similar engagements) not specifically targeted
at the Company, the Surviving Corporation or Buyer. Notwithstanding the
forgoing, no action by a portfolio company of a Principal Stockholder will be
considered a violation of this Section 6 unless, following the date of this
Agreement, the Principal Stockholder introduced the candidate to such
portfolio company or otherwise made the portfolio company aware of such
candidate.

 



 

Section 7. _[Reserved]_

 



 

Section 8. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earlier to
occur of (a) the Effective Time or (b) any termination of the Merger Agreement
in accordance with the terms thereof; _provided_ that (i) Sections 5(a) and
(c) and Section 17 shall survive any such termination and (ii) no such
termination shall relieve any party of liability for a breach hereof prior to
termination.

 



 

Section 9. _Fiduciary Duties_. The Principal Stockholder is signing this
Agreement solely in the Principal StockholderÂ’s capacity as an owner of his,
her or its respective Shares, Company Equity Awards and/or Company Warrants,
and notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, nothing herein
shall prohibit, prevent or preclude the Principal Stockholder (and the
Principal StockholderÂ’s officers, directors, employees, representatives and
agents) from taking or not taking any action in his or her capacity as an
officer or director of the Company, to the extent permitted by the Merger
Agreement.

 



 

Section 10. _Representations and Warranties of the Principal Stockholder_. The
Principal Stockholder on his, her or its own behalf hereby severally
represents and warrants to Buyer solely with respect to the Principal
Stockholder as follows:

 



 

(a) _Ownership of Shares_. The Principal Stockholder legally and Beneficially
owns all Shares, Company Equity Awards and Company Warrants set forth on
_Schedule I_ hereto as being owned by the Principal Stockholder and has good
and marketable title to such Shares, Company Equity Awards and Company
Warrants, free and clear of any claims, liens, encumbrances and security
interests whatsoever, except as set forth in clauses (A)-(C) of this Section
10(a). The Principal Stockholder owns no shares of Company Stock (or other
equity interests of the Company) other than the Shares, Company Equity Awards,
and Company Warrants as set forth on _Schedule I_ hereto. The Principal
Stockholder (i) has sole voting power, without restrictions, with respect to
the Shares and (ii) is not a party to any voting trust, proxy, or other

2017, (B) Right of First Refusal and Co-Sale Agreement by and among the
Company and the other parties thereto, dated as of February 15, 2017, and (C)

laws of the jurisdiction of its organization. The Principal Stockholder has
the legal capacity and all requisite power and authority to enter into,
deliver and perform all of his, her or its obligations, under this Agreement
and under the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the
performance by the Principal Stockholder of its obligations under this
Agreement and under the Merger Agreement, require or will require no
authorization or approval by the board of directors or similar governing body
of the Principal Stockholder, other than such authorizations or approvals as
have been obtained. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and
delivered by the Principal Stockholder and constitutes or will constitute a
valid and binding obligation of the Principal Stockholder, enforceable against

insolvency, fraudulent transfer, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditorsÂ’ rights generally, and to general equity principles.

 



 

(c) _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict
with or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material
benefit under, any provision of any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, or other agreement, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree or Law applicable to
the Principal Stockholder, the Principal StockholderÂ’s Shares or any of the
Principal StockholderÂ’s properties or assets, except for any of the foregoing
that would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or delay the
performance by the Principal Stockholder of any of the Principal StockholderÂ’s
obligations hereunder. The Principal Stockholder is not a party to, and the
Principal StockholderÂ’s Shares, Company Equity Awards and Company Warrants are
not subject to or bound in any manner by, any contract or agreement relating
to such Shares, Company Equity Awards or Company Warrants, including any
voting agreement, option agreement, purchase agreement, stockholdersÂ’
agreement, partnership agreement or voting trust that would, individually or
in the aggregate, prevent or delay the performance by the Principal
Stockholder of any of the Principal StockholderÂ’s obligations hereunder. No
consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or
filing with, any Governmental Entity is required by or with respect to the
Principal Stockholder in connection with the execution and delivery of this
Agreement or the consummation by the Principal Stockholder of the transactions
contemplated hereby, except where the failure to obtain such consents,
approvals, orders, authorizations or registrations, or to make such
declarations or filings would not, individually or in the aggregate, prevent
or delay the performance by the Principal Stockholder of any of the Principal
StockholderÂ’s obligations hereunder.

 



 

(d) _Brokers_. No agent, broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of the
Principal Stockholder is, or shall be, entitled to any brokerÂ’s fees, finderÂ’s
fees or commissions from the Principal Stockholder, the Company or any of the
other parties hereto in connection with this Agreement or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(e) _Litigation_. There is no Legal Proceeding which is pending or has been
threatened in writing against the Principal Stockholder that questions the
validity of this

 



      
 

 



 

Agreement or any action taken or to be taken by the Principal Stockholder in
connection herewith or that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Principal StockholderÂ’s ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(f) _Tax Matters_. The Principal Stockholder has had an opportunity to review
with his, her or its own Tax advisors the Tax consequences of the Merger and
the transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Principal
Stockholder understands that he or she must rely solely on its advisors and
not on any statements or representations made by the Buyer, the Company or any
of their agents or representatives. The Principal Stockholder understands that
the Principal Stockholder (and not Buyer, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation) shall be responsible for any Tax liability of the Principal
Stockholder, including amounts withheld to satisfy applicable Taxes, that may

Agreement.

Stockholder, by its execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby (a)

otherwise) arising out of the representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement and/or out of the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement, and agrees that any claim of the

against, or joinder of, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary and (b) forever waives, releases and discharges (and hereby agrees
to cause each of its representatives to forever waive, release and discharge)
with prejudice the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary from

applicable Law or otherwise), causes of action, protests, suits, disputes,
orders, obligations, debts, demands, proceedings, contracts, agreements,

subrogation, assignment, reimbursement, operation of law or otherwise),
whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, accrued or not accrued,
foreseen or unforeseen, or mature or unmature related or with respect to, in
connection with, or arising out of, directly or indirectly, any event, fact,
condition, circumstance, occurrence, act or omission that was in existence (or
that occurred or failed to occur) at or prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , this clause (b) shall not be construed as releasing (a) any Party
from its obligations otherwise expressly set forth in this Agreement or any
agreement delivered pursuant hereto or (b) the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary from (i) their respective obligations (subject
to Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement) under the director and officer

Agreement as in effect on the date hereof or (ii) any obligation to pay to any
Person any wages or benefits arising in the Ordinary Course of Business solely

Subsidiary. The Principal Stockholder hereby expressly waives any and all
provisions, rights and benefits conferred by Â§1542 of the California Civil
Code (or any similar, comparable or equivalent provision or law of any
applicable jurisdiction) which section provides:

 



 

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

acknowledges and agrees that each investor rights, co-sale, voting and similar

thereafter, shall be of no further force or effect, (ii) waives any and all
notices, consents and approvals required to be given pursuant to any Principal

contemplated hereby or thereby, (iii) acknowledges and agrees that no breach
or default shall be deemed to have occurred under any Stockholder Agreements
by reason of the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, the
Merger Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, and (iv) subject to the effectiveness of the Closing, without
limiting the Principal StockholderÂ’s rights under the Merger Agreement,
releases the Company from any and all liabilities arising directly or
indirectly from the CompanyÂ’s obligations under any Stockholder Agreements.

by the Principal Stockholder (in which case the limitations referenced in this

The parties to this Agreement have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises with respect to any term or provision of this Agreement,

shall not affect any other term or provision of this Agreement or any other
such certificate, instrument or other document referred to in this Agreement,
and the parties to this Agreement shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to substitute one or more valid, legal and enforceable terms or
provisions into this Agreement which, insofar as practicable, implement the

held invalid or unenforceable only in part, degree or within certain
jurisdictions shall remain in full force and effect to the extent not held
invalid, illegal or unenforceable to the extent consistent with the intent of
the parties as reflected by this Agreement. To the extent permitted by

obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the parties to this
Agreement (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties to this Agreement, and any purported assignment
or other transfer without such consent shall be void and unenforceable;

Agreement, in whole or in part, from time to time to one or more of its
Affiliates; _provided_ that Buyer shall remain primarily liable for its
obligations under this Agreement and such Affiliate is subject to all of the
terms and conditions hereof. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement

privilege hereunder. Unless otherwise provided, the rights and remedies

rights or remedies which the parties to this Agreement may otherwise have at
law or in equity. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on

unconditionally submits, for itself and its assets and properties, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any Delaware State court, or Federal court of the
United States of America, sitting within the State of Delaware, and any
appellate court from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement, the agreements delivered in connection with
this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or for
recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the
parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) agrees

and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the
laying of venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware State or
Federal court and (iv) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the
defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such Delaware State or Federal court. Each of the parties to

action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.
Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably consents to service
of process in the manner provided for in the notices in Section 17(b). Nothing
in this Agreement shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to

(k) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE, IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY

WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF
THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND

THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 17(k).

 



 

(l) _Equitable Remedies_. Each of the parties to this Agreement acknowledges
and agrees that the other parties to this Agreement would be irreparably
damaged in the event that any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement are
not performed in accordance with their specific terms or otherwise are
breached. Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that (i)
the parties to this Agreement shall be entitled to obtain an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of any of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement, and to enforce specifically the performance by each other party
hereto under this Agreement and (ii) the right of specific enforcement is an
integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without
that right, no party would have entered into this Agreement. Each party to
this Agreement hereby agrees to waive the defense in any such suit that the
other parties to this Agreement have an adequate remedy at law and to
interpose no opposition, legal or otherwise, as to the propriety of injunction
or specific performance as a remedy, and hereby agrees to waive any
requirement to post any bond in connection with obtaining such relief. The
equitable remedies described in this Section 17(l) shall be in addition to,

 **FORM OF SURRENDER AND JOINDER AGREEMENT**

 



 

THIS SURRENDER AND JOINDER AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is executed and
delivered by the undersigned (the " _Option Holder_ ") for the benefit of
Agilis Biotherapeutics, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), and
PTC Therapeutics Inc., a Delaware corporation (the " _Buyer_ "), and the other
third party beneficiaries named herein.

 



 

 **RECITALS:**

 



 

A. The Company has entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
July 19, 2018 (the " _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among the Buyer, Agility
Merger Sub, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of the
Buyer (the " _Transitory Subsidiary_ "), the Company and Shareholder
Representative Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the "
_Company Equityholder Representative_ "), a copy of which is attached as
_Annex A_ hereto. All capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined in this
Agreement shall have the meanings assigned thereto in the Merger Agreement.

 



 

B. The Board of Directors of the Company has approved the Merger Agreement and
the transactions contemplated thereby, and has approved this Agreement in
connection therewith, including the treatment of Company Options set forth
therein and herein.

 



 

C. The Option Holder is a party to certain option agreement(s) (the " _Option
Agreement(s)_ ") with the Company pursuant to which the Option Holder received
the Company Options as set forth opposite the Option HolderÂ’s name on
_Schedule I_ hereto under and pursuant to the terms and conditions of the
CompanyÂ’s 2017 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the " _Company Stock Plan"_ ).

 



 

D. Under the Company Stock Plan, in the event of a Change in Control (as
defined in the Company Stock Plan), the Company may, in its sole discretion,
cancel any Company Options granted thereunder by giving notice to each holder
thereof of its intention to cancel such Company Options and permitting the
exercise of such Company Options during the thirty (30) day period next
preceding the effective date of the Change in Control of some or all of such
Company Options, including, in the BoardÂ’s discretion, some or all shares that
would not otherwise be vested and exercisable.

 



 

E. Under the Merger Agreement, effective as of the Effective Time, the Company
Options that are outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time,
whether vested or unvested, will be cancelled and the Company has provided
such notice to holders of Company Options, including the Option Holder of such
cancellation pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Company Stock Plan.

 



 

F. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, if the Option Holder executes and
delivers this Agreement and allows this Agreement to become effective, then
Option Holder shall have the right to receive with respect to Option HolderÂ’s
vested Company Options that were so cancelled at the Effective Time the
consideration as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and subject to the terms
and conditions of the Merger Agreement.

      
 

 



 

G. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, and as an inducement and condition
to the BuyerÂ’s willingness to enter into the Merger Agreement, the right of
the Option Holder to receive the consideration, if any, with respect to Option
HolderÂ’s vested Company Options that were so cancelled at the Effective Time
is conditioned upon the Option HolderÂ’s execution and delivery of this
Agreement to the Buyer and the Company.

 



 

H. Further, as an additional inducement for Option Holder to enter into this
Agreement, the Company has determined to provide such additional accelerated
vesting of Option HolderÂ’s Company Options as set forth on Schedule I (the "
_Acceleration Benefit_ "), and, subject to Option HolderÂ’s execution and
delivery of this Agreement, such Company Options eligible for the Acceleration
benefit shall be deemed to be vested Company Options effective as of
immediately prior to, but subject to the occurrence of, the Effective Time.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and other good and valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
the Option Holder hereby irrevocably agrees as follows:

 



 

1. _Cancellation of Options_. The Option Holder hereby consents to the treatment of his or her Company Options pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the Merger Agreement and acknowledges and agrees that all of the Option HolderÂ’s Company Options shall be canceled at the Effective Time in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.5 of the Merger Agreement. The Option Holder acknowledges and agrees that the Option Holder shall only receive the consideration, if any, provided pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, with respect to the Option HolderÂ’s vested Company Options (including any such Company Options eligible for the Acceleration Benefit) and only if the Option Holder executes this Agreement, and any payment of any such consideration shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement. The Option Holder agrees and acknowledges that the holderÂ’s unvested Company Options (after, if applicable, application of the Acceleration Benefit) will terminate pursuant to the Merger Agreement without any payment in exchange therefor. The Option Holder agrees and acknowledges that the Option Holder will not be entitled to receive the Acceleration Benefit unless Option Holder executes this Agreement. From and after the Effective Time, none of the Company Options of Option Holder shall remain outstanding, be in force or effect, or have any rights, including any rights set forth in the Option Agreement(s). Option Holder shall only be entitled to the payment rights (if any) available to the Option Holder under the Merger Agreement. Without limiting the foregoing, the Option Holder acknowledges that after the Closing, the Option Holder shall have no right by virtue of such Option HolderÂ’s Company Options to receive any equity, including options to acquire equity, in the Surviving Corporation, the Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. From and after the Effective Time, the Option Agreement(s) shall be, and are hereby, terminated and shall be of no further force or effect.

 



 

2. _Joinder to Merger Agreement_.

 



 

(a) The Option Holder hereby joins and agrees to be bound by Section 2.1,
Section 2.4, Section 2.6, Section 2.9, Section 3.4, Section 6.10, Article
VIII, Article IX, Article X, Article XI and Article XII of the Merger
Agreement, and all other provisions of the Merger Agreement that by their

limitations and qualifications contained in such provisions of the Merger
Agreement and herein, in each case as a Company Equityholder as if a signatory
to the Merger Agreement, and the Option Holder shall comply with, and be
subject to, all of the terms, conditions, covenants, agreements and
obligations set forth in such Relevant Provisions as a Company Equityholder,
and, without limiting the foregoing, expressly consents to the withholding of
the Escrow Amount, the Company Equityholder Representative Expense Amount, the
Holdback Amount and, if applicable, amounts from any Future Payments pursuant
to Article VIII, as contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(b) Buyer hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Option Holder shall have any
and all rights of a Company Equityholder under the Merger Agreement and all
other provisions of the Merger Agreement that by their terms purport to grant
any rights to the Company Equityholders or that are related to any such
provisions and applicable to the Company Equityholders, as if the Option
Holder were a signatory to the Merger Agreement; provided that the Company
Equityholder Representative shall have the sole authority to act for, and to
enforce the rights of, the Option Holder under the Merger Agreement in
accordance with Section 2.4 of the Merger Agreement.

 



 

3. _Representations and Warranties of Option Holder_. The Option Holder hereby represents and warrants to the Buyer, the Company and the Surviving Corporation as follows:

 



 

(a) _Ownership_. The Option Holder owns, of record and beneficially, and has
good and valid title to, the Company Options listed opposite the Option
HolderÂ’s name on Schedule I, free and clear of any Liens (except for
restrictions on transfer arising under applicable securities laws). The
Company Options constitute all Company Options owned of record, beneficially
or legally by the Option Holder, and, except for any Company Stock owned by
the Option Holder, the Option Holder has no other rights to acquire Company
Options or Company Stock. All ownership information set forth across from the
Option HolderÂ’s name on the _Schedule I_ hereto is accurate and complete.

 



 

(b) _Capacity_. The Option Holder has the legal right and capacity to hold the
Company Options listed opposite the Option HolderÂ’s name on Schedule I.

 



 

(c) _Authorization._ The Option Holder has legal capacity to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform his or her obligations hereunder and
under the Merger Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
Option Holder and, assuming that this Agreement constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Company and the Buyer, constitutes a valid and
binding obligation of the Option Holder, enforceable against the Option Holder
in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that its enforceability may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy,

 



      
 

 



 

insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting the
enforcement of creditorsÂ’ rights generally, and by general equitable
principles.

 



 

(d) _No Conflicts_. The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict
with or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material
benefit under, any provision of any loan or credit agreement, note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, lease, or other agreement, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree or Law applicable to
such Option Holder, such Option HolderÂ’s Company Options or any of such Option
HolderÂ’s properties or assets, except for any of the foregoing that would not,
individually or in the aggregate, prevent or delay the performance by such
Option Holder of any of such Option HolderÂ’s obligations hereunder. The Option
Holder is not a party to, and such Option HolderÂ’s Company Options are not
subject to or bound in any manner by, any contract or agreement relating to
such Company Options, including any voting agreement, transfer agreement, loan
agreement, option agreement, purchase agreement, stockholdersÂ’ agreement,
partnership agreement or voting trust or other similar agreement with respect
to the rights under the Company Options or the economic value thereof, that
would, individually or in the aggregate, prevent or delay the performance by
such Option Holder of any of such Option HolderÂ’s obligations hereunder.

 



 

(e) _Brokers_. No agent, broker, Person or firm acting on behalf of the Option
Holder is, or shall be, entitled to any brokerÂ’s fees, finderÂ’s fees or
commissions from the Option Holder, the Company or any of the other parties
hereto in connection with this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



 

(f) _Litigation_. There is no Legal Proceeding which is pending or has been
threatened in writing against the Option Holder that questions the validity of
this Agreement or any action taken or to be taken by the Option Holder in
connection herewith or that would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the Option HolderÂ’s ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(g) _Voting Arrangements_. Other than the Option Agreement(s) and the Company
Stock Plan, the Option Holder is not party, and none of the Company Options
(or the shares of Company Stock issuable upon exercise thereof) owned of
record, beneficially or legally by the Option Holder or which the Option
Holder has a right (contingent or otherwise) to acquire is subject, to any
voting trusts, proxies, or other contracts relating to any Company Options (or
the shares of Company Stock issuable upon exercise thereof) or rights to
acquire any such shares.

 



 

(h) _Tax Matters_. The Option Holder has had an opportunity to review with
his, her or its own Tax advisors the Tax consequences of the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. The Option Holder
understands that he or she must rely solely on its advisors and not on any
statements or representations

 



      
 

 



 

made by the Buyer, the Company or any of their agents or representatives. The
Option Holder understands that the Option Holder (and not Buyer, the Company
or the Surviving Corporation) shall be responsible for any Tax liability of
the Option Holder, including amounts withheld to satisfy applicable Taxes,
that may arise as a result of the Merger or the transactions contemplated by
the Merger Agreement.

 



 

(i) _Consents_. No consent, notice, waiver, approval, order or authorization
of, or registration, declaration or filing with, any Governmental Entity or
any third party, including under any organizational documents of the Option
Holder, any contract with the Option Holder or by which any of his or her
properties or assets may be bound or any judgment, order, decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Option Holder or any of
his or her properties or assets, is required by or with respect to the Option
Holder in connection with the execution and delivery of this Agreement and any
related agreements to which the Option Holder is a party or the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby except for such consents,
notices, waivers, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations and filings as may be required under applicable securities laws,
in each case that would not reasonably be expected to prohibit or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement, or any related agreement to which the Option Holder is a party.

 



 

(j) _Waiver of Notice_. The Option Holder hereby acknowledges that Option
Holder has received all notice required under the Company Stock Plan and any
Option Agreements and further, hereby waives any other notice rights under the
applicable Company Stock Plan(s) and any Option Agreements in connection with
the Merger, the Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby.

 



 

4. _Release of Claims_. Effective upon the Effective Time, each Option Holder, by its execution and delivery of this Agreement, hereby (a) waives any and all rights of indemnification, contribution and other similar rights against the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary (whether arising pursuant to any charter document of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary, any contract, applicable Law or otherwise) arising out of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement and/or out of the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement, and agrees that any claim of the Buyer, whether for indemnity or otherwise, may be asserted directly against the Option Holders or any Option Holders (solely to the extent, and subject to the limitations, provided in this Agreement), without any need for any claim against, or joinder of, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary and (b) forever waives, releases and discharges (and hereby agrees to cause each of its representatives to forever waive, release and discharge) with prejudice the Company, the Surviving Corporation and each Subsidiary from any and all claims, rights (including rights of indemnification, contribution and other similar rights, from whatever source, whether under contract, applicable Law or otherwise), causes of action, protests, suits, disputes, orders, obligations, debts, demands, proceedings, contracts, agreements, promises, liabilities, controversies, costs, expenses, fees (including attorneysÂ’ fees), or damages of any kind, arising by any means (including subrogation, assignment, reimbursement, operation of law or otherwise), whether known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, accrued or not

 



      
 

 



 

accrued, foreseen or unforeseen, or mature or unmature related or with respect
to, in connection with, or arising out of, directly or indirectly, any event,
fact, condition, circumstance, occurrence, act or omission that was in
existence (or that occurred or failed to occur) at or prior to the Closing;
_provided_ , _however_ , this clause (b) shall not be construed as releasing
(a) any Party from its obligations otherwise expressly set forth in this
Agreement or any agreement delivered pursuant hereto or (b) the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary from (i) their respective obligations
(subject to Section 9.2 of the Merger Agreement) under the director and
officer indemnification provisions expressly set forth in their respective
Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof or included in the
agreements listed on _Schedule 9.2_ of the Merger Agreement as in effect on
the date hereof or (ii) any obligation to pay to any Person any wages or
benefits arising in the Ordinary Course of Business solely from such PersonÂ’s
employment with the Company, the Surviving Corporation or a Subsidiary. Each
Option Holder hereby expressly waives any and all provisions, rights and
benefits conferred by Â§1542 of the California Civil Code (or any similar,
comparable or equivalent provision or law of any applicable jurisdiction)
which section provides:

 



 

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

 



 

5. _Stockholders Agreement_. The Option Holder covenants and agrees that if the Option Holder acquires any shares of Company Stock after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Option Holder shall, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours after such acquisition, execute and deliver to the Company and the Buyer a Stockholders Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Annex B_ with respect to such shares of Company Stock.

 



 

6. _Proprietary Information_ _._

but not limited to: (i) specifications, manuals, software in various stages of
development, and other technical data; (ii) customer and prospect lists,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Option Holder shall have no obligation
hereunder to keep confidential any such information to the extent disclosure

extent required for, enforcement of rights under the Merger Agreement. Nothing
in this Agreement shall (A) be deemed to prohibit the Option Holder from
disclosing the fact that discussions regarding the Merger have taken place or
that the Merger has occurred to the Option HolderÂ’s immediate family members
who have agreed to hold such information in confidence or (B) limit or
interfere with Option HolderÂ’s right, without notice to or authorization of

(i) This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out of or related
hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or to the inducement of any
party to enter herein, whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) shall be
governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation, and effect, by
and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware
(including in respect of the statute of limitations or other limitations
period applicable to any claim, controversy or dispute, in each case, which
statute of limitations or other limitations the parties hereby agree to modify
as set forth in Section 8.3 of the Merger Agreement) without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws
of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

 



 

(ii) Each of the parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding

waives any right it may have to a trial by jury

 



      
 

 



 

with respect to any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum
to the maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond,
surety or other security that might be required of any other party with
respect thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending
or delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address
and in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 10(e)_.
Nothing in this _Section 10(c)(ii)_, however, shall affect the right of any
party to serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(d) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of
Law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without the prior written
consent of each other party hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this
Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable
by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section 10(d)_ shall be
null and void.

 



 

(e) _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under

personally delivered, when delivered, (a) if to the Buyer or the Company
(prior to the Closing), as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (b) if to
the Option Holder, as set forth on the applicable signature page hereto.

 



 

(f) _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement, the Merger
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the other agreements
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits
hereto and thereto and the Confidentiality Agreement) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof or thereof can be waived,
only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement or such
other agreements contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as applicable, signed
by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement
or any other agreements contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate

 



       
 

 



 

or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a
waiver of any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party
to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. This
Agreement shall terminate upon any termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(g) _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without
posting a bond or undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to
which they are entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that
it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and
other equitable relief on the basis that (i) the party seeking such remedy has
an adequate remedy at Law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, the rights and
remedies available to the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Company
Equityholder Representative in connection with a breach or threatened breach
of this Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive, and the exercise by any of
them of any such right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other
rights or remedies that may now or subsequently be available, whether pursuant
to applicable Law, contract or otherwise, and nothing herein or in the Merger
Agreement shall be construed to limit any such right or remedy.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. All payments to be made with respect to any Company
Options shall be subject to applicable federal, state and local income or
other taxes required to be withheld from the payments and any other required
payroll deductions. The Company and Buyer make no representation as to the tax
consequences to the Option Holder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, which shall be the sole responsibility of
the Option Holder.

 



 

(i) _No Contract for Continuing Services_. Neither this Agreement not the
Merger Agreement shall be construed as creating any contract for continued
services between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and any
Option Holder, and nothing herein contained shall give Option Holder the right
to be retained as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates.

 



 

(j) _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares

 



      
 

 



 

that any term or provision hereof is invalid or unenforceable, the parties
hereto agree that the court making such determination shall have the power to
limit the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to
replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or
provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes closest to expressing
the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this
Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the event such court does
not exercise the power granted to it in the prior sentence, the parties hereto
agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid
and enforceable term or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible,
the economic, business and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable
term.

 

       
 

 



 

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Agreement on the date
set forth below, it being understood that this Agreement shall be irrevocable.

I, the undersigned spouse of the Option Holder named above, acknowledge that I

Agreement to which this Spousal Consent is attached and the related Merger
Agreement relating to the disposition of Company Options and the release of
certain claims, in each case including any interest I have therein. I hereby
agree that my interest, if any, in any such Company Options and/or claims
shall be irrevocably bound by the Surrender and Joinder Agreement and further
understand and agree that any community property interest I may have therein

I am aware that the legal, financial and related matters contained in the

respect to this Spousal Consent. I have either sought such guidance or counsel
or determined after reviewing the Surrender and Joinder Agreement and the
related Merger Agreement carefully that I will waive such right.

"A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT KNOW
OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE RELEASE,
WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

The Warrant Holder covenants and agrees that if the Warrant Holder acquires any shares of Company Stock after the date of this Agreement and prior to the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Warrant Holder shall, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 24 hours after such acquisition, execute and deliver to the Company and the Buyer a Stockholders Agreement in the form attached hereto as _Annex B_ with respect to such shares of Company Stock.

 



 

16. _Proprietary Information_ _._

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, the Warrant Holder shall not, and shall not
permit its controlled Affiliates to, disclose or make use of any information
relating to the business of the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Subsidiaries that is not generally known by, nor easily learned or determined
by, persons outside the Company (collectively referred to herein as "
_Proprietary Information_ ") including, but not limited to: (i)
specifications, manuals, software in various stages of development, and other
technical data; (ii) customer and prospect lists, details of agreements and
communications with customers and prospects, and other customer information;
(iii) sales plans and projections, product pricing information, protocols,
acquisition, expansion, marketing, financial and other business information
and existing and future products and business plans and strategies; (iv) sales
proposals, demonstrations systems, sales material; (v) research and
development; (vi) software systems, computer programs and source codes; (vii)
sources of supply; (viii) identity of specialized consultants and contractors
and Proprietary Information; (ix) purchasing, operating and other cost data;
(x) special customer needs, cost and pricing data; and (xi) employee
information (including personnel, payroll, compensation and benefit data and
plans), including all such information recorded in manuals, memoranda,
projections, reports, minutes, plans, drawings, sketches, designs, data,
specifications, software programs and records, whether or not legended or
otherwise identified as Proprietary Information, as well as such information
that is the subject of meetings and discussions and not recorded. Proprietary
Information shall not include such information that the Warrant Holder can
demonstrate (A) is generally available to the public (other than as a result
of a disclosure by the Warrant Holder in violation of the terms of this
Agreement or other obligation owed to Buyer), (B) was disclosed to the Warrant
Holder by a third party under no obligation to keep such information
confidential, or (C) was independently developed by the Warrant Holder without
reference to Proprietary Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Warrant Holder shall have no obligation hereunder to keep confidential any of
the Proprietary Information to the extent disclosure thereof is required by
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event

 



      
 

 



 

disclosure is required by Law, the Warrant Holder shall use its Reasonable
Best Efforts to provide the Buyer with prompt advance notice of such
requirement so that the Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order.

 



 

(b) From and after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Warrant
Holder agrees that such Warrant Holder shall not, and such Warrant Holder
agrees not to permit such Warrant HolderÂ’s controlled Affiliates to, directly
or indirectly, disclose the existence or terms of this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement or any other agreement contemplated thereby or any information
regarding the negotiation hereof or thereof except to the extent such
information is generally known to the public (other than as a result of a
disclosure by the Warrant Holder or an Affiliate thereof in violation of this
Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, such Warrant Holder shall have no
obligation hereunder to keep confidential any such information to the extent
disclosure thereof (x) is required by Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that in
the event disclosure is required by Law, such Warrant Holder shall use best
efforts to provide Buyer with prompt advance notice of such requirement so
that Buyer may seek an appropriate protective order or (y)(i) is to the
Warrant HolderÂ’s legal counsel and tax and accounting advisors subject to
professional or contractual confidentiality obligations or otherwise to the
extent required for the preparation of any Tax Return, or (ii) is in
connection with, and only to the extent required for, enforcement of rights or
defense of claims under the Merger Agreement or this Agreement. Nothing in
this Agreement shall (A) be deemed to prohibit the Warrant Holder from
disclosing the fact that discussions regarding the Merger have taken place or
that the Merger has occurred to the Warrant HolderÂ’s immediate family members
who are required to hold such information in confidence or (B) limit or
interfere with the Warrant HolderÂ’s right, if required by Law, without notice
to or authorization of the Company, to communicate in good faith with any
Governmental Entity for the purpose of reporting a possible violation of Law,
or to participate in any investigation or proceeding that may be conducted by
any Governmental Entity, including by providing documents or other
information, or for the purpose of filing a charge or complaint with a
Governmental Entity.

 



 

(c) The Warrant Holder agrees that the remedy at Law for any breach of this
_Section 6_ would be inadequate and that the Buyer shall be entitled to
injunctive relief, without the requirement of posting any bond or other
security, in addition to any other remedy it may have upon breach of any
provision of this _Section 6_.

 



 

17. _Public Disclosure_. The Warrant Holder shall not, directly or indirectly, issue any press release or public announcement or otherwise make any statement or communication to any third party, in each case relating to the subject matter of this Agreement and the Merger Agreement without the prior written approval of the Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Warrant Holder may make any public disclosure that is required by applicable Law (in which case the Warrant Holder shall, at least 24 hours prior to the issuance thereof, consult with the Buyer as to contents and timing thereof and furnish the Buyer with the text of the proposed disclosure or statement prior to

 



      
 

 



 

making such disclosure or statement, in each case to the extent permitted by
applicable Law); _provided_ , _further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing herein shall limit the ability of the Warrant Holder to disclose, on a
confidential basis, the subject matter of this Agreement and the Merger
Agreement to his or her legal, financial and tax advisors on a confidential
basis.

 



 

18. _Acknowledgement and Agreement to be Bound by the Provisions of the Merger Agreement_

 



 

The Warrant Holder understands, acknowledges and agrees to the following:

 



 

(a) between the date of the Merger Agreement and the Effective Time, the
Warrant Holder shall not sell, pledge, hypothecate or otherwise transfer, or
agree to do any of the foregoing in respect of, his or her Company Warrants or
any shares of Company Stock issued upon the exercise of Company Warrants or
otherwise exercise any of Warrant HolderÂ’s Company Warrants;

 



 

(b) the deposit with the Escrow Agent of a portion of the Aggregate Closing

Equityholders under the Merger Agreement and to satisfy, in accordance with
the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, obligations owed to the Buyer
from and after the Closing Date;

 



 

(c) that the Warrant Holder shall only be entitled to receive distributions
with respect to the Escrow Amount, if, and to the extent that, any portion of

20. _Miscellaneous_

 



 

(a) _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original but all of which together shall be

counterpart. This Agreement

 



      
 

 



 

may be executed and delivered by facsimile or by an electronic scan delivered
by electronic transmission.

 



 

(b) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement (including the exhibits
hereto) is not intended to, and shall not, confer upon any other Person any

Parties are intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement and shall be
entitled to enforce this Agreement against the undersigned in accordance with
its terms.

 



 

(c) _Governing Law; Jurisdiction and Venue; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 



 

(i) This Agreement (and any claims or disputes arising out of or related
hereto or the transactions contemplated hereby or to the inducement of any
party to enter herein, whether for breach of contract, tortious conduct or
otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute or otherwise) shall be
governed in all respects, including validity, interpretation, and effect, by
and construed in accordance with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware
(including in respect of the statute of limitations or other limitations
period applicable to any claim, controversy or dispute, in each case, which
statute of limitations or other limitations the parties hereby agree to modify
as set forth in Section 8.3 of the Merger Agreement) without giving effect to
any choice or conflict of Law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of Laws
of any jurisdictions other than those of the State of Delaware.

 



 

(ii) Each of the parties to this Agreement (a) consents to submit itself to
the exclusive personal jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware, New Castle County, or, if that court does not have jurisdiction, a
federal court sitting in Wilmington, Delaware in any action or proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such
action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees
that it shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by
motion or other request for leave from any such court, (d) agrees not to bring
any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court, and (e)
waives any right it may have to a trial by jury with respect to any action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement. Each of the parties
hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any
action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety or other security
that might be required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party
hereto may make service on another party by sending or delivering a copy of
the process to the party to be served at the address and in the manner
provided for the giving of notices in _Section 10(e)_. Nothing in this
_Section 10(c)(ii)_, however, shall affect the right of any party to serve
legal process in any other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(d) _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of
Law or otherwise,

 



      
 

 



 

by any of the parties hereto without the prior written consent of each other
party hereto. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this _Section 10(d)_ shall be null and void.

 



 

(e) _Notices_. All notices, requests, demands and other communications under
this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given
or made and received as follows: (i) if sent by registered or certified mail
in the United States return receipt requested, upon receipt, (ii) if sent by
nationally recognized overnight air courier, one (1) Business Day after
mailing, (iii) if sent by facsimile transmission, with a copy mailed on the
same day in the manner provided in clauses (i) or (ii) of this Section 10(e)
when transmitted and receipt is confirmed and (iv) if otherwise actually
personally delivered, when delivered, (a) if to the Buyer or the Company
(prior to the Closing), as set forth in the Merger Agreement, and (b) if to
the Warrant Holder, as set forth on the applicable signature page hereto.

 



 

(f) _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement, the Merger
Agreement, the Company Disclosure Schedule and the other agreements
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits
hereto and thereto and the Confidentiality Agreement) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof
and thereof and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof, and can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof or thereof can be waived,
only by written instrument making specific reference to this Agreement or such
other agreements contemplated by the Merger Agreement, as applicable, signed
by the party against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement
or any other agreements contemplated by the Merger Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy. This
Agreement shall terminate upon any termination of the Merger Agreement in
accordance with the terms thereof.

 



 

(g) _Specific Enforcement_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions

 



       
 

 



 

to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms
and provisions of this Agreement, in each case without posting a bond or
undertaking, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will not
oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable
relief on the basis that (i) the party seeking such remedy has an adequate
remedy at Law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at Law or equity. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in the Merger Agreement or this Agreement, the rights and remedies
available to the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation and the Company Equityholder
Representative in connection with a breach or threatened breach of this
Agreement are cumulative and not exclusive, and the exercise by any of them of
any such right or remedy shall not preclude the exercise of any other rights
or remedies that may now or subsequently be available, whether pursuant to
applicable Law, contract or otherwise, and nothing herein or in the Merger
Agreement shall be construed to limit any such right or remedy.

 



 

(h) _Withholding Taxes_. All payments to be made with respect to any Company
Warrants shall be subject to applicable federal, state and local income or
other taxes required to be withheld from the payments and any other required
payroll deductions. The Company and Buyer make no representation as to the tax
consequences to the Warrant Holder of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Merger Agreement, which shall be the sole responsibility of
the Warrant Holder.

 



 

(i) _No Contract for Continuing Services_. Neither this Agreement not the
Merger Agreement shall be construed as creating any contract for continued
services between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and any
Warrant Holder, and nothing herein contained shall give Warrant Holder the
right to be retained as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or Affiliates.

 



 

(j) _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid or
unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 **SPOUSAL CONSENT (IF APPLICABLE)**

 



 

I, the undersigned spouse of the Warrant Holder named above, acknowledge that
I have read and am familiar with the contents of the Surrender and Joinder
Agreement to which this Spousal Consent is attached and the related Merger
Agreement relating to the disposition of Company Warrants and the release of
certain claims, in each case including any interest I have therein. I hereby
agree that my interest, if any, in any such Company Warrants and/or claims
shall be irrevocably bound by the Surrender and Joinder Agreement and further
understand and agree that any community property interest I may have therein
shall be similarly bound by the Surrender and Joinder Agreement.

 



 

I am aware that the legal, financial and related matters contained in the
Surrender and Joinder Agreement and the related Merger Agreement are complex
and that I am free to seek independent professional guidance or counsel with
respect to this Spousal Consent. I have either sought such guidance or counsel
or determined after reviewing the Surrender and Joinder Agreement and the
related Merger Agreement carefully that I will waive such right.

individually as an " ** _Interested Party_** ," or collectively as the " **
_Interested Parties_** ," and any such contract or transaction is referred to
herein as an " ** _Interested Party Transaction_** "), shall be void or
voidable solely for that reason, or solely because the director or officer is
present at or participates in the meeting of the Board which authorized the
Interested Party Transaction or solely because the vote of any such director
is counted for such purpose, if: (i) the material facts as to the relationship
or interest and as to the Interested Party Transaction are disclosed or are
known to the Board, and the Board in good faith authorizes the Interested
Party Transaction by affirmative votes of a majority of the disinterested

 **SECTION 262**

 



 

 **262\. Appraisal rights.**

 



 

(a) Any stockholder of a corporation of this State who holds shares of stock
on the date of the making of a demand pursuant to subsection (d) of this
section with respect to such shares, who continuously holds such shares
through the effective date of the merger or consolidation, who has otherwise
complied with subsection (d) of this section and who has neither voted in
favor of the merger or consolidation nor consented thereto in writing pursuant
to Â§ 228 of this title shall be entitled to an appraisal by the Court of
Chancery of the fair value of the stockholderÂ’s shares of stock under the
circumstances described in subsections (b) and (c) of this section. As used in
this section, the word "stockholder" means a holder of record of stock in a
corporation; the words "stock" and "share" mean and include what is ordinarily
meant by those words; and the words "depository receipt" mean a receipt or
other instrument issued by a depository representing an interest in 1 or more
shares, or fractions thereof, solely of stock of a corporation, which stock is
deposited with the depository.

 



 

(b) Appraisal rights shall be available for the shares of any class or series
of stock of a constituent corporation in a merger or consolidation to be
effected pursuant to Â§ 251 (other than a merger effected pursuant to Â§ 251(g)
of this title and, subject to paragraph (b)(3) of this section, Â§ 251(h) of
this title), Â§ 252, Â§ 254, Â§ 255, Â§ 256, Â§ 257, Â§ 258, Â§ 263 or Â§ 264 of this
title:

 



 

(1) Provided, however, that, except as expressly provided in Â§ 363(b) of this
title, no appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the
shares of any class or series of stock, which stock, or depository receipts in
respect thereof, at the record date fixed to determine the stockholders
entitled to receive notice of the meeting of stockholders to act upon the
agreement of merger or consolidation, were either: (i) listed on a national
securities exchange or (ii) held of record by more than 2,000 holders; and
further provided that no appraisal rights shall be available for any shares of
stock of the constituent corporation surviving a merger if the merger did not
require for its approval the vote of the stockholders of the surviving
corporation as provided in Â§ 251(f) of this title.

 



 

(2) Notwithstanding paragraph (b)(1) of this section, appraisal rights under
this section shall be available for the shares of any class or series of stock
of a constituent corporation if the holders thereof are required by the terms
of an agreement of merger or consolidation pursuant to Â§Â§ 251, 252, 254, 255,
256, 257, 258, 263 and 264 of this title to accept for such stock anything
except:

 



 

a. Shares of stock of the corporation surviving or resulting from such merger
or consolidation, or depository receipts in respect thereof;

 



 

b. Shares of stock of any other corporation, or depository receipts in respect
thereof, which shares of stock (or depository receipts in respect thereof) or
depository receipts at the effective date of the merger or consolidation will
be either listed on a national securities exchange or held of record by more
than 2,000 holders;

 



 

c. Cash in lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts
described in the foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a. and b. of this section; or

 



 

d. Any combination of the shares of stock, depository receipts and cash in
lieu of fractional shares or fractional depository receipts described in the
foregoing paragraphs (b)(2)a., b. and c. of this section.

      
 

 



 

(3) In the event all of the stock of a subsidiary Delaware corporation party
to a merger effected under Â§ 251(h), Â§ 253 or Â§ 267 of this title is not owned
by the parent immediately prior to the merger, appraisal rights shall be
available for the shares of the subsidiary Delaware corporation.

 



 

(4) In the event of an amendment to a corporationÂ’s certificate of
incorporation contemplated by Â§ 363(a) of this title, appraisal rights shall
be available as contemplated by Â§ 363(b) of this title, and the procedures of
this section, including those set forth in subsections (d) and (e) of this
section, shall apply as nearly as practicable, with the word "amendment"
substituted for the words "merger or consolidation," and the word
"corporation" substituted for the words "constituent corporation" and/or
"surviving or resulting corporation."

 



 

(c) Any corporation may provide in its certificate of incorporation that
appraisal rights under this section shall be available for the shares of any
class or series of its stock as a result of an amendment to its certificate of
incorporation, any merger or consolidation in which the corporation is a
constituent corporation or the sale of all or substantially all of the assets
of the corporation. If the certificate of incorporation contains such a
provision, the provisions of this section, including those set forth in
subsections (d), (e), and (g) of this section, shall apply as nearly as is
practicable.

 



 

(d) Appraisal rights shall be perfected as follows:

 



 

(1) If a proposed merger or consolidation for which appraisal rights are
provided under this section is to be submitted for approval at a meeting of
stockholders, the corporation, not less than 20 days prior to the meeting,
shall notify each of its stockholders who was such on the record date for
notice of such meeting (or such members who received notice in accordance with
Â§ 255(c) of this title) with respect to shares for which appraisal rights are
available pursuant to subsection (b) or (c) of this section that appraisal
rights are available for any or all of the shares of the constituent
corporations, and shall include in such notice a copy of this section and, if
1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock corporation, a copy of Â§ 114
of this title. Each stockholder electing to demand the appraisal of such
stockholderÂ’s shares shall deliver to the corporation, before the taking of
the vote on the merger or consolidation, a written demand for appraisal of
such stockholderÂ’s shares. Such demand will be sufficient if it reasonably
informs the corporation of the identity of the stockholder and that the
stockholder intends thereby to demand the appraisal of such stockholderÂ’s
shares. A proxy or vote against the merger or consolidation shall not
constitute such a demand. A stockholder electing to take such action must do
so by a separate written demand as herein provided. Within 10 days after the
effective date of such merger or consolidation, the surviving or resulting
corporation shall notify each stockholder of each constituent corporation who
has complied with this subsection and has not voted in favor of or consented
to the merger or consolidation of the date that the merger or consolidation
has become effective; or

 



 

(2) If the merger or consolidation was approved pursuant to Â§ 228, Â§ 251(h), Â§
253, or Â§ 267 of this title, then either a constituent corporation before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation or the surviving or resulting
corporation within 10 days thereafter shall notify each of the holders of any
class or series of stock of such constituent corporation who are entitled to
appraisal rights of the approval of the merger or consolidation and that
appraisal rights are available for any or all shares of such class or series
of stock of such constituent corporation, and shall include in such notice a
copy of this section and, if 1 of the constituent corporations is a nonstock
corporation, a copy of Â§ 114 of this title. Such notice may, and, if given on
or after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, shall, also notify
such stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation. Any
stockholder entitled to appraisal rights may, within 20 days after the date of
mailing of such notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to Â§
251(h) of this title, within the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by Â§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days after the date of mailing
of such notice, demand in writing from the

      
 

 



 

surviving or resulting corporation the appraisal of such holderÂ’s shares. Such
demand will be sufficient if it reasonably informs the corporation of the
identity of the stockholder and that the stockholder intends thereby to demand
the appraisal of such holderÂ’s shares. If such notice did not notify
stockholders of the effective date of the merger or consolidation, either (i)
each such constituent corporation shall send a second notice before the
effective date of the merger or consolidation notifying each of the holders of
any class or series of stock of such constituent corporation that are entitled
to appraisal rights of the effective date of the merger or consolidation or
(ii) the surviving or resulting corporation shall send such a second notice to
all such holders on or within 10 days after such effective date; provided,
however, that if such second notice is sent more than 20 days following the
sending of the first notice or, in the case of a merger approved pursuant to Â§
251(h) of this title, later than the later of the consummation of the offer
contemplated by Â§ 251(h) of this title and 20 days following the sending of
the first notice, such second notice need only be sent to each stockholder who
is entitled to appraisal rights and who has demanded appraisal of such
holderÂ’s shares in accordance with this subsection. An affidavit of the
secretary or assistant secretary or of the transfer agent of the corporation
that is required to give either notice that such notice has been given shall,
in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.
For purposes of determining the stockholders entitled to receive either
notice, each constituent corporation may fix, in advance, a record date that
shall be not more than 10 days prior to the date the notice is given,
provided, that if the notice is given on or after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, the record date shall be such effective date. If no
record date is fixed and the notice is given prior to the effective date, the
record date shall be the close of business on the day next preceding the day
on which the notice is given.

 



 

(e) Within 120 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation,
the surviving or resulting corporation or any stockholder who has complied
with subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof and who is otherwise
entitled to appraisal rights, may commence an appraisal proceeding by filing a
petition in the Court of Chancery demanding a determination of the value of
the stock of all such stockholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time
within 60 days after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, any
stockholder who has not commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that
proceeding as a named party shall have the right to withdraw such
stockholderÂ’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms offered upon the
merger or consolidation. Within 120 days after the effective date of the
merger or consolidation, any stockholder who has complied with the
requirements of subsections (a) and (d) of this section hereof, upon written
request, shall be entitled to receive from the corporation surviving the
merger or resulting from the consolidation a statement setting forth the
aggregate number of shares not voted in favor of the merger or consolidation
and with respect to which demands for appraisal have been received and the
aggregate number of holders of such shares. Such written statement shall be
mailed to the stockholder within 10 days after such stockholderÂ’s written
request for such a statement is received by the surviving or resulting
corporation or within 10 days after expiration of the period for delivery of
demands for appraisal under subsection (d) of this section hereof, whichever
is later. Notwithstanding subsection (a) of this section, a person who is the
beneficial owner of shares of such stock held either in a voting trust or by a
nominee on behalf of such person may, in such personÂ’s own name, file a
petition or request from the corporation the statement described in this
subsection.

 



 

(f) Upon the filing of any such petition by a stockholder, service of a copy
thereof shall be made upon the surviving or resulting corporation, which shall
within 20 days after such service file in the office of the Register in
Chancery in which the petition was filed a duly verified list containing the
names and addresses of all stockholders who have demanded payment for their
shares and with whom agreements as to the value of their shares have not been
reached by the surviving or resulting corporation. If the petition shall be
filed by the surviving or resulting corporation, the petition shall be
accompanied by such a duly verified list. The Register in Chancery, if so
ordered by the Court, shall give notice of the time and place fixed for the
hearing of such petition by registered or certified mail to the surviving or
resulting corporation and to the stockholders shown on the list at the
addresses therein stated. Such notice shall also be given by 1 or more
publications at least 1 week before the day of the hearing, in a newspaper of

      
 

 



 

general circulation published in the City of Wilmington, Delaware or such
publication as the Court deems advisable. The forms of the notices by mail and
by publication shall be approved by the Court, and the costs thereof shall be
borne by the surviving or resulting corporation.

 



 

(g) At the hearing on such petition, the Court shall determine the
stockholders who have complied with this section and who have become entitled
to appraisal rights. The Court may require the stockholders who have demanded
an appraisal for their shares and who hold stock represented by certificates
to submit their certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery for notation
thereon of the pendency of the appraisal proceedings; and if any stockholder
fails to comply with such direction, the Court may dismiss the proceedings as
to such stockholder. If immediately before the merger or consolidation the
shares of the class or series of stock of the constituent corporation as to
which appraisal rights are available were listed on a national securities
exchange, the Court shall dismiss the proceedings as to all holders of such
shares who are otherwise entitled to appraisal rights unless (1) the total
number of shares entitled to appraisal exceeds 1% of the outstanding shares of
the class or series eligible for appraisal, (2) the value of the consideration
provided in the merger or consolidation for such total number of shares
exceeds $1 million, or (3) the merger was approved pursuant to Â§ 253 or Â§ 267
of this title.

 



 

(h) After the Court determines the stockholders entitled to an appraisal, the
appraisal proceeding shall be conducted in accordance with the rules of the
Court of Chancery, including any rules specifically governing appraisal
proceedings. Through such proceeding the Court shall determine the fair value
of the shares exclusive of any element of value arising from the
accomplishment or expectation of the merger or consolidation, together with
interest, if any, to be paid upon the amount determined to be the fair value.
In determining such fair value, the Court shall take into account all relevant
factors. Unless the Court in its discretion determines otherwise for good
cause shown, and except as provided in this subsection, interest from the
effective date of the merger through the date of payment of the judgment shall
be compounded quarterly and shall accrue at 5% over the Federal Reserve
discount rate (including any surcharge) as established from time to time
during the period between the effective date of the merger and the date of
payment of the judgment. At any time before the entry of judgment in the
proceedings, the surviving corporation may pay to each stockholder entitled to
appraisal an amount in cash, in which case interest shall accrue thereafter as
provided herein only upon the sum of (1) the difference, if any, between the
amount so paid and the fair value of the shares as determined by the Court,
and (2) interest theretofore accrued, unless paid at that time. Upon
application by the surviving or resulting corporation or by any stockholder
entitled to participate in the appraisal proceeding, the Court may, in its
discretion, proceed to trial upon the appraisal prior to the final
determination of the stockholders entitled to an appraisal. Any stockholder
whose name appears on the list filed by the surviving or resulting corporation
pursuant to subsection (f) of this section and who has submitted such
stockholderÂ’s certificates of stock to the Register in Chancery, if such is
required, may participate fully in all proceedings until it is finally
determined that such stockholder is not entitled to appraisal rights under
this section.

 



 

(i) The Court shall direct the payment of the fair value of the shares,
together with interest, if any, by the surviving or resulting corporation to
the stockholders entitled thereto. Payment shall be so made to each such
stockholder, in the case of holders of uncertificated stock forthwith, and the
case of holders of shares represented by certificates upon the surrender to
the corporation of the certificates representing such stock. The CourtÂ’s
decree may be enforced as other decrees in the Court of Chancery may be
enforced, whether such surviving or resulting corporation be a corporation of
this State or of any state.

 



 

(j) The costs of the proceeding may be determined by the Court and taxed upon
the parties as the Court deems equitable in the circumstances. Upon
application of a stockholder, the Court may order all or a portion of the
expenses incurred by any stockholder in connection with the appraisal
proceeding, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneyÂ’s fees and the
fees and expenses of experts, to be charged pro rata against the value of all
the shares entitled to an appraisal.

      
 

 



 

(k) From and after the effective date of the merger or consolidation, no
stockholder who has demanded appraisal rights as provided in subsection (d) of
this section shall be entitled to vote such stock for any purpose or to
receive payment of dividends or other distributions on the stock (except
dividends or other distributions payable to stockholders of record at a date
which is prior to the effective date of the merger or consolidation);
provided, however, that if no petition for an appraisal shall be filed within
the time provided in subsection (e) of this section, or if such stockholder
shall deliver to the surviving or resulting corporation a written withdrawal
of such stockholderÂ’s demand for an appraisal and an acceptance of the merger
or consolidation, either within 60 days after the effective date of the merger
or consolidation as provided in subsection (e) of this section or thereafter
with the written approval of the corporation, then the right of such
stockholder to an appraisal shall cease. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
appraisal proceeding in the Court of Chancery shall be dismissed as to any
stockholder without the approval of the Court, and such approval may be
conditioned upon such terms as the Court deems just; provided, however that
this provision shall not affect the right of any stockholder who has not
commenced an appraisal proceeding or joined that proceeding as a named party
to withdraw such stockholderÂ’s demand for appraisal and to accept the terms
offered upon the merger or consolidation within 60 days after the effective
date of the merger or consolidation, as set forth in subsection (e) of this
section.

 



 

(l) The shares of the surviving or resulting corporation to which the shares
of such objecting stockholders would have been converted had they assented to
the merger or consolidation shall have the status of authorized and unissued
shares of the surviving or resulting corporation.

If you elect not to exercise your Company Options and, prior to the Exercise
Deadline, you execute and deliver to the Company a copy of the Surrender and
Joinder Agreement attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto (the " ** _Surrender
Agreement_** "), then in respect of all your Company Options that were vested
and exercisable, but unexercised effective as of the Effective Time, you shall
receive the cash consideration described in the Surrender Agreement and the
Merger Agreement. Further, as an additional inducement for you to enter into
the Surrender Agreement, the Company has determined to provide such additional
accelerated vesting of your Company Options as set forth on _Exhibit A_
hereto (the " ** _Acceleration Benefit_** "), and, subject to your execution

be eligible for the Acceleration Benefit if you sign the Surrender _**

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _Agreement. Your Company Options will not be eligible for the Acceleration
Benefit if you elect to exercise your Company Options rather than execute and
deliver a copy of the Surrender Agreement. Further, only your Company Options
that (i) are currently vested, (ii) would have otherwise vested pursuant to
their terms prior to the Exercise Deadline or (iii) are entitled to the
Acceleration Benefit will be entitled to the cash consideration described in
the Surrender Agreement and the Merger Agreement; any other Company Options
that you hold will be cancelled in exchange for no consideration and you will
have no further rights with respect thereto._**

 



 

If you do elect to exercise your vested Company Options instead of executing
the Surrender Agreement or allowing your Company Options to terminate and
expire, you may do so by delivering an exercise notice in the form provided by
the Company and paying to the Company the exercise price thereof, subject to
your satisfaction of all other terms and conditions applicable to the exercise
of a Company Option under the Company Stock Plan (including making adequate
accommodation for payment of any applicable withholding taxes) all prior to
the Exercise Deadline. You may only elect to exercise your Company Options
that will have vested in accordance with their original vesting schedule on or
before the Exercise Deadline; the Acceleration Benefit will not apply to the
Company Options that you elect to exercise. **_ All documentation and payments
with respect to any exercise of Company Options must be completed in full and
delivered prior to the Exercise Deadline in order to be effective_**. Such
exercise shall be effective immediately prior to the Effective Time. Upon any
such exercise, you will receive and will be required to execute additional
documentation required of holders of the CompanyÂ’s common stock in connection
with the Merger. If you elect to exercise any Company Options, you will
participate in the Merger as a stockholder of the Company and will receive
additional information regarding your rights and obligations as a stockholder
in the Merger under separate cover.

financial advisor to understand the impact on your personal financial
situation. However, if you should have any questions about this notice, the

Delaware corporation and a wholly owned indirect subsidiary of the Buyer (the
" ** _Transitory Subsidiary_** "), the Company and Shareholder Representative
Services LLC, a Colorado limited liability company (the " ** _Company
Equityholder Representative_** "). The Company expects the transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement (the " ** _Merger_** ") to close prior to
August [ ] (such date the Merger closes, the " ** _Closing Date_** ").

 



 

You are receiving this notice because you currently hold outstanding warrants

_Company Warrant_** " and, you, in your capacity as a holder of Company
Warrants, a " ** _Warrant Holder_** ") as set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto.

 



 

The Merger will constitute a "Change of Control" as such term is defined in
the Company Warrants, and under the Merger Agreement, none of the Buyer, the
Transitory Subsidiary or their affiliates will assume or continue any Company
Warrants. Under Section 1.2 of the Company Warrants, in the event of a Change
of Control, the Company Warrants and the purchase rights thereunder will lapse
completely, and the Company Warrants will be of no further force or effect.

 



 

 ** _This notice constitutes notice under the Company Warrants of termination
of your Company Warrants. You shall be permitted to exercise your Company
Warrants to the extent outstanding and exercisable through _11:59 p.m.
Eastern time on [ ]_ (the "Exercise Deadline"). If you do not exercise your
Company Warrants prior to the Exercise Deadline, then except as specifically
set forth below, your Company Warrants will terminate and no consideration
will be paid to you therefor and you shall have no further rights with respect
thereto._**

Agreement and the Merger Agreement. **_Further, only your Company Warrants
that are currently exercisable will be entitled to the cash consideration
described in the Surrender Agreement and the Merger Agreement._**

Surrender Agreement or allowing your Company Warrants to terminate and expire,
you may do so by delivering an exercise notice in the form provided by the
Company and paying to the Company the exercise price thereof, subject to your
satisfaction of all other terms and conditions applicable to the exercise of a
Company Warrant under the terms of such Company Warrant all prior to the
Exercise Deadline. **_ All documentation and payments with respect to any
exercise of Company Warrants must be completed in full and delivered prior to

and obligations as a stockholder in the Merger under separate cover.

understand the impact of the Merger on your Company Warrants, we are not able
to provide financial or tax advice and we suggest you meet with a tax or
financial advisor to understand the impact on your personal financial
situation. However, if you should have any questions about this notice, the
