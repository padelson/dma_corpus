set out on _Schedule 3.1(a)_.

 

(b) The initial closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Initial Closing_ ") with respect thereto shall be held at the offices of
Polsinelli P.C., 401 Commerce Street, Suite 900, Nashville, TN 37219, at 10:00
a.m. local time, on August 31, 2017, for (i) all Purchased Assets and Real
Property related to Facilities for which the Closing Conditions have been
fulfilled, and (ii) to the extent allowed by Law, the Real Property for any
Facilities (and Purchased Assets other than Licenses and

 



17  provider agreements) where the only remaining unfulfilled Closing Condition
(other than conditions that by their terms will be satisfied at the Closings)
is the issuance of a License required by  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(v)_ to
operate, with the applicable OTA Transferee entering into an Interim
Management Agreement and Interim Sublease for such Facilities (collectively,
the date on which (i) and (ii) occur being the " _Initial Closing Date_ ");
_provided, however,_ that except with respect to any Initial Closing occurring
on December 31, 2017 such Closing shall not include any Facility where the
parties do not have adequate assurance on or prior to the twentieth (20th)
day of the month that any required third party consent will be obtained on or
prior to Closing.

 

(c) Following the Initial Closing, the Parties shall have subsequent
closings (each, a " _Subsequent Closing_ " and collectively, " _Subsequent
Closings_ ") at the end of each successive month for any Facilities which were
not included in the Initial Closing and which would be eligible under
_Sections 3.1(b)(_ _i_ _) or 3.1(b)(ii)_ if the Initial Closing Date were the
end of the relevant successive month (in each instance, the date on which a
Subsequent Closing occurs, the " _Subsequent Closing Date_ "); _provided,
however_ , that such Subsequent Closing shall not include any Facility where
the parties do not have adequate assurance on or prior to the twentieth (20th)
day of the month that any required third party consent will be obtained on or
prior to such Subsequent Closing. 

(d) Except as otherwise specifically set out in this Agreement, matters
pertaining to a Closing or a Closing Date shall be read and deemed to be
related to: (i) prior to such anticipated Closing Date, the Facilities and
related Purchased Assets which are anticipated to be or qualified to become
Transferred Facilities as of such Closing Date, and (ii) after such
anticipated Closing Date, the Facilities and related Purchased Assets which
became Transferred Facilities as of such Closing Date; _provided that_ , if a
Facility fails to become a Transferred Facility on a Closing Date as the
result of a breach or default of a Party that is not the result of it becoming
an Escrow Facility or Operator Delay Facility, nothing in this paragraph is
intended to waive the rights of the non-breaching party regarding such breach
pursuant to _Article X_ hereof.

3.2 Satisfaction of Interim Agreements. For any Facilities that are
subject to an Interim Agreement following the Initial Closing or a Subsequent
Closing, the applicable Seller Party and OTA Transferee shall have an
administrative transfer (each, an " _Administrative Transfer_ " and
collectively, " _Administrative Transfers_ ") to finalize all pending
transfers and terminate the Interim Agreements upon receipt by such OTA
Transferee, as applicable, of a License to operate, or receipt of
such written assurances from the Department, in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to such OTA Transferee, that a License to operate has been or will
be issued by the Department effective as of the Effective Time.

 

3.3 Effective Time. The Initial Closing shall be deemed effective for each
applicable Transferred Facility as of 12:00:01 a.m. local Facility time on
the day after the Initial Closing Date (the " _Initial Effective Time_ ").
Similarly, each Subsequent Closing shall be deemed effective for each
applicable Transferred Facility as of 12:00:01 a.m. local Facility time on
the day after such Subsequent Closing (together with the Initial Effective
Time, each being an " _Effective Time_ " specific to the Facilities involved
in each Closing, respectively). To the extent necessary, any matters related
to an Administrative Transfer shall be deemed effective as of 12:00:01 a.m.
local time at such Facility on the day after such Administrative Transfer for
the Facilities involved therein (such time being the " _Effective Time_ "
specific to the Facilities involved in each Administrative Transfer,
respectively). The Effective Time for other Purchased Assets at a Facility
shall be the same as if such Purchased Assets were treated as a Transferred
Facility.

 

3.4 Transfer of Purchased Assets. At the Initial Closing and any Subsequent
Closings, Seller shall deliver or cause Seller Parties to deliver to
Purchaser, Purchaser Parties and/or Purchaser Assignees instruments of
transfer in the forms attached hereto and as described more fully in _Article
VII_ with respect to the Purchased Assets to be transferred in connection
with the Closing, including the relevant Transferred Facilities, in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ (subject to such Closings that involve Interim
Agreements).

 



18 3.5 Designation of Purchased Assets. Within three (3) days following the
Execution Date, Purchaser shall provide written notice to Seller that
identifies which Purchased Assets, if any, have been assigned as of the
Execution Date to a Purchaser Party or Purchaser Assignee. Seller hereby
acknowledges and agrees that certain Purchased Assets will not be held by
Purchaser following the Closing and instead shall be held by Purchaser Parties
or Purchaser Assignees, as applicable. With respect to each Purchaser Party
and each Purchaser Assignee, and except with respect to the obligations to
pay the Purchase Price under _Section_ __ _ 2.5_ for which it shall be the
sole obligor, and the obligations set forth in Section 6.12 with respect to a
Lease Guaranty for which Purchaser shall retain secondary liability following
the Closing until such time as the applicable Purchaser Assignee is released
from such Lease Guaranty in accordance with 6.12, Purchaser shall retain
secondary liability (behind the applicable Purchaser Assignee) hereunder for
all pre-Closing obligations owed to Seller with respect to such assigned
Purchased Assets unless Seller otherwise releases Purchaser from such
liability. For the avoidance of doubt, this Section shall not impact
Purchasers or the Funds liabilities under _Article X_ of this Agreement.

 

3.6 Operations Transfer Agreements. On or before the Execution Date,
Purchaser has caused the OTA Transferee with respect to each Facility, and
Seller has caused Seller Party with respect to each Facility, to enter into an
Operations Transfer Agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as

Regency has executed the OTAs identified in _Schedule 3.6_ for Facilities
where Purchaser has not otherwise produced a third-party operator; Regency may
assign such OTAs to third party operators by no later than July 22, 2017, or

qualification.

 

(d) _No Conflicts or Violations_. Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
the fulfillment of the terms hereof by Purchaser will (i) violate or result in

against Purchaser, that questions the validity of this Agreement or seeks to
prohibit, enjoin or otherwise challenge the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



26 5.3 Brokers and Finders. Except as set forth on _Schedule 5.3_ , no Broker
has been engaged by Purchaser in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. No fees, commissions or costs of any such Broker will be owed by

5.4 Financing Documents. Subject to satisfaction of the Closing Conditions
contained in Section 7.1, Purchaser does not have any reason to believe that
any of the conditions to the Financing will not be satisfied or that the

has fully paid or caused to be paid all fees required to be paid by it on or
prior to the date hereof in connection with the Financing.

5.5 Solvency. Purchaser is not entering into the Transaction Documents
with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future
creditors. Immediately after giving effect to each of the transactions

(a) as of the Closing Date will be able to pay its debts generally as they
become due and shall own property having a present fair saleable value greater
than the amounts required to pay its debts (including a reasonable estimate
of the amount of all contingent liabilities) as they become absolute and
mature in accordance with their stated terms; and (b) shall not have, as of
the Closing Date, unreasonably small capital to carry on any businesses in
which it is engaged. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, (i) "fair
saleable value" means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets

5.6 BMC Funds. Purchaser and each of the Funds, severally but not jointly,
hereby represents, warrants and covenants to Seller as follows: (a) on or
prior to each Closing Date, the Funds will cause Purchaser to be adequately
funded (the " _Fund Financing_ ") such that Purchaser, together with any

for the Indiana Portfolio, will have sufficient funds to pay the Purchase
Price payable on such Closing Date pursuant to Section 2.5(a), (b) each of the
Funds has and will maintain sufficient access to cash and other sources of
immediately available funds, and otherwise have the capabilities, to enable
them to pay, perform and/or discharge, as applicable, the Termination Payment
and the Fund Financing in full; (c) none of the Funds has or will incur any
obligation, commitment, restriction or liability (including contingent
liabilities) of any kind that would impair or adversely affect such sources or
capabilities; and (d) assuming the payment, performance and/or discharge,
as applicable, of the Termination Payment or the Fund Financing, in each case
in whole or in part, by the Funds (and not, for the avoidance of doubt, by
Purchaser), none of the Funds will (i) be insolvent (either because its
financial condition is such that the sum of its debts is greater than the
fair value of its assets or because the present fair value of its assets will
be less than the amount required to pay its probable liability on its debts as
they become absolute and matured), (ii) have unreasonably small capital with
which to engage in its business, or (iii) have incurred or plan to incur debts
beyond its ability to repay such debts as they become absolute and matured.
Each of the Funds has a remaining life of not less than three (3) years. Each
of the Funds, severally but not jointly, hereby covenants and agrees to (x)
unconditionally and irrevocably guaranty as a primary obligation the full,
complete, and punctual payment and performance of any payment obligations of
Purchaser arising pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or _10.4_
(provided that the Funds aggregate guarantee obligation hereunder shall not
under any circumstances exceed the Maximum Termination Payment), and (y)
maintain a net worth sufficient to satisfy such guaranty obligation. If at any
time the Funds net worth is not sufficient to satisfy the guaranty obligation
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence, the Fund shall make a
deposit with Title Company in an amount

 



27  sufficient, when taken together with the Funds then-current net worth, to
satisfy such guaranty obligation. Upon Sellers request, but not more than
once in a 60-day period, the Fund shall provide evidence reasonably
satisfactory to Seller as to the Funds then-current net worth. Each of the
Funds waives presentment, demand of performance, filing of any claim,
any right to require any proceeding first against Purchaser, protest, notice
and all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.6_. The obligations of each
Fund hereunder shall not be affected by (A) the failure of Seller to assert
any claim or demand or to enforce any right or remedy against Purchaser or any
other guarantor under the provisions of this Agreement or any other agreement
or otherwise, (B) any extension or renewal of any provision hereof or
thereof, (C) the failure of Seller to exercise any right or remedy against any
other guarantor of the Termination Payment, or (D) the release or substitution
of any guarantor. Each of the Funds, severally but not jointly, hereby
covenants and agrees to reserve funds sufficient to satisfy its share of the
Fund Financing and the Maximum Termination Payment until such time as such
Termination Payment is extinguished (whether because it has been paid or
because no further Termination Payment may become owed to Seller under this
Agreement), and will not under any circumstances distribute such funds in any
manner that would cause such Fund to be unable to satisfy the Fund
Financing and the Termination Payment.

5.7 Third Party Reports. _Schedule 5.7_ sets forth a list of all

without limitation, title, survey, real estate, zoning, and environmental)

is not a Person with whom a citizen of the United States is prohibited from
engaging in transactions by any trade embargo, economic sanction, or other
prohibition of United States law, regulation, or executive order of the

States. The OFAC List currently is accessible through the internet website

CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AND PURCHASER
DISCLAIMS ANY OTHER REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to accomplish each of the following: (i) taking of all
reasonable acts necessary to cause the Closing Conditions of the Parties set

consultation with the other Party.

 

(c) On or prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to fulfill or obtain the fulfillment of the conditions

such agreement, including the execution and delivery of any documents,
certificates, instruments or other papers that are reasonably required for the
consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby.

 

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any Contract, Real
Property Lease, Ventas Agreement, or License if an attempted assignment
thereof, without consent of a third party thereto, would constitute a breach
or other contravention thereof or in any way adversely affect the rights of
Purchaser, any Purchaser Party or Purchaser Assignee, Seller, or any Seller
Party. Seller will reasonably cooperate with Purchasers efforts to obtain the
consent of the other parties to any Real Property Leases or Contracts to
be assigned to Purchaser or a Purchaser Party or Purchaser Assignee as
applicable. To the extent any Contracts are not assigned, each will be an

shall respond to any subsequent request for reasonable information in a
timely fashion.

obtain all approvals and authorizations, and make all filings for the

6.4 Announcement and Disclosure.

 

(a) The Parties agree to consult with each other and provide the other
party with the opportunity to review and comment prior to issuing any initial
press release concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties shall not be restricted
from (i) making any public statements required by applicable Law, court
process or the New

 



31  York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq Stock Market, or (ii) issuing any
subsequent press release or other public statement that is not inconsistent in
any material respect with the initial press release issued by that Party in
accordance with this Agreement, in each case under this clause (ii) to the
extent such disclosure is still accurate.

 

(b) Except as may be necessary to enforce this Agreement, or to comply with
applicable Laws including securities Laws, for three (3) years after the last
Closing, Seller shall (i) treat and hold as confidential any proprietary and
confidential information of Seller related exclusively to the Purchased Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities related to any Transferred Facility (collectively,
" _Confidential Information_ "), and (ii) refrain from using any of the
Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement. The term
"Confidential Information" shall not include information that is or becomes
generally available to the public by actions of Persons other than Seller or
that pertains to any of the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities. If
Seller is required to disclose any Confidential Information in order to
comply with, or avoid violating, any applicable Law, Seller will use
commercially reasonable efforts to provide Purchaser with prompt notice
thereof to the extent legally permissible. With the exception of securities
filings reasonably required of a public company like Sellers indirect
parent, to the extent legally permissible, Seller shall provide Purchaser, in
advance of any such disclosure, with copies of any Confidential Information
that Seller intends to disclose (and, if applicable, the text of the
disclosure language itself) and shall reasonably cooperate with Purchaser, at
Purchasers sole expense, if permitted by applicable Law, to the extent
Purchaser may reasonably seek to limit such disclosure in a manner consistent
with applicable Law.

(c) Except as may be necessary to enforce this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document, for three (3) years after the last Closing, Purchaser
shall (i) treat and hold as confidential any proprietary and confidential
information of Seller or any of its Affiliates that does not relate
exclusively to the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities related to the
Facility, including any proprietary and confidential information relating to
any of the Excluded Assets or the Excluded Liabilities (collectively, "
_Seller Confidential Information_ "), and (ii) refrain from using any of
Seller Confidential Information except in connection with this Agreement. The
term "Seller Confidential Information" shall not include information that is
or becomes generally available to the public by actions of Persons other than
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates. If Purchaser is required to disclose any
Seller Confidential Information in order to avoid violating any applicable
Law, Purchaser will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide Seller
with prompt notice thereof to the extent legally permissible. To the extent
legally permissible and at Sellers sole expense, Purchaser shall provide
Seller, in advance of any such disclosure, with copies of any Seller
Confidential Information that Purchaser intends to disclose (and, if
applicable, the text of the disclosure language itself) and shall reasonably
cooperate with Seller, at Sellers sole expense, if permitted by applicable
Law, to the extent Seller may reasonably seek to limit such disclosure in a
manner consistent with applicable Law.

 

6.5 [Reserved].

 

6.6 [Reserved].

 

6.7 Efforts and Actions.

 

(a) Each Party shall from time to time and without further consideration,
before and after the Closing, execute such further instruments and take such
other actions as any other Party hereto shall reasonably request for itself or
on behalf of a third party, provided such requests (i) do not materially
contravene any financing agreement or arrangement of a Party, and (ii) are
solely in furtherance of its obligations set forth in any of the Transaction
Documents and are wholly consistent therewith, to effectuate the purposes and
terms set forth in the Transaction Documents and to provide for the orderly
implementation of the Closing and, following the Closing, of the respective
Parties rights and obligations as set forth in this Agreement.

 



32 (b) Following the Execution Date, upon reasonable advance notice
by Purchaser or an OTA Transferee, Seller shall permit reasonable access by
Purchaser, each OTA Transferee and their respective representatives to seek to
establish personal relationships with Persons who have business relations with
the Business;  _provided, however,_ that except as contemplated by the
Transaction Documents or permitted by Seller in writing, neither Purchaser nor
any OTA Transferee shall have the right to amend or modify any agreements
applicable to the operation of the Business at any Facility unless any such
amendments or modifications are contingent on Closing regarding any applicable
Facilities. Seller shall be entitled, if it so elects, to have a
representative participate in any such discussions.

 

(c) On and after the Execution Date, with reasonable coordination with and
advance notice to Seller Parties, Purchaser and each OTA Transferee shall be
entitled to visit the Facilities to assess operational needs for the operation
of the Facilities after the Effective Time including, without limitation,
information technology requirements. In addition, on and after the Execution
Date, so long as there is not a disruption in information technology service
to the Facilities, Purchasers information technology consultants may install
data lines at the Facilities with reasonable advance notice and coordination
with Seller. Purchaser shall indemnify and hold Seller and its Affiliates
harmless from and against all Losses suffered or incurred as a result of any
such access, and this obligation shall survive Closing.

 

(d) On and after the Execution Date, so long as this Agreement has not been
terminated, Seller shall provide Purchaser and each OTA Transferee, their
officers, employees, members, agents, contractors, engineers, consultants,
licensees and assignees (i) access to all the books, contracts, and other
records of Seller and Seller Parties as they relate to the Facilities as
Purchaser or an OTA Transferee may reasonably request, and (ii) access to the
Facilities for the purpose of making any and all examinations and
investigations of the Facilities as Purchaser and OTA Transferee may
reasonably request. Seller shall be entitled, if it so elects, to have a
representative present.

(e) Seller and each Seller Party shall deliver to Purchaser, promptly
after receipt of the same, copies of any survey reports, waivers of
deficiencies, plans of correction and any other investigation reports issued
with respect to the Business or a Facility between the Execution Date and the
applicable Closing. Seller and each Seller Party, as applicable, shall notify
Purchaser immediately upon the occurrence of any survey or investigation of
any Facility, regardless of whether the applicable Governmental Authority has
issued a formal report or finding (such notice may be done verbally by
telephone if promptly followed by written notification).

 

(f) Between the Execution Date and the applicable Closing, Seller and each
Seller Party, as applicable, shall notify Purchaser of any Government
Reimbursement Program recoupment claim or open Cost Report settlement proposal
received from a Governmental Authority.

 

6.8 Overhead and Shared Services; National Contracts. Purchaser
acknowledges that the Business currently benefits from the National Contracts
and receives Overhead and Shared Services from Seller and its Affiliates.
Purchaser further acknowledges that, as it relates to the operation of the
Business at any Transferred Facility, all such benefits from the National
Contracts and provision of Overhead and Shared Services shall cease, and any
agreement by the Business with Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect to
benefiting from the National Contracts or the provision of Overhead and
Shared Services shall terminate, as of the Closing Date for such Transferred
Facility. No Overhead and Shared Services shall be provided by Seller or any
of its Affiliates to any Transferred Facility.

 



33 6.9 Risk of Loss; Casualty Loss; Condemnation.

 

(a) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, any of the Real
Property included in the Purchased Assets related to a Facility shall be
destroyed or damaged in whole or in part (other than damage that is of such a
_de_ _minimis_ nature that it would not reasonably be expected to have any
material effect on the use or value of the affected Facility) by fire,
earthquake, flood, or other casualty (a " _Casualty Loss_ "), Seller shall
deliver notice of such Casualty Loss to Purchaser. If the repair of such
Casualty Loss would, (i) in the reasonable determination (the " _Repair
Estimate_ ") of an engineer, architect or contractor selected by Seller and
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser or a major regional or national
commercial real estate broker selected by Seller and reasonably satisfactory
to Purchaser (" _Estimator_ "), cost less than fifteen percent (15%) of the
Purchase Price applicable to such Facility pursuant to the Purchase Price
Allocation (the " _Casualty Threshold_ "), and (ii) permit the applicable
Facility to continue to be operated in substantially the same manner as
immediately prior to the Casualty Loss, then Purchaser shall not have the
right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such Facility as a result of
such Casualty Loss and the Closing shall take place as provided herein,
provided that Purchaser shall have the option of (x) taking such Facility as
it is, together with the insurance proceeds, if any, or the right to receive
the same, and the rights to any other claims arising as a result of the
damage, and reducing the Purchase Price paid with respect to such Facility by
the amount of any applicable deductible, or (y) electing to have Seller work
with its insurance carrier to cause all necessary repairs to be completed in
a manner reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser within forty-five (45) days of
the date the Casualty Loss occurred.

 

(b) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, a Casualty Loss
occurs and the Repair Estimate exceeds the Casualty Threshold, then Purchaser
shall have the right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such Facility
within twenty (20) days after Purchaser has received the Repair Estimate with
respect to such Casualty Loss, or at the Closing, whichever is earlier, in
which case such affected Facility shall not be transferred at the Closing, the
Parties rights and obligations hereunder with respect thereto shall terminate
with no further liability on the part of any Party (other than to the extent
any rights and obligations are expressly stated in this Agreement to survive
termination of this Agreement), and the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
amount set forth opposite such Facility on _Schedule 2.5(b)_. If Purchaser
does not elect to terminate this Agreement with respect to such Facility as
set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(b)_, then, at Purchasers option, either
(i) the Closing shall take place as otherwise provided herein, with a
reduction of the Purchase Price with respect to such Facility in the amount of
the Repair Estimate, or (ii) Seller shall work with its insurance carrier to
cause all necessary repairs to be completed in a manner
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser as soon as reasonably practicable after
the date the damage occurred. If such repairs are not completed prior to the
Closing Date, then the closing of the transaction with respect to such damaged
Facility (the " _Escrowed Damaged Facility_ ") shall occur after the Closing
Date in accordance with the timing for closing Escrow Facilities set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 10.3_ (the " _Escrowed Damaged Facility Closing Date_ "), and
the Purchase Price allocated to the Escrowed Damaged Facility will not be paid
on the Closing Date but shall be paid on the date the Escrowed Damaged
Facility Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
the foregoing, if the Escrowed Damaged Facility Closing Date does not occur
on or prior to the Outside Date, then this Agreement will terminate with
respect to the damaged Facility.

 

(c) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, any
Condemnation is commenced with respect to any of the Real Property related to
any Facility, Seller shall deliver notice of such Condemnation to Purchaser.
If the Condemnation is of such a _de minimis_ nature that it would, as
reasonably determined by an Estimator selected in the manner set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_, not reasonably be expected to have a material effect
on the use or value of the affected Facility, then Purchaser shall not have
the right to terminate this Agreement with respect to such Facility as
a result of such Condemnation and the Closing shall take place as provided
herein, without reduction of the Purchase Price, and Seller shall assign to
Purchaser at the Closing all of Sellers right, title and interest in and to
all awards made in respect of such Condemnation and to pay over to Purchaser
all amounts theretofore received by Seller (net of any reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses) in connection with such Condemnation.

 



34 (d) If, between the date of this Agreement and the Closing,
any Condemnation is commenced with respect to all, or a portion of the Real
Property that would, in the reasonable determination of the Estimator,
reasonably be expected to have a material effect on the use or value of the
affected Facility, then Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement with respect to such Facility within ten (10) days after Seller has
given Purchaser notice that such Condemnation has commenced, or at the
Closing, whichever is earlier, in which case such affected Facility shall not
be transferred at the Closing and the Parties rights and obligations
hereunder with respect thereto shall terminate with no further liability on
the part of any Party (other than to the extent any rights and obligations
are expressly stated in this Agreement to survive termination of this
Agreement). If Purchaser does not elect to terminate this Agreement as set
forth above, the Closing shall take place as provided herein, with a reduction
of the Purchase Price with respect to such Facility in an amount the
Estimator reasonably determines the value of the Facility has been impaired as
a result of such Condemnation.

 

(e) If, prior to the first scheduled Closing with respect to a Portfolio,
the sum of (i) the aggregate loss, if any, reasonably determined by
Estimator(s) to be represented by Casualty Losses and/or Condemnations
suffered by Facilities within such Portfolio, plus (ii) the Transfer Value of
any Escrow Facilities within such Portfolio (such sum, the " _Aggregate
Impacted Facilities Value_ ") is equal to or greater than fifteen percent
(15%) of the Transfer Value of the Facilities in such Portfolio (the "
_Aggregate Impacted Facilities Threshold_ "), then (x) subject to _Section_
__ _ 6.9(f)_ and in addition to any termination rights Purchaser may
otherwise have under this Agreement with respect to such Portfolio or the
individual Facilities therein, Purchaser shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement with respect to such Portfolio, and (y) notwithstanding any
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, Purchasers obligation to
consummate a Closing with respect to each Facility in such
Portfolio (including any Facility which that has not suffered any Casualty
Loss and/or Condemnation and is not an Escrow Facility) shall be delayed until
such time as the Aggregate Impacted Facilities Value for such Portfolio is
less than the Aggregate Impacted Facilities Threshold for such Portfolio and
the applicable Facility is otherwise eligible for Closing under this
Agreement.

 

(f) To the extent the Aggregate Impacted Facilities Value for a Portfolio
that has exceeded the Aggregate Impacted Facilities Threshold includes the
Transfer Value of one or more Escrow Facilities, Seller shall have a period of
one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the first scheduled Closing
with respect to such Portfolio (the " _Portfolio Escrow Cure Period_ ") to
bring such Escrow Facilities into compliance. With respect to such a
Portfolio, Purchasers termination right under _Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)(x)_
shall arise upon the expiration of the Portfolio Escrow Cure Period only if
the Aggregate Impacted Facilities Value for such Portfolio still exceeds the
Aggregate Impacted Facilities Threshold as a result of Facilities within such
Portfolio continuing to be Escrow Facilities.

 

6.10 Title and Survey Matters; Estoppel Certificates.

 

(a) Seller has delivered to Purchaser the title insurance commitments (the
" _First American Title Reports_ ") for all of the Real Property, issued by
First American Title. Purchaser has obtained from Madison Title Agency, LLC
or, solely with respect to the Facilities located in the State of Ohio,
Riverside Abstract (in each case, in such capacity, " _Title Company_ ")
title insurance commitments (" _Title Reports_ ") and, at Closing, Purchaser
shall cause Title Company to issue standard form owners policies of title
insurance with respect to each parcel of Real Property; Seller will cooperate
therewith. Purchaser shall cause Title Company to use commercially reasonable
efforts to deliver a copy of each exception document to which reference is
made in the Title Reports; Seller will cooperate therewith. In the case of
parcels of Owned Real Property and owned (as opposed to leased) Ventas
Property, such policies shall be standard ALTA Form 2006 owners policies in
the full amount of that portion of the Purchase Price allocated to each such
parcel of Owned Real Property, insuring good and marketable fee title thereto
(expressly including all easements and other appurtenances). Purchaser may
coordinate with Title Company to have the standard exceptions deleted, if
available; Seller will cooperate therewith.

 



35  Purchaser shall be responsible for the cost of any extended coverage to any
final title policy. Seller shall not be obligated to provide leasehold
policies for any Leased Real Property or the Ventas Property, provided,
however, that this sentence shall not be deemed to relieve Seller of any
cooperation obligation otherwise set forth herein. The title policies for the
Owned Real Property shall be subject only to the Permitted Encumbrances.
Purchaser may request such endorsements to the title policies, at Purchasers
sole cost and expense.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, Purchaser may order updates or continuations of,
and supplements to, the Title Reports (each a " _Title Update_ ") for any
Real Property, at Purchasers sole cost. Purchaser shall instruct Title
Company to simultaneously deliver directly to Purchaser and Seller copies of
each Title Update (including tax and departmental searches) ordered by
Purchaser or otherwise issued by Title Company, at Purchasers cost, and
copies of all underlying documentation referenced as an exception in such
Title Update as soon as and if reasonably available.

 

(c) Purchaser shall have the right to deliver one or more written notices
to the Title Updates (each, a " _Title Objection Notice_ ") to Seller
objecting to any items contained in the Title Updates or a Title Update which
are not Permitted Encumbrances and which would materially interfere with the
use or occupancy of the affected property or materially and adversely affect
the value of the affected property if not removed or otherwise cured, such
Title Objection Notice to be delivered prior to the earlier of (i) within ten
(10) days after Purchasers receipt of such Title Update, and (ii) twenty
(20) days prior to the Closing Date. Failure of Purchaser to provide a Title
Objection Notice within such period (or to include any such matters in a
timely delivered and valid Title Objection Notice) shall be
deemed Purchasers approval of all items contained in such Title Update. All
such items that are not objected to by Purchaser in a timely delivered and
valid Title Objection Notice shall be deemed to be Permitted Encumbrances and
the Purchase Price shall not be reduced. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts and expend such amounts as it deems appropriate in its
commercially reasonable discretion to remove or cure prior to the Closing any
title exceptions that are not Permitted Encumbrances to which Purchaser
properly and timely objects to in the Title Objection Notice (which cure may,
at Sellers election, involve obtaining, at Sellers expense, title insurance
from Title Company acceptable to Purchaser insuring against the effect of
such exceptions). Seller shall not have any obligation to remove or cure any
such exceptions or pay any amounts to cure or remove the same except that
Seller shall be obligated to cure or remove any exceptions created
by, through or under Seller after the date of this Agreement and otherwise
not agreed to by Purchaser. Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing within
seven (7) days after receipt of notice from Purchaser regarding such
exceptions whether Seller elects to attempt to remove or cure any such
exceptions, and Sellers failure to deliver such notice in a timely manner
shall be deemed an election by Seller not to remove or cure such exceptions.
If Seller notifies Purchaser that Seller has elected to remove or cure any
such exceptions and the removal or cure cannot be completed by the Closing,
then the Facility shall become an Escrow Facility. If Seller notifies
Purchaser that Seller has elected not to remove or cure any such exceptions
(or is deemed to have elected not to remove or cure such exceptions), then
Purchaser shall notify Seller within seven (7) days after receipt of such
notice (or date of deemed election, as applicable) whether Purchaser elects
to proceed to the Closing for such Facility, taking title subject to such
exceptions, or not to proceed to the Closing for such Facility, in which case
the Parties shall be relieved of any further obligations hereunder with
respect to such Facility. Failure of Purchaser to provide such notice in a
timely manner shall be deemed an election by Purchaser to proceed to the
Closing for such Facility. If Purchaser elects (or is deemed to have elected)
to take title subject to any such exceptions under this _Section 6.10_, such
exceptions shall become Permitted Encumbrances and the Purchase Price shall
not be reduced.

 

(d) Purchaser shall be responsible for the costs of any Title Updates, new
or updated surveys and title insurance policies obtained by Purchaser.

 



36 (e) Purchaser may elect to obtain, at Purchasers expense, to the extent
available, surveys of each parcel of Real Property prepared in accordance with
the Minimum Standard Detail Requirements for ALTA/ NSPS Land Title Surveys,
jointly established and adopted by ALTA and NSPS in 2016, which includes Items
2, 3, 4, 6(a), 6(b), 7(a), 7(b)(1), 8, 9, 10, 11 and 19 of Table A thereof
(and for vacant parcels, includes Item 5 of Table A), certified to Purchaser
and Title Company, each dated no more than thirty (30) calendar days prior to
the Closing and each detailing, among other things, the legal description,
perimeter boundaries, all improvements located thereon, all easements and
encroachments, rights-of-way, utilities rights and other matters (whether
above or below ground) encumbering or affecting each such parcel of Real
Property and such other matters as Purchaser or Title Company reasonably
request, each containing a surveyor certificate reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser and Title Company, and each prepared by a registered land surveyor
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser licensed to practice in the jurisdiction
in which the parcel of Real Property is located. In the event any survey
discloses any matters which would materially interfere with the use or
occupancy of the affected property or materially and adversely affect the
value of the affected property if not removed or otherwise cured, then subject
to  _Section_ __ _ 6.10(g)_ Purchaser may include such matter(s) in a Title
Objection Notice and the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ shall apply.

 

(f) Purchaser may elect to obtain, at Purchasers expense, engineering and
property condition inspection reports satisfactory to Purchaser for each
parcel of Real Property, as well as any environmental site assessments, each
dated no more than thirty (30) days prior to the Closing and each prepared by
an engineering and property condition consultant of national or regional
reputation reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser. Purchaser may elect to
obtain, at Purchasers expense, zoning compliance reports satisfactory to
Purchaser for each parcel of Real Property, each dated no more than
thirty (30) days prior to the Closing and each prepared by a zoning
consultant of national or regional reputation reasonably satisfactory to
Purchaser. In the event any report discloses any matters which would
materially interfere with the use or occupancy of the affected property or
materially and adversely affect the value of the affected property if not
removed or otherwise cured, then subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.10(g)_ Purchaser
may include such matter(s) in a Title Objection Notice and the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 6.10(c)_ shall apply.

(g) Real Estate Challenges and Required Repairs.

(i) As of the Execution Date, Purchaser acknowledges that it has completed
all due diligence regarding real estate matters (including without
limitation, title, survey, real estate, zoning, and environmental) to
Purchasers satisfaction, and Purchasers rights to challenge any issues
related to real estate (including without limitation in _Section_ __ _
6.10(e)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.10(f)_) are limited to changes to the real
estate having occurred between the Execution Date and the Closing Date, except
for those matters specifically set forth on _Schedule 6.10(g)(i)_ or as
otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.10(g)(ii)_.

 

(ii) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause each of the
matters listed on _Schedule 6.10(g)(ii)_ to be satisfied, resolved,
remediated, removed or released, as applicable, to Purchasers reasonable
satisfaction prior to Closing (the " _Required Repairs_ "). Seller shall
provide written notice to Purchaser when a Required Repair has been
completed, and Purchaser and its representatives shall have the right to
access each parcel of Real Property at least five (5) days prior to Closing to
confirm that such Required Repairs have been completed. In the event that
Seller does not complete the Required Repairs regarding any Facility prior to
Closing on that Facility despite its commercially reasonable efforts, Seller
shall not be in breach of this provision so long as Seller provides a credit
to the Purchase Price in the reasonable amount of the remaining Required
Repairs for such Facility.

(h) If any of the Real Property Leases require Landlord to provide an
estoppel and/or a nondisturbance agreement, then Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain said estoppels and/or nondisturbance agreements
in the form prescribed by the Real Property Leases. Seller shall

 



37  include (but cannot promise to obtain) customary estoppel and nondisturbance
language in the initial draft of each document requesting consent to an
assignment of a Real Property Lease. In the event that any Landlord does not
provide a customary estoppel, Seller shall provide a tenant estoppel in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser.

 

(i) With respect to the lease of the Facility located in Indian Creek,
Indiana, Seller shall provide the written consent of the landlord under such
lease to a leasehold mortgage to be placed upon the tenants interest under
such lease, which consent shall be in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Purchaser and its Financing Source.

 

6.11 Lien Release. Seller shall (a) deliver to Purchaser no later than
three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, customary lien terminations
(including UCC-3 financing statements), releases, and instruments of discharge
(including mortgage releases, if applicable) with respect to all Encumbrances
relating to the Credit Agreement and all other Encumbrances on the applicable
Transferred Facility and the related Purchased Assets that are not Permitted
Encumbrances, and (b) consummate on or prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
Encumbrance Release Transactions with respect to the applicable Transferred
Facility and the related Purchased Assets.

6.12 Lease Guaranties. Purchaser will cooperate with Seller and use its
commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in obtaining a full and
unconditional release of those Lease Guaranties set forth on _Schedule 6.12_ ,
from and after the Closing Date, which obligations of Purchaser shall
include, providing a replacement guaranty by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates for the benefit of the landlord under the applicable Real Property
Lease in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser which such
replacement guaranty shall only apply to matters accruing from and after the
Closing Date. If a full and unconditional release of any such Lease Guaranties
is not obtained and any such Lease Guaranties remain outstanding following
the Closing for any reason (regardless of whether or not Purchaser has
complied with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.12_), then
Purchaser shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from
and against all Losses suffered or incurred following the Closing in
connection with such Lease Guaranties as an Assumed Liability pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 9.3(c)_, provided that Purchaser may assign any such Lease
Guaranty obligation to a creditworthy successor in interest subject to the
prior written consent of Seller (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Furthermore, to the extent that Seller or an Affiliate remains
liable under a Real Property Lease following the Closing Date, unless and
until Seller or such affiliate receives a full and unconditional release from
such liability from the landlord thereunder for matters accruing from and
after the Closing Date (which matters, for the avoidance of doubt, constitute
Assumed Liabilities hereunder), Purchaser and its affiliates shall not amend,
modify, or extend the obligations of tenant under such Real Property Lease in
any manner that increases the liability or contingent liability of Seller or
its affiliates thereunder or in any way transfer such Real Property Lease to a
party other than an Affiliate without securing such release.

 

6.13 [Reserved].

 

6.14 [Reserved].

 

6.15 Purchasers Financing.

 

(a) Unless, and to the extent, Purchaser has sufficient cash from other
sources (including by reason of a capital market or other financing
transaction) available to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, from
and after the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange the Financing.

 



38 (b) Unless, and to the extent, Purchaser has sufficient cash from
other sources (including by reason of a capital market or other financing
transaction) available to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement,
Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to negotiate and enter into
one or more commitment letters and definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Purchaser shall give
Seller reasonably prompt notice if for any reason Purchaser believes in good
faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing
required to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

(d) Unless and to the extent Purchaser has sufficient cash from other
sources (including by reason of a capital market or other financing
transaction) available to satisfy its obligations under this Agreement, in the
event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable, Purchaser shall use
its reasonable best efforts to, as promptly as practicable, arrange
alternative debt financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount
sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
following the occurrence of such event.

 

(e) Neither the obtaining of the Financing, any alternative debt financing
from the same or alternative sources or a refinancing transaction, nor the
completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the Financing, is a
condition to the Closing.

 

6.16 Financing Cooperation.

 

(a) Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to
cause its Affiliates and their respective representatives to (i) provide as
promptly as reasonably practicable (1) such information as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser to facilitate the pledging by Purchaser of, and
granting, recording and perfection of security interests in, collateral
constituting Purchased Assets, and to facilitate Purchasers ability to
obtain, at Purchasers cost, surveys and title insurance for the benefit of a
Financing Source, and (2) other information (financial or otherwise) relating
to the Business and/or the Purchased Assets as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser and/or Financing Sources, which information may include information
to be used by Purchaser in the preparation of an information package regarding
the business, operations, financial projections and prospects of the Business
and/or the Purchased Assets as customary or reasonably necessary for the
completion of such Financing and/or to prepare customary offering or
information documents to be used by Purchaser for the completion of the
Financing; (ii) cooperate with the marketing efforts of Purchaser and the
Financing Sources, including participating in a reasonable number of meetings
and due diligence sessions, at times and at locations reasonably acceptable
to Seller; (iii) make available upon reasonable notice, personnel with
appropriate seniority and expertise relating to Seller, the Business and/or
the Purchased Assets, in each case, as may be reasonably requested
by Purchaser, or as may be reasonably requested by the Financing Sources;
(iv) subject to satisfactory confidentiality and limitation of use provisions,
provide authorization letters acceptable to Seller to the Financing Sources
authorizing the distribution of specified information to prospective lenders
or investors; (v) subject to any contractual agreement in effect, obtain any
applicable customary payoff letters and instruments of discharge to be
delivered at the Closing(s); and (vi) subject to any contractual agreement in
effect, execute and deliver any pledge and security documents (including
mortgages), other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or
documents as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser (including a
certificate of the chief financial officer of Seller or one or more of its
Subsidiaries with respect to solvency matters) related to the Purchased
Assets; provided that (A) none of Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be
required to take any action that would be prohibited by any applicable Law,
(B) no obligations of Seller or any of its Affiliates under any certificate,
contract, or other document or instrument delivered pursuant to this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.16_ shall be effective until the Closing Date, and none of
Seller nor any of its Affiliates shall be required to take any action pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.16_ under any certificate, contract, or other
document or instrument that is not contingent upon the

 



39  Closing or that would be effective prior to the Closing Date, (C) any
requested cooperation shall not interfere with the ongoing operations of
Seller and its Affiliates or their financing, (D) Seller and its Affiliates
shall not be deemed to be in breach of this _Section_ __ _ 6.16(a)_ unless a
court of competent jurisdiction has determined by final and non-
appealable judgment that a Financing was not consummated solely due to the
failure of Seller and its Affiliates to comply with this _Section_ __ _
6.16(a)_, and (E) for the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby understood and
agreed that neither the obtaining of the Financing, any alternative debt
financing from the same or alternative sources or a refinancing transaction,
nor the completion of any issuance of securities contemplated by the
Financing, is a condition to the Closing. 

(b) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such documents, and take such actions, as may be necessary or reasonably
requested by Purchaser to facilitate the consummation of each Seller
Encumbrance Release Transaction.

 

(c) Purchaser shall, promptly upon request by Seller accompanied by a
reasonably detailed invoice, reimburse Seller for all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys
fees) incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates in satisfying
its obligations under _Section_ __ _ 6.16_.

6.17 Reverse 1031. Seller is aware that that certain Purchaser Assignees
intend to perform an IRC Section 1031 tax-deferred exchange (the " _Exchange_
"), and each Purchaser Assignee reserves the right to include the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by and through an assignment of
such Purchaser Assignees rights, as part of an Exchange for the benefit of
Assignee, at no cost, expense or liability to Seller or Purchaser. Seller
agrees to execute any and all documents as are reasonably necessary in
connection therewith, provided that the Closing with respect to the applicable
Real Property shall not be contingent upon or subject to the completion of
such an Exchange. Seller agrees to cooperate with any such Purchaser Assignee
in such an exchange, and in return, Purchaser Assignees agree to hold Seller
and Purchaser harmless from any and all claims, costs or liabilities resulting
from such an Exchange. Seller agrees and consents to partial assignments of
this Agreement to any qualified intermediary by one or more Purchaser
Assignees in connection with an Exchange.

ARTICLE VII

CLOSING CONDITIONS

 

7.1 Conditions to Obligations of Each Party to Consummate Transactions on
the Closing Date.

 

(a) The respective obligations of Seller, on the one hand, and Purchaser,
on the other hand, to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby at the
applicable Closing shall be subject to the satisfaction at or prior to the

performed by Purchaser on or before the Closing Date shall have been

ARTICLE IX

 

INDEMNIFICATION

 

9.1 Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants. All
representations, warranties, pre-Closing covenants and obligations of Seller,
including with respect to any Transferred Facility, on the one hand, and
Purchaser, on the other hand, contained in this Agreement or in any document
to be executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement at the Closing (each,
a " _Closing Document_ ") shall survive the Closing for such Facility for
eighteen (18) months and automatically terminate thereafter without any action
on the part of any Party hereto; _provided, however,_ that (a) the
representations and warranties set forth in _Sections 4.1_ (Corporate), _4.5_
(Title to Purchased Assets; Absence of Encumbrances), _4.14_ (Brokers and
Finders), _5.1_  (Corporate), and _5.3_ (Brokers and Finders) shall survive
indefinitely after the Closing for such Facility; (b) the representations and
warranties set forth in _Section_ __ _ 4.3_ (Taxes) shall survive until
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations period
(including all extensions thereof) applicable to the underlying subject matter
being represented; and (c) the representations and warranties set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 4.12_ shall survive until the three year anniversary of the
Closing Date for such Facility. The representations and warranties contained
in _Sections 4.1, 4.3, 4.5, 4.14, 5.1, and 5.3_ are sometimes
collectively referred to herein as the "Fundamental Representations." Except
as otherwise set out in this Agreement, post-Closing covenants

 



43  and obligations of the Parties shall survive the Closing Date for such
Facility for three (3) years and automatically terminate without any action on
the part of any Party hereto;  _provided, however,_ that (a) non-monetary
obligations for access and/or retention of records, confidentiality, general
cooperation, delivery of property received belonging to the other Party,
and further assurances, shall survive for the Closing Date for such
Transferred Facility for the period of the statute of limitations or the
specific period set forth herein; (b) Purchasers obligations with respect to
Assumed Liabilities will survive the Closing Date for such Transferred
Facility until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of
limitations period (including all extensions thereof) applicable for such
Assumed Liability; and (c) Sellers obligations with respect to Excluded
Liabilities will survive the Closing Date for such Transferred Facility until
thirty (30) days after the expiration of the statute of limitations period
(including all extensions thereof) applicable for such Excluded Liability.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any covenant, obligation, representation or
warranty in respect of which indemnity may be sought hereunder shall survive
the time at which it would otherwise terminate pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 9.1_ (such time, the " _Expiration Date_ ") if a Notice of Indemnification
shall have been given to the applicable Indemnifying Party on or before the
applicable Expiration Date; _provided, however,_ that such survival shall
automatically expire if Indemnified Party does not bring a judicial action
against Indemnifying Party within one hundred eighty (180) days following the
Expiration Date, and further, in the absence of the filing of such an action,
the Escrow shall be released one hundred eighty (180) days after the three-
year anniversary of the Initial Closing Date.

 

9.2 Indemnification by Seller. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and any cure
periods set forth in this Agreement, Seller or its successors and assigns, as
applicable, shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser, its successors and
assigns (including the respective Purchaser Parties and Purchaser Assignees),
each OTA Transferee and its successors and assigns, and their respective
Affiliates (collectively, " _Purchaser Indemnified Parties_ ") from and
against any Loss incurred or suffered by such Purchaser Indemnified Party
arising out of or resulting from:

 

(a) a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document;

 

(b) a failure by Seller to perform or comply with the covenants on the part
of Seller set forth in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; and

(c) any Excluded Liability, and any obligations arising with respect to
a Purchased Asset prior to the Closing Date.

9.3 Indemnification by Purchaser. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and any
cure periods set forth in this Agreement, Purchaser or its successors and
assigns, as applicable, shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
Affiliates (" _Seller Indemnified Parties_ "), from and against any Loss
incurred or suffered by such Seller Indemnified Party arising out of or
resulting from:

 

(a) a breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document; 

(b) a failure by Purchaser to perform or comply with any covenant of
Purchaser in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document; and

(c) any Assumed Liability, and any obligations arising with respect to a
Purchased Asset from and after the Closing Date.

 



44 9.4 Indemnification Limitations.

 

(a) Notwithstanding _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, if the Closing occurs:

 

(i) an Indemnifying Party shall not have any obligation to indemnify an
Indemnified Party with respect to a Facility whatsoever from and against any
Loss pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a) or 9.3(a)_ unless and until the
aggregate claims for such Losses with respect to such Facility (and with
respect to any Purchaser Indemnified Party, combined with claims for Losses
by the applicable OTA Transferee for breaches of Sellers representations and
warranties under the applicable OTA with respect to such Facility) exceed
Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000.00) (the " _Indemnification Threshold_ "), at
which time Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all such Losses
greater than the Indemnification Threshold, subject to the Indemnification
Cap; and

 

(ii) Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover Losses pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 9.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.3(a)_ for an aggregate amount
(and with respect to the Purchaser Indemnified Parties, combined with the
aggregate amount of Losses recovered by the OTA Transferees for breaches of
Sellers representations and warranties under the OTAs in excess of Twelve-
and-One Half Percent (12.5%) of the Transfer Value of Facilities that become
Transferred Facilities (the " _Indemnification Cap_ "); _provided, however_ ,
that claims for breach of any of the Fundamental Representations shall not be
subject to the limits set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(_ _i_ _)_ and this 
_Section_ __ _ 9.4(a)(ii)_ and shall not be included in the determination of
whether the limit in clause (ii) has been reached. The Indemnification Cap
shall be allocated among the Facilities as set forth on _Schedule 9.4(a_ _)(_
_ii)_. Notwithstanding the limitations on indemnification set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 9.1_ and this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, such limitations shall not
apply to any claim against Seller for fraud. For all purposes of this
_Article_ __ _ IX_, when determining the amount of the Losses arising out of
or resulting from a breach of a representation or warranty of Seller or
Purchaser, any material adverse effect or other materiality qualifier
contained in any such representation or warranty will be disregarded.

(b) Any Losses for which any Indemnified Party would be entitled to
indemnification under this _Article IX_ shall be reduced by the amount of
insurance proceeds actually received or recovered under any insurance policies
for the benefit of such Indemnified Party (including any title policies) and
any cash payments, setoffs or recoupment of any payments actually recovered by
such Indemnified Party in respect of such Losses. Each Indemnified Party shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate losses for which such
Indemnified Party is subject to indemnification under this _Article IX_.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the previous Section, if an
Indemnified Party believes that coverage for Losses is likely to be available
under title policies, such Indemnified Party shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to pursue any insurance proceeds available to such
Indemnified Party pursuant to any title policies. If, after Indemnifying Party
has made an indemnification payment to an Indemnified Party with respect to
Losses in satisfaction of its obligations under this _Article IX_ ,
Indemnified Party actually recovers from any third parties amounts in respect
of such Losses, Indemnified Party shall as promptly as practicable forward to
Indemnifying Party such amounts, but not in excess of the indemnification
payment received by Indemnified Party. Seller shall have no obligation to
indemnify (whether under this Article or otherwise) both (i) Purchaser, or a
Purchaser Party or an assignee of Purchaser, and (ii) an OTA Transferee, with
respect to any single Loss and shall not be required to pay duplicative
damages. Further, Seller shall not owe obligations to more than one of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any single Loss and shall not
be required to pay duplicative damages. For avoidance of doubt, multiple
Purchaser Indemnified Parties could incur separate Losses (i.e., not a "single
Loss") from the same matter for which indemnification is being sought.

(c) Any indemnification payments made pursuant to this Agreement shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price (as determined for U.S. federal
income tax purposes) and shall be reflected as an adjustment to the
consideration allocated to a specific asset, if any, giving rise to the
adjustment and if any such adjustment does not relate to a specific asset,
such adjustment shall be allocated in accordance with the allocation
principles set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_. In the event of a claim under
this Section, a Party shall have a duty to mitigate its Losses.

 



45 9.5 Assumption of Defense. An Indemnified Party shall promptly give notice
(each, a " _Notice of Indemnification_ ") to each Indemnifying Party after
obtaining knowledge of any matter as to which recovery may be sought against
such Indemnifying Party because of the indemnity set forth above, and,
if such indemnity shall arise from the claim of a third party and
Indemnifying Party provides written notice to Indemnified Party stating that
Indemnifying Party is responsible for the entire claim within ten (10) days
after Indemnifying Partys receipt of the applicable Notice of
Indemnification, shall permit such Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of
any such claim or any proceeding resulting from such claim; _provided,
however,_ that failure to give any such Notice of Indemnification promptly
shall not affect the indemnification provided under this _Article IX_ , except
and only to the extent such Indemnifying Party shall have been actually
prejudiced as a result of such failure or if such Notice of Indemnification
is not given to Indemnifying Party prior the applicable Expiration Date. If an
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of such third party claim, such
Indemnifying Party shall have full and complete control over the conduct of
such proceeding on behalf of Indemnified Party and shall, subject to the
provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, have the right to decide all matters
of procedure, strategy, substance and settlement relating to such
proceeding;  _provided, further, however,_ that any counsel chosen by such
Indemnifying Party to conduct such defense shall be reasonably satisfactory to
Indemnified Party; and _provided, further, however,_ that Indemnifying Party
shall not without the written consent of Indemnified Party consent to the
entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the matter
which (a) does not include a provision whereby the plaintiff or the claimant
in the matter releases Indemnified Party from all liability with respect
thereto, and (b) in the case of Purchaser as Indemnifying Party, does not
include any provision that would impose any obligation (including an
obligation to refrain from taking action) upon Seller. Indemnified Party may
participate in such proceeding and retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost
and expense (and, for the avoidance of doubt, such cost and expense shall not
constitute a Loss for purposes of the Indemnification Obligations).
Notwithstanding the forgoing, (i) Purchaser, at any time when it believes that
a claim for indemnification relates to or arises in connection with any
criminal proceeding, indictment or investigation, may assume the defense and
otherwise deal with such claim in good faith with counsel of its choice, and
be fully indemnified therefor, (ii) the Indemnifying Party may not assume the
defense of any claim if an actual conflict of interest exists between
Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party that precludes effective joint
representation, and (iii) Indemnified Party may take over the defense and
prosecution of a claim from Indemnifying Party if Indemnifying Party has
failed or is failing to vigorously prosecute or defend such claim.

 

9.6 Non-Assumption of Defense. If no Indemnifying Party is permitted
or elects to assume the defense of any such claim by a third party or
proceeding resulting therefrom, Indemnified Party shall diligently defend
against such claim or litigation in such manner as it may deem appropriate
and, in such event, Indemnifying Party or Parties shall reimburse Indemnified
Party for all reasonable and actually incurred out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by Indemnified Party and its
Affiliates in connection with the defense against such claim or proceeding,
within thirty (30) days after the receipt of detailed invoices.

 

9.7 Indemnified Partys Cooperation as to Proceedings. Indemnified Party
will cooperate in all reasonable respects with any Indemnifying Party in the
conduct of any proceeding as to which such Indemnifying Party assumes the
defense, except to the extent Indemnified Party could reasonably be expected
to be prejudiced thereby. Indemnifying Party or Parties shall promptly
reimburse Indemnified Party for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses, legal or otherwise, incurred by Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
in connection therewith, within thirty (30) days after the receipt of detailed
invoices therefor.

 



46 9.8 Damages Disclaimed. EXCEPT IN THE EVENT OF FRAUD OR AS SUCH MAY BE
PART OF ANY CLAIM OF ANY THIRD PARTY THAT IS NOT A PURCHASER INDEMNIFIED PARTY
OR A TRANSFEREE INDEMNIFIED PARTY (AS DEFINED IN THE OTA), UNDER NO
CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL SELLER OR ANY SELLER PARTY BE RESPONSIBLE OR LIABLE
(WHETHER UNDER THIS  _ARTICLE IX_ OR OTHERWISE IN THIS AGREEMENT) IN ANY WAY
HEREUNDER FOR LOST PROFITS, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, SPECIAL OR PUNITIVE
DAMAGES, DIMINUTION IN VALUE, OR ANY EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER
THE ACTION IS FOUNDED IN CONTRACT, TORT, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE.

9.9 Individual Liability Disclaimed. For the avoidance of doubt, except in
the event of fraud, no individual officer, director, member, managing member,
shareholder, equity holder, partner, employee, agent, or representative of
either Party shall have any liability for any claims of the other Party
related to this Agreement, or any agreements, certificates or instruments
delivered in connection herewith, in any way.

 

9.10 Exclusive Remedy Post-Closing. With the exception of fraud and
injunctive relief for specific performance or an action required under this
Agreement post-Closing for any Transferred Facility, the exclusive remedy of
any Party after a Closing with respect to Facilities involved in that Closing
shall be indemnity under this _Article IX_. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the remedies under _Article X_ shall remain for Facilities which have not
become Transferred Facilities. For the avoidance of doubt, the Maximum
Termination Payment shall not be a limit on any damages owed to Seller under
this _Article IX_.

9.11 _Application_ ___of_ _ _ _Escrow_ ___Funds_. Any payment Seller is
obligated to make to Purchaser Indemnified Parties pursuant to this _Article
IX_ or pursuant to Section 10.1 of the OTA shall be paid first, to the extent
there are sufficient Escrow Funds, by release of Escrow Funds to Purchaser
Indemnified Parties, as applicable, by Escrow Agent in accordance with the
terms of the Escrow Agreement, and shall accordingly reduce the Escrow Funds
and, second, to the extent the Escrow Funds are insufficient to pay any
remaining sums due, then Seller shall promptly pay all of such additional sums
due and owing to Purchaser Indemnified Parties in cash by wire transfer of
immediately available funds.

 

ARTICLE X

TERMINATION AND BREACH

10.1 Termination and Breach Events. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, in addition to the termination rights set forth in _Section_ __ _
6.9_, this Agreement may be terminated and the transactions contemplated
hereby (that have not yet had a Closing) abandoned at any time:

 

(a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

 

(b) by either Seller or Purchaser, upon prior written notice to the other
Party, if the Initial Closing shall not have occurred by December 31, 2017
(the " _Termination Date_ "); _provided_ that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)_ shall not be available to any
Party whose breach of representation or warranty or failure to fulfill in any
material respect any covenants and agreements of such Party set forth in this
Agreement was a cause of the failure of the Closing to occur on or before the
applicable Termination Date;

 

(c) by either Seller or Purchaser (i) in the event that any Law shall have
been enacted or Order issued by any Governmental Authority that directly
prohibits the consummation of all Closings that have not occurred as of the
date of such enactment or issuance, and such Law or Order shall have become
final and non-appealable, or (ii) with respect to a particular Facility in
the event that any Law

 



47  shall have been enacted or Order issued by any Governmental Authority that
directly prohibits the consummation of the Closing with respect to such
Facility, and such Law or Order shall have become final and non-appealable;
_provided_ that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __
_ 10.1(c)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach
of representation or warranty or failure to fulfill in any material respect
any covenants and agreements of such Party set forth in this Agreement was a
cause of the failure of the event or condition giving rise to the right to
terminate this Agreement;

(d) by either Seller or Purchaser if the other Party has (i) breached this
Agreement in any manner that would result in a failure of a Closing Condition
to be satisfied, or failed to Close upon satisfaction of its Closing
Conditions, and (ii) failed to cure any such breach within thirty (30) days of
receipt of written notice (a " _Cure Right_ ") of such breach (which notice
shall specify in reasonable detail the nature of such breach and the Partys
intention to terminate this Agreement if such breach is not cured); _provided_
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section_ __ _
10.1(d)_ shall not be available to any Party whose breach of representation or
warranty or failure to fulfill in any material respect any covenants and
agreements of such Party set forth in this Agreement was a cause of the
failure of the event or condition giving rise to the right to terminate the
Agreement; _provided further_ that this right to terminate (and the
restriction on a partys right to terminate) shall not apply to Facilities
for which a Closing has been delayed pursuant to Section 6.9 nor to Escrow
Facilities or Operator Delay Facilities for such period as such Facilities are
deemed to be either an "Escrow Facility" or "Operator Delay Facility" under
this Agreement (except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 10.4_); and
_provided further_ that there shall be no Cure Right or right to extension for
a failure to close by the Termination Date or Outside Date, or for the
failure of a party to close upon satisfaction of its Closing Conditions;

 

(e) by Purchaser with respect to all Facilities that are not yet
Transferred Facilities if a Material Adverse Effect occurs with respect to
the remaining Facilities in all of the Portfolios, taken as a whole;

(f) by Purchaser with respect to a particular Portfolio (excepting any
Facilities within such Portfolio that are Transferred Facilities), if a
Material Adverse Effect occurs with respect to such Portfolio.

 

(g) by Purchaser with respect to a particular Facility (that is not yet a
Transferred Facility) if the OTA with respect to such Facility is terminated
prior to the applicable Closing pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i), 9.1(b) or
9.1(c) of the OTA; or

 

(h) by Seller or Purchaser with regard to any Facility that does not become
a Transferred Facility by the Outside Date, even if such failure to become a
Transferred Facility is the result of a breach or default of the Terminating
Party (and in such event, with all applicable remedies of the non-terminating
Party preserved). 

10.2 Effect of Termination or Breach.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 10.4_, if this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 10.1(a), 10.1(b), 10.1(c), 10.1(e), 10.1(f)(with
respect to such Facilities), or 10.1(g)(with respect to such Facility(ies))_,
_10.1(h)(with respect to such (Facility(ies))_ , none of the Parties shall be
liable to the other Parties for any liabilities and damages that occurred
prior to such termination, for Facilities that are not Transferred Facilities,
other than liability for intentional, material breaches of this Agreement that
occurred prior to such termination. Further, except in the event of liability
for intentional and material breaches by Purchaser, Purchaser Parties,
Purchaser Assignees, or OTA Transferees, if the Initial Closing has not taken
place, the Deposit shall be returned to Purchaser, and if the Initial Closing
has taken place, any remaining Deposit allocated to Facilities that have not
yet become Transferred Facilities shall be returned to Purchaser.

 



48 (b) If an uncured material breach gives rise to a right of Seller
or Purchaser to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
10.1(d)_, then:

(i) If Purchaser is the breaching Party, Seller shall have the right to
keep the Deposit and be paid the Termination Payment as liquidated damages and
terminate the Agreement, but shall not have the right to sue for damages or
pursue specific performance. In the event the Initial Closing has occurred,
Seller shall have the right to keep any remaining portion of the Deposit and
be paid the Termination Payment as liquidated damages and terminate this
Agreement, but such termination will only be with regard to the Facilities
that are not yet Transferred Facilities; the Agreement shall remain in full
force and effect for all Transferred Facilities that have had a Closing.
Within five (5) Business Days after a termination giving Seller the right to
the Termination Payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.2(b)(i)_,
Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller such Termination Payment.
THE PARTIES ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT (a) IT WOULD BE IMPRACTICAL
OR EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE SELLERS ACTUAL DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF
PURCHASERS DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, AND (b) TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL OF
THE CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING ON THE DATE OF THIS AGREEMENT, THE SUM OF THE
DEPOSIT AND THE TERMINATION PAYMENT IS A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF SELLERS
ACTUAL DAMAGES IN SUCH EVENT. CONSEQUENTLY, IN THE EVENT OF PURCHASERS
DEFAULT UNDER THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO CLOSING, SELLERS SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
REMEDY AT LAW SHALL BE TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT AND TO RECEIVE THE DEPOSIT
AND THE TERMINATION PAYMENT, AND SELLER SHALL NOT IN ADDITION TO SUCH REMEDY
HAVE ANY RIGHTS TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER _SECTION 9.3_ FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE
NOT TRANSFERRED FACILITIES.

 

(ii) If Seller is the breaching Party, Purchaser shall have the right to a
return of the Deposit, terminate the Agreement, and sue for damages, or to
pursue specific performance solely to require closing (but not to obtain money
for losses; further, the Deposit shall be left in escrow pending the outcome
of any action for specific performance). In the event the Initial Closing has
occurred, Purchaser shall have the same rights but only with regard to the
Facilities that are not yet Transferred Facilities; the Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect for all Transferred Facilities that have had
a Closing. In the event that Purchaser is in material default under this
Agreement (including any material default that is waived by Seller), then its
remedy will be limited to termination and damages, and it shall have no
further right to specific performance.

(c) Upon a termination, this Agreement shall become void and of no further
force and effect, except for the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)-(c)_
(relating to confidentiality, as if the Agreement had Closed), _Article IX_
(relating to indemnification, _Article_ _X_ (relating to termination, breach,
and damages, and any related provisions of the Agreement to the extent
necessary to give effect to the remedies hereunder), and _Article XI_
(relating to certain miscellaneous provisions). If this Agreement is
terminated after the Initial Closing, then this Agreement shall become void
and of no further force and effect with regard to any Facilities that are not
yet Transferred Facilities, except for the provisions of _Section_ __ _
6.4(a)_ (relating to confidentiality), _Article IX_ (relating to
indemnification), _Article_ _X_ (relating to termination, breach and damages,
and any related provisions of the Agreement to the extent necessary to give
effect to the remedies hereunder), and _Article XI_  (relating to certain
miscellaneous provisions); _provided, however,_ this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect for all Transferred Facilities that have had a Closing.
Further, the non-disclosure agreement with BlueMountain Capital Management ("
_BMCM_ ") will remain in effect and obligations thereunder owed by BMCM will
remain in place.

 

(d) So long as not the result of an intentional breach committed for the
purpose of delaying a Closing, a Facility becoming an Escrow Facility shall
not be a default or breach by Seller, and a Facility becoming an Operator
Delay Facility shall not be a default or breach by Purchaser; _provided,
however_ , that the failure to return such Escrow Facility or Operator Delay
Facility to eligible status for

 



49  Closing prior to the Outside Date shall give rise to the termination
remedies provided in _Sections 10.3 and 10.4_ , respectively, and the failure
to make commercially reasonable, good faith efforts to return such Facility
to eligible status for Closing shall be a breach giving rise to remedies
pursuant to this _Article X._

 

10.3 Escrow Facilities. Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, in
the event of a material breach by Seller or its Affiliate of its
Representations and Warranties in _Article IV,_ its covenants in _Article VI_
with regard to one or more Facilities which breach does not rise to the level
of a Material Adverse Effect under this Agreement, or the failure by a
Facility to meet one or more of the closing conditions outlined in Section
7.1(a)(i)-(iii)(so long as not the result of any breach by Purchaser), or in
the event of a material breach by Seller or its Affiliate of
its representations, warrants or covenants in an OTA with regard to a
Facility regardless of whether such breach rises to the level of a Material
Adverse Effect as such term is defined in the OTA, then each such Facility as
to which the breach or the failure to meet a closing condition relates shall
be deemed an " _Escrow Facility_ " (or collectively, " _Escrow Facilities_ ").
Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement or any Schedule attached
hereto, all disclosures on _Schedule 4.4(j)_ or on _Schedule 4.8(e)-1_ (but
only regarding a denial of payment of new admissions or a scheduled exception
to Section 4.8(e)-1(ii)) or _Schedule 4.8(e)-2_ of an OTA, as well as any
Disclosure Update with respect to the foregoing (and with respect to a OTA as
the term "Disclosure Update" is defined in such OTA), shall be disregarded
for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 10.3_ in determining whether the
Facilities to which any such disclosure applies as of the applicable Closing
Date shall be deemed Escrow Facilities. Closing on the Escrow Facilities (and
payment of the Purchase Price allocated to the Escrow Facilities) shall be
postponed until no later than the Outside Date, to allow Seller, as
applicable, to use commercially reasonably efforts to cure the material
breach and cause such Facilities to come back into compliance, and after the
Initial Closing and subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.9(e)_, closings shall proceed
with respect to other Facilities that are not Escrow Facilities in accordance
with _Section_ __ _ 3.1_. The Closing with respect to the Escrow Facilities
pursuant to this Section shall take place on or before the last day of the
month that is thirty (30) days after the cause for such Facility being deemed
an Escrow Facility has been remedied; _provided, however,_ the Closing Date
for any Escrow Facility shall occur on or before the Outside Date. In the
event the Closing with respect to any Escrow Facility does not occur on or
before the Outside Date, then absent an agreement between the Parties to the
contrary, this Agreement shall terminate with respect to such Escrow Facility,
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Transfer Value of such Facility
under this Agreement, and any remaining Deposit allocated to such Facility
shall be returned to Purchaser.

 

10.4 Effect of Failure of Purchaser to Satisfy Certain Closing Conditions
or of OTA Transferee to Close under the OTA.

(a) In the event Purchaser fails to satisfy the Closing Condition set forth
in  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c)(v)_ in accordance with the timeline for Closing
set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.1_ (together with any Facility subject to
_Section_ __ _ 10.4(b)_ for which Regency is not the OTA Transferee, an "
_Operator Delay Facility_ "), (i) Purchaser shall use its good faith
commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy such Closing Condition as promptly
as practicable either with the initial OTA Transferee or, if the initial OTA
Transferee is deemed by the relevant Government Authority to be incapable of
satisfying such Closing Condition or if Purchaser otherwise determines in its
sole discretion, with a substitute OTA Transferee to which the applicable OTA
has been assigned, such substitute OTA Transferee to be selected by Purchaser
in its sole discretion and reasonably acceptable to Seller (it being
understood that an operator that is substantially similar to the OTA
Transferees that have executed OTAs as of the Closing shall be deemed to be
acceptable to Seller) (a " _Substitute OTA Transferee_ "), and (ii) the
Closing for such Operator Delay Facility shall be extended, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 10.4(c)_, until the earlier of (A) the last day of the month
that is thirty (30) days after the month in which Purchaser has satisfied such
Closing Condition as contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 10.4(a)_, or (B) the
Outside Date. In the event Purchaser is unable on or prior to the Outside
Date to satisfy the Closing Condition set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1(c_ _)(_
_v)_ with respect to the initial OTA Transferee or a Substitute OTA Transferee
then, at Sellers option, Seller may terminate this Agreement with respect to
such Operator Delay Facility, and the amount of the Deposit allocated to such
Facilities in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_ and the
Termination Payment shall be paid to Seller.

 



50 (b) In the event that either (x) an OTA Transferee fails to consummate the
transactions contemplated by the applicable OTA in accordance with the
timeline for Closing for the applicable Facility set forth in _Section_ __ _
3.1_ and the applicable Facility is not an Escrow Facility or subject to a
delayed Closing under _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ or (y) Seller terminates an OTA
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ thereof, then (i) Purchaser shall use its
good faith commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable OTA to be
assigned to a Substitute OTA Transferee as promptly as practicable, but in any
event within forty-five (45) days of the failure of the prior OTA Transferee
(provided any required acceptance by Seller with respect to the Substitute
OTA Transferee has not been unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (ii) the
Closing for such Facility shall be extended until the earlier of (A) the last
day of the month that is thirty (30) days after the month in which such
assignment occurs and the applicable Facility is otherwise eligible for
Closing under _Section_ __ _ 3.1_, or (B) the Outside Date; _provided_ that
if Regency is the OTA Transferee, then Purchaser shall not have a
substitution right under this _Section_ __ _ 10.4(b)_. In the event such
Closing does not occur on or prior to the Outside Date then, at Sellers
option, Seller may terminate this Agreement with respect to the applicable
Facility and the amount of the Deposit allocated to such Facility in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.5(b)_ and the Termination Payment shall be
paid to Seller.

 

(c) Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Purchaser shall
not have the right under this  _Section_ __ _ 10.4_ to designate more than
two (2) Substitute OTA Transferees with respect to an individual Facility;
_provided_ that if Regency is the OTA Transferee, then Purchaser shall not
have a substitution right under Section 10.4(b) (but for the avoidance of
doubt shall have substitution rights with respect to Regency under _Section_
__ _ 10.4(a)_). In the event the second Substitute OTA Transferee with
respect to a Facility is either deemed by the relevant Government Authority
to be incapable of satisfying the Closing Condition set forth in _Section_ __
_ 7.1(c)(v)_ or Regency or such Substitute OTA Transferee fails to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the applicable OTA on or prior to the date
on which the applicable Closing would otherwise have occurred under _Section_
__ _ 10.4(b)(ii)(A)_, then, at Sellers option, Seller may immediately
terminate this Agreement with respect to the applicable Facility, and the
amount of the Deposit allocated to such Facility in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 2.5(b)_ and the Termination Payment shall be paid to Seller.

 

10.5 Third Party Reports Following Termination. In connection with any
termination Purchaser agrees to promptly deliver to Seller an inventory of
all third party reports commissioned by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates
related to the Facilities or the Purchased Assets (including without
limitation title reports, environmental surveys, zoning reports and
the like)(collectively, the "Third Party Reports"). Upon request of Seller,
Purchaser will assign and promptly deliver to Seller all or any portion of the
Third Party Reports. In exchange for any such Third Party Reports assigned
to Seller, Seller agrees to pay Purchaser fifty percent (50%) of the
documented costs originally paid by Purchaser to the applicable third parties
for such Third Party Reports.

 

ARTICLE XI

 

MISCELLANEOUS

 

11.1 Disclosure Schedules. The information contained in the Disclosure
Schedules shall be deemed to qualify to the specific Section (or subsection,
as appropriate) of this Agreement to which it corresponds, and shall be
cumulative so that if the existence of the fact or item or its contents
disclosed in any particular Schedule is relevant to any other Schedule, then
such fact or item shall be deemed to be disclosed with respect to the other
Schedule to the extent such relevance is reasonably apparent whether or not a
specific cross-reference appears. The headings contained in the
Disclosure Schedules are included for convenience only, and are not intended
to limit the effect of the disclosures contained in such Schedule or to expand
the scope of the information required to be disclosed in such Schedule. 

 



51  Descriptions of documents in the Schedules are summaries only and are
qualified in their entirety by the specific terms of such documents. Matters
reflected in the Disclosure Schedules are not necessarily limited to matters
required by this Agreement to be reflected herein; additional matters are set
forth for informational purposes and the fact that any item of information is
disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be construed to mean that
such information is required to be disclosed by this Agreement. Any
information and the dollar thresholds set forth herein shall not be used as a
basis for interpreting the term "material" or other similar terms in
this Agreement or constitute an admission that such items are required to be
disclosed under this Agreement.

 

11.2 Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Parties shall bear its own expenses in connection with the negotiation and
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject
to the foregoing, no expenses of Seller relating in any way to the purchase
and sale of the Purchased Assets hereunder and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including legal, accounting or other professional expenses of Seller
shall be charged to or paid by Purchaser or included in any of the Assumed
Liabilities. No expenses of Purchaser relating in any way to the purchase and
sale of the Purchased Assets hereunder and the transactions contemplated
hereby, including legal, accounting or other professional expenses of
Purchaser shall be charged to or paid by any Seller or included in any of the
Excluded Liabilities. The foregoing shall not limit, however, any Partys
right to include such expenses in any claim for damages against any other
Party who breaches any legally binding provision of this Agreement to the
extent provided in this Agreement. The Parties agree that in the event of a
dispute as to whether Seller is entitled to the Termination Payment, the
prevailing party shall be entitled to the recovery of its reasonable
attorneys fees and costs.

 

11.3 Entirety of Agreement. This Agreement (including the Disclosure
Schedules and all other schedules and exhibits hereto which are incorporated
into and are a part of this Agreement), together with any certificates and
other instruments delivered hereunder, including the Closing Documents and the

prior negotiations, agreements and understandings, if any, whether written or
oral, and state in full all representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements that have induced this Agreement. Each Party agrees that in
dealing with third parties, no contrary representations will be made.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the non-disclosure agreement (the "NDA")
executed by BMCM will remain in effect and obligations thereunder owed by
BMCM are not superseded hereby.

and after such Closing Date for all notices with respect to such Facility.

11.5 Amendments; Waivers. This Agreement may be modified or amended only by
an instrument in writing, duly executed by Purchaser and Seller; _provided,
however,_ that this _Section_ __ _ 11.5 and Sections 11.7(a), (d) and (e),
11.10, 11.11, and 11.15_ (and any related definitions insofar as they
affect such Sections) may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise

more agents, trustees and/or other representatives on behalf of the Financing
Sources and/or a sufficient number of the Financing Sources in accordance with
the terms of the applicable commitment letter (including any "market flex"
provisions applicable thereto) and/or the definitive agreements relating to
the applicable Financing, as applicable). No waiver by any Party of any term,
provision, condition, covenant, agreement, representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement (or any breach thereof) shall be effective unless
it is in writing executed by the Party against which such waiver is to be
enforced. No waiver shall be deemed or construed as a further or continuing
waiver of any such term, provision, condition, covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty (or breach thereof) on any other occasion or as a
waiver of any other term, provision, condition, covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty (or of the breach of any other term, provision,
condition, covenant, agreement, representation or warranty) contained in this
Agreement on the same or any other occasion.

 

11.6 Counterparts; Facsimile. For the convenience of the Parties, this
Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts, each such executed
counterpart shall be deemed an original and all such counterparts together
shall constitute one and the same instrument. Facsimile or electronic .pdf
transmission of any signed original counterpart transmission shall be deemed
the same as the delivery of an original.

 



53 11.7 Assignment; Binding Nature; No Beneficiaries.

 

(a) This Agreement may not be assigned by any Party hereto (excluding any
collateral assignment for the benefit of the Financing Sources and except as
permitted by Section 6.17) without the written consent of the other Party
hereto, except that (i) the indemnification and other rights hereunder of a
Party may be assigned to any bank or other financial institution which is or
becomes a lender to such Party or any of its successors and assigns and (ii)
this Agreement or any portion hereof may be assigned by Purchaser to any of
its Affiliates, any Purchaser Party or any Purchaser Assignee without the
written consent of Seller or any Seller Party provided that Purchaser remains
liable for any pre-closing obligations under this Agreement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 3.5_. Any Purchaser Assignee, upon taking assignment, makes
all applicable representations and warranties, and covenants to all applicable
obligations, under this Agreement with regard to the Facilities and Purchased
Assets being assigned to such Purchaser Assignee, except to the extent a
Purchaser Assignee is not assigned or does not assume certain obligations
under this Agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no assignment by Purchaser
shall (i) expand any of Sellers obligations and liabilities hereunder or
change any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, the Transaction
Documents or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents; and (ii) be made if it would reasonably be expected to
prevent, or materially impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
Transaction Documents.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no assignment by Seller shall
(i) expand any of Purchasers obligations and liabilities hereunder or change
any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents or
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents;
(ii) relieve Seller of liability to Purchaser for all obligations and
liabilities to be performed by or on behalf of Seller hereunder or pursuant to
the Transaction Documents with respect to Purchaser and its Affiliates; and
(iii) be made if it would reasonably be expected to prevent, or materially
impede, interfere with, hinder or delay the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or the Transaction Documents.

 

(d) Except as otherwise set forth herein, this Agreement shall be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties and their
respective heirs, personal representatives, legatees, successors and permitted
assigns. Except as otherwise expressly provided in _Article IX_ , this
Agreement shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than
the Parties, the OTA Transferees and their respective heirs, personal
representatives, legatees, successors and permitted assigns. Each OTA
Transferee shall be a third party beneficiary of the representations and
warranties of Seller under _Article IV_ and the indemnification provisions of
_Article IX_ ; _provided, however,_ Seller shall have no obligation to
indemnify (whether under _Article IX_ or otherwise) both (i) Purchaser, or a
Purchaser Party or an assignee of Purchaser, and (ii) an OTA Transferee with
respect to any single Loss and shall not be required to pay duplicative
damages. Further, Seller shall not owe obligations to more than one of the
Purchaser Indemnified Parties with respect to any single Loss and shall not
be required to pay duplicative damages. For avoidance of doubt, multiple
Purchaser Indemnified Parties could incur separate Losses (i.e., not a "single
Loss") from the same matter for which indemnification is being sought.

(e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Financing Sources
shall be express third party beneficiaries of _Section_ __ _ 11.7(a), (d)
and (e)_ __ _ and Section_ __ _ 11.5, Section_ __ _ 11.10, Section_ __ _
11.11, and Section_ __ _ 11.15_, and each of such Sections shall expressly
inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources and the Financing Sources shall
be entitled to rely on and enforce the provisions of such Sections.

 

(f) In all of the foregoing instances of an assignment by Purchaser, prior
to the applicable Closing, Purchaser shall act as the representative and
agent for its Purchaser Parties and for any Purchaser Assignees, and Seller
need only deal directly with Purchaser. By taking any assignment,

 



54  Purchaser Assignees acknowledge and agree that they shall be bound by the
consents and any actions of Purchaser taken prior to the applicable Closing,
and that Purchaser shall act as their agent and representative in connection
with any modifications.

11.8 Headings. The headings in this Agreement are inserted for convenience
only and shall not constitute a part hereof.

11.9 Construction. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises under this Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the
provisions of this Agreement.

11.10 Governing Law.

 

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any
choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of Delaware
or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Seller (on behalf of
itself, the Seller Parties and their respective Affiliates and the
equityholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial
advisors, accountants, legal counsel, investment bankers, and other agents,
advisors and representatives of each of them) and each of the other parties
hereto agrees that any claim, controversy or dispute of any kind or nature
(whether based upon contract, tort or otherwise) against a Financing Source
that is in any way related to this Agreement, the Transferred Facilities, the
Purchased Assets, the Assumed Liabilities or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute against a Financing
Source arising out of or relating in any way to any Financing, shall be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of the State of New
York without regard to conflict of law principles (other than Sections 5-1401
and 5-1402 of the New York General Obligations Law); provided that (i) the
interpretation of the definition of Material Adverse Effect and whether or not
a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, (ii) the determination of the accuracy
of any representations and warranties made in this Agreement and whether as a
result of any inaccuracy thereof Purchaser or any of its Affiliates has the
right to terminate its obligations under this Agreement, or to decline to
consummate the transactions pursuant to this Agreement and (iii) the
determination of whether the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have
been consummated in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in each case,
shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted solely in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Delaware in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 11.10(a)_.

(c) The Parties hereby waive compliance with any applicable bulk sale or
bulk transfer law or other analogous legislation in force in any jurisdiction
of the U.S. in which the Purchased Assets are located.

 

11.11 Forum; Waiver of Jury Trial.

 

(a) Except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.6_, in any Action
between the Parties arising out of or relating to this Agreement, any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Transaction Document or any
of the transactions contemplated thereby, each of the Parties (i) irrevocably
and unconditionally consents and submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and
venue of either the state or federal courts located in the State of Delaware,
except to the extent submission to the jurisdiction of a court in another
state is necessary for an order of specific performance by a court in the
State of Delaware to be enforced, and (ii) irrevocably consents to service of
process by first-class certified mail, return receipt requested, postage
prepaid.

 



55 (b) Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives any and all right
to trial by jury of any claim or cause of action in any legal proceeding
arising out of or related to this Agreement or any Financing or the
transactions or events contemplated hereby or any course of conduct, course of
dealing, statements (whether verbal or written) or actions of any Party or
the actions of any Financing Source in connection with any Financing
(including any action, proceeding or counterclaim against any Financing
Source). The Parties each agree that any and all such claims and causes of
action shall be tried by the court without a jury. Each of the Parties hereto
further waives any right to seek to consolidate any such legal proceeding in
which a jury trial has been waived with any other legal proceeding in which
a jury trial cannot or has not been waived.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the
Parties hereto agrees (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and the
equityholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial
advisors, accountants, legal counsel, investment bankers, and other agents,
advisors and representatives of each of them) that it will not bring or
support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against the Financing Sources in any way relating to
this Agreement, the Transferred Facilities, the Purchased Assets, the Assumed
Liabilities or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including any dispute against a Financing Source arising out of or relating
in any way to any Financing or the performance thereof or the transactions
contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court
of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law
exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts
thereof).

 

11.12 Remedies Cumulative. Except as otherwise provided herein, the
remedies provided for or permitted by this Agreement shall be cumulative and
the exercise by any Party of any remedy provided for herein shall not preclude
the assertion or exercise by such Party of any other right or remedy provided
for herein.

 

11.13 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of
this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision of this Agreement.

11.14 Enforcement.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that any breach of this
Agreement could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary damages
alone. The Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to the valid termination
of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ and subject to _Section_
__ _ 10.2_, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in equity, but in all
events subject to the limitations set out in this Agreement. For
the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall not be entitled to specific performance
of Purchasers obligation to consummate a Closing hereunder.

 

(b) Nothing set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_ shall require Seller
to institute any proceeding for (or limit Sellers right to institute any
proceeding for) specific performance under this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_ prior
or as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Section_ __ _
10.1_, nor shall the commencement of any legal proceeding pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 11.14_ or anything set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 11.14_
restrict or limit Sellers right to terminate this Agreement in accordance
with the terms of _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ or pursue any other remedies under
this Agreement.

 



56 (c) To the extent any Party brings any Action to enforce specifically
the performance of the terms and provisions of this Agreement (other than an
Action to specifically enforce any provision that expressly survives
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 9.1_) when expressly
available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, each
Termination Date shall automatically be extended by (i) the amount of time
during which such Action is pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days, or (ii)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such Action.
The parties shall make commercially reasonable efforts to have such action
expedited and given advance treatment on the courts calendar.

 

11.15 No Recourse to Financing Sources. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Seller (on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and the
equityholders, directors, officers, employees, consultants, financial
advisors, accountants, legal counsel, investment bankers, and other agents,
advisors and representatives of each of them) (a) acknowledges and agrees
that it (and such other Persons) shall have no recourse against the Financing
Sources, and the Financing Sources shall be subject to no liability or claims
by Seller (or such other Persons) in connection with the Financing or in any
way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby, whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise, (b)
waives any rights or claims of any kind or nature that Seller or any such
other Persons may have against any Financing Source relating to this
Agreement, the Financing, or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
