unreasonably withheld (the " _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the holders
of Common Shares other than Excluded Shares, cash in respect of the aggregate
Amalgamation Consideration to be paid in exchange for issued and outstanding
Common Shares upon due surrender of the Certificates and other materials
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 2 (such amounts being hereinafter
referred to as the " _Payment Fund_ "). Parent will cause the Amalgamated
Company to cause the Paying Agent, pursuant to irrevocable instructions, to
make the payments provided for in the preceding sentence out of the Payment
Fund. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any other purpose, except as
provided in this Agreement. The Paying Agent shall invest any funds held by it
for purposes of this Section 2.07 as directed by Parent, on a daily basis;
provided that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the
United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or
better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or a combination of the foregoing or in certificates of deposit,
bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with
capital exceeding $1 billion, and, in any such case, no such instrument shall
have a maturity exceeding three months. Any interest and other income
resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. Parent shall pay, or
shall cause the Amalgamated Company to pay, to Dissenting Shareholders the
fair value of the Dissenting Shares in accordance with the requirements of
Sections 106(6A) and 106(6B) of the Companies Act.

 

 **(b)** Promptly following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Amalgamated Company to cause the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of
Common Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time a letter of transmittal
(the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") that shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of Certificates to the Paying Agent and which sets forth the
procedures by which holders of Certificates, and the holders of book shares,
which are uncertificated, may receive the Amalgamation Consideration. Upon a
holder complying with such procedures, the Paying Agent will deliver to such
holders cash in an amount (without interest, subject to applicable
withholding for Taxes, levies, imposts or other governmental charges) equal
to the number of Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) owned by such
Person

 



 



 

14

     

immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Amalgamation
Consideration. All such Certificates shall forthwith be canceled and book
accounts shall be canceled. If payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the Certificate surrendered or book account is
registered, it shall be a condition of payment that the Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for
transfer and that all documentation for a book account transfer is received
and that the Person requesting such payment pay any transfer or similar Taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder
or establish to the satisfaction of the Amalgamated Company that such Tax has
been paid or is not applicable.

 

 **(c)** If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the
Amalgamated Company, or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Amalgamated Company or the Paying Agent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Amalgamation Consideration with respect to
the Common Shares formerly represented thereby.

 

 **(d)** Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the
Company for six months after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
Amalgamated Company. Any former shareholders of the Company who have not
complied with Section 2.07(b) prior to the end of such six-month period shall
thereafter look only to the Amalgamated Company (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of their claim for the
Amalgamation Consideration. None of Parent, Amalgamation Sub or the
Amalgamated Company shall be liable to any holder of Common Shares for any
monies delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates (or book shares) shall not have been surrendered prior to six
years after the Effective Time (or such earlier date as shall be immediately
prior to the date that such unclaimed funds would otherwise become subject to
any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law), unclaimed funds payable with
respect to such Certificates (or book shares) shall become the property of the
Amalgamated Company, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 

 **(e)** Parent, the Amalgamated Company or the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold any applicable Taxes from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Common Shares. To the
extent that amounts are properly deducted and withheld and paid over to the
appropriate Tax Authority by Parent, the Amalgamated Company or the Paying
Agent, such deducted and withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the shareholder in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made by Parent, the Amalgamated Company or the
Paying Agent.

 



 



 

15

     

 **2.08 Adjustments to Prevent Dilution**. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued Common Shares shall have been
changed into a different number of shares or a different class, in either case
by reason of a share consolidation, reclassification, share split (including a
reverse share split), share dividend or distribution, recapitalization,
amalgamation, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other
similar transaction, the Amalgamation Consideration shall be equitably
adjusted.

 

 **2.09 Stock Options and Restricted Shares**. At the Effective Time, each
option (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ") (whether or not then vested or
exercisable) to purchase or acquire Common Shares granted to Employees,
directors, or independent contractors of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries under the Companys 2003 Long Term Incentive Plan or any other
incentive plan of the Company (or agreement related thereto) (each, a "
_Company Incentive Plan_ ") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than five Business Days after the Effective Time), a cash payment, rounded to
the nearest penny, equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of (i) the
Amalgamation Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price of such
Company Stock Option, multiplied by (b) the number of shares covered by such
Company Stock Option, less (c) any required withholding Taxes or, if there is
no such excess, such Company Stock Option shall be cancelled without
consideration. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall waive any
vesting conditions applicable to any shares of restricted stock (each, a "
_Company Restricted Share_ ") granted pursuant to any Company Incentive Plan,
and such Company Restricted Shares shall be treated the same as other Common
Shares for purposes of this Agreement.

 

 **2.10 Warrants**. At the Effective Time, each warrant (whether or not then
vested or exercisable) to purchase Common Shares (each, a " _Company Warrant_
") that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time upon the surrender of a Company Warrant, a cash payment,
rounded to the nearest penny, equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any,
of (i) the Amalgamation Consideration over (ii) the per share exercise price
of such Company Warrant, multiplied by (b) the number of shares covered by
such Company Warrant, less (c) any required withholding Taxes.

 

 **ARTICLE 3**

the property owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except where
the failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing

accordance and complied in all material respects with all applicable legal
requirements (except if, and to the extent that, such Company SEC Document was
subsequently amended, superseded or supplemented by a filing made prior to the
date hereof). No Subsidiary of the Company is required to make any filings
with the SEC. No Company SEC Document contained, when filed (and, if amended,

all exhibits and schedules thereto, required to be filed with or submitted to
the appropriate Insurance Regulator of the jurisdiction in which it is
domiciled and to any other jurisdiction where required on forms prescribed or

_Company Annual Statement_ "), together with all exhibits and schedules
thereto, financial statements relating thereto and any actuarial opinion,
affirmation or certification filed in connection therewith and each quarterly
statement so filed for the quarterly periods ended after January 1, 2008 (each

respects, to the extent required by and in conformity with SAP, the statutory
financial condition of such Company Insurance Subsidiary at the date thereof

respect to Company Annual Statements and Company Quarterly Statements that
have not been cured or otherwise resolved to the satisfaction of such
Insurance Regulator.

 **(a)** The Company conducts all of its insurance operations through its
Subsidiaries. Except as otherwise would not individually or in the aggregate
be reasonably expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, all
policies, binders, slips, treaties, certificates, annuity contracts and
participation agreements and other agreements of insurance or reinsurance,
whether individual or group, in effect as of the date hereof (including all
applications, supplements, endorsements, riders and ancillary agreements in
connection therewith) (the " _General Insurance Contracts_ ") that are issued
by the Company or its Subsidiaries and any and all marketing materials are, to
the extent required under applicable Law, on forms approved by the applicable
Insurance Regulator or which have been filed with and not objected to by such

charged conform thereto in all material respects and such premiums comply in
all material respects with the insurance or reinsurance statutes, regulations
and rules applicable thereto.

 

 **(b)** Each reinsurance and coinsurance treaty or agreement, including
retrocessional agreements, to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
a party, under which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have any existing
rights, duties, obligations or liabilities or which is otherwise applicable to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, assuming its due authorization,
execution and delivery by the other party or parties thereto, is valid and
binding in all material respects in accordance with its terms and is in full
force and effect, except for such treaties or agreements the failure of which
to be valid and binding or in full force and effect would not individually or
in the aggregate reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Any Subsidiary of the Company that has ceded reinsurance pursuant to
any such treaty or agreement is entitled to take full credit in its financial
statements for all amounts recoverable (net of any reserve for collectibility
under such treaty or agreement) with such credit accounted for (i) pursuant to
SAP, as a reduction of such Subsidiarys loss reserves and (ii) pursuant to
U.S. GAAP, as a reinsurance recoverable asset. The Company has no material
unrecoverable reinsurance balances, other than as reserved on the Company
Financial Statements. All intragroup reinsurance agreements have been filed
and approved in accordance with all applicable insurance holding company acts.

 

 **(c)** The reserves for future payment of benefits, losses, claims, expenses
and similar purposes (including claims litigation) under all insurance
policies, reinsurance agreements or retrocessional agreements to which any
Company Insurance Subsidiary is a party reflected in, or included with, the
financial statements set forth in the Company Annual Statements, the Company
Quarterly Statements and the Company Financial Statements (i) have been
computed in all material respects in accordance with

 



 



 

21

     

presently accepted actuarial standards consistently applied and prepared in
accordance with applicable SAP or U.S. GAAP consistently applied, (ii) have
been computed based on assumptions that are consistent in all material
respects with applicable Contract provisions and with those used to compute
the corresponding items in the Company Annual Statements, Company Quarterly

in all material respects in accordance with the requirements for reserves
established by the Insurance Regulator of the state or other jurisdiction of
domicile of each Company Insurance Subsidiary.

 

 **(d)** Prior to the date hereof, the Company has delivered or made available
to Parent a true and complete copy of any actuarial reports prepared by
actuaries, independent or otherwise, with respect to the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries since January 1, 2006, and all attachments, addenda, supplements
and modifications thereto (the " _Company Actuarial Analyses_ "). At the time
each Company Actuarial Analyses was prepared, the Company believed in good
faith that it was prepared using appropriate modeling and other procedures
accurately applied, if relevant, and in conformity with generally accepted
actuarial standards consistently applied, and that the projections contained
therein were properly prepared in accordance with the assumptions
stated therein. The information and data furnished by the Company or its
Subsidiaries to its independent actuaries in connection with the preparation
of the Company Actuarial Analyses were, at the time furnished, accurate and
complete in all material respects.

the filing of the application to register the Amalgamation pursuant to the
Companies Act and the consent of the Minister to the Amalgamation, and (vii)
such other consents or notifications the failure of which to be obtained or

result in a Company Material Adverse Effect, or prevent or materially delay
the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 **(b)** Neither the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by
the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the Amalgamation or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will (i) conflict with or

expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect or which would prevent or
delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
There are no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened claims
for indemnification by the Company in favor of directors, officers, Employees
and agents of the Company that would reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

 

 **3.09 Material Contracts**.

 

 **(a)** Each Material Contract by which the Company, or any of its
Subsidiaries or the respective assets, business or operations thereof is bound

delivery by, the other party or parties thereto) valid and binding upon the
Company or its Subsidiaries party thereto and, to the Knowledge of the
Company, each other party thereto (except as may be limited by bankruptcy,

Company Material Adverse Effect.

currently conducted and to own, lease or operate their properties and assets
(collectively, the " _Company Permits_ "), except for failures to hold such
Company Permits that individually or in the aggregate do not have, and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with the terms of the Company
Permits and, to the Companys Knowledge, there has occurred no violation of,
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under, or event
giving to any Person any right of termination, amendment or cancellation (with

review by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any Company Permits is pending or threatened, nor has any
Governmental Authority indicated an intention to conduct the same, against the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, alleging any violation of any Law, except,
in each case, for those investigations or reviews the outcomes of which have
not had, and would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. Since December 31, 2005, the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries has filed all material periodic statements, together with all

respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries which, by application of
similar principles, reasonably could be expected to result in a proposed
deficiency for any other period not so examined, and there are not now in
force any waivers or agreements by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for
the extension of time for the assessment of any material Tax, nor has any such

ARTICLE 6

 

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS

 

 **6.01 Preparation of the Proxy Statement; Shareholders Meetings.**

 

 **(a)** As promptly as reasonably practicable following the execution of this
Agreement, the Company shall with the cooperation of Parent (i) prepare the
proxy statement relating to the Company Shareholder Meeting (including any
amendments and supplements thereto) (the " _Proxy Statement_ "), (ii)
determine whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with, any
Governmental Authority is required, or any consents, approvals or waivers are
required to be obtained from parties to any Material Contracts, in connection
with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(iii) seek any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers or make any such
filings, furnish information required in connection therewith or with the
Proxy Statement and seek timely to obtain any such actions, consents,
approvals or waivers. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
of Parent and the Company shall furnish all information concerning it as may
reasonably be requested by the other party in connection with the preparation
of the Proxy Statement. The Company will cause the Proxy Statement to comply
as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act. The Company shall use reasonable best efforts to respond to any
comments of the SEC or its staff and have the Proxy Statement cleared by the
SEC as promptly as practicable. The Company shall, as promptly as practicable
after receipt thereof, provide Parent copies of any written comments and
advise Parent of any oral comments with respect to the Proxy Statement
received by the SEC. The Company shall cooperate and provide Parent with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement prior to filing such documents
with the SEC, and will provide Parent with a copy of all such filings made
with the SEC. If at any time prior to obtaining the Required Company Vote, any
party discovers any information relating to Company, Parent or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or any of their respective officers, directors or
Affiliates which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that such document would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and, as soon as reasonably practicable, the
Company shall file with the SEC an appropriate amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement describing such information and, to the extent required by
Law, the Company will disseminate such information to the shareholders of the
Company.

 

 **(b)** Except as otherwise contemplated by this Agreement, no amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement shall be made without the approval of
Parent, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence, the Company, pursuant to,
and subject to the terms of, Section 6.05, may amend or supplement the Proxy
Statement pursuant to a Qualifying Amendment to effect such a change, and in
such event, the right of approval set forth in this Section 6.01(b) shall
apply only with respect to information relating to Parent or its business,
financial condition or results of operations, and shall be subject to the
right of each party to have its board of directors deliberations and
conclusions accurately described. A " _Qualifying Amendment_ " means an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement to the extent that it contains
(i) a change in, or withdrawal, modification, qualification or amendment of,
the recommendation of the Companys board of directors (or a committee
thereof) as permitted by Section 6.05(c), (ii) a statement of the reasons of

 



 



 

38

     

the Companys board of directors (or a committee thereof) for making such
change in, or withdrawal, modification, qualification or amendment to, the
recommendation of the Companys board of directors (or a committee thereof)
and (iii) additional information reasonably related to the foregoing.

 

 **6.02 Board Actions and Shareholders Meeting**. The Company shall take all
necessary steps, in accordance with applicable Law and its Organizational
Documents, duly to call, give notice of, convene and hold, as soon as
reasonably practicable after responding to all comments of the SEC or its
staff to the Proxy Statement to the satisfaction of the SEC, a meeting of the
holders of the Common Shares (as adjourned or postponed in accordance with
applicable Law and Companys Organizational Documents, the " _Company
Shareholder Meeting_ ") on a date mutually agreed between Company and Parent,
which date shall be as promptly as practicable and in no event later than
forty five (45) calendar days after the first mailing of the definitive Proxy
Statement. The Company shall mail, or cause to be mailed, the Proxy Statement
to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable. Except as otherwise
permitted by Section 6.01(b) and Section 6.05, the Companys board of
directors (or a committee thereof) shall recommend approval of this Agreement,
the Bermuda Amalgamation Agreement, the Amalgamation and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the holders of the Common
Shares and include in the Proxy Statement such recommendation, as well as the
opinion of the Companys financial advisor to the effect that the Amalgamation
Consideration is fair, from a financial point of view, to the holders of
Common Shares. The Company agrees that (a) except in order to obtain a
required quorum or as otherwise required under applicable Law, it shall not
adjourn, postpone or cancel (or propose to adjourn, postpone or cancel) the
Company Shareholder Meeting and (b) it shall use its reasonable best efforts
to obtain the requisite quorum and to solicit and obtain the Required Company
Vote.

 

 **6.03 Access to Information; Confidentiality.**

 

 **(a)** Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company will (i)
give Parent and its authorized representatives (including counsel, financial
advisors and accountants) and the lenders to Parent and Amalgamation Sub (and
their counsel and advisors) reasonable access during normal business hours to
all key employees, and key facilities and to all books and records of the
Company and its Subsidiaries and which access shall be subject to the
reasonable security procedures of the Company and its Subsidiaries and (ii)
cause the Companys officers and key employees and those of its Subsidiaries
and its auditors, counsel and financial advisors to cooperate with Parent in
its investigation of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to
furnish Parent and its authorized representatives and the lenders to Parent
(and their counsel and advisors) with such financial and operating data and
other information with respect to the business, properties and personnel of
the Company and its Subsidiaries as Parent may from time to time reasonably
request; provided, however, that the Company may withhold (A) any document or
information that is subject to the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a
third party, (B) any document or information, if such disclosure would violate
applicable Law or (C) such portions of documents or information that are
subject to attorney-client privilege and the provision of which, as

 



 



 

39

     

determined by Companys counsel, may eliminate the privilege pertaining to
such portion of such documents, in each case, only after the Company has
endeavored in good faith to enter into arrangements or obtain consents or
waivers that would permit the Company to make such document or information
available to Parent, but has failed to enter into such arrangements or obtain
such consents or waivers.

 

 **(b)** Each of Parent and Amalgamation Sub will hold and will cause its
authorized representatives (including the lenders to Parent and Amalgamation
Sub and their counsel and advisors) to hold in confidence all documents and
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent or
Amalgamation Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement pursuant to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between
Parent and the Company, dated January 8, 2008 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ ").

 

 **6.04 Reasonable Best Efforts**.

 

 **(a)** Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party
will use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under this Agreement and applicable Law to consummate the
Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, including preparing and filing
as promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary
applications, notices, filings and other documents and to obtain as promptly
as practicable all required Permits from any Governmental Authority and all
other consents, waivers, Orders, approvals, Permits and clearances necessary
or advisable to be obtained from any third party or any Governmental Authority
in order to consummate the Amalgamation or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in limitation of the
foregoing, each party hereto agrees (i) to make, as promptly as practicable,

Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which filing shall be made in any
event within 15 Business Days of the date hereof), (ii) to make or cause to be
made all filings that are required or advisable by applicable Law of Bermuda,
Ireland, the United Kingdom, the European Union or the United States or such
other Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
with the objective of obtaining the consents set forth in Sections 3.07 and
(iii) in each case, to supply as promptly as practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act or any such other Law and to use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act
or any such other Law as soon as practicable.

 

 **(b)** Each of Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts
referenced in Section 6.04(a), use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry,
including any proceeding initiated by a private party, (ii) promptly inform
the other party of the status of any of the matters contemplated hereby,
including providing the other party with a copy of any written communication

party to, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice, the Federal
Trade Commission or any other Governmental Authority and of any written
communication (or summary of oral communications) received or given in
connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case regarding any
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) to the extent
practicable, consult with each other in advance of any meeting or conference
with any such Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by
a private party, with any such other Person.

 

 **(c)** Parent shall as promptly as practicable make all Form A filings
required by Insurance Regulators in the United States (the " _Form A Filings_
") following the execution of this Agreement (which filings shall be made in
any event within 15 Business Days of the date hereof). Parent and the Company
shall supply promptly any additional information and documentary material that
may be requested by such Insurance Regulators in connection therewith. Parent
agrees to provide a draft of its Form A Filings to the Company for its review
and to consult with the Company relating to any issues arising as a result of
the Companys review, prior to the submission of the Form A Filings; provided,
that such consultation shall not delay the timely filing of the Form A
Filings or any amendments or supplements thereto and it being agreed that the
final determination as to the content of the Form A Filings or any amendments
or supplements thereto shall remain with Parent. Parent agrees to provide the
Company with a copy of its Form A Filings and each amendment or supplement
thereto in final form upon submission thereof.

 

 **(d)** In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this Section 6.04, if (i) any objections are asserted with
respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under any Law, (ii)
any administrative or judicial Action is instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) by any Governmental Authority or private party challenging the
Amalgamation or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
as violative of any Law or which would otherwise prevent, delay or impede the
consummation, or otherwise materially reduce the contemplated benefits, of the
Amalgamation or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
or (iii) any Law is enacted, entered, promulgated or enforced by a
Governmental Authority that would make the Amalgamation or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or would otherwise
prevent, delay or impede the consummation, or otherwise materially reduce the
contemplated benefits, of the Amalgamation or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, then each of the Company and Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or Actions so as to
permit the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including, selling, holding separate or otherwise disposing of or conducting
its or its Subsidiaries business or assets in a specified manner, or agreeing
to sell, hold separate or otherwise dispose of or conduct its or its
Subsidiaries business or assets in a specified manner, which would resolve
such objections or Actions or eliminate such illegality.

 

 **(e)** Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.04 shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.02(b) or 8.02(c) so long as
such party has otherwise complied with its obligations under this Section 6.04
prior to such termination.

 



 



 

41

     

 **(f)** Each of the Company and Parent shall, if any "moratorium," "control
share," "fair price" or other anti-takeover Law becomes applicable to this
Agreement, the Amalgamation, or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions so that such
Law will cease to be applicable to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or ensure that the Amalgamation and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the
effect of such Law on this Agreement, the Amalgamation and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

 **6.05 Acquisition Proposals** _._

 

 **(a)** From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article 8, the Company
will not, and will cause its Subsidiaries and each officer, director,
employee, consultant, financial advisor, auditor, investment banker, attorney,
accountant, agent or other advisor or representative (collectively, the "
_Representatives_ ") of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or
facilitate (including by way of furnishing information) the making by, or take
any action that is reasonably expected to lead to the making by, any Person
(other than Parent) of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) engage in any
discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide access to the Companys
books, receipts, properties or employees or furnish to any Person any
confidential information or data with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
any inquiries with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) enter into
any agreement, understanding or arrangement with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, or approve or recommend or propose to approve or recommend any
Acquisition Proposal or any agreement, arrangement or understanding relating
to an Acquisition Proposal (or resolve or authorize or propose to agree to do
any of the foregoing); provided that nothing contained in this Section 6.05(a)
shall prohibit the Company from furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any Person that has expressed a bona fide
written interest in making an Acquisition Proposal after the date of this
Agreement, if (i) the board of directors of the Company (or a committee
thereof) by a majority vote determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys outside counsel and financial advisors, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal, (ii) the Required Company Vote has not yet been obtained, and (iii)
prior to its receipt of confidential information such Person enters into a
confidentiality agreement with the Company on terms that are no less favorable
to the Company than the corresponding terms contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement. The Company shall notify Parent of having received any written
expression of interest in making an Acquisition Proposal (which notice shall
be provided orally and in writing and shall identify the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and set forth the material terms thereof) no later than
twenty-four (24) hours after its receipt thereof, and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed as to the status of any such proposal and any

 



 



 

42

     

such discussions or negotiations, including with respect to any material
modifications to the terms of any Acquisition Proposal. Neither the Company
nor its Subsidiaries will enter into any confidentiality agreement with any
Person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries from providing such information to Parent. Immediately
after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the Company will and will
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to (i) cease and
terminate any existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal unless
any such Person makes a Superior Proposal following the date hereof and (ii)
fully enforce the provisions of any confidentiality agreements entered into by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or their respective representatives),
including by not waiving or otherwise modifying any "standstill" or similar
restriction contained therein.

 

 **(b)** " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean a bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal with respect to which the board of directors of the Company (or a
committee thereof) has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal advisors and taking into account all
relevant factors, including the identity of the offeror and all legal,
financial, regulatory and other aspects of the proposal, including the terms
of any financing, that if accepted, such Acquisition Proposal would result in
a transaction more favorable from a financial point of view to the Companys
shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided,
that solely for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal," the term
Acquisition Proposal shall have the meaning assigned to such term in Section
1.01, except that each reference to "20%" in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal shall be deemed to be a reference to "50%."

 

 **(c)** The board of directors of the Company (or a committee thereof) shall,
at any time prior to receipt of the Required Company Vote, be permitted to (i)
elect not to recommend to the Companys shareholders that they give the
Required Company Vote, (ii) withdraw, modify, qualify or amend its
recommendation to the Companys shareholders that they give the Required
Company Vote or (iii) recommend to the Companys shareholders any Superior
Proposal other than the Amalgamation and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, but only if, in each case, (A) such action is taken in response to
an Acquisition Proposal and that did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 6.05 and the board of directors of the Company (or a committee
thereof) by a majority vote determines, in its good faith judgment and
after consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that
such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company shall
have notified Parent in writing at least three Business Days in advance of its
intention to effect such withdrawal, recommendation, modification,
qualification or amendment (such, a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ "), which
Notice of Superior Proposal shall specify the material terms and conditions of
such Superior Proposal, and shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent
during such three Business Day period (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement
such that such Acquisition Proposal would no longer be determined in good
faith by the board of directors of the Company (or committee thereof) to
constitute a Superior Proposal.

 



 



 

43

     

 **(d)** Nothing herein shall limit the Companys ability to comply in good
faith, to the extent applicable, with Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2 under the Exchange
Act with regard to a tender or exchange offer; provided, however, that neither
the Company nor the Companys board of directors (nor any committee thereof)
shall (i) recommend that the shareholders of the Company tender their Common
Shares in connection with any such tender or exchange offer (or otherwise
approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal) or (ii) withdraw or modify the
Companys recommendation, unless in each case such action would otherwise
comply with the terms of this Section 6.05.

 

 **6.06 Employee Benefit Plans** _._ Parent and the Company agree that, except
as otherwise provided herein (including as set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter or the Parent Disclosure Letter, as applicable) and unless otherwise
mutually agreed in writing, the Company Plans in effect at the date of this
Agreement shall remain in effect after the Effective Time with respect to
Employees covered by such plans at the Effective Time. Parent shall cause the
Amalgamated Company to assume, recognize and give effect to all of the change
in control provisions with respect to the severance of Employees as set forth
in each of the contracts listed in the Company Disclosure Letter, in
accordance with the terms thereof.

consummated, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such Expenses, except as otherwise provided in Section 6.08 and
except that if the Amalgamation is consummated, the Amalgamated Company shall
pay, or cause to be paid, any and all property or transfer taxes imposed on
the parties hereto in connection with the Amalgamation.

 

 **6.08 Indemnification; Directors and Officers Insurance** _._

 

 **(a)** For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
the Amalgamated Company to and the Amalgamated Company shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
present and former directors and officers of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against all Losses
incurred in connection with any Action, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative related to the fact that such person was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, arising out of
or pertaining to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including the Amalgamation and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement), or taken by them at the request of the Company or any of the
Companys Subsidiaries, whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the
Effective Time. Each Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
reasonable expenses incurred in the defense of any Action from the Amalgamated
Company within ten Business Days of receipt by the Amalgamated Company from
the Indemnified Party of a request therefor; provided that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by applicable Law, to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such person is not entitled to indemnification. The
Amalgamated

 



 



 

44

     

Company shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment
in any proceeding or threatened Action (and in which indemnification could be
sought by such Indemnified Party), unless such settlement, compromise or
consent includes an unconditional release of an Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents.

 

 **(b)** Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall cause Amalgamation Sub to
amend the indemnification and exculpation provisions of its Bye-laws such that
after such amendment the Bye-Laws comply with this Section 6.08(b) as of and
after the Effective Time. For a period of six years following the Closing
Date, Parent shall (and shall cause the Amalgamated Company and its
Subsidiaries to) cause the Bye-Laws (and other similar Organizational
Documents) of the Amalgamated Company and its Subsidiaries to contain
provisions with respect to indemnification and exculpation that are at least
as favorable as the indemnification and exculpation provisions contained in
the Bye-Laws (or other similar Organizational Documents) of the Company and
its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time, and during such six
year period, such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in any respect, adverse to the Indemnified Parties, except as
required by Law. Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation and
indemnification for acts or omissions in favor of the Indemnified Parties
occurring prior to or at the Effective Time as provided in the Companys Bye-
Laws or in any agreement listed in the Company Disclosure Letter shall be
assumed by the Amalgamated Company from and after the Closing and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms from the
Closing until the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date.

 

 **(c)** The Company may (with the consent of Parent, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld) obtain as of the Closing "tail" insurance policies with
a claims period of at least six years from the Closing Date with respect to
the directors and officers liability insurance in amount and scope at least
as favorable as the coverage applicable to the Companys directors and
officers as of the date hereof (the " _Tail Policy_ "). The premium of such
Tail Policy shall be no more than the amount set forth in the Company
Disclosure Letter. If the Company does not obtain the Tail Policy prior to the
Closing, for a period of six years from the Closing Date, Parent shall cause
to be maintained in effect policies of at least the same coverage as the
policies of directors and officers liability insurance maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the _"D andO
Insurance_") for the benefit of those persons who are covered by such policies
on the Closing Date with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Closing, to the extent that such liability insurance can be maintained at a
cost to Parent not greater than 250 percent of the last annualized premium for
the current directors and officers liability insurance as set forth in the
Company Disclosure Letter; provided that, if such insurance cannot be so
maintained or obtained at such cost, Parent shall cause the Amalgamated
Company to maintain or obtain as much of such insurance as can be so
maintained or obtained (not to exceed six years from the Closing Date) at a
cost equal to 250 percent of the last annualized premium for such insurance.

 



 



 

45

     

 **(d)** Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Action
(whether arising before, at or after the Closing Date) is made against any
party covered by directors and officers liability insurance, on or prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, the provisions of this Section 6.08
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such Action.

 

 **(e)** If the Amalgamated Company or any of its successors or assigns shall
(i) consolidate or amalgamate with or merge into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation,
amalgamation or merger or (ii) transfer all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Amalgamated
Company shall assume all of the obligations of the Amalgamated Company set
forth in this Section 6.08.

 

 **(f)** The obligations under this Section 6.08 shall not be terminated,
amended or otherwise modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (or any other person who is a beneficiary under the DandO
Insurance or the Tail Policy (and their heirs and representatives)) without
the prior written consent of such affected Indemnified Party or other person
who is a beneficiary under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy (and their
heirs and representatives). Each of the Indemnified Parties or other persons
who are beneficiaries under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy (and their
heirs and representatives) are intended to be third party beneficiaries of
this Section 6.08, with full rights of enforcement as if a party thereto. The
rights of the Indemnified Parties (and other persons who are beneficiaries
under the DandO Insurance or the Tail Policy (and their heirs and
representatives)) under this Section 6.08 shall be in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights that such persons may have under the
memorandum of association, bye-laws or other Organizational Documents, any and
all indemnification agreements of or entered into by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or applicable Law (whether at law or in equity).

 

 **6.09 Advice of Change**. The Company shall, upon obtaining Knowledge of any
of the following, give prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall, upon
obtaining Knowledge of any of the following, give prompt notice to the
Company, of (a) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence
or non-occurrence of which would be reasonably likely to cause any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement, which is
qualified as to materiality, to be untrue or inaccurate, or any representation
or warranty of such party not so qualified, to be untrue or inaccurate in any
material respect, at or prior to the Closing Date, (b) any failure in any
material respect of any of the Company, Parent or Amalgamation Sub, as the
case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement
to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder, (c) the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which would be
likely to cause any condition to the obligations of any party to effect the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement not to be satisfied, (d) any
notice or other written communication from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (e) any
Actions (or communications indicating that the same may be contemplated)
commenced or threatened against the Company, Parent or Amalgamation Sub, as
the case may be, or any of their respective Subsidiaries which, if pending on
the date of this Agreement, would have been required to have been disclosed
pursuant to Section 3.08 or Section 4.04

 



 



 

46

     

or which relate to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (f) any notice or other communication from any third party
alleging that the consent of such third party is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that
the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 6.09 shall not cure any
breach or non-compliance arising out of the matter(s) set forth in the notice
or limit or otherwise affect the rights or remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.

 

 **6.10 Public Announcements**. Each of Parent and the Company will consult
with the other and provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon, before issuing any press release, making any filing with the SEC or
otherwise making any public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and shall not issue any such press release,
make any such SEC filing or make any such public statement prior to such
consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, the Companys
Organizational Documents or under any listing agreement or applicable rules of
Nasdaq or any other securities exchange.

or adopted a final Law or Order or taken any other final Action restraining,
enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the transactions contemplated by this

 **(a)** In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of

to this Article 8, this Agreement (other than Sections 6.03(b)
(confidentiality), 6.07 (Fees and Expenses), 8.05 (Effect of Termination and
Abandonment) and Article 9 (Miscellaneous)) shall become void and of no effect
with no liability on the part of any party (or of any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents, legal and financial advisors or other
representatives); provided that no such termination shall relieve any party of
any liability or damages resulting from any willful and material breach of any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement; provided further that any failure by Parent and Amalgamation Sub to
have immediately available funds necessary for the payment of the aggregate
amounts payable pursuant to Article 2 will be deemed a willful and material
breach hereunder if, as a result of such failure, the parties are unable to or
do not (i) timely obtain the Requisite Regulatory Approvals or (ii) timely
consummate the Amalgamation or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 **(b)** Notwithstanding Section 6.07, if this Agreement is terminated by the
Company pursuant to Section 8.03 or by Parent pursuant to Section 8.04, the
Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for all Expenses incurred in
connection with the execution of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $1 million and pay to
Parent the Company Termination Fee in cash by wire transfer in immediately
available funds to an account designated by Parent, concurrently with and as a
condition to such termination. The parties agree that the foregoing liquidated
damages are reasonable considering all the circumstances existing as of the
date hereof and constitute the parties good faith estimate of the actual
Losses reasonably expected to result from the termination of this Agreement
as described in this Section 8.05(b). Except as contemplated by Section 6.07,
Parent agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, Parents right to
payment of such liquidated damages as provided in this Section 8.05(b) shall
be its sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses or Liability arising out of or
in connection with any termination of this Agreement as described in this
Section 8.05(b).

 

 **(c)** If this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company or Parent pursuant
to (A) Section 8.02(a) (other than due to any failure to obtain any Requisite
Regulatory Approval required by Section 7.01(b) that is not caused by a breach
by the Company of its obligations under Section 6.04) or (B) Section 8.02(b),
or (ii) by Parent pursuant to Section 8.02(c), and, in each case, at any time
after the date of this Agreement a bona fide Acquisition Proposal shall have
been made to the Company, its officers or directors or its shareholders or any
Person shall have publicly announced an intention to make an Acquisition
Proposal with respect to the Company prior to such termination, then (A) the
Company shall reimburse Parent and its Affiliates for all Expenses incurred in
connection with the execution of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement up to a maximum amount of $1
million and (B) if within 12 months of such termination, the Company enters
into or consummates a definitive agreement with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (with all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal
increased to fifty percent (50%)), then upon the earlier of the execution or
consummation of such definitive agreement, the Company shall also pay to
Parent an

 



 



 

51

     

amount equal to the Company Termination Fee. The parties agree that the
foregoing liquidated damages are reasonable considering all the circumstances
existing as of the date hereof and constitute the parties good faith estimate
of the actual Losses reasonably expected to result from the termination of
this Agreement as described in this Section 8.05(c). Except as contemplated by
Section 6.07, Parent agrees that, to the fullest extent permitted by Law,
Parents right to payment of such liquidated damages as provided in this
Section 8.05(c) shall be its sole and exclusive remedy for any Losses or
Liability arising out of or in connection with any termination of this
Agreement as described in this Section 8.05(c).

 

 **8.06 Amendment**. This Agreement may be amended by action taken by the
Company, Parent and Amalgamation Sub at any time before or after approval of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by the Required Company Vote,
but after any such approval, no amendment shall be made that requires the
approval of the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law without such
approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of all the parties.

 

 **8.07 Extension; Waiver**. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each
party (for these purposes, Parent and Amalgamation Sub shall together be
deemed one party and the Company shall be deemed the other party) may (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained herein or in any document, certificate
or writing delivered pursuant hereto, or (c) waive compliance by the other
party with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement
on the part of either party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party. The failure of either party hereto to assert any of its rights
hereunder shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

 **ARTICLE 9**
