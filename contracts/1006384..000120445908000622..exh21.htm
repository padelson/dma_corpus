 Exhibit 2.1

 

 _  SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT_

 

 This SHARE EXCHANGE AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of March 31,
2008, is by and among Nevstar Corporation, a Nevada corporation, (the "
_Parent_ "), HFG International, Limited, a Hong Kong corporation, Dollar Come
Investments Limited, a British Virgin Islands company (the " _Company_ "), and
the Shareholders of the Company identified on _Annex A_ hereto (each, a "
_Shareholder_ ", and together, the " _Shareholders_ "). Each of the parties
to this Agreement is individually referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and
collectively, as the " _Parties_."

 

 _  BACKGROUND_

 

  

 

 The Company has 100 shares of capital stock (the " _Company Stock_ ")
outstanding, all of which are held by the Shareholders. Each Shareholder is
the record and beneficial owner of the number of shares of Company Stock set
forth opposite such Shareholders name on _Annex A_ hereto. Each Shareholder
has agreed to transfer all of his, her or its (hereinafter " _its_ ") shares
of Company Stock in exchange for a number of newly issued shares of the Common
Stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Parent (the " _Parent Stock_ ") that
will, in the aggregate, constitute 95% of the issued and outstanding capital
stock of the Parent on a fully-diluted basis as of and immediately after the
Closing. The number of shares of Parent Stock to be received by each
Shareholder is listed opposite each such Shareholders name on _Annex A_. The
aggregate number of shares of Parent Stock that is reflected on _Annex A_ is
referred to herein as the " _Shares_ ".

 

 The exchange of Company Stock for Parent Stock is intended to constitute a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a)(1)(B) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986 (the " _Code_ "), as amended or such other tax free
reorganization exemptions that may be available under the Code.

 

 The Board of Directors of the Parent and the Company have determined that it
is desirable to effect this plan of reorganization and share exchange.

deliver such Company Stock. Upon delivery of any certificate or certificates
duly assigned, representing the same as herein contemplated and/or upon
registering of the Parent as the new owner of such Company Stock in the share
register of the Company, the Parent will receive good title to such Company
Stock, free and clear of all liens, security interests, pledges, equities and
claims of any kind, voting trusts, stockholder agreements and other
encumbrances (collectively, " _Liens_ ").

and validly existing in its jurisdiction of organization or has been properly
formed under the laws of its jurisdiction of formation.

 

 Section 2.03

 

 _  Power and Authority_. Each Shareholder that is an entity has the legal
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform its
obligations hereunder. All acts required to be taken by the Shareholder to
enter into this Agreement and to carry out the Transactions have been properly
taken. This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of
the Shareholder, enforceable against such Shareholder in accordance with the

_Securities Act_ ") and, if issued in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, will be issued by reason of a specific exemption from the
registration provisions of the Securities Act which depends upon, among other
things, the bona fide nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of the
Shareholders representations as expressed herein. The non-registration shall
have no prejudice with respect to any rights, interests, benefits and
entitlements attached to the Parent Stock in accordance with the Parent
charter documents or the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. 

 

 Section 2.09

 

 _  Restricted Securities_. The Shareholder understands that the Parent Stock
is characterized as "restricted securities" under the Securities Act inasmuch
as this Agreement contemplates that, if acquired by the Shareholder pursuant
hereto, the Parent Stock would be acquired in a transaction not involving a
public offering. The Shareholder further acknowledges that if the Parent
Stock is issued to the Shareholder in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, such Parent Stock may not be resold without registration under the
Securities Act or the existence of an exemption therefrom. The Shareholder
represents that it is familiar with Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities
Act, as presently in effect, and understands the resale limitations imposed
thereby and by the Securities Act.

necessary to enable it to own, lease or otherwise hold its properties and

expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company, a material adverse
effect on the ability of the Company to perform its obligations under this
Agreement or on the ability of the Company to consummate the Transactions (a "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ "). The Company and each Company Subsidiary
is duly qualified to do business in each jurisdiction where the nature of its
business or its ownership or leasing of its properties make such qualification

of Section 3.06.

exist any condition which upon the passage of time or the giving of notice
would cause such a violation of or default under) any Contract to which it is
a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except for

reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

 Section 3.12

Letter, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries do not own any real property.
Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries has sufficient title to, or
valid leasehold interests in, all of its properties and assets used in the
conduct of its businesses. All such assets and properties, other than assets
and properties in which the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has

the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to conduct business as currently
conducted.

marks, service mark rights, copyrights and other proprietary intellectual
property rights and computer programs (collectively, " _Intellectual Property
Rights_ ") which are material to the conduct of the business of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a whole. The Company Disclosure Letter
sets forth a description of all Intellectual Property Rights which are
material to the conduct of the business of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries taken as a whole. There are no claims pending or, to the
knowledge of the Company, threatened that the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries is infringing or otherwise adversely affecting the rights of any

audited consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended December
31, 2006 and 2005 and unaudited consolidated financial statements for the

Financial Statements_ "). The Company Financial Statements fairly present in
all material respects the financial condition and operating results of the
Company, as of the dates, and for the periods, indicated therein. The Company
does not have any material liabilities or obligations, contingent or
otherwise, other than (i) liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of
business subsequent to December 31, 2007, and (ii) obligations under contracts
and commitments incurred in the ordinary course of business and not required
under generally accepted accounting principles to be reflected in the Company
Financial Statements, which, in both cases, individually and in the aggregate
would not be reasonably expected to result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

 

 Section 3.16

 

 _  Insurance_. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the
Company and its subsidiaries are insured by insurers of recognized financial
responsibility against such losses and risks and in such amounts as are
prudent and customary in the businesses in which the Company and its
subsidiaries are engaged and in the geographic areas where they engage in such
businesses. Except as set forth in the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company
has no reason to believe that it will not be able to renew its and its
subsidiaries existing insurance coverage as and when such coverage expires or
to obtain similar coverage from similar insurers as may be necessary to
continue its business on terms consistent with market for the Companys and
such subsidiaries respective lines of business.

or partner. 

   Section 3.18

immediately following the Closing will not have become, an "investment
company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended.

 

 Section 3.19

 

 _  Disclosure_. The Company confirms that neither it nor any person acting
on its behalf has provided any Shareholder or its respective agents or counsel
with any information that the Company believes constitutes material, non-
public information except insofar as the existence and terms of the proposed
transactions hereunder may constitute such information and except for
information that will be disclosed by the Parent under a current report on
Form 8-K filed within four business days after the Closing. The Company
understands and confirms that the Shareholders will rely on the foregoing
representations and covenants in effecting transactions in securities of the
Company. All disclosure provided to the Shareholders regarding the Company,
its business and the transactions contemplated hereby, furnished by or on
behalf of the Company (including the Companys representations and warranties
set forth in this Agreement) are true and correct and do not contain any

mailed to the Parents stockholders, contain any untrue statement of a

Adverse Effect_ "). The Parent is duly qualified to do business in each
jurisdiction where the nature of its business or their ownership or leasing of
its properties make such qualification necessary and where the failure to so
qualify would reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
The Parent has delivered to the Company true and complete copies of the
certificate or articles of incorporation of the Parent, as amended to the date
of this Agreement (as so amended, the " _Parent Charter_ "), and the Bylaws of
the Parent, as amended to the date of this Agreement (as so amended, the "

of 150,000,000 shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (" _Parent
Common Stock_ "), and 10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.01
per share. As of March 31, 2007 (i) 1,250,090 shares of Parent Common Stock
are issued and outstanding; (ii) no shares of preferred stock are outstanding
and (iii) no shares of Parent Common Stock or preferred stock are held by the
Parent in its treasury. Except as set forth above, no shares of capital stock
or other voting securities of the Parent are issued, reserved for issuance or
outstanding. All outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Parent are,
and all such shares that may be issued prior to the date hereof will be when
issued, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and not
subject to or issued in violation of any purchase option, call option, right
of first refusal, preemptive right, subscription right or any similar right
under any provision of the General Corporation Law of the State of Nevada, the
Parent Charter, the Parent Bylaws or any Contract to which the Parent is a
party or otherwise bound. There are not any bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Parent having the right to vote (or convertible into, or

holders of Parent Common Stock may vote (" _Voting Parent Debt_ "). There are
not any options, warrants, rights, convertible or exchangeable securities,
"phantom" stock rights, stock appreciation rights, stock-based performance

security convertible or exercisable for or exchangeable into any capital stock

obligating the Parent to issue, grant, extend or enter into any such option,
warrant, call, right, security, commitment, Contract, arrangement or
undertaking or (c) that give any person the right to receive any economic

occurring to holders of the capital stock of the Parent. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are not any outstanding contractual obligations of the
Parent to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock
of the Parent. Except as set forth in that certain Stock Purchase Agreement
dated October 11, 2005 by and between the Halter Financial Investments, L.P.
and the Parent, the Parent is not a party to any agreement granting any
securityholder of the Parent the right to cause the Parent to register shares
of the capital stock or other securities of the Parent held by such
securityholder under the Securities Act. The stockholder list provided to the
Company is a current stockholder list generated by its stock transfer agent,
and such list accurately reflects all of the issued and outstanding shares of
the Parents Common Stock.

material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The consolidated

permitted by the rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present the consolidated financial position of the Parent
and its consolidated subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated
results of their operations and cash flows for the periods shown (subject, in
the case of unaudited statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments).

   (c)

 

 Except as set forth in the Parent SEC Documents, the Parent has no
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether accrued, absolute,

of the Parent or in the notes thereto. Except for its agreement with

Company or the Shareholders following the Closing.

any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading.

 The Parent has timely filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its behalf,
all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, and all such Tax Returns are true,

reflect an adequate reserve for all Taxes payable by the Parent (in addition
to any reserve for deferred Taxes to reflect timing differences between book

been proposed, asserted or assessed against the Parent, and no requests for
waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes are pending, except to the extent

under (nor does there exist any condition which upon the passage of time or

Material Adverse Effect.

interests in, all of its properties and assets used in the conduct of its
businesses. All such assets and properties, other than assets and properties

requiring payments to or from any officer, director or such employee or, to

or partner.

 

 Section 4.20

 

 _  Internal Accounting Controls_. The Parent maintains a system of internal
accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (a)
transactions are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorizations, (b) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (c) access to
assets is permitted only in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization, and (d) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with
the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken
with respect to any differences. The Parent has established disclosure
controls and procedures for the Parent and designed such disclosure controls
and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Parent is
made known to the officers by others within those entities. The Parents
officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Parent\'s controls and
procedures. Since December 31, 2005, there have been no significant changes
in the Parents internal controls or, to the Parents knowledge, in other
factors that could significantly affect the Parents internal controls.

   Section 4.21

 

 _  Solvency_. Based on the financial condition of the Parent as of the

Parents fair saleable value of its assets exceeds the amount that will be
required to be paid on or in respect of the Parents existing debts and other
liabilities (including known contingent liabilities) as they mature, (b) the
Parents assets do not constitute unreasonably small capital to carry on its
business for the current fiscal year as now conducted and as proposed to be
conducted including its capital needs taking into account the particular
capital requirements of the business conducted by the Parent, and projected
capital requirements and capital availability thereof, and (c) the current
cash flow of the Parent, together with the proceeds the Parent would receive,
were it to liquidate all of its assets, after taking into account all
anticipated uses of the cash, would be sufficient to pay all amounts on or in
respect of its debt when such amounts are required to be paid. The Parent
does not intend to incur debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as they
mature (taking into account the timing and amounts of cash to be payable on or
in respect of its debt).

 

 Section 4.22

 

 _  Application of Takeover Protections_. The Parent has taken all necessary
action, if any, in order to render inapplicable any control share acquisition,
business combination, poison pill (including any distribution under a rights
agreement) or other similar anti-takeover provision under the Parents charter
documents or the laws of its state of incorporation that is or could become

on its behalf has provided any Shareholder or its respective agents or counsel

information that will be disclosed by the Parent under a current report on
Form 8-K filed within four business days after the Closing. The Parent
understands and confirms that the Shareholders will rely on the foregoing
representations and covenants in effecting transactions in securities of the
Parent. All disclosure provided to the Shareholders regarding the Parent, its
business and the transactions contemplated hereby, furnished by or on behalf
of the Parent (including the Parents representations and warranties set forth

statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

have any securities of the Parent registered with the SEC or any other
governmental authority that have not been satisfied.

to the Shareholders the Shares contemplated by this Agreement.

event, liability, development or circumstance has occurred or exists, or is
contemplated to occur with respect to the Parent, its subsidiaries or their
respective business, properties, prospects, operations or financial condition,
that would be required to be disclosed by the Parent under applicable
securities laws on a registration statement filed with the SEC relating to an
issuance and sale by the Parent of its Common Stock and which has not been
publicly announced.

 

 Section 4.29

 

 _  Foreign Corrupt Practices_. Neither the Parent, nor to the Parents
knowledge, any director, officer, agent, employee or other person acting on
behalf of the Parent or any of its subsidiaries has, in the course of its

unlawful contribution, gift, entertainment or other unlawful expenses relating

 Section 8.02

 

 _  Amendments; Waivers; No Additional Consideration_. No provision of this
Agreement may be waived or amended except in a written instrument signed by
the Company, the Parent and the Shareholders holding a majority of the Shares.
No waiver of any default with respect to any provision, condition or
requirement of this Agreement shall be deemed to be a continuing waiver in the
future or a waiver of any subsequent default or a waiver of any other
provision, condition or requirement hereof, nor shall any delay or omission of
either Party to exercise any right hereunder in any manner impair the exercise

of any transaction document unless the same consideration is also offered to
all Shareholders who then hold Shares.

   Section 8.03

any Shares is mutilated, lost, stolen or destroyed, the Parent shall issue or
cause to be issued in exchange and substitution for and upon cancellation
thereof, or in lieu of and substitution therefor, a new certificate or

 _  Remedies_. In addition to being entitled to exercise all rights provided
herein or granted by law, including recovery of damages, each of the
Shareholders, the Parent and the Company will be entitled to specific
performance under this Agreement. The Parties agree that monetary damages may
not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by reason of any breach of
obligations described in the foregoing sentence and hereby agrees to waive in
any action for specific performance of any such obligation the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

 

 Section 8.05

 

 _  Independent Nature of Shareholders Obligations and Rights_. The
obligations of each Shareholder under this Agreement are several and not joint
with the obligations of any other Shareholder, and no Shareholder shall be
responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other
Shareholder under this Agreement. The decision of each Shareholder to acquire
Shares pursuant to this Agreement has been made by such Shareholder
independently of any other Shareholder. Nothing contained herein, and no
action taken by any Shareholder pursuant hereto, shall be deemed to constitute
the Shareholders as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or any
other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Shareholders are in any
way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the
transactions contemplated herein. Each Shareholder acknowledges that no other
Shareholder has acted as agent for such Shareholder in connection with making
its investment hereunder and that no Shareholder will be acting as agent of
such Shareholder in connection with monitoring its investment in the Shares or
enforcing its rights under this Agreement. Each Shareholder shall be entitled
to independently protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation
the rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be necessary for
any other Shareholder to be joined as an additional party in any proceeding
for such purpose. Each of the Company and the Parent acknowledge that each of
the Shareholders has been provided with this same Agreement for the purpose of
closing a transaction with multiple Shareholders and not because it was
required or requested to do so by any Shareholder.

 

 Section 8.06

 

 _  Limitation of Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, each of the Parent and the Company acknowledge and agree that the
liability of a Shareholder arising directly or indirectly, under any
transaction document of any and every nature whatsoever shall be satisfied
solely out of the assets of such Shareholder, and that no trustee, officer,
other investment vehicle or any other affiliate of such Shareholder or any
investor, shareholder or holder of shares of beneficial interest of such
Shareholder shall be personally liable for any liabilities of such
Shareholder.

   Section 8.07

 

 _  Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to a
Section, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless
otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including"
are used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". 

 

 Section 8.08

 

 _  Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner to the end that Transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

 

 Section 8.09

 

 _  Counterparts; Facsimile Execution_. This Agreement may be executed in
one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. Facsimile
execution and delivery of this Agreement is legal, valid and binding for all
purposes.

 

 Section 8.10

 

 _  Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement, taken
together with the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter,
(a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the Parties with respect to the
Transactions and (b) are not intended to confer upon any person other than the
Parties any rights or remedies.

 

 Section 8.11

 

 _  Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in
accordance with, the laws of the State of New York, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws
thereof, except to the extent the laws of Nevada are mandatorily applicable to
the Transactions.

 

 Section 8.12

 

 _  Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written
consent of the other Parties. Any purported assignment without such consent
shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will be
binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and
their respective successors and assigns.
