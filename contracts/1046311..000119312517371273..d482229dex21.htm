1.6 _Purchase Price Determination_.

to the anticipated Closing Date, Seller shall deliver to Buyer a statement
(the " _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers good faith
calculation of the Estimated Purchase Price and reasonably detailed
calculations demonstrating each component thereof, including Estimated Cash,
Estimated Indebtedness, Estimated Net Working Capital, Estimated Transaction
Expenses

 



3  and Estimated Audit Expenses. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be
prepared based upon the books and records of the Company in accordance with
the definitions as provided in this Agreement and the Accounting Methodology.
Buyer shall be entitled to review and make comments to the matters and amounts
set forth in the Estimated Closing Statement, such comments to be delivered to
Seller no later than one (1) Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing
Date. Seller shall cooperate and shall cause the Company to cooperate with
Buyer in the review of the Estimated Closing Statement, including providing
Buyer and its representatives with reasonable access during normal
business hours to the relevant books, records and finance employees of the
Company and the Business. Seller shall consider in good faith Buyers
reasonable objections to the Estimated Closing Statement delivered by Seller,
but Seller shall not be obligated to make any modification to the Estimated
Closing Statement. The Estimated Closing Statement shall be binding on the
parties hereto for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 1.6(a)_ and for purposes
of determining the Estimated Purchase Price in _Section_ __ _ 1.5(a)_.

(b) _Post-Closing Date Purchase Price Adjustments_. As promptly
as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall cause to be prepared and delivered to Seller a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Buyers good faith calculation of
the Purchase Price and reasonably detailed calculations demonstrating each
component thereof, including the aggregate amount of the Cash and Cash
Equivalents of the Company, the aggregate amount of the Indebtedness of the
Company, Net Working Capital, Transaction Expenses and Audit Expenses. The
Closing Statement shall (i) be prepared based upon the books and records of
the Company in accordance with the definitions as provided in this Agreement
and the Accounting Methodology and (ii) not include any changes in assets or
liabilities as a result of purchase accounting adjustments or other changes
arising from or resulting as a consequence of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The post-Closing purchase price adjustment as set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_ is not intended to permit the introduction of
different accounting methods, policies, practices,
procedures, classifications, conventions, categorizations, definitions,
principles, judgments, assumptions, techniques or estimation methods with
respect to financial statements (including any of the foregoing as they relate
to the nature of accounts, calculation of levels of reserves or levels of
accruals) from the Accounting Methodology. Notwithstanding anything else in
this Agreement to the contrary, to the extent that the Closing Statement
corrects a manifest mathematical error that was utilized in the determination
of Target Net Working Capital, then the Target Net Working Capital shall be
reduced or increased as a result of such error, as appropriate, to reflect
such error.

 

(c) _Dispute Resolution Procedures_.

 

(i) If Seller disagrees with Buyers calculation of the Purchase Price or any
component thereof, including the calculation of the aggregate amount of the
Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Company, the calculation of the aggregate
amount of Indebtedness of the Company, Net Working Capital or Transaction
Expenses as set forth in the Closing Statement delivered pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(b)_, then Seller may, within thirty (30) days after
delivery of the Closing Statement, deliver a notice to Buyer providing
reasonable detail of the reasons for such disagreement and setting
forth Sellers calculation of the items and amounts in dispute. Any such
notice of disagreement shall specify all items or amounts as to which Seller
disagrees, and Seller shall be deemed to have agreed with all other items and
amounts, and the calculation thereof, set forth in the Closing Statement.

 



4 (ii) If a notice of disagreement shall be properly delivered pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)(i)_, Seller and Buyer shall, during the fifteen (15)
days following such delivery, negotiate in good faith to reach written
agreement on the disputed items or amounts. The matters set forth in any
written resolution executed by Seller and Buyer shall be final and binding on
the parties on the date of such written resolution. If Seller and Buyer are
unable to reach such agreement during such fifteen (15) day period, they shall
promptly (and in any event, within thirty (30) days) thereafter submit any
matters in dispute for resolution to PricewaterhouseCoopers or, if
PricewaterhouseCoopers is unavailable, another nationally recognized
independent accounting firm that has no material relationship with any of the
parties, as is mutually agreed to by Buyer and Seller, or if Buyer and Seller
cannot so agree within fifteen (15) days following the determination that
PricewaterhouseCoopers is unavailable, the firm mutually selected by a panel
consisting of the firm that has been proposed by Buyer and the firm that has
been proposed by Seller (the firm to which such matters are so submitted for
resolution, the " _Valuation Firm_ ").

 

(iii) The Valuation Firm shall make a final and binding determination with
respect to the computation of the Purchase Price, including each of the
components thereof, to the extent such amounts are in dispute, in accordance
with the guidelines and procedures set forth in this Agreement and on _Exhibit
B_. Buyer and Seller shall cooperate with the Valuation Firm during the term
of its engagement and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
Valuation Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to the
computation of the Purchase Price, including each of the components thereof,
as soon as practicable. The Valuation Firm shall consider only those items
and amounts in Buyers and Sellers respective calculations of the Purchase
Price, including each of the components thereof, that are identified as being
items and amounts to which Buyer and Seller have been unable to agree. In
resolving any disputed item, the Valuation Firm may not assign a value to any
item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either party or
less than the smallest value for such item claimed by either party. The
Valuation Firms determination of the Purchase Price, including each of the
components thereof, shall be based solely on written materials submitted by
Buyer and Seller ( _i.e._ , not on independent review) and on the definitions
included herein. The determination of the Valuation Firm shall be conclusive
and binding upon the parties hereto and shall not be subject to appeal or
further review.

 

(iv) The costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm in determining the Purchase
Price, including each of the components thereof, shall be borne by Buyer, on
the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which
the portion of the contested amount not awarded to each party bears to the
amount actually contested by such party. For example, if Buyer claims the
Purchase Price is one thousand dollars ($1,000) less than the amount
determined by Seller, and Seller contests only five hundred dollars ($500) of
the amount claimed by Buyer, and if the Valuation Firm ultimately resolves the
dispute by awarding Buyer three hundred dollars ($300) of the five hundred
dollars ($500) contested, then the costs and expenses of the Valuation Firm
will be allocated sixty percent (60%) ( _i.e._ , 300 ÷ 500) to Seller and
forty percent (40%) ( _i.e._ , 200 ÷ 500) to Buyer. Prior to the Valuation
Firms determination of the Purchase Price, (i) Buyer, on the one hand, and
Seller, on the other hand, shall each pay fifty percent (50%) of any retainer
paid to the Valuation Firm and (ii) during the engagement of the Valuation
Firm, the Valuation Firm will bill fifty percent (50%) of the total charges to
each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand. In connection
with the Valuation 

 



5  Firms determination of the Purchase Price, the Valuation Firm shall also
determine, pursuant to the terms of the first and second sentences of this 
_Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)(iv)_, and taking into account all fees and expenses
already paid by each of Buyer, on the one hand, and Seller, on the other hand,
as of the date of such determination, the allocation of its fees and
expenses between Buyer and Seller, which such determination shall be
conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto.

(v) The Closing Statement (and each of the components thereof) shall become
final and binding on the parties (A) on the thirty-first (31st) day following
the delivery of the Closing Statement if a notice of disagreement has not been
delivered to Buyer by Seller prior to such time, (B) with such changes as are
necessary to reflect matters resolved pursuant to any written resolution
executed pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)(ii)_, on the date such resolution
is executed, if all outstanding matters are resolved through such resolution,
and/or (C) with such changes as are necessary to reflect the Valuation Firms
resolution of the matters in dispute (together with any changes necessary to
reflect matters previously resolved pursuant to any written resolution
executed pursuant to this Agreement and any matters not disputed pursuant to a
notice of disagreement), on the date the Valuation Firm delivers its final,
binding resolution pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)(ii)_ (the Closing
Statement in such form, the " _Final Closing Statement_ ," and the Purchase
Price set forth in the Final Closing Statement, the " _Final Purchase Price_
").

 

(d) _Final Payment_. As promptly as practicable, but in no event later than
five (5) Business Days following finalization of the Final Closing Statement
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_:

(i) If the Estimated Purchase Price is equal to or is less than the Final
Purchase Price (the amount of such shortfall, if any, the " _Shortfall Amount_
"), then (A) Seller and Buyer shall deliver joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to release, in accordance with the Escrow Agreement, to Seller
the Adjustment Escrow Amount; and (B) Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
designated in writing by Seller, the Shortfall Amount.

 

(ii) If the Estimated Purchase Price exceeds the Final Purchase Price (the
amount of such excess, the " _Excess Amount_ "), then (A) Seller and Buyer
shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release, in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, (1) to Buyer, the lesser of (x) the
Excess Amount; and (y) the Adjustment Escrow Amount; and (2) to Seller, any
funds remaining in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after the release
of funds to Buyer pursuant to clause (1) above; and (B ) Seller shall pay or
cause to be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the
account designated in writing by Buyer, the amount, if any, by which the
Excess Amount exceeds the Adjustment Escrow Amount.

(e) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.5_, the parties hereto (i) shall, and shall
cause their respective representatives to, cooperate and (ii) shall make
available to one another and their respective employees and
representatives and, if applicable, the Valuation Firm, to the extent
necessary, at reasonable times and with reasonable advance notice, such books,
Contracts, records, work papers and appropriate personnel and other
information (including work papers, and outside advisors) as any of the
foregoing may reasonably request, in each case, to prepare and review the
Closing Statement (including the calculation of Cash and Cash Equivalents of
the

 



6  Company, Indebtedness of the Company, Net Working Capital and Transaction
Expenses), and/or any matters in dispute (including those submitted to the
Valuation Firm), in each case, subject to the restrictions of applicable Law,
work-product doctrine, attorney-client privilege or other similar legally-
recognized privilege and execution of customary work paper access letters.
Buyer, the Company and Seller each acknowledge and waive any actual or
potential conflict of employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries assisting
Seller and Buyer as described in this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, and will not, and
will cause the Company not to, prevent such access by Seller.

 

1.7 _Purchase Price Allocation_. The parties hereto agree to treat the
purchase of the Units as a purchase of the assets of the Company for U.S.
federal and, to the extent permitted by Law, applicable state and local income
Tax purposes. Seller and Buyer shall allocate the Purchase Price among the
assets of the Company and the services to be received pursuant to the
Transition Services Agreement (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "). The Allocation
Schedule shall be prepared in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the
Treasury Regulations thereunder. Within one-hundred and twenty (120) days of
the Closing Date, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller the Allocation
Schedule for Sellers review and approval. If, within thirty (30) days
following the delivery of the Allocation Schedule, Seller notifies Buyer in
writing that Seller disputes any calculation in the Allocation Schedule, Buyer
and Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve such dispute. Should Buyer
and Seller fail to reach an agreement within thirty (30) days after Seller
notifies Buyer of such dispute, Buyer and Seller shall bring all disputes
relating to the preparation of such allocation to the Valuation Firm for
resolution, whose decisions shall be final and binding on the parties (and
reflected on the Allocation Schedule) and whose expenses shall be paid equally
by Buyer on one hand and Seller on the other. If the Valuation Firm is unable
to resolve such dispute prior to the filing of any Tax Return to which the
Purchase Price allocation made pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ is
relevant, each of Buyer and Seller shall be entitled to take its own position
with respect to the allocation of the Purchase Price on the applicable Tax
Return, the filing of which shall not prejudice or otherwise control the
Valuation Firms resolution of such matter. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Allocation Schedule (or any update thereto) shall be conclusive
absent manifest error and shall be final and binding upon the parties. Seller
and Buyer shall (i) prepare and file all income Tax Returns (including IRS
Form 8594) in a manner consistent with the Allocation Schedule (or any update
thereto), if such Allocation Schedule is agreed prior to the filing of any
such Tax Return, and (ii) take no position inconsistent with the Allocation
Schedule (or any update thereto) in any income Tax Return, any income Tax
proceeding before any Taxing Authority.

1.8 _Withholding_. To the extent required by applicable Law, Buyer shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to
any Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required under
applicable Law to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment or to otherwise take such action to satisfy any other Tax withholding
and reporting obligations it has under applicable Law with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. To the extent that such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, they shall be paid over to or deposited with the
relevant Governmental Body by Buyer, and such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
applicable Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.
Buyer acknowledges that no withholding of Taxes shall be made with respect to
the payment of the Purchase Price to Seller, provided that Seller delivers a
customary executed certificate of non-foreign status, unless there is a change
in law with respect to the withholding of Taxes after the date hereof.

contesting or resisting (including through any applicable appeals process) any
Legal Proceeding which may be instituted challenging the Transaction and
seeking to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any Order, whether

prevents or restricts the consummation of the Transaction. Buyer and the
Company shall use reasonable best efforts to take any and all actions
necessary as may be required to cause the expiration of the notice periods

with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Buyer and the Company agrees
to promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and

the foregoing, Buyer shall use reasonable best efforts to:

 



37 (i) at Buyers sole cost, comply with all restrictions and conditions, if
any, (A) imposed or requested by any Governmental Antitrust Entity with
respect to Competition Laws in connection with granting any necessary
clearance or terminating any applicable waiting period including (1) agreeing
to sell, divest, hold separate, license, cause a third party to acquire, or
otherwise dispose of, any Subsidiary, operations, divisions, businesses,
product lines, customers or assets of Buyer or the Company contemporaneously
with or after the Closing and regardless as to whether a third party Buyer
has been identified or approved prior to the Closing (a " _Divestiture_ "),
(2) taking or committing to take such other actions that may limit Buyer or
the Companys freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
one or more of its operations, divisions, businesses, products lines,
customers or assets, and (3) entering into any Order, consent decree or other
agreement to effectuate any of the foregoing or (B) reasonably requested by a
third party in connection with a Divestiture;

understanding with any Governmental Antitrust Entity without the
prior written consent of the Company.

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ or anything else

event shall Buyer be obligated to take or refrain from taking, or cause its
Affiliates or Subsidiaries to take or refrain from taking, any action under 
_Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ or suffer to exist any condition, qualification,
limitation, restriction or requirement that, individually or in the aggregate
with any other actions under this _Section_ __ _ 6.3(e)_, qualifications,
conditions, limitations, restrictions or requirements, would be expected to
result in a Burdensome Condition.

(f) Buyer shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, acquire or agree
to acquire, by merging with or into or consolidating with, or by purchasing a
substantial portion of the assets of or equity in, or by any other manner, any
business or any corporation, partnership, association or other business
organization or division thereof, or otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any
assets, if the entering into of a definitive agreement relating to, or the
consummation of such acquisition, merger or consolidation could reasonably be
expected to: (i) materially increase the risk of not obtaining any consent of
any Governmental Antitrust Entity necessary to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby; (ii) materially increase the risk of any Governmental
Antitrust Entity entering an Order prohibiting the consummation of the
Transaction; or (iii) materially increase the risk of not being able to remove
any such Order on appeal or otherwise.

 

6.4 _Further Assurances_. Other than as provided in _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, each
of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) take all
actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the Transaction and (ii) cause
the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the conditions to

with the Property Transaction Agreement. Seller shall cause its Affiliates to
use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary or appropriate to

Information) for a period of two (2) years after the Closing Date).

(b) From the Closing until the second (2nd) anniversary of the Closing Date,
Seller shall, and shall cause WS Holdings and its Subsidiaries to, and shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and WS Holdings
respective representatives to, retain in strict confidence all information,
whether oral or written and whether in any tangible or intangible format,
regarding Buyer, the Business and the Company, together with that portion of
any analyses, compilations, studies, notes or other documents or records
prepared by Seller, WS Holdings and its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective representatives which contain, reflect or are based upon
confidential or proprietary information of Buyer, the Business or the Company,
including any information disclosed to Seller pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.7_
(collectively, " _Company Information_ "). The obligations of Seller pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ shall not apply, or shall cease to apply (as
applicable), to Company Information if or when, and to the extent that,
such Company Information (i) is generally available to and known by the
public (other than as a result of its disclosure by Seller, WS Holdings or
their respective Affiliates or representatives); (ii) becomes available to
Seller, WS Holdings or their respective Affiliates on a non-confidential
basis from a Person other than Buyer, the Company or any of their respective

agreement or other legal or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to Buyer
or the Company with respect to such information; or (iii) is independently
developed by or on behalf of Seller or WS Holdings without the use of or

Governmental Body to disclose any of the Company Information, such Person
shall provide Buyer, to the extent practicable and legally permissible, with
prompt prior written notice to that effect, and such Person will cooperate
(at Buyers sole cost and expense) with Buyer if Buyer seeks to obtain a
protective order concerning such Company Information. If, in the absence of a
protective order or the receipt of a written waiver by Buyer, Seller, WS
Holdings or any Subsidiary or representative thereof is nonetheless, on the
advice of counsel, legally required or compelled to disclose Company
Information, such Person may, without liability under this Agreement, disclose
that portion of the Company Information which, upon the advice of such
counsel, such Person is legally required to disclose. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein, in the event of an alleged breach or
violation of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, the restricted period set forth
in the first sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_ shall be tolled until
such alleged breach or violation is resolved; _provided_ , that if any
such Person is found to have not violated this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)_, then
such restricted period shall not be deemed to have been so tolled.

limited liability company agreement of the Company as now in effect and the
indemnification agreements or other arrangements set forth on _Schedule

Indemnitors are secondary), and (ii) the Company shall be required to (and
Buyer shall cause the Company to) advance the full amount of expenses incurred
by any Indemnitee and shall be liable for the full amount of all expenses,
judgments, penalties, fines and amounts paid in settlement to the extent (x)
legally permitted and (y) required by the terms of this Agreement or the
Companys certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement (or

the Indemnitee may have against the Indemnitors. Buyer and the Company
irrevocably waive, relinquish and release the Indemnitors from any and all
claims against the Indemnitors for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect thereof. Buyer and the Company further agree
that no advancement or payment by an Indemnitor on behalf of an Indemnitee
with respect to any claim for which an Indemnitee has sought indemnification
from the Company shall affect the foregoing and the applicable Indemnitor
shall have a right of contribution and/or be subrogated to the extent of such
advancement or payment to all of the rights of recovery of the Indemnitee
against the Company. Buyer and the Indemnitees agree that the Indemnitors are
express third party beneficiaries of the terms of this _Section_ __ _
6.6(b)_.

 

(c) On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall obtain a six (6) year tail
insurance policy (the " _D andO Tail Policy_") with respect to officers and
directors liability insurance covering the Persons who are presently covered

this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_).

 



40 (e) Buyer shall have the right (but not the obligation) to control the defense
of, including the investigation of, any litigation, claim or proceeding
(each, a " _Claim_ ") relating to any acts or omissions covered under this

that the Indemnitee shall be permitted to participate in the defense of such
Claim at their own expense.

(f) Each of Buyer and the Indemnitee shall, and Buyer shall cause the Company
to, reasonably cooperate, and cause their respective Affiliates to reasonably
cooperate, in the defense of any Claim and shall provide reasonable access to
properties and individuals as reasonably requested in advance in writing and
confirmed by the Company and furnish or cause to be furnished records,
information and testimony, and attend such conferences, discovery proceedings,

or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be

_Replacement_ "). Buyer may, in its sole discretion, (x) agree to accept any
or all Replacements as Designated Business Employees or (y) strike any or all
Replacements from _Schedule 9.1_ in which case such Replacements shall not be

provided or made available to such person by any Affiliate of the Company
immediately prior to the Closing, and (ii) employee retirement, health and
welfare benefits (excluding equity, equity-based, change in control, retention
or deferred compensation arrangements) that are no less favorable than those

Company) relating to confidentiality, assignment of inventions, non-
solicitation or non-competition or similar restrictions that would place
restrictions or interfere with any Transferred Employees ability to perform
his or her duties or responsibilities or provide services as an employee of
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Company) following the Transfer Date.

no such service shall be recognized to the extent such recognition would
result in the duplication of benefits; (ii) waive all limitations as to
preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Transferred

welfare benefit plan of the Company immediately prior to Closing); and (iii)
provide credit under a comparable Buyer Plan for any pre-Closing co-payments,
deductibles and out-of-pocket expenditures for the remainder of the coverage
period for the plan year in which the Transfer Date occurs (subject, in each
case under items (i), (ii) and (iii) of this sentence, to the Seller timely
providing to Buyer all information reasonably requested by Buyer).

Closing Date. Seller shall not, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and
the terms of the Seller 401(k) Plan, place any Transferred Employees Seller

distribution (including plan loans) from the Seller 401(k) Plan.

 

(e) Seller shall be solely responsible and retain any and all Liabilities and
obligations under the Seller Benefit Plans, including all Liabilities with

a consultant, interfere with or attempt to entice away from WS Holdings or its
Subsidiaries any employee thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that any public
advertisement or general solicitation (or hiring as a result thereof), in
each case not specifically targeted at such employees, shall not be a breach
of this _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, in the event of an alleged breach or violation of this
Section 6.13(b), the restricted period set forth in the first sentence of this
Section 6.13(b) shall be tolled until such alleged breach or violation is
resolved; provided, that if any such Person is found to have not violated
this Section 6.13(b), then such restricted period shall not be deemed to have
been so tolled. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that (A) the agreements and
covenants contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ are (x) reasonable and
valid in geographical and temporal scope and in all other respects, and (y)
essential to protect the value of the business and assets of WS Holdings and
its Subsidiaries and (B) Buyer has obtained knowledge, contacts, know-how,
training and experience and there is a substantial probability that such
knowledge, know-how, contacts, training and experience could be used to the
substantial advantage of a competitor of

 



46  WS Holdings and its Subsidiaries and to the substantial detriment of WS
Holdings and its Subsidiaries. Buyer also acknowledges that Seller has agreed
to sell the Units in reliance on the covenants made by Buyer in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.13(b)_ and that Seller would not have agreed to sell the
Units in the absence of the covenants made by Buyer in this _Section_ __ _
6.13(b)_. If any court of competent jurisdiction shall at any time deem the
duration or the geographic scope of any of the provisions of this _Section_ __
_ 6.13(b)_ unenforceable, the other provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.13(b)_ shall nevertheless stand and the duration and/or geographic scope
set forth herein shall be deemed to be the longest period and/or greatest size
permissible by law under the circumstances, and the parties hereto agree that
such court shall reduce the time period and/or geographic scope to
permissible duration or size.

6.14 _Affiliate Agreements_. Prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall
cause the Company to, take such action as may be necessary so that, effective
as of the Closing, all (a) Franchise Agreements with each Subsidiary of Seller
and (b) the other Affiliate Agreements set forth on  _Schedule_ __ _ 4.20_
(collectively, the " _Terminated Affiliate Agreements_ _"_ ), in each case
including any Liabilities and obligations of the Company, on the one hand, and
Seller, their owners and each of their Affiliates (other than the Company) on
the other hand, shall be terminated in their entirety effective as of the
Closing without any Liability to Buyer or the Company and without further
actions by the parties and thereby be deemed cancelled and discharged in
their entirety irrespective of any contrary terms in any such Affiliate
Agreement, in each case, other than any indemnities or similar rights that may
be applicable to the parties thereto.

 

6.15 _Use of Name_. Following the Closing, Seller shall not use, or permit any
of its Affiliates to use, the "WoodSpring" or "ValuePlace" name or any name
confusingly similar thereto or derivative thereof and shall change all
corporate names incorporating the "WoodSpring" or "ValuePlace" name or any
name confusingly similar thereto within forty-five (45) days after the
Closing. As of the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause each of its
Affiliates to, cease to use any Intellectual Property owned by the Company,
unless licensed to Seller or its Affiliates pursuant to the Transition
Services Agreement or a Franchise Agreement.

6.16 _Pre-Closing Transactions_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and
shall cause the Company to, take or cause to be taken, all actions required to
sell, distribute, transfer, convey and deliver to Seller or any Affiliate
thereof (other than the Company) the assets, employees and the liabilities of
the Company set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ 6.16-A_ (the " _Excluded Assets and
Liabilities_ "). Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take or cause to be taken, all actions required to sell,
distribute, transfer, convey and deliver to the Company any and all assets
exclusively required for the conduct of the Business as it is presently being
conducted and as it is proposed to be conducted (including those set forth on
_Schedule 6.16-B_, the " _Included Assets_ "). Prior to the Closing Date,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company) to,
execute, acknowledge, and deliver all conveyances, notices, assumptions and
such other instruments (each in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer), and shall take, or cause to be taken, such further actions as may be
necessary or appropriate to complete the transactions contemplated by this
_Section_ __ _ 6.16_ (the " _Pre-Closing Transactions_") prior to the Closing
Date and without any ongoing liability or obligation of the Company. For the
avoidance of doubt, none of the Excluded Assets and Excluded Liabilities shall
be recorded, reflected or otherwise provided for in the Estimated 

 



47  Closing Statement or any amounts contained therein. In the event that any
(a) Excluded Assets and Liabilities remain in possession of the Company
following the Closing or (b) Included Assets have not been transferred to the
Company as of the Closing, each of the parties shall cooperate to as promptly
as practicable assign and transfer such Excluded Assets and Liabilities or
Included Assets, as applicable, to the appropriate party. In the event that
following the Closing, either Party receives mail, packages or other
communications properly belonging to the other Party, such receiving Party
shall promptly deliver such mail, packages or other communications (or, in
the event the same also relates to the business of the receiving Party,
copies thereof) to such other Party. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.16_ are not intended to, and shall not, be deemed to constitute an
authorization by any Party to permit any other Party to accept service of
process on its behalf and no Party is or shall be deemed to be the agent of
another Party for service of process purposes. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement
to assign or transfer any Included Asset, or any claim, right or benefit
arising thereunder or resulting therefrom, if an attempted assignment or
transfer thereof, without the consent of a third party thereto, would
constitute a breach or default thereof, would result in a violation of the
rights of any such third party, would be ineffective, or would in any way
adversely affect the rights of Seller, its Affiliates, Buyer or the
Company thereunder. If such consent (a " _Deferred Consent_ ") is not
obtained, then (a) the Included Asset to which such Deferred Consent relates
(a " _Deferred Item_ " and any such deferred Contract or lease, a " _Deferred
Contract_ ") shall not be assigned or transferred pursuant to this Agreement
without any reduction in the Purchase Price as a result thereof, (b) from and
after the Closing, Seller and Buyer will cooperate, in all commercially
reasonable respects, to obtain such Deferred Consent as soon as practicable
after the Closing, provided that neither the Seller or its Affiliates nor
Buyer shall be required to make any payments or agree to any material
undertakings in connection therewith, and (c) until such Deferred Consent is
obtained, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate, in all commercially reasonable
respects, in any lawful and commercially reasonable arrangement reasonably
proposed by Buyer under which (i) the Company would obtain (without
infringing upon the legal rights of any third party) the economic claims,
rights and benefits (net of the amount of any related Tax costs and any other
Liabilities imposed on the Seller or any of its Affiliates under the Deferred
Item) and (ii) the Company would assume any related economic burden with
respect to the Deferred Item that arises after the Closing Date.

 

6.17 _Financial Information_. On or prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall
provide Buyer with such financial information as is requested and needed by
Buyer to allow Buyer (or its ultimate parent company) to comply with
applicable Laws promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission,
including such financial information as is required for Buyer (or its ultimate
parent company) to comply with Regulation S-X and GAAP.

6.18 _Events During Executory Period_. In no event shall a matter that first
arises between the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date and results in
a failure of a representation or warranty of Seller or the Company contained
in this Agreement be deemed to be Fraud with respect to the failure of such
representation or warranty solely on the grounds that neither Seller nor the
Company are permitted to update the Disclosure Schedules pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



48 6.19 _Seller Capitalization_. Until the final determination of the Final
Purchase Price and payment required to be made by the Seller to Buyer in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.20_, Seller shall
have adequate liquidity so that Seller, if necessary, can make any such
payments to Buyer pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6(d)_ or _Section_ __ _
6.20_.

6.20 _Retained Payables_. From and after the Closing, in the event that any
Retained Payable becomes payable by Seller or one of its Affiliates, Seller
shall provide to Buyer a copy of the underlying invoice in respect of each
such Retained Payable. Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company, to either (i)
promptly pay such invoice directly (and provide reasonable evidence of such
payment to Seller) or (ii) pay to Seller the amount set forth in such invoice
(and in the case of this clause (ii), Seller shall promptly pay such invoice
and provide reasonable evidence of such payment to Buyer.

6.21 _IP Matters_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts, in each
case, on or prior to the Closing Date, to (a) record change of name filings
with the applicable Governmental Body for each of the trademark and design
registrations listed on _Schedule 6.21-A_ so that such registrations reflect
ownership under the Companys current name, (b) record with the United States
Patent and Trademark Office a release of the security interest held by
Equity Bank on each of the trademark registrations listed on _Schedule
6.21-B_, and (c) change the registrant information with the applicable domain
name registrar for each of the domain names listed on  _Schedule 6.21-C_ to
reflect registration in the Companys current name.

ARTICLE 8

 

MISCELLANEOUS

8.1  _Survival_. The agreements in _Article 1_ and this _Article 8_ and
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_, _Section_ __ _ 6.6_, _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, _Section_ __
_ 6.8_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_, _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, _Section_ __ _ 6.13_,
_Section_ __ _ 6.15_, _Section_ __ _ 6.16_, _Section_ __ _ 6.18_, 
_Section_ __ _ 6.19_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.20_ of this Agreement shall
survive the Closing. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_, the remainder of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement or in
any schedule, exhibit, instrument or other document pursuant to this Agreement
shall terminate at the earlier of the Closing or the time of termination of
this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.1_, and thereafter none of the
parties hereto or any of their Affiliates or any of their respective managers,
officers, directors, employees, advisors, consultants, agents or
representatives shall have any liability whatsoever with respect to any such
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement, except as provided in
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_, and no claim for breach of any such representation or
warranty, detrimental reliance or other right or remedy (whether in contract,
in tort or at law or in equity) may be brought after the Closing with respect
thereto against Seller or any of its Affiliates, or any of its or their
respective officers, directors, employees, agents, representatives,
successors and permitted assigns (the " _Seller Group_ "), and there will be
no liability in respect thereof, whether such liability has accrued prior to,
on or after the Closing, on the part of Seller, the Company or any other
member of the Seller Group. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ will
not, however, prevent or limit a cause of action (i) under _Section_ __ _
8.2_ to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof and (ii)
under _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ to enforce any decision or determination of the
Valuation Firm. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything herein to the
contrary, nothing herein shall operate to limit the liability of any Person
for Fraud.

8.2 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement or any
Transaction Document are not performed in accordance with their specific terms
or are otherwise breached, including if the parties hereto fail to take any
action required of them hereunder to consummate this Agreement.

 



51  It is accordingly agreed that, in addition to any other applicable remedies
at law or equity, the parties and the third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions, without proof of
damages, to prevent breaches of this Agreement or any Transaction Document and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and any
Transaction Document. Each party hereto agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief on
the basis that the other party has an adequate remedy at law. In no event
shall the exercise of the Companys right to seek specific performance
pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ reduce, restrict or otherwise limit
Sellers right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1_ or
pursue all applicable remedies at law, including seeking money damages. In
any action for specific performance, each of the parties hereto hereby waives
(i) any defense that a remedy at law would be adequate and (ii) any
requirement under any law to post a bond or other security as a prerequisite
to obtaining equitable relief.

8.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each of the
Company, Seller and Buyer shall bear its own expenses incurred in connection
with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each Transaction
Document and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
thereby.

 

8.4 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents and
all claims or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or statute) that
may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement and/or the other
Transaction Documents or the negotiation, execution or performance of this
Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents (including any claim or
cause of action based upon, arising out of or related to any representation
or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement and/or the other
Transaction Documents or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement and/or
the Transaction Documents), shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the internal Laws of the State of Delaware, including its statutes of
limitations, without giving effect to the conflict of laws principles thereof
that might require the application of the laws of another jurisdiction.

8.5 _Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process_. All claims, actions and
proceedings (whether in contract, tort or statute) based upon, arising out of
or relating to this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents or the
negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement and/or the other
Transaction Documents (including any claim or cause of action based upon,
arising out of or related to any representation or warranty made in or in
connection with this Agreement and/or the other Transaction Documents or as an
inducement to enter into this Agreement and/or the Transaction
Documents) shall be heard and determined in any state or federal court
sitting in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, if the Chancery
Court of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware),
and the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction
of such courts (and, in the case of appeals, appropriate appellate courts
therefrom) in any such action or proceeding and irrevocably waive the defense
of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any such action or proceeding,
and any judgment of such courts may be enforced in any other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or by any other manner provided by Law. The consents to
jurisdiction set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall not constitute
general consents to service of process in the State of Delaware and shall have
no effect for any purpose except as provided in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.5_
and shall not be deemed to confer rights on any Person other than the parties
hereto. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction
by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by applicable Law.

 



52 8.6 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
IN RESPECT TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF,
UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTION WHETHER ARISING
IN CONTRACT, IN TORT, BY STATUTE OR OTHERWISE. EACH PARTY HERETO (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY
LEGAL PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS _SECTION_ _8.6_.

 

8.7 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Disclosure Schedule and
exhibits hereto), the Transaction Documents, and the Confidentiality
Agreement represent the entire understanding and agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement supersedes
all prior and contemporaneous agreements, arrangements, contracts,
discussions, negotiations, undertakings and understandings (whether written
or oral and including any letter of intent or other similar preliminary
documents) between the parties with respect to such subject matter (other than
the Confidentiality Agreement). The parties hereto have voluntarily agreed to
define their rights, liabilities and obligations with respect to the
Transaction exclusively in contract pursuant to the express terms and
provisions of this Agreement, the Transaction Documents and any other
executed agreement entered into by the parties hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, and the parties hereto expressly disclaim
that they are owed any duties or are entitled to any remedies not expressly
set forth in this Agreement, the Transaction Documents, and any other
executed agreement entered into by the parties hereto in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. Furthermore, the parties each hereby
acknowledge that this Agreement embodies the justifiable expectations of
sophisticated parties derived from arms-length negotiations, and all parties
specifically acknowledge that no party has any special relationship with
another party that would justify any expectation beyond that of an ordinary
buyer and an ordinary seller in an arms-length transaction. The sole and
exclusive remedies for any breach of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement (including any representations and warranties set forth herein,
made in connection herewith or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement)
or any claim or cause of action otherwise arising out of or related to the
Transaction shall be those remedies available at law or in equity for breach
of contract against the parties to this Agreement only (as such contractual
remedies have been further limited or excluded pursuant to the express terms
of this Agreement), and the parties hereby agree that no party hereto shall
have any remedies or causes of action (whether in contract, tort or otherwise)
for any statements, communications, disclosures, failures to disclose, or
representations or warranties not explicitly set forth in this Agreement. The
parties agree that the representations and warranties contained herein are for
contractual risk allocation purposes only.

 



53 8.8 _Amendments and Waivers_. This Agreement can be amended, supplemented or
changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written instrument
making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party against whom
enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or waiver is
sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party
hereto of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be
construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of
any other or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to
exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
such right, power or remedy by such party preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

8.9 _Notices_. All notices and other communications under this Agreement shall
be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered personally by hand
(with written confirmation of receipt), (ii) when transmitted by electronic
mail if the sender on the same day sends a confirming copy of such notice by a
recognized overnight carrier (charges prepaid), or (iii) one Business Day

8.10 _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is adjudicated
by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal, or incapable of
being enforced by any Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as
the economic or legal substance of the Transaction is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon any such adjudication that any
term or provision hereof is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the Transaction is consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

 

8.11 _Binding Effect; Third-Party Beneficiaries; Assignment_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall
create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any Person
not a party to this Agreement except as contemplated by  _Section_ __ _
6.6_, _Section_ __ _ 8.13_, _Section_ __ _ 8.14_, _Section_ __ _ 8.16_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.17_ and this _Section_ __ _ 8.11_. No assignment of this
Agreement or of any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any of the
parties, directly or indirectly (by operation of law or otherwise), without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any
attempted assignment without the required consents shall be void; _provided_
that Buyer may, without consent of any other party hereto (a) assign all or
any portion of its rights hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates; (b)
grant any of its or its Affiliates lenders a security interest in any or all
of its rights hereunder and such lenders will have the right to enforce all
rights of Buyer under this Agreement (or otherwise make a collateral
assignment to such lenders); or (c) assign all or any portion of its rights
hereunder to any purchaser or successor of Buyer (in each case, whether by
merger, purchase of capital stock, purchase of assets or otherwise). No
assignment of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the parties hereto of
any such obligations.

 



55 8.12 _Counterparts._ This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement. This Agreement and any signed agreement entered
into in connection herewith or contemplated hereby, and any amendments hereto
or thereto, to the extent signed and delivered by facsimile, by electronic
mail in "portable document format" (".pdf") form, or any other electronic
transmission, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original
contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effects as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the
request of any party hereto or to any such contract, each other party hereto
or thereto shall re-execute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties.

 

8.13 _Non-Recourse_. All claims or causes of action (whether in contract or in
tort, in law or in equity) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this
Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), may be made only
against the entities that are expressly identified as parties hereto. No
Person who is not a named party to this Agreement, including any director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder,
Affiliate, agent, attorney or representative of any named party to this
Agreement (" _Non-Party Affiliates_"), shall have any liability (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or based upon any theory that seeks
to impose liability of an entity party against its owners or Affiliates) for
any obligations or liabilities arising under, in connection with or related to
