SECTION 1.02. Interpretation and Construction.

  

  

(a) Unless otherwise provided herein all monetary values stated herein are
expressed in United States currency and all references to "dollars" or "$"
will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United States.

  

  

(b) Each accounting term set forth herein and not otherwise defined shall have
the meaning accorded it under GAAP as applied on a consistent basis by Seller.
For the avoidance of doubt, in the event of any discrepancy between GAAP and
the provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of this Agreement shall
control.

  

  

(c) Whenever conversion of values into any Foreign Currency for a particular
date or period shall be required under this Agreement, such conversion shall
be made using the midpoint foreign exchange provided by Bloomberg at 2:00
p.m., New York time, on the second business day prior to the Principal Closing
Date (the "Exchange Rate"). To the extent the relevant foreign exchange rate
is not then provided by Bloomberg, the Exchange Rate official foreign exchange
rate published by the local central bank (or equivalent institution) of the
relevant jurisdiction on the second business day prior to the Principal
Closing Date.

(d) The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of
this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of
this Agreement. Any reference to any federal, state, local or foreign Law
shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. When a reference is made in
this Agreement to a party or to a Section, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference
shall be to a party to, a Section of, or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. All terms defined in this Agreement
shall have their defined meanings when used in any Exhibit or Schedule to this
Agreement or any certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant
hereto, unless otherwise defined therein. Whenever the words "include",
"includes", "including" or "such as" are used in this Agreement, they shall be
deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation". The word "will" shall
be construed to have the same meaning and effect as the word "shall". The
words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used
in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. The word "or" when used in this
Agreement is not exclusive. The word "extent" in the phrase "to the extent"
means the degree to which a subject or other thing extends, and such phrase
shall not mean simply "if". Whenever used in this Agreement, any noun or
pronoun shall be deemed to include the plural as well as the singular and to
cover all genders. Any agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to
herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time
amended, supplemented or modified, including (i) (in the case of agreements or
instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession
of comparable successor statutes and (ii) all attachments thereto and
instruments incorporated therein. The words "asset" and "property" shall be
construed to have the same meaning and effect. References to a Person are also
to its permitted successors and assigns. In the event of any conflict between
this Agreement and any Country Acquisition Agreement, the terms of this
Agreement shall control.

  

  

ARTICLE II

  

Closings

  

  

SECTION 2.01. Closings.

  

  

(a) The closing of the purchase and sale of the Transferred Assets relating to
the Principal Country Units and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
relating to the Principal Country Units (the "Principal Closing") shall take
place at a mutually agreed location, at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on
December 21, 2011, or at such other place and time if required by applicable
Law; provided that if the conditions set forth in Article V with respect to
the Principal Closing (excluding those conditions intended to be satisfied at
the Principal Closing) shall not have been satisfied or waived by such date,
then the Principal Closing shall be held at 10:00 A.M., New York City time, on
the second business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent
permitted, waiver) of the conditions set forth in Article V with respect to
the Principal Closing (the "Principal Closing Date"). The Principal Closing
shall be deemed to occur and be effective at 11:59 P.M., local time, on the
date of such Closing.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

9  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) The closing of the purchase and sale of the Transferred Assets relating to
each Non-Principal Country Unit and the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities
relating to such Non-Principal Country Unit will occur on the Principal
Closing Date so long as the conditions set forth in Article V with respect to
such Non-Principal Country Unit (excluding those conditions intended to be
satisfied at such Closing) have been satisfied or waived by such date. The
parties expect that the transfer to Buyer of one or more of the Non-Principal
Country Units (including the Transferred Assets, Assumed Liabilities and
Transferred Employees relating thereto) may take place after, but not before,
the Principal Closing. In the event that the Closing with respect to any Non-
Principal Country Unit does not occur contemporaneously with the Principal
Closing because the conditions set forth in Article V with respect to such
Closing have not been satisfied or waived on or prior to the Principal Closing
Date, then the parties shall hold the Closing in respect of such Non-Principal
Country Unit within five business days after all of the conditions set forth
in Article V with respect to such Non-Principal Country Unit have been
satisfied or waived (excluding those conditions intended to be satisfied at
such Closing) (each such date, a "Non-Principal Country Unit Closing Date").
Until the occurrence of the applicable Closing with respect to such Non-
Principal Closing Unit, none of the assets, liabilities or employees of such
Non-Principal Country Unit shall be transferred to or assumed by Buyer, as the
case may be, and Seller shall hold and operate, for its account, such Non-
Principal Country Unit in a manner consistent with Seller's obligations under
Section 6.01, the parties shall diligently work to satisfy the conditions
precedent set forth in Article V, subject to the parties' obligations set
forth in Section 6.05 and the parties shall enter into a distribution
arrangement with respect to such Non-Principal Country Unit upon the terms and
conditions set forth in the Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 2.02. Transferred/Excluded Assets; Assumed/Excluded Liabilities.

  

  

(a) Transferred Assets. Pursuant to the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, at the applicable Closing, Seller will, and will
cause the Selling Affiliates to, sell, convey, assign and transfer to Buyer,
and Buyer will purchase, acquire and accept, the Transferred Assets related to
the applicable Country Unit. Accordingly, Seller will, or will cause its
Affiliates to, execute and deliver at the Principal Closing a general
assignment and bill of sale in the form of Exhibit B (the "General
Assignment"), a general patent assignment in the form of Exhibit C (the
"Patent Assignment") and a general trademark assignment in the form of Exhibit
D (the "Trademark Assignment") and at each applicable Closing such other
instruments of conveyance, assignment and transfer as Buyer reasonably
requests, in each case to convey to Buyer all of Seller's (or its Affiliate's)
right, title and interest in and to the applicable Transferred Assets. All
risk of loss with respect to the Transferred Assets (whether or not covered by
insurance) shall be on Seller up to the time of the applicable Closing,
whereupon such risk of loss with respect to the Transferred Assets conveyed at
such Closing shall pass to Buyer.

  

  

(b) Excluded Assets. Anything to the contrary herein notwithstanding, Buyer is
not purchasing pursuant to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby Seller's (or any of its Affiliates') right, title or
interest in any asset not identified as a Transferred Asset. Specifically,
Seller's (and any of its Affiliates') right, title or interest in any Excluded
Asset is not being conveyed to Buyer.

  

  

(c) Assumed Liabilities. At the applicable Closing, Buyer shall assume the
Assumed Liabilities and shall agree to satisfy and discharge when due the
liabilities and obligations of Seller (and its Affiliates) pursuant to the
Assumed Liabilities, in each case related to the applicable Country Units.
Buyer shall promptly reimburse Seller for the performance by Seller (or any of
its Affiliates) of any Assumed Liability the performance of which by, or on
behalf of, Buyer (or an Affiliate of Buyer) is not accepted by the obligee in
the exercise of such obligee's lawful rights. After the applicable Closing,
Buyer shall pay all Assumed Liabilities related to the applicable Country
Units as and when such liabilities become due. Buyer will execute and deliver
to Seller at each Closing an assumption agreement in the form of Exhibit E
(the "Assumption Agreement") and such other agreements and instruments as
Seller may reasonably request, whereby Buyer agrees to assume and undertakes
to pay, perform and discharge as and when due the Assumed Liabilities related
to the applicable Country Units.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

10  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Excluded Liabilities. Except as specifically provided in this Agreement or
any Ancillary Agreement, neither Buyer nor any of its Affiliates shall assume
or be obligated to pay, perform or otherwise discharge any Excluded Liability.
Seller and its Affiliates, as the case may be, will remain liable to pay,
perform and discharge when due, all Excluded Liabilities.

  

  

(e) Country Transfer Agreements. To the extent required by applicable Law or
as deemed necessary by the parties hereto, the transfer of each Country Unit
outside of the United States will be effected pursuant to a short-form
agreement or instrument of transfer, such as a bill of sale, which agreement
shall be prepared by Seller consistent with the terms of this Agreement and
shall be on terms agreeable to Buyer and wholly consistent with and as close
as reasonably possible to the terms of this Agreement (each, a "Country
Transfer Agreement"). The parties shall enter into the Country Transfer
Agreements as soon as reasonably practicable and no later than the end of the
transition services period for such Country Unit as set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement.

  

  

(f) Designation of Affiliates. To the extent that any of the Transferred
Assets are under the control of any of Seller's Affiliates, Seller shall
direct its Affiliates to promptly take such legal action as may be necessary
to consummate the transfer to Buyer and its Affiliates of such Transferred
Assets under terms and conditions which are wholly consistent with and subject
to the terms of this Agreement. Prior to the applicable Closing, Buyer may
designate, with the consent of Seller, one or more Affiliates to, at the
applicable Closing, (i) acquire all or part of the Transferred Assets or (ii)
assume all or part of the Assumed Liabilities, in each case related to the
applicable Principal Country Unit or Non-Principal Country Unit, as the case
may be, in which event all references herein to Buyer will be deemed to refer
to such Affiliates, as appropriate; provided, however, that no such
designation will in any event limit or affect the obligations of Buyer under
this Agreement to the extent not performed by such Affiliates.

  

  

(g) Transferred Assets Subject to Third-Party Consent. To the extent that the
sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery or attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery to Buyer (or one of its
Affiliates) of any Transferred Asset is prohibited by any applicable Law or
would require any governmental or third party registrations, authorizations,
approvals, consents or waivers (each, a "Consent") and such registrations,
authorizations, approvals, consents or waivers shall not have been obtained
(or are otherwise not in full force and effect) as of the applicable Closing
(each, a "Restricted Transferred Asset"), this Agreement shall not constitute
a sale, assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, or any attempted sale,
assignment, transfer, conveyance or delivery, thereof. For a period of twelve
months after the applicable Closing Date, the parties shall cooperate with
each other to obtain promptly such authorizations, approvals, consents or
waivers; provided, however, that Seller shall not be required to pay any
consideration or make any concession therefor; and provided, further, that if
at the end of such twelve-month period an applicable authorization, approval,
consent or waiver has not been obtained through the best efforts of Buyer and
its Affiliates, such twelve-month period may be extended upon Buyer's request
for a mutually agreed period of time designed to enable the accomplishment of
the consent at issue (provided that in no event shall such period be extended
to beyond the date that is twenty-four months following the Closing Date). If
an authorization, approval, consent or waiver is obtained, Seller shall
assign, transfer, convey or deliver any such Transferred Asset to Buyer at no
additional cost. If not obtained despite Seller's reasonable good faith
efforts, Seller will be deemed to have fulfilled its obligations under this
Agreement and under no circumstances shall the Purchase Price be reduced or
Seller or its Affiliates be subject to any liability on account of the failure
to obtain any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver. Pending the
earlier of obtaining such authorization, approval, consent or waiver or the
expiration of such twelve-month period (or such longer period, as applicable),
the parties shall cooperate with each other in any reasonable and lawful
arrangements designed to provide to Buyer the benefits of use of any such
Transferred Asset. Buyer agrees that no condition to Buyer's obligations to
close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not
satisfied as a result of (i) the failure to obtain any such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver or as a result of any such default or termination;
or (ii) any lawsuit, action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or
threatened by or on behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the
failure to obtain any authorization, approval, consent or waiver or any such
default or termination. Buyer further agrees that no representation, warranty
or covenant of Seller contained in this Agreement shall be breached or deemed
breached, and no condition to Buyer's obligations to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be deemed not satisfied as a result of
(i) the failure to obtain any such authorization, approval, consent or waiver
or as a result of any such default or termination; or (ii) any lawsuit,
action, claim, proceeding or investigation commenced or threatened by or on
behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
authorization, approval, consent or waiver or any such default or termination,
provided that in each such case Seller has complied with its obligation
hereunder to use reasonable good faith efforts to obtain such authorization,
approval, consent or waiver. When a Consent for the sale, assignment,
transfer, conveyance and delivery of a Restricted Transferred Asset is
obtained, Seller shall promptly assign, transfer, convey and deliver such
Restricted Transferred Asset to Buyer pursuant to a special-purpose assignment
agreement substantially similar in terms and conditions set forth in the
General Assignment (which special-purpose agreement the parties shall prepare,
execute and deliver in good faith at the time of such transfer, all at no
additional cost to Buyer).

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(h) Buyer's Recording and Similar Responsibilities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Section 2.02, it shall be Buyer's responsibility
(i) to prepare the applicable country patent assignments and trademark
assignments and to record such assignments following execution thereof by
Seller (or its applicable Affiliate), (ii) to apply for its own marketing
authorizations for the Products to the relevant regulatory authorities where
it is not within the power of Seller to cause, by giving notice to the
applicable regulatory authority, the transfer directly to Buyer of the
existing marketing authorizations identified as Transferred Assets and (iii)
to bear the fees and other costs in accordance with Section 2.06(e) and any
Taxes arising from such activities.

  

  

SECTION 2.03. Purchase Price.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the Principal
Closing, Buyer shall (or shall cause one or more of its Affiliates as Buyer
may designate pursuant to Section 2.02(f) to) pay or cause to be paid to
Seller (or one or more of its Affiliates as Seller may designate), in
immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts
designated in writing by Seller at least two business days prior to the
Principal Closing Date, cash in U.S. dollars (or in a Foreign Currency or any
combination thereof to the extent required by Law) as directed by Seller in an
amount equal to US$165,000,000.00 (the "Purchase Price").

  

  

(b) If Seller directs Buyer to pay the portion of the Purchase Price allocable
to the Transferred Assets associated with Italy as a Principal Country Unit in
Foreign Currency, at least two business days prior to the Principal Closing
Date, Buyer shall determine the Exchange Rate with respect to such Foreign
Currency as set forth in Section 1.02(c).

  

  

(c) Buyer shall not be entitled to deduct from the Purchase Price any Transfer
Taxes.

  

  

SECTION 2.04. Purchase Price Adjustment. For the purposes of clarification
only, Seller is retaining all accounts payable and accounts receivable with
respect to each Country Unit existing on the Seller's books and records as of
the applicable Closing Date and/or arising out of the operation or conduct of
the Business before the applicable Closing for such Country Unit and the only
purchase price adjustment after any Closing will be the adjustment of the
Inventory pursuant to this Section 2.04.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(a) Within 75 days after the Principal Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and
deliver to Buyer a statement in the form of Schedule 2.04(a) (in its draft
form, the "Initial Price Adjustment Statement" and the date on which such
Initial Price Adjustment Statement is delivered to Buyer, the "Initial Price
Adjustment Delivery Date"), setting forth with respect to each Principal
Country Unit the book value of the Inventory as of the Principal Closing Date
of each such Country Unit (the "Principal Country Units Inventory"). To the
extent that the Principal Closing Inventory is greater than $8,051,000 or less
than $8,001,000, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted as described in Section
2.04(f) below (the "Initial Purchase Price Adjustment").

  

  

(b) Within 75 days after each Closing of any Non-Principal Country Unit,
Seller shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a statement in the form of Schedule
2.04(b) (each such statement in its draft form, a "Subsequent Price Adjustment
Statement"), setting forth with respect to each such Non-Principal Country
Unit (i) the book value of the Inventory as of the applicable Closing Date of
each such Non-Principal Country Unit (the "Subsequent Country Inventory") and
(ii) (A) the Subsequent Country Inventory minus the Non-Principal Country Unit
Inventory Target, if the Subsequent Country Inventory is greater than the Non-
Principal Country Unit Inventory Target or (B) the Non-Principal Country Unit
Inventory Target minus the Subsequent Country Inventory, if the Subsequent
Country Inventory is less than the Non-Principal Country Unit Inventory
Target. With respect to each Non-Principal Country Unit, to the extent that
the Subsequent Country Inventory exceeds the Non-Principal Country Unit
Inventory Target or is less than the Non-Principal Country Unit Inventory
Target, as determined as herein provided, the Purchase Price shall be further
adjusted as described in Section 2.04(g) below (each, a "Subsequent Purchase
Price Adjustment").

  

  

(c) In connection with the preparation of the Initial Price Adjustment
Statement and each Subsequent Price Adjustment Statement (each such statement,
a "Price Adjustment Statement"), Buyer shall (A) assist, and shall cause its
Affiliates to assist, Seller, its accountants, advisors and other
representatives in its preparation of each Price Adjustment Statement and (B)
afford to Seller, its accountants, advisors and other representatives,
reasonable access during normal business hours to the personnel, properties,
books and records of the Business to the extent relevant to the preparation of
any Price Adjustment Statement (including any taking and preparing of physical
counts of Inventory). For purposes of this Section 2.04, the book value of
Inventory will be determined in a manner consistent with Seller's inventory
accounting policies used in the preparation of the Financial Statements (the
"Inventory Accounting Policies").

  

  

(d) Each Price Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding upon the
parties on the 30th day following receipt thereof by Buyer unless Buyer gives
written notice of its disagreement (a "Notice of Disagreement") to Seller
prior to such date. Any Notice of Disagreement shall specify in reasonable
detail the nature and amount of any disagreement so asserted. If a timely
Notice of Disagreement is received by Seller, then the relevant Price
Adjustment Statement (as revised in accordance with clause (x) or (y) below)
shall become final and binding upon the parties on the earlier of (x) the date
the parties hereto resolve any differences they have with respect to any
matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement or (y) the date any matters in
dispute are resolved by an accounting firm (in accordance with the procedure
set forth in this Section 2.04) selected by Seller and Buyer or, if the
parties are unable to agree, an independent accounting firm selected by
Seller's and Buyer's independent accounting firms (such firm, the "Accounting
Firm").

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(e) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the Dispute Resolution
provisions set forth in Sections 11.12 and 11.13 of this Agreement shall not
apply to any dispute described in this Section 2.04. During the 30-day period
immediately following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, Seller and
Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve in writing any differences they may
have with respect to any matter specified in the Notice of Disagreement. At
the end of such 30-day period, Seller and Buyer shall submit for review and
resolution by the Accounting Firm any and all matters which remain in dispute
and which were included in the Notice of Disagreement, and the Accounting Firm
shall make a final determination of the values set forth on each Price
Adjustment Statement (and shall use such determination to prepare each final
Price Adjustment Statement), which determination shall be binding on the
parties; provided, however, the scope of such determination by the Accounting
Firm shall be limited to: (i) those matters that remain in dispute and that
were included in the Notice of Disagreement, (ii) whether, for each
calculation of Inventory, such calculation was prepared in accordance with
this Section 2.04, including, whether the Inventory Accounting Policies were
used, and (iii) whether there were mathematical errors in the relevant Price
Adjustment Statement, and the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted
to make any other determination. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any
determination as to the accuracy of Section 3.05 or any other representation
or warranty in this Agreement or as to compliance by Seller or any Selling
Affiliate with any of the covenants in this Agreement (other than this Section
2.04). Each Price Adjustment Statement shall become final and binding on Buyer
and Seller on the date the Accounting Firm delivers the respective final Price
Adjustment Statement to the parties. The fees and expenses of the Accounting
Firm pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be borne one-half each by Buyer and
Seller.

  

  

(f) If the Initial Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Principal
Country Units Inventory exceeds $8,051,000, then the amount of such excess
shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar basis to the Purchase Price. If the
Initial Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Principal Country Units
Inventory is less than $8,001,000, then the Purchase Price shall be reduced on
a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficit. If the Initial Price
Adjustment Statement discloses that the Principal County Units Inventory is
less than $8,051,000 and more than $8,001,000, then there shall be no
adjustment to the Purchase Price in respect of the Principal Closing.

  

  

(g) If a Subsequent Price Adjustment Statement discloses that the Subsequent
Country Inventory for the applicable Non-Principal Country Unit exceeds the
Non-Principal Country Unit Inventory Target for such Non-Principal Country
Unit, then the amount of such excess shall be added on a dollar-for-dollar
basis to the Purchase Price. If a Subsequent Price Adjustment Statement
discloses that the Subsequent Country Inventory for the applicable Non-
Principal Country Unit is less than the Non-Principal Country Unit Inventory
Target for such Non-Principal Country Unit, then the Purchase Price shall be
reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the amount of such deficit.

  

  

(h) No payment pursuant to this Section 2.04 need be made by either party
until the determination of a final Price Adjustment Statement; provided that
not later than 10 business days after the determination of each final Price
Adjustment Statement (each such 10th business day being a "Purchase Price
Adjustment Due Date"), Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be
designated by Buyer) shall pay or cause to be paid to Seller (or one or more
of the Selling Affiliates as may be designated by Seller), in immediately
available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank accounts designated in
writing by Seller at least two business days prior to such Purchase Price
Adjustment Due Date, cash in U.S. dollars or, to the extent if required by
Law, in a Foreign Currency (at the Exchange Rate as determined by Section
1.02(c)) as directed by Seller in an amount equal to the respective positive
Purchase Price adjustment under Sections 2.04(f) and (g), if any.

  

  

(i) On or before each Purchase Price Adjustment Due Date, Seller (or one or
more of its Affiliates as may be designated by Seller) shall pay or cause to
be paid to Buyer (or one or more of its Affiliates as may be designated by
Buyer), in immediately available funds by wire transfer to one or more bank
accounts designated in writing by Buyer at least two business days prior to
such Purchase Price Adjustment Due Date, cash in U.S. dollars or, to the
extent if required by Law, in a Foreign Currency (at the Exchange Rate as
determined by Section 1.02(c)) as directed by Buyer in an amount equal to the
respective negative Purchase Price adjustment under Sections 2.04(f) and (g),
if any.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

   
 

SECTION 2.05. Allocation of Purchase Price. (a) Buyer and Seller shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to agree on an allocation of the
Purchase Price (the "Allocation") after the Principal Closing Date. The
Allocation shall allocate for all purposes (including Tax and financial
accounting purposes) the Purchase Price and Assumed Liabilities among the
Country Units in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code.

  

  

(b) Within 120 calendar days after the Principal Closing, Seller shall deliver
a draft of the Allocation (the "Proposed Allocation") to Buyer for its
consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned. Except as provided in subparagraphs (c) and (d) of this Section
2.05, at the close of business on the 30th calendar day after delivery of the
Proposed Allocation, the Proposed Allocation shall become binding upon Buyer
and Seller, shall be set forth on Schedule 2.05 (the "Allocation Schedule"),
and shall be the Allocation.

  

  

(c) Buyer shall raise any objection to the Proposed Allocation in writing
within 30 calendar days of the delivery of the Proposed Allocation. Buyer and
Seller shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any differences within 30
calendar days after delivery of the Proposed Allocation. If Buyer and Seller
reach written agreement amending the Proposed Allocation within 30 calendar
days after delivery of the Proposed Allocation, the Proposed Allocation, as so
amended, shall become binding upon Buyer and Seller, shall be set forth in the
Allocation Schedule, and shall be the Allocation.

  

  

(d) Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the Dispute Resolution
provisions set forth in Sections 11.12 and 11.13 of this Agreement shall not
apply to any dispute described in this Section 2.05. If Buyer and Seller
cannot agree on the Allocation within 30 calendar days after delivery of the
Proposed Allocation, then all remaining disputed items shall be submitted for
resolution by an independent appraisal firm mutually selected by Buyer and
Seller. Buyer and Seller shall each request that the independent appraisal
firm make a final determination as to the disputed items within 30 calendar
days after such submission. The Proposed Allocation shall be amended
accordingly, and the Proposed Allocation, as so amended, shall become binding
upon Buyer and Seller, shall be set forth in the Allocation Schedule, and
shall be the Allocation. The fees, costs and expenses of the independent
appraisal firm shall be borne equally by Buyer and Seller.

  

  

(e) The Allocation shall be amended to reflect any adjustments (including
those described in Section 2.04) to the Purchase Price under this Agreement.
If, after all adjustments to the Allocation are made, the Allocation with
respect to any Selling Affiliate, when expressed in the relevant local
currency at the Exchange Rate used to determine the Principal Country Units
Closing Inventory or the Subsequent Country Inventory, as applicable, is less
than the local currency net book value recorded on the statutory books for the
Transferred Assets of such Selling Affiliate as of the applicable Closing
Date, then the Allocation with respect to such Selling Affiliate shall be
adjusted so that it is equal to such local currency net book value, and the
parties will agree to a corresponding downward adjustment elsewhere in the
Allocation.

  

  

(f) Each of Seller, Buyer and their respective Affiliates shall prepare and
file its Tax Returns (including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) on a basis
consistent with the Allocation and shall take no position inconsistent with
the Allocation on any Tax Return or in any proceeding before any Taxing
Authority or otherwise. In the event that the Allocation is disputed by any
Taxing Authority, the party receiving notice of the dispute shall promptly
notify the other party hereto, and both Seller and Buyer agree to use their
commercially reasonable efforts to defend such Allocation in any audit or
similar proceeding, and the dispute shall be governed by the procedures for
Claims in Section 10.06.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

   
 

SECTION 2.06. Transfer Taxes and Other Costs.

  

  

(a) All recoverable and non-recoverable transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration, value-added, goods and services and other such Taxes
incurred in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents (such Taxes, together
with any interest, penalties and additions thereto, "Transfer Taxes"), shall
be borne and paid solely by Buyer when due; provided, however, that if Seller
determines (in its sole reasonable discretion) that it is required by
applicable Law to pay any Transfer Taxes, then Seller shall pay such Transfer
Taxes, and Buyer shall, subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of
Seller's payment thereof, promptly reimburse Seller in dollars (or, at
Seller's request, reimburse a Selling Affiliate in local currency), whether or
not such Transfer Taxes were correctly or legally imposed by the applicable
Governmental Entity.

  

  

(b) Seller shall provide, and shall cause its Affiliates to provide, such
cooperation as Buyer or a designee of Buyer may reasonably request in
connection with obtaining a refund of any Transfer Taxes paid or borne by
Buyer or any of its designees hereunder, and any such refunds received by
Seller or any of its Affiliates shall be promptly paid over to Buyer or its
designee (subject to reimbursement by Buyer if Seller or any of its Affiliates
is obligated to repay such refund).

  

  

(c) Seller and Buyer shall file all necessary Tax Returns and other
documentation required to be filed by it with respect to all Transfer Taxes,
and, if required by applicable Law, the parties will, and will cause their
Affiliates to, join in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other
documentation.

  

  

(d) The determination of whether any exemption from (or reduction in) Transfer
Taxes is available with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents shall be
made by Seller in its sole reasonable discretion. In making such
determination, Seller shall take into account any duly completed exemption
certificates delivered to it from Buyer no later than 10 calendar days prior
to the applicable Closing Date to which the certificate relates.

  

  

(e) All costs and fees associated with transferring to Buyer or one of its
Affiliates the Transferred IP and marketing authorizations for the Products
conveyed to Buyer at any Closing shall be borne and paid solely by Buyer when
due; provided, however, that if any such amount shall be incurred by Seller,
Buyer shall, subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of Seller's payment
thereof, promptly reimburse Seller for its out of pocket costs.

  

  

(f) All costs and expenses associated with removing and moving any Transferred
Asset to a location designated by Buyer shall be borne and paid solely by
Buyer when due; provided, however, that if any such amount shall be incurred
by Seller, Buyer shall, subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of
Seller's payment thereof, promptly reimburse Seller for its out of pocket
costs.

  

  

SECTION 2.07. Straddle Periods. In the case of any taxable period that
includes (but does not end on) the applicable Closing Date (a "Straddle
Period"):

  

  

(a) Taxes imposed on a periodic basis (including real, personal and intangible
property Taxes) ("Property Taxes") imposed with respect to the Transferred
Assets for the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period on a pro rata basis (based on the number of days during the
Straddle Period elapsed on or prior to the applicable Closing Date). If at the
time of the applicable Closing, the tax rate or the assessed valuation for the
year in which the applicable Closing occurs has not yet been fixed, Property
Taxes shall be prorated based upon the tax rate and the assessed valuation
established for the previous tax year; and

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) Taxes (other than Property Taxes) imposed with respect to the Transferred
Assets shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-
Closing Tax Period as if such taxable period ended as of the close of business
on the applicable Closing Date.

  

  

SECTION 2.08. Delivery by Seller. (a) At the Principal Closing, Seller will
deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer (unless delivered previously), the
following:

  

  

(i) the Officer's Certificate referred to in Section 5.01(c) hereof;

  

  

(ii) the Secretary's Certificate referred to in Section 5.01(d) hereof;

  

  

(iii) duly executed counterparts of the Ancillary Agreements as contemplated
by Section 7.10;

  

  

(iv) duly executed counterparts of any Country Transfer Agreements related to
the Principal Country Units; and

  

  

(v) a duly executed General Assignment, Patent Assignment and Trademark
Assignment as contemplated by Section 2.02(a).

  

  

(b) At any Non-Principal Country Unit Closing, Seller shall deliver or cause
to be delivered any applicable Country Acquisition Agreement and any other
documents specified therein or as contemplated by Section 2.02(a) with respect
to each Country Unit to be transferred at such Non-Principal Country Unit
Closing.

  

  

SECTION 2.09. Delivery by Buyer. (a) At the Principal Closing, Buyer will
deliver or cause to be delivered to Seller or, as designated by Seller, one or
more of Seller's Affiliates (unless previously delivered), the following:

  

  

(i) the Purchase Price;

  

  

(ii) the Officer's Certificate referred to in Section 5.02(c) hereof;

be delivered any applicable Country Transfer Agreement and any other documents
specified therein with respect to each Country Unit to be transferred at such
Non-Principal Country Unit Closing (including a duly executed Assumption
Agreement with respect to the Assumed Liabilities of such Non-Principal
Country Unit as contemplated by Section 2.02(c)).

ARTICLE III

  

Representations and Warranties of Seller

  

  

Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Transferred Assets are sold "as is,
where is" and Buyer agrees to accept the Transferred Assets on the relevant
Closing Date in the condition they are in at the place they are located on
such Closing Date based on its own inspection, examination and determination
with respect to all matters, and without reliance upon any express or implied
representations or warranties of any nature made by, on behalf of or imputed
to Seller other than as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the Schedules
or Exhibits hereto. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Buyer
acknowledges that Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to
(i) any forecasts, projections, estimates or budgets delivered or made
available to Buyer of future revenues, future results of operations (or any
component thereof), future cash flows or future financial condition (or any
component thereof) of the Business or (ii) any other information or documents
made available to Buyer or its counsel, accountants or advisors with respect
to the Business, except as expressly set forth in this Agreement or the
Schedules or Exhibits hereto. BUYER AGREES THAT THE REPRESENTATIONS AND
WARRANTIES GIVEN HEREIN BY SELLER ARE IN LIEU OF, AND BUYER HEREBY EXPRESSLY
WAIVES ALL RIGHTS TO, ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES THAT MAY OTHERWISE BE APPLICABLE
BECAUSE OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE UNIFORM COMMERCIAL CODE OR ANY OTHER STATUTE,
INCLUDING THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.

  

  

Subject to the foregoing and except as set forth in the Disclosure Schedules
attached hereto, Seller represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date of
this Agreement as follows:

  

  

SECTION 3.01. Organization and Good Standing.

  

  

(a) Each of Seller and the Selling Affiliates is a legal entity duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, and has all requisite corporate
power and authority to own or lease and operate its respective properties
relating to the Business and to carry on the Business as now being operated
and conducted.

  

  

(b) Seller or the applicable Selling Affiliate is qualified to sell the
Products in the Country Units where the Products are currently sold, other
than where the failure to be so qualified would reasonably be expected to
cause a Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

SECTION 3.02. Authority. Seller has full power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to carry out, or cause to be carried out, the
transactions contemplated hereby. Seller and each of the Selling Affiliates
have, or will have at the applicable Closing, full power and authority to
execute and deliver each Transaction Document (other than this Agreement) to
which it is or will be a party and to carry out, or cause to be carried out,
the transactions contemplated by each of the Transaction Documents (other than
this Agreement) to which it is a party. This Agreement has been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller and has been duly
executed and delivered by Seller and constitutes the valid and legally binding
obligation of Seller in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to creditors' rights
generally and (b) the availability of injunctive relief and other equitable
remedies. Each of the Transaction Documents (other than this Agreement) has
been duly authorized by all necessary action on the part of Seller and each
Selling Affiliate and has been, or will be at the applicable Closing, duly
executed and delivered by Seller and each such Selling Affiliate and
constitutes or will constitute the valid and legally binding obligation of
Seller and each such Selling Affiliate in accordance with its terms, except as
such enforceability may be limited by (a) bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar Laws affecting or relating to
creditors' rights generally and (b) the availability of injunctive relief and
other equitable remedies.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

   
 

SECTION 3.03. Title to Tangible Property. Except as otherwise set forth on
Schedule 3.03(a), or as otherwise disclosed in this Agreement, Seller or a
Selling Affiliate (i) has good and valid title to, or the right to transfer
(or cause to be transferred), all the material tangible Transferred Assets,
free and clear of any Liens other than Permitted Liens.

  

  

SECTION 3.04. Assets of the Business. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.04,
none of the Excluded Assets are material to the continued operation of the
Business as it is conducted as of the date of this Agreement. Following all
Closings, except for (i) Excluded Assets and (ii) the services and benefits
available or otherwise offered by Seller or any of the Selling Affiliates to
Buyer or an Affiliate of Buyer under this Agreement or the Ancillary
Agreements, Buyer will own all of the assets exclusively used in or reasonably
necessary to conduct the Business in the same manner as it is conducted as of
the date of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 3.05. Financial Statements. Prior to the date of this Agreement,
Seller has delivered to Buyer true, complete and correct copies of the

(iv) take promptly, in the event that any permanent or preliminary injunction
or other order is entered, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, in
any proceeding that (x) would make consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents unlawful or
that would prevent or delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and (y) relates solely to
Non-Material Assets or Non-Material Other Assets, any and all reasonable steps
(including the appeal thereof or the taking of the steps contemplated by
clauses (i) and (ii) of this subsection (d)) necessary to vacate, modify or

(e) To assist Buyer in complying with its obligations set forth in this
Section 6.05, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, enter into one
or more agreements reasonably requested by Buyer to be entered into by any of

records relating to income Taxes and attorney-client privileged
communications) relating to the Business, and will furnish, at Buyer's

during such period all such information concerning the affairs of the Business
as Buyer may reasonably request. Buyer will hold in confidence all information
so obtained.

  

  

SECTION 6.06. Financing. (a) Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
appropriate action, do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws, and to execute and deliver, or cause to be
executed and delivered, such instruments and documents as may be required, to
arrange the Financing as promptly as reasonably practicable on the terms
(including the "market flex" provisions) and subject only to the conditions
contained in the Financing Commitments, including to (i) negotiate and enter
into definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms
(including the "market flex" provisions) and subject only to the conditions

so long as such definitive agreements (A) do not contain any additional or
modified conditions or other contingencies to the funding of the Financing
than those contained in the Financing Commitments as of the date of this
Agreement, (B) are in a form that is otherwise not reasonably likely to impair
or delay the funding of the Financing or the Principal Closing and (C) do not

aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitments as of
the date of this Agreement, (ii) satisfy, and cause its Affiliates to satisfy,

contained in the Financing Commitments and (iii) consummate the Financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments at the Principal Closing. Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, refrain from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that is reasonably likely to result in the failure of
any of the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments or in any
definitive agreement related to the Financing.

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Section 6.06, Buyer acknowledges and agrees that its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein are not conditioned upon the

written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably conditioned, delayed or
withheld), except that Buyer may amend, supplement or otherwise modify the
Financing Commitments for the Financing if such amendment, supplement or other
modification (A) does not contain additional or modified conditions or other
contingencies to the funding of the Financing relative to those contained in
Financing Commitments for the Financing as in effect on the date of this
Agreement, (B) is otherwise not reasonably likely to impair or delay the
funding of the Financing or the Principal Closing (it being understood that,
subject to the requirements of this clause (c), such amendment, supplement or
other modification of the Financing Commitments may provide for the assignment
of a portion of the Financing Commitment to additional agents or arrangers and
grant such Persons approval rights with respect to certain matters as are
customarily granted to additional agents or arrangers) and (C) do not (I)
materially increase the aggregate amount of Financing or (II) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Financing set forth in the Financing Commitments as of
the date of this Agreement.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

32  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions (including the "market flex" provisions) contained in the Financing
Commitments, Buyer shall promptly notify Seller, and Buyer shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event, replacement commitments on terms that
will enable Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and which will not be reasonably likely to impair or delay the
funding of the Financing or the Principal Closing. Buyer shall deliver to
Seller complete and correct copies of all amendments, supplements, other
modifications or agreements pursuant to which any amended, supplemented,
modified or replacement commitments shall provide Buyer with any portion of
the Financing; provided that Buyer may redact from any such copies the fee
amounts payable to their Financing sources.

  

  

(e) Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, and shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its and its Affiliates' accountants,
legal counsel and other advisors to, provide commercially reasonable

statements of the Business other than those included the Financial Statements,

and (IV) Seller and its Affiliates shall not be required to provide such
requested cooperation beyond the Outside Date, except Seller and its
Affiliates shall be required to cooperate with Buyer by providing reasonable
assistance in obtaining any necessary consents of Seller\'s auditor to the
filing of Financial Statements with the SEC at any time such consent is
required by Law. Buyer shall, promptly upon request by Seller, reimburse
Seller for all out-of-pocket costs incurred by Seller or any of its Affiliates
in connection with such cooperation. Buyer and its Affiliates shall, on a
joint and several basis, indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates
from and against any Damages suffered or incurred by them in connection with
the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith. Seller shall have the right to consent to the use of its and its
Affiliates' logos in connection with the Financing.

  

  

(f) Buyer shall keep Seller informed on a timely basis of the status of the
Financing and within one (1) business day of any material developments
relating to the Financing.

  

  

(g) Buyer acknowledges that the information being provided to it in connection
with the Financing is subject to the terms of Section 6.04.

whether as third party beneficiary or otherwise, under the Financing
Commitments or any financing document related to the Financing and shall not
be entitled to enforce any such Financing Commitments or document against any
agent, arranger, bookrunner, lender, letter of credit issuer or other
financing party that is a party to any such commitment letter or document
(including, without limitation, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A. and Wells Fargo
Securities, LLC and their respective affiliates) (collectively, the "Lender
Group") and (ii) waives any claim (including, without limitation, any claim
under contract, any claim in tort and any claim for specific performance) it
may have against any member of the Lender Group with respect to the failure of
the Financing to close; provided that nothing contained in this sentence shall
prevent the Seller from enforcing any of the terms of this Agreement against
the Buyer or Parent.

representatives access during normal business hours (upon 24 hours' written
notice to Buyer) to all contracts, books, records and other data relating to
the Transferred Assets and Assumed Liabilities conveyed and assumed at any
Closing to the extent that such materials were delivered to Buyer and are
required for a proper purpose. Seller agrees that after the applicable Closing
Buyer or its authorized representatives may, at Buyer's cost and expense, make
copies of those books and records (or redacted portions thereof) that have not

2.02(a), Buyer agrees to arrange for its own insurance policies with respect
to the Business covering all periods and agrees not to seek, through any
means, to benefit from any of Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies
which may provide coverage for claims relating in any way to the Business.

  

  

SECTION 7.05. Payments from Third Parties. In the event that, on or after the
applicable Closing Date, either party shall receive any payments or other
funds due to the other pursuant to the terms of any of the Transaction
Documents, then the party receiving such funds shall promptly forward such
funds to the proper party. The parties acknowledge and agree there is no right
of offset regarding such payments and a party may not withhold funds received
from third parties for the account of the other party in the event there is a
dispute regarding any other issue under any of the Transaction Documents.

  

  

SECTION 7.06. Assurances. For a period of up to eighteen (18) months after the
Principal Closing Date, if either Buyer or Seller becomes aware that any of
the Transferred Assets has not been transferred to Buyer or that any Excluded
Asset has been transferred to Buyer, it shall promptly notify the other and
the parties hereto shall, as soon as reasonably practicable, ensure that such
property is transferred at the recipient's expense, with any necessary prior
third-party consent or approval, to:

  

  

(a) Buyer, in the case of any Transferred Asset which was not transferred at
the applicable Closing Date; or

  

  

(b) Seller, in the case of any Excluded Asset and was transferred at any
Closing.

  

  

SECTION 7.07. Returned Goods. For a period of 180 days after the applicable
Closing Date, Buyer agrees to adhere to the returned goods policy set forth on
Schedule 7.07 attached hereto with respect to all Products of the Business
received from customers, whether sold by Buyer or Seller, to the extent any
such returned Product has the name or trademark of Seller or an Affiliate on
it.

  

  

SECTION 7.08. Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns; Payment of Taxes; No
Section 338(h)(10) Election. (a) In the case of a Tax Return for a Straddle
Period required to be filed after the applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare such Tax Return on a basis consistent with past practice.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

36  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(b) All Taxes due and payable with respect to such Tax Returns will be paid by
filer, subject to reimbursement by the other party pursuant to Sections 10.02
and 10.03.

  

  

SECTION 7.09. No Use. Seller agrees that neither it nor any of its Affiliates
shall use any of the Transferred IP after the applicable Closing Date except
as specifically provided herein or in the Ancillary Agreements.

  

  

SECTION 7.10. Ancillary Agreements. At the Principal Closing, Buyer and Seller
shall enter into, execute and deliver the Transition Services Agreement,
substantially in the form attached as Exhibit F (the "Transition Services
Agreement"),

  

  

SECTION 7.11. Bulk Transfer Laws. Buyer acknowledges that Seller and the
Selling Affiliates have not taken, and do not intend to take, any action
required to comply with any applicable bulk sale or bulk transfer Laws or
similar Laws of any jurisdiction. Buyer hereby waives compliance by Seller and
the Selling Affiliates with the provisions of any bulk sale or bulk transfer
Laws or similar Laws of any jurisdiction in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

Employees

  

  

SECTION 8.01. Employee Benefits Matters. (a) From and after the date of this
Agreement until the applicable Closing Date, Buyer shall consult with Seller
and obtain Seller's consent before distributing any communications to any
Employees of the Business whether relating to employee benefits, post-Closing
terms of employment or otherwise.

  

  

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law and as soon as practicable after
the date of this Agreement, Seller shall provide Buyer with a list to be set
forth on Schedule 8.01(b) containing an identification number, date of hire,
position, location, and base salary, bonus opportunity and wage rate, as
applicable, of the individuals identified by Seller as expected to be
Employees of the Business, and Seller shall update such information
periodically prior to the applicable Closing Date to reflect new hires, leaves
of absence and employment terminations and any other material changes thereto
and provide copies of such updated lists and information to Buyer.

  

  

(c) In the event the employment of an Employee of the Business does not
automatically transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates upon the occurrence of the
Closing by operation of Law, not less than 10 business days prior to the
applicable Closing, Buyer or one of its Affiliates will offer employment,
effective at 11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date, to such
Employee of the Business in accordance with this Agreement and applicable Law;
provided, that, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Buyer shall not
be obligated to offer employment to any Employee of the Business who spends
less than 75% of his or her work effort on the Business. Offers pursuant to
the preceding sentence shall be sufficient to avoid statutory, contractual,
common Law or other severance obligations and shall otherwise comply in all
respects with such applicable Law (including with respect to compensation and
benefits). With respect to any Employee of the Business who, as of the Closing
Date, is on approved leave of absence from work with Seller or its Affiliates,
Buyer shall be entitled to offer employment to such individual on the earliest
practicable date following the return of such individual to work with Seller
and its Affiliates and otherwise on terms and conditions consistent with this
Section 8.01. Sellers shall promptly notify Buyer of the occurrence and end of
any such leave of absence. In the event the employment of an Employee of the
Business transfers automatically to Buyer and its Affiliates upon the
occurrence of the Closing by operation of Law, Buyer and Seller agree to take
or cause to be taken all actions required under applicable Law and all other
actions as are necessary such that the employment of such Employee of the
Business will transfer to Buyer or its Affiliates automatically as of 11:59
P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

37  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(d) Seller and Buyer intend that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement should not constitute a separation, termination or severance of
employment of any Employee of the Business prior to or upon the occurrence of
11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date, including for purposes
of any Business Employee Benefit Plan that provides for separation,
termination or severance benefits, and that such Employee will have continuous
and uninterrupted employment immediately before and immediately after 11:59
P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date, and Seller and Buyer shall,
and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, comply with any requirements
under applicable Law to ensure the same. Other than with respect to any
liability arising directly as a result of Seller's failure to comply with the
disclosure requirements of Section 3.11(a), 3.12(a) or 3.12(b), Buyer or its
Affiliates shall bear 100% of the costs relating to, and shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller and the Selling Affiliates from and against, (i) any
claims made by any Employee of the Business for any statutory or common law
severance or other separation benefits, any contractual or other severance or
separation benefits and any other legally mandated payment obligations
(including any compensation payable during a mandatory termination notice
period and any payments pursuant to a Judgment of a court having jurisdiction
over the parties) and for any other claim, cost, liability or obligation
(whether related to compensation, benefits or otherwise), in each case,
arising out of or in connection with the failure of Buyer or its Affiliates to
make an offer of employment to or continue the employment of any Employee of
the Business (to the extent required under this Section 8.01) or any other
individual that is entitled to automatically transfer to Buyer or its
Affiliates upon the occurrence of the Closing by operation of Law, in each
case, in accordance with this Agreement or applicable Law, and (ii) any claims
relating to the employment of any Transferred Employee on or after 11:59 P.M.,
local time, on the applicable Closing Date, including in respect of any act or
omission relating to the employment of any Transferred Employee on or after
11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date.

  

  

(e) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee, for the two-year period
immediately following the applicable Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates:
(i) shall provide to each Transferred Employee no less favorable base salary,
annual bonus opportunity and wage rates, as applicable, as set forth on
Schedule 8.01(b) and employee benefits under plans, programs and arrangements
which will provide benefits to such Transferred Employee which are no less
favorable, in the aggregate, to the benefits provided by Seller and its
Affiliates pursuant to the material Listed Plans immediately prior to the
applicable Closing Date (excluding any equity-based compensation, defined
benefit pensions or retiree medical benefits); and (ii) shall not (without
such employee's consent) require that such Transferred Employee relocate to an
office that would result in a commute of more than 50 miles from his or her
office as of immediately prior to the applicable Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contemplated by this Agreement shall be construed as
requiring either Buyer or its Affiliates to be obligated to continue the
employment of any U.S. Transferred Employee for any period after the
applicable Closing Date.

  

  

(f) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee, for the two-year period
immediately following the applicable Closing Date, Buyer or its Affiliates
shall provide severance or similar termination benefits provided under the
material Listed Plans and otherwise as provided by applicable Law to each
Transferred Employee that are no less favorable than the better of (i) those
severance or termination benefits applicable to such Transferred Employee as
of immediately prior to the applicable Closing Date and (ii) those provided
under Buyer's severance plan, program, policy or practice (whether contractual
or otherwise) on the date of such Transferred Employee's termination. For the
avoidance of doubt, if during such two-year period a U.S. Transferred
Employee's employment should terminate as a result of his or her desire not to
accept a relocation as described in clause (ii) of this Section 8.01(f), then
Buyer will be obligated to pay such U.S. Transferred Employee severance at
least equal to the amount that such employee would have received if Seller's
severance plan, program, policy or practice (based on the terms and conditions
set forth on the applicable Closing Date) were still in effect on the date of
such U.S. Transferred Employee's termination.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(g) With respect to each U.S. Transferred Employee, effective from and after
11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall (i) recognize, for all purposes (other than benefit accrual
under a defined benefit pension plan) under all plans, programs and
arrangements established or maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the
benefit of the Transferred Employees as of the effective date of such hire,
service with Seller and the Selling Affiliates prior to the applicable Closing
Date to the extent such service was recognized under the corresponding Listed
Plan covering such Transferred Employees including, for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and benefit levels and accruals, and (ii) waive any pre-
existing condition exclusion, actively-at-work requirement or waiting period
under all employee health and other welfare benefit plans established or
maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates for the benefit of the Transferred
Employees, except to the extent such pre-existing condition, exclusion,
requirement or waiting period would have applied to such individual under the
corresponding Listed Plan and (iii) provide full credit for any co-payments,
deductibles or similar payments made or incurred prior to the applicable
Closing Date for the plan year in which the applicable Closing occurs,
provided that the Seller provides sufficient information to Buyer or its
Affiliates within ten (10) business days following the applicable Closing to
enable it to implement such a commitment.

  

  

(h) Buyer shall be, or shall cause its Affiliates to be, responsible for all
(A) medical, vision, dental and prescription drug claims for expenses incurred
by any Transferred Employee or his or her dependents, (B) claims for short-
term and long-term disability income benefits incurred by any Transferred
Employee and (C) claims for group life, travel and accident, and accidental
death and dismemberment insurance benefits incurred by any Transferred
Employee, in each case, on or after 11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable
Closing Date. Except in the event of any claim for workers compensation
benefits, for purposes of this Agreement, the following claims and liabilities
shall be deemed to be incurred as follows: (A) medical, vision, dental and/or
prescription drug benefits (including hospital expenses), upon provision of
the services, materials or supplies comprising any such benefits and (B) short
and long-term disability, life, accidental death and dismemberment and
business travel accident insurance benefits, upon the death, illness, injury
or accident giving rise to such benefits. Sellers and their Subsidiaries shall
be responsible for all claims for workers compensation benefits that are
incurred prior to 11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date by
any Transferred Employee. Buyer and its Affiliates shall be responsible for
all claims for benefits that are incurred on or after 11:59 P.M., local time,
on the applicable Closing Date by any Transferred Employee. A claim for
workers compensation benefits shall be deemed to be incurred when the event
giving rise to the claim (the "Workers Compensation Event") occurs. If the
Workers Compensation Event occurs over a period both preceding and following
the applicable Closing, the claim shall be the joint responsibility and
liability of Seller and Buyer and shall be equitably apportioned between
Seller and Buyer based upon the relative periods of time that the Workers
Compensation Event transpired preceding and following the applicable Closing.

  

  

(i) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 8.01 to the contrary,
effective from and after 11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing
Date, (i) with respect to Non-U.S. Transferred Employees, Buyer or its
Affiliates shall provide to such employees the same terms and conditions of
employment (including plans, programs, social insurance contribution or
arrangements) to the extent (x) required by applicable Law in the relevant
non-U.S. jurisdiction and (y) required so that Seller and the Selling
Affiliates shall avoid any liability that would otherwise result from a
failure to comply with applicable Law, and (ii) with respect to Transferred
Employees covered by Collective Bargaining Agreements, Buyer or one of its
Affiliates shall comply with applicable Law concerning Collective Bargaining
Agreements in the context of this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

39  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(j) If any Employee of the Business requires a work permit or employment pass
or other legal or regulatory approval for his or her employment with Buyer or
its Affiliates, Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, use their
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any such permit, pass or other
approval to be obtained and in effect prior to 11:59 P.M., local time, on the
applicable Closing Date.

  

  

(k) As of 11:59 P.M., local time, on the applicable Closing Date, Seller shall
provide to Buyer and its Affiliates all employment records for Transferred
Employees required to be provided to Buyer and its Affiliates under applicable
Law. Buyer and its Affiliates shall ensure that all such records are used only
in connection with the employment of the Transferred Employees and shall keep
such employment records confidential; provided that Buyer and its Affiliates
shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its Affiliates from and against
any statutory, common Law or other claims that arise from the use of such
employment records other than for employment, compensation or termination-
related purposes.

  

  

(l) The provisions contained in this Agreement with respect to Employees of
the Business are included for the sole benefit of the respective parties
hereto and shall not create any right in any other person, including any
Employee of the Business (or dependent or beneficiary of any of the
foregoing). Nothing herein shall be deemed an amendment of any plan providing
benefits to any Employee of the Business.

  

  

(m) Seller and the Selling Affiliates shall not, for a period of one (1) year
after the Principal Closing Date, directly or indirectly, hire or seek to
hire, or solicit for employment any Transferred Employee; provided, however,
that Seller and the Selling Affiliates shall not be prohibited from making
general advertising or executive searches not targeted at Seller's or Selling
Affiliates' Transferred Employees.

  

  

ARTICLE IX

  

Termination

  

  

SECTION 9.01. Buyer Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer:
(a) at any time prior to the Principal Closing, if (i) Seller shall have
failed to comply, in any material respect, with any of Seller's covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement (other than any obligation of Seller
and its Affiliates set forth in Section 6.06(e), excluding Seller's obligation
to deliver the Supplemental Financial Information) or (ii) any one or more of
the representations or warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement shall
prove to have been inaccurate in any material respect when made and, in the
case of clauses (i) and (ii), such failure or inaccuracy has a Material
Adverse Effect as of the Principal Closing, and Buyer shall have given Seller
a reasonable opportunity to cure any such failure or inaccuracy to so comply
before the Principal Closing; (b) at the Principal Closing, if any of the
conditions precedent to the performance of Buyer's obligations at the
Principal Closing shall have become incapable of fulfillment; (c) if the
Principal Closing shall not have occurred on or before the Outside Date; or
(d) upon the issuance of any final, nonappealable order by a court of
competent jurisdiction precluding the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (by injunction or otherwise); provided,
however, that Buyer may only terminate this Agreement if at the time of
termination Buyer is not in material breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

40  

  

 

 

 

   
 

SECTION 9.02. Seller Termination. This Agreement may be terminated by Seller:
(a) at any time prior to the Principal Closing, if (i) Buyer shall have failed
to comply, in any material respect, with any of Buyer's covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement or (ii) any one or more of the
representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement shall prove
to have been inaccurate in any material respect when made and, in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii), such failure or inaccuracy would have a material adverse
effect on the ability of Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby and Seller shall have given Buyer a reasonable opportunity to cure any
such failure or inaccuracy to so comply before the Principal Closing; (b) at
the Principal Closing, if any of the conditions precedent to the performance
of Seller's obligations at the Principal Closing shall have become incapable
of fulfillment; (c) if the Principal Closing shall not have occurred on or
before the Outside Date; (d) upon the issuance of any final, nonappealable
order by a court of competent jurisdiction precluding the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (by injunction or otherwise);
provided, however, that Seller may only terminate this Agreement if at the
time of termination Seller is not in material breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement (other than any obligation of Seller and its Affiliates set forth in
Section 6.06(e), excluding Seller's obligation to deliver the Supplemental
Financial Information); or (e) if (i) all of the conditions set forth in
Section 5.01 hereof have been satisfied (other than those conditions that (A)
by their terms are to be satisfied at the Principal Closing or (B) the failure
of which to be satisfied is attributable primarily to a breach by Buyer of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement), (ii) Seller has irrevocably confirmed by notice to Buyer that all
conditions set forth in Section 5.02 have been satisfied or that it is willing
to waive any unsatisfied conditions in Section 5.02 hereof and (iii) the
Principal Closing shall not have occurred within one business day after
delivery of such notice.

  

  

SECTION 9.03. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated pursuant
to this Article IX, it will become void and of no further force and effect,
with no liability on the part of any party to this Agreement (or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
stockholders, managers, members, directors, officers, Affiliates or agents),
except that the provisions of this Section 9.03 and Article XI will survive
any termination of this Agreement; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from liability for Damages incurred or suffered by any
other party as a result of any fraud, willful misconduct or any breach of any
covenant or other agreement (excluding in either case any breach of Section
6.06(e), other than Seller's obligation to deliver the Supplemental Financial
Information) contained in this Agreement (whether or not intentional or
willful), including any failure by Buyer to consummate the Principal Closing
in accordance with Section 2.01 (whether or not due in part or in whole to any
failure of any of the Financing to be consummated).

  

  

ARTICLE X

  

Indemnification

  

  

SECTION 10.01. Survival. All representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement and the covenants contained in Article VI of this Agreement shall
survive the Principal Closing until the date that is 12 months from the
Principal Closing Date, provided however, that the Tax Representations and the
representations and warranties set forth in Sections 3.07, 3.09, 3.12, 3.13
and 3.15 shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations, or until the expiration of the period in which any regulatory
authority has the power to make any claims, assessment or reassessment with
respect thereto, whichever is longer, with respect to any matter subject to
the representations and warranties contained in those sections, provided,
further, that the Title Representations, the Broker Representations and any
representations contained in Sections 3.01(a), 3.02, 3.03 or 4.01 shall
survive without limitation as to time. When a representation or warranty
expires, it shall be of no force or effect. The other covenants contained in
this Agreement shall survive indefinitely except as otherwise specified
herein.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

41  

  

 

 

 

   
 

SECTION 10.02. Indemnification by Seller. Seller indemnifies and holds
harmless Buyer and its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and
representatives (the "Buyer Indemnitees") against and from any and all Damages
which any Buyer Indemnitee may incur or suffer to the extent such arise out of
or result from (i) the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement made by Seller in this Agreement or (ii) any of the Excluded
Liabilities. Notwithstanding that a claim for Damages may fall into multiple
categories of this Section 10.02, Seller shall be required to indemnify a
Buyer Indemnitee one time only. Buyer shall take, and shall cause the other
Buyer Indemnitees to take, reasonable steps to mitigate any Damages upon
becoming aware of any event that would reasonably be expected to, or does,
give rise thereto.

  

  

SECTION 10.03. Indemnification by Buyer. In addition to the indemnification
set forth in Sections 6.05(e), 7.01(b), 8.01(d) and 8.01(k), Buyer and Parent
indemnify and hold harmless Seller against and from any and all Damages which
Seller and any of its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, agents and
representatives (the "Seller Indemnitees") may incur or suffer to the extent
such arise out of or result from (i) the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer in this Agreement or (ii) any of
the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding that a claim for Damages may fall
into multiple categories of this Section 10.03, Buyer shall be required to
indemnify a Seller Indemnitee one time only. Seller shall take, and shall
cause the other Seller Indemnitees to take, all commercially reasonable steps
to mitigate any Damages upon becoming aware of any event that would reasonably
be expected to, or does, give rise thereto.

  

  

SECTION 10.04. Scope of Seller's Liability. (a) Indemnification shall be
available to the Buyer Indemnitees under Section 10.02(i) with respect to
breaches of representations or warranties if the aggregate amount of Damages
otherwise due to the Buyer Indemnitees for all claims for such indemnification
exceeds one percent (1%) of the Purchase Price (the "First Basket") and then
indemnification shall apply to all Damages incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees
from the first dollar incurred, but only for all such Damages up to fifteen
percent (15%) of the Purchase Price (the "Indemnification Cap"). Seller shall
not have any liability under Section 10.02(i) with respect to breaches of
representations or warranties for any individual item where the Damages
relating thereto are less than $150,000 (together with the First Basket, the
"Indemnification Baskets").

  

  

(b) For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Indemnitees shall be entitled to the
indemnification provided for hereunder even if any of them obtained knowledge
before the Principal Closing Date or Non-Principal Country Unit Closing Date,
as applicable, of the matter that is later the subject of a claim for
indemnity.

  

  

SECTION 10.05. Claims. Any Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee claiming it
may be entitled to indemnification under this Article X (the "Indemnified
Party") shall give prompt written notice to the other party (the "Indemnifying
Party") of each matter, action, cause of action, claim, demand, fact or other
circumstances upon which a claim for indemnification (a "Claim") hereunder may
be based. Such notice shall contain, with respect to each Claim, such facts
and information as are then reasonably available, the estimated amount of
Damages and the specific basis for indemnification hereunder. Failure to give
prompt notice of a Claim hereunder shall not affect the Indemnifying Party's
obligations hereunder, except to the extent the Indemnifying Party is
prejudiced by such failure.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

42  

  

 

 

 

   
 

SECTION 10.06. Defense of Actions. The Indemnified Party shall permit the
Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Party's option and expense, to assume
the complete defense of any Claim based on any action, suit, proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment by any third party with full authority to conduct
such defense and to settle or otherwise dispose of the same and the
Indemnified Party will fully cooperate in such defense; provided the
Indemnifying Party will not, in defense of any such action, suit, proceeding,
claim, demand or assessment, except with the consent of the Indemnified Party
(which consent will not be unreasonably withheld), consent to the entry of any
Judgment or enter into any settlement (a) which provides for any relief other
than the payment of monetary damages and/or (b) which does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the third-party claimant to the
Indemnified Party of a release from all liability in respect thereof. After
notice to the Indemnified Party of the Indemnifying Party's election to assume
the defense of such action, suit, proceeding, claim, demand or assessment, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party only for such
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in
connection with the defense thereof at the request of the Indemnifying Party.
As to those third-party actions, suits, proceedings, claims, demands or
assessments with respect to which the Indemnifying Party does not elect to
assume control of the defense, the Indemnified Party will afford the
Indemnifying Party an opportunity to participate in such defense, at its cost
and expense, and will consult with the Indemnifying Party prior to settling or
otherwise disposing of any of the same. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, with respect to any Claim asserted by a Governmental Entity
relating to Taxes, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in
the defense, but the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The
Indemnified Party will not settle any Claim without the prior consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

  

  

SECTION 10.07. Limitation, Exclusivity. No Claim based upon a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant shall be made or have any validity unless
the Indemnified Party shall have given written notice of such Claim to the
Indemnifying Party prior to the date such representation, warranty or covenant
expires as set forth in Section 10.01. If full recovery under any such Claim
is not had within three months of such written notice, mediation under Section
11.13 must be initiated within 30 days following the end of such three-month
period or such Claim shall be invalidated. This Article X provides the
exclusive means by which a party may assert and remedy Claims, and Sections
11.12 and 11.13 provide the exclusive means by which a party may bring actions
against the other party under or with respect to this Agreement. Each party
hereby waives and releases any other remedies or claims that it may have
against the other party (or any of its Affiliates) with respect to the matters
arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or relating to the
Transferred Assets, except that nothing herein shall limit the liability of
any party hereto for fraud or intentional misrepresentation. With respect to
any Damages arising under this Agreement, Buyer agrees that it shall only seek
such Damages from Seller or its successors or permitted assigns, and Buyer
hereby waives the right to seek Damages from or equitable remedies, such as
injunctive relief, against any Affiliate of Seller or any director, officer or
employee of Seller (or any of its Affiliates).

  

  

SECTION 10.08. Calculation of Damages. Except as otherwise provided in this
Article X, in any case where the Indemnified Party subsequently recovers from
third parties any amount in respect of a matter with respect to which an
Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount
so recovered (after deducting therefrom the full amount of the expenses
incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of any amount
previously so paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party in respect of such matter.

  

  

SECTION 10.09. Tax Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any indemnity payment
under this Agreement shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price
for Tax purposes unless there is no reasonable basis for doing so under the
applicable Tax Law.

  

  

SECTION 10.10. Parent Guarantee. Parent hereby unconditionally guarantees, and
agrees to cause Buyer to satisfy, all obligations of Buyer under this
Agreement. The guarantee provided pursuant to the immediately preceding
sentence (a) shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price and (b) shall
terminate upon the earlier to occur of (i) the last to expire of Buyer's
representations and warranties and (ii) the valid termination of this
Agreement (the "Guarantee Termination"); provided that in the event Seller has
made a claim against Buyer and/or Parent in connection with the termination of
this Agreement, then the Guarantee Termination under clause (b) of this
sentence shall not occur until the final, nonappealable resolution (and, if
applicable, satisfaction) of such claim. Nothing in this Section 10.10 shall
be construed to limit in any way the right of Seller to seek an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement as contemplated by Section 11.12.

SECTION 11.01. No Reliance by Buyer; Own Due Diligence. Buyer is relying on
its own investigation, examination and valuation of the Business, including
the Transferred Assets, in effecting the transactions covered by this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. Buyer has made all inspections
and investigations of the Business and the Transferred Assets deemed necessary
or desirable by Buyer. Buyer is purchasing the Transferred Assets based on the
results of its inspections and investigations, and not on any representation
or warranty of Seller or any of its Affiliates not expressly set forth in this
Agreement. In light of these inspections and investigations and the
representations and warranties made to Buyer by Seller herein, Buyer is
relinquishing any right to any claim based on any representations and
warranties other than those expressly set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 11.02. Financial Statements and Projections. (a) In connection with
Buyer's investigation of the Business, Buyer may have received from Seller
various forward-looking statements regarding the Business (including the
estimates, assumptions, projections, forecasts and plans furnished to it) (the
"Forward-Looking Statements"). Buyer acknowledges and agrees (i) there are
uncertainties inherent in attempting to make the Forward-Looking Statements;
(ii) Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties; (iii) Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own investigation, examination and valuation of
the Business and has employed outside professionals to assist it with the
foregoing; (iv) Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own
evaluation of the adequacy and accuracy of all Forward-Looking Statements; (v)
Buyer is not relying on any Forward-Looking Statement in any manner whatsoever
and (vi) with respect to the foregoing, Buyer shall have no claim against
Seller or any of its Affiliates.

  

  

(b) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying any Forward-Looking Statement.

  

  

(c) Seller makes no representation or warranty with respect to any Forward-
Looking Statement made (i) in the Confidential Descriptive Memorandum, (ii) in
the Data Room, (iii) in the Management Presentation, (iv) in any supplemental
due diligence information provided to Buyer, (v) in connection with Buyer's
discussions with management of the Business, (vi) in negotiations leading to
this Agreement or (vii) in any other circumstance.

  

  

SECTION 11.03. "To the knowledge." "To the knowledge of Seller" or other
references to the knowledge or awareness of Seller or its Affiliates means the
actual knowledge of those individuals set forth on Schedule 11.03.

  

  

SECTION 11.04. Waivers. At any time and from time to time prior to the
applicable Closing, the parties hereto may by written agreement signed by both
parties, (a) extend the time for, or waive in whole or in part, the
performance of any obligation of any party hereto under this Agreement, (b)
waive any inaccuracy in any representation, warranty or statement of any party
hereto or (c) waive any condition or compliance with any covenant contained in
this Agreement.

SECTION 11.05. Modifications and Amendments. This Agreement shall not be
altered or otherwise amended except pursuant to an instrument in writing
executed and delivered by each of the parties hereto.

  

  

SECTION 11.06. Assignability, Beneficiaries, Governing Law and Enforcement.
This Agreement and the rights and obligations hereunder shall be binding upon
and inure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto, their respective
successors and permitted assigns, but this Agreement shall not be assignable
by either party hereto without the express written consent of the other party
hereto, which will not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, Parent may, without the consent of
any party hereto, assign from and after the Principal Closing Date, all or any
portion of its rights and obligations under this Agreement to any of its
and/or Buyer's lenders as collateral security but any such assignment shall
not release Parent from any of its obligations under this Agreement. Other
than as explicitly set forth herein, including in Sections 10.02 and 10.03,
nothing contained herein is intended to confer upon any Person, other than the
parties to this Agreement and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, any rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement. This
Agreement shall be governed by the law of the State of New York without
reference to the choice of law doctrine of such state. The parties agree that
irreparable damage would occur and that the parties would not have any
adequate remedy at law if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which any party is entitled at law or in
equity.

SECTION 11.08. Headings. The Article and Section headings contained in this
Agreement are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the
meaning and interpretation of this Agreement.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

   
 

SECTION 11.09. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original and all of which
shall be deemed to constitute the same Agreement.

  


 

  

SECTION 11.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement, together with the Exhibits
and Schedules expressly contemplated hereby and attached hereto and the other
agreements and certificates delivered in connection herewith including the
Confidentiality Agreement, contains the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements or understandings between the parties. Before signing
this Agreement the parties have had numerous conversations including
preliminary discussions, formal negotiations and informal conversations at
meals and social occasions, and have generated correspondence and other
writings, in which the parties discussed the transaction which is the subject
of this Agreement and their aspirations for success. In such conversations and
writings, individuals representing the parties may have expressed their
judgments and beliefs concerning the intentions, capabilities, and practices
of the parties, and may have forecasted future events. The parties recognize
that such conversations and writings often involve an effort by both sides to
be positive and optimistic about the prospects for the transaction. However,
it is also recognized that all business transactions contain an element of
risk, as does the transaction contemplated by this Agreement, and that it is
normal business practice to limit the legal obligations of contracting parties
to only those promises and representations which are essential to their
transaction so as to provide certainty as to their respective future rights
and remedies. Accordingly, other than the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into between the parties, the Transaction Documents are intended to define the
full extent of the legally enforceable undertakings and representations of the
parties hereto, and no promise or representation, written or oral, which is
not set forth explicitly in such agreements is intended by either party to be
legally binding. Each of the parties acknowledge that in deciding to enter
into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents and to consummate the
transaction contemplated hereby and thereby, none of them has relied upon any
statements or representations, written or oral, other than those explicitly
set forth herein or therein.

  


 

  

SECTION 11.11. Payment of Expenses. Except as otherwise set forth in this
Agreement, all costs and expenses associated with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby, including the fees of counsel and
accountants and fees relating to the Financing, shall be borne by the party
incurring such expenses.

  


 

  

SECTION 11.12. Arbitration. (a) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising from
or related in any way to this Agreement or the interpretation, application,
breach, termination or validity thereof, including any claim of inducement of
this Agreement by fraud or otherwise, will be submitted for resolution to
arbitration pursuant to the rules then pertaining of the International
Institute for Conflict Prevention and Resolution for Non-Administered
Arbitration (available at http://www.cpradr.org), or successor ("CPR"), except
where those rules conflict with these provisions, in which case these
provisions control. The arbitration will be held in New York, New York.

  


 

  

(b) The panel shall consist of three arbitrators chosen from the CPR Panels of
Distinguished Neutrals (or, by agreement, from another provider of
arbitrators) each of whom is a lawyer with at least 15 years experience with a
law firm or corporate law department of over 25 lawyers or who was a judge of
a court of general jurisdiction. In the event the aggregate damages sought by
the claimant are stated to be less than $5 million, and the aggregate damages
sought by the counterclaimant are stated to be less than $5 million, and
neither side seeks equitable relief, then a single arbitrator shall be chosen,
having the same qualifications and experience specified above. Each arbitrator
shall be impartial and independent of the parties and shall abide by the Code
of Ethics for Arbitrators in Commercial Disputes (available at
http://www.adr.org).

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) The parties agree to cooperate (i) to attempt to select the arbitrator(s)
by agreement within 45 days of initiation of the arbitration, including
jointly interviewing the final candidates, (ii) to meet with the arbitrator(s)
within 45 days of selection and (iii) to agree at that meeting or before upon
procedures for discovery and as to the conduct of the hearing which will
result in the hearing being concluded within no more than nine months after
selection of the arbitrator(s) and in the award being rendered within 60 days
of the conclusion of the hearings, or of any post hearing briefing, which
briefing will be completed by both sides within 45 days after the conclusion
of the hearings.

  

  

(d) In the event the parties cannot agree upon selection of the arbitrator(s),
the CPR will select arbitrator(s) as follows: CPR shall provide the parties
with a list of no less than 25 proposed arbitrators (15 if a single arbitrator
is to be selected) having the credentials referenced above. Within 25 days of
receiving such list, the parties shall rank at least 65% of the proposed
arbitrators on the initial CPR list, after exercising cause challenges. The
parties may then interview the five candidates (three if a single arbitrator
is to be selected) with the highest combined rankings for no more than one
hour each and, following the interviews, may exercise one peremptory challenge
each. The panel will consist of the remaining three candidates (or one, if one
arbitrator is to be selected) with the highest combined rankings. In the event
these procedures fail to result in selection of the required number of
arbitrators, CPR shall select the appropriate number of arbitrators from among
the members of the various CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals, allowing each
side challenges for cause and three peremptory challenges each.

  

  

(e) In the event the parties cannot agree upon procedures for discovery and
conduct of the hearing meeting the schedule set forth in paragraph (c) above,
then the arbitrator(s) shall set dates for the hearing, any post hearing
briefing, and the issuance of the award in accord with the paragraph (c)
schedule. The arbitrator(s) shall provide for discovery according to those
time limits, giving recognition to the understanding of the parties that they
contemplate reasonable discovery, including document demands and depositions,
but that such discovery be limited so that the paragraph (c) schedule may be
met without difficulty. In no event will the arbitrator(s), absent agreement
of the parties, allow more than a total of 10 days for the hearing or permit
either side to obtain more than a total of 40 hours of deposition testimony
from all witnesses, including both fact and expert witnesses, or serve more
than 20 individual requests for documents, including subparts, or 20
individual requests for admission or interrogatories, including subparts.
Multiple hearing days will be scheduled consecutively to the greatest extent
possible.

  

  

(f) The arbitrator(s) must render their award by application of the
substantive law of New York and are not free to apply "amiable compositeur" or
"natural justice and equity." The arbitrator(s) shall render a written opinion
setting forth findings of fact and conclusions of law with the reasons
therefor stated. A transcript of the evidence adduced at the hearing shall be
made and shall, upon request, be made available to either party. The
arbitrator(s) shall have power to exclude evidence on grounds of hearsay,
prejudice beyond its probative value, redundancy, or irrelevance and no award
shall be overturned by reason of such ruling on evidence. To the extent
possible, the arbitration hearings and award will be maintained in confidence.

  

  

(g) In the event the panel's award exceeds $5 million in monetary damages or
includes or consists of equitable relief, or rejects a claim in excess of that
amount or for that relief, then the losing party may obtain review of the
arbitrators' award or decision by a single appellate arbitrator (the "Appeal
Arbitrator") selected from the CPR Panels of Distinguished Neutrals by
agreement or, failing agreement within seven working days, pursuant to the
selection procedures specified in paragraph (d) above. If CPR cannot provide
such services, the parties will together select another provider of
arbitration services that can. No Appeal Arbitrator shall be selected unless
he or she can commit to rendering a decision within 45 days following oral
argument as provided in paragraph (h). Any such review must be initiated
within 30 days following the rendering of the award referenced in paragraph
(f) above.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(h) The Appeal Arbitrator will make the same review of the arbitration panel's
ruling and its basis that the U.S. Court of Appeals of the Circuit where the
arbitration hearings are held would make of findings of fact and conclusions
of law rendered by a district court after a bench trial and then modify,
vacate or affirm the arbitration panel's award or decision accordingly, or
remand to the panel for further proceedings. The Appeal Arbitrator will
consider only the arbitration panel's findings of fact and conclusions of law,
pertinent portions of the hearing transcript and evidentiary record as
submitted by the parties, opening and reply briefs of the party pursuing the
review, and the answering brief of the opposing party, plus a total of no more
than four hours of oral argument evenly divided between the parties. The party
seeking review must submit its opening brief and any reply brief within 75 and
130 days, respectively, following the date of the award under review, whereas
the opposing party must submit its responsive brief within 110 days of that
date. Oral argument shall take place within five months after the date of the
award under review, and the Appeal Arbitrator shall render a decision within
45 days following oral argument. That decision will be final and not subject
to further review, except pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act.

  

  

(i) The parties consent to the jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for
the district in which the arbitration is held for the enforcement of these
provisions and the entry of judgment on any award rendered hereunder
(including after review by the Appeal Arbitrator where such an appeal is
pursued). Should such court for any reason lack jurisdiction, any court with
jurisdiction shall act in the same fashion.

  

  

(j) Each party has the right before or, if the arbitrator(s) cannot hear the
matter within an acceptable period, during the arbitration to seek and obtain
from the appropriate court provisional remedies such as attachment,
preliminary injunction, replevin, etc. to avoid irreparable harm, maintain the
status quo, or preserve the subject matter of the arbitration.

  

  

(k) EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL OF ANY ISSUE BY JURY.

  

  

(l) EACH PARTY HERETO WAIVES (i) ANY CLAIM TO SPECIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY OR
MULTIPLIED DAMAGES, (ii) ANY CLAIM OF CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOSS OF
PROFIT DAMAGES AND (iii) ANY CLAIM FOR ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS AND
PREJUDGMENT INTEREST, IN EACH CASE FROM THE OTHER PARTY HERETO (OR ANY
AFFILIATE OF SUCH OTHER PARTY HERETO).

  

  

SECTION 11.13. Mediation. (a) Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of
or related to this Agreement, or the interpretation, application, breach,
termination or validity thereof, including any claim of inducement by fraud or
otherwise, which claim would, but for this provision, be submitted to
arbitration shall, before submission to arbitration, first be mediated through
non-binding mediation in accordance with The CPR Mediation Procedure then in
effect of CPR (available at http://www.cpradr.org), except where that
procedure conflicts with these provisions, in which case these provisions
control. The mediation shall be conducted in New York, New York and shall be
attended by a senior executive with authority to resolve the dispute from each
of the parties.

  

  

(b) The mediator shall be neutral, independent, disinterested and shall be
selected from a professional mediation firm such as JAMS or CPR.

   
 

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

   
 

(c) The parties shall promptly confer in an effort to select a mediator by
agreement. In the absence of such an agreement within 10 days of initiation of
the mediation, the mediator shall be selected by CPR as follows: CPR shall
provide the parties with a list of at least 15 names from the CPR Panels of
Distinguished Neutrals. Each party shall exercise challenges for cause, two
peremptory challenges, and rank the remaining candidates within 5 working days
of receiving the CPR list. The parties may together interview the three top
ranked candidates for no more than one hour each and, after the interviews,
may each exercise one peremptory challenge. The mediator shall be the
remaining candidate with the highest aggregate ranking.

  

  

(d) The mediator shall confer with the parties to design procedures to
conclude the mediation within no more than 45 days after initiation. Under no
circumstances may the commencement of arbitration under the Section 11.12 be
delayed more than 45 days by the mediation process specified herein absent
contrary agreement of the parties.

  

  

(e) Each party agrees not to use the period or pendency of the mediation to
disadvantage the other party procedurally or otherwise. No statements made by
either side during the mediation may be used by the other or referred to
during any subsequent proceedings.

  

  

(f) Each party has the right to pursue provisional relief from any court, such
as attachment, preliminary injunction, replevin, etc., to avoid irreparable
harm, maintain the status quo, or preserve the subject matter of the
arbitration, even though mediation has not been commenced or completed.

  

  

SECTION 11.14. Survival of Certain Provisions. The provisions of this
Agreement set forth in Articles X and XI and any remedies for the breach
thereof, shall survive the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 11.15. Fulfillment of Obligations. Any obligation of any party to any
other party under this Agreement, which obligation is performed, satisfied or
fulfilled by an Affiliate of such party, shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

  

  

SECTION 11.16. Severability. It is the desire and intent of the parties hereto
that the provisions of this Agreement will be enforced to the fullest extent
permissible under the Laws in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is
sought. Accordingly, if any particular provision of this Agreement will be
determined to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision will be deemed
amended to delete therefrom the portion thus determined to be invalid or
unenforceable, such deletion to apply to the extent of such invalidity or
unenforceability, without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof
only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular
jurisdiction in which such determination is made.

FORM OF PATENT ASSIGNMENT

  


 

  

This PATENT ASSIGNMENT is made and entered into as of [ ], 2011, between [ ],
a [ ] ("Assignor"), and [ ], a [ ] ("Assignee").

  


 

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to, and upon the terms of, that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement dated as of [ ], 2011 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), by and among
[ ], a [ ] ("Buyer"), [ ], a [ ], and [ ], a [ ], Buyer agreed to purchase

therefor, together with all reissuances, divisions, renewals, revisions,
extensions, reexaminations, provisionals, continuations and continuations-in-
part with respect thereto and including all foreign equivalents of and/or
counterparts to any of the foregoing as set forth on Schedule A annexed hereto
(hereinafter referred to collectively as the "Patents"). Each capitalized term
used and not defined in this Patent Assignment shall have the meaning assigned
to it in the Asset Purchase Agreement;

  


 

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, Buyer (or an Affiliate of
Buyer) has or will purchase certain assets related to the Business and to
which the Patents pertain; and

  


 

  

WHEREAS, in accordance therewith, Assignor desires to transfer and assign to

to accept the transfer and assignment of all of Assignor's worldwide right,
title and interest in, to and under such Patents and in and to the inventions

and/or misappropriation, including, but not limited to, the right to sue and
collect damages for any past or future infringements throughout the world, all
to be held and enjoyed by said Assignee, its successors and assigns, as fully
and entirely as the same would have been held and enjoyed by Assignor had this
Patent Assignment not been made.

  


 

  

For a period of 24 months following the Principal Closing Date, Assignor
agrees to provide reasonable assistance to Assignee in connection with the
provision of the necessary information to permit Assignee at its expense to
effect, record and perfect the transfer of the registrations of the Patents,
including executing and delivering any needed executed transfers, assignments,
conveyances, and powers of attorney to permit Assignee to record its ownership
of such Patents and Assignor agrees to reasonably cooperate with Assignee in
filing appropriate documents to cancel all "registered user" filings worldwide

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  


 

  

This Patent Assignment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed an original, and all of which shall constitute one and
the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it
being understood that parties need not sign the same counterpart. The parties
further agree that counterparts to this Patent Assignment may be delivered by

construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York without giving
effect to the principles of conflicts of laws thereof.

  


 

  

This Trademark Assignment may be executed in one or more counterparts, each of

FORM OF ASSUMPTION AGREEMENT

  


 

  

This Assumption Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of [
], 2011, between [ ], a [ ] ("Assignor"), and [ ], a [ ] ("Assignee").

  

  

WHEREAS, pursuant to, and upon the terms of, that certain Asset Purchase
Agreement dated as of [ ], 2011 (the "Asset Purchase Agreement"), by and among
[ ], a [ ] ("Buyer"), [ ], a [ ], and [ ], a [ ], Buyer agreed to purchase
certain assets related to the Business as a going concern and assume certain
liabilities related to the Business (either directly or through one or more of
its Affiliates), in each case as more fully described in the Asset Purchase
Agreement;

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in the Asset Purchase Agreement, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

  

  

SECTION 1. Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein
shall have the meanings given to such terms in the Asset Purchase Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 2. Assumption. (a) Upon the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement,
Assignor hereby assigns and transfers to Assignee, such Assignee having been
so designated by Buyer, and Assignee hereby assumes and undertakes to pay,
perform and discharge as and when due any and all of the liabilities and
obligations of Assignor pursuant to any and all of the Assumed Liabilities
relating to the Business in [ ] (other than those Assumed Liabilities
identified on Schedule A). Assignee assumes and undertakes to pay, perform and
discharge as and when due only the liabilities and obligations of Assignor
pursuant to the Assumed Liabilities relating to the Business in [ ] (other
than those Assumed Liabilities identified on Schedule A) and does not assume
or undertake to pay, perform or discharge any other liability of Assignor (or
any predecessor of Assignor or any prior owner of all or part of Assignor's
businesses, assets or properties) of whatever nature, whether presently in
existence or arising hereafter, and the parties hereto hereby agree that all
liabilities other than Assignor's liabilities and obligations pursuant to the
Assumed Liabilities relating to the Business in [ ] (other than those Assumed
Liabilities identified on Schedule A) shall remain the sole responsibility of
Assignor.

  

  

(b) Upon the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Assignor hereby agrees to
assign and transfer to Assignee, and Assignee hereby agrees to assume and
undertake to pay, perform and discharge as and when due any and all of the
liabilities and obligations of Assignor pursuant to any and all of the Assumed
Liabilities identified on Schedule A, in each case to occur on a future date
to be mutually agreed to by the parties, but in no event to occur later than
the date that is 18 months after the date hereof.

  

  

SECTION 3. No Modification of Asset Purchase Agreement. Neither the making nor
the acceptance of this conveyance, assignment, transfer and assumption shall
enlarge, restrict or otherwise modify the terms of the Asset Purchase
Agreement or constitute a waiver or release by any party to the Asset Purchase
Agreement of any liabilities imposed thereby.

  

  

SECTION 4. General. (a) This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, and all of which
shall constitute one and the same agreement and shall become effective when
one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered
to the other party, it being understood that parties need not sign the same
counterpart. The parties further agree that counterparts to this Agreement may
be delivered by facsimile or electronic transmission.

   
 

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) This Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, along with any Schedules and
Exhibits thereto, contain the entire agreement and understanding among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all
prior agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter. None of
the parties hereto shall be liable or bound to any other party hereto in any
manner by any representations, warranties or covenants relating to such
subject matter except as specifically set forth in the Asset Purchase
Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement or the other Transaction Documents.
In the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the terms of the Asset
Purchase Agreement and the terms hereof, the terms of the Asset Purchase
Agreement shall govern.

  

  

(c) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO THE PRINCIPLES OF
CONFLICTS OF LAWS THEREOF.

  

  

(d) Each party hereto hereby waives to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, any right it may have to a trial by jury in respect of any
litigation directly or indirectly arising out of, under or in connection with
this Agreement, the Asset Purchase Agreement, any other Transaction Document
or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party (i) certifies
that no representative, agent or attorney of any other party has represented,
expressly or otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of
litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii) acknowledges that it
and the other party hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement, the
Asset Purchase Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, as applicable,
by, among other things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section
4(d).

  

  

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have duly executed this Agreement on
the date first above written.
