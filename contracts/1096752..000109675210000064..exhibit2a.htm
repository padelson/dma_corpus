faith deposit in the amount of $22,500,000 (the "Good Faith Deposit"), and an
additional deposit in the amount of $7,500,000 (the "Purchase Price Deposit")
as security for the performance of the Purchaser's obligations under this

such termination, the Purchase Price Deposit shall be disbursed to the Seller
and/or returned to the Purchaser (in whole or part to either or both) only to
the extent and as directed by the Bankruptcy Court, it being agreed that the
Bankruptcy Court shall determine the amount, if any, of damage or loss to
Seller's bankruptcy estate that occurred during the interim period between the
date of this Agreement and the date of termination of this Agreement and which
damage or loss is found by the Bankruptcy Court to be directly attributable to
the pendency of the transactions contemplated hereby (but not including any
damage to the Business after such termination or the failure to close any
back-up agreement for the sale of the Business), and to the extent the
Bankruptcy Court finds such damage or loss, it shall direct such portion of
the Purchase Price Deposit to be disbursed to the Seller as the sole and
exclusive remedy of Seller to fully compensate for such damage or loss.
Promptly following such finding by the Bankruptcy Court, the Parties shall
jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the portion of the Purchase Price
Deposit which is not distributed to the Seller, together with any interest
earned thereon, to the Purchaser pursuant to the direction of the Bankruptcy
Court.

  

  

(c) If this Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 3.4(f) as a
result of a material breach by Purchaser, the Purchase Price Deposit shall be
returned to the Purchaser and the Good Faith Deposit shall be disbursed to the
Seller as liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy of Seller to
fully compensate for such damage or loss. The Parties acknowledge and agree
that the failure to obtain any necessary approvals under the HSR Act shall not
be considered a breach of this Agreement.

  

  

(d) If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 3.4(a), (c), (d), (e),
or (g), the Parties shall jointly instruct the Escrow Agent to deliver the
Purchase Price Deposit and the Good Faith Deposit, and all interest thereon,
to the Purchaser no later than one (1) Business Day after such termination, by
wire transfer to a bank account specified in writing by the Purchaser to the
Escrow Agent.

the Closing Date with employment after the Closing Date (the "Continuing
Employees"). For the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending twelve

(regardless whether such Continuing Employee continues to be employed by
Purchaser, unless he or she voluntarily refuses to accept such offer of
employment at the same location, voluntarily resigns such employment or is

items at the level specified as compared to that which was provided by the

severance payments (payable in accordance with the terms of a plan established
by the Purchaser) substantially equivalent in the aggregate to the economic
monetary value of the salary, bonus and benefits for the remainder of said
twelve (12) month period.

  

  

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate and vesting where
length of service is relevant under any employee benefit plan of Purchaser

receive service credit for service with the Seller to the same extent such

provided, however, that such service shall not be credited to the extent that
it would result in a duplication of benefits. Any medical, dental or health
plan of the Seller that is adopted or continued after the Closing to provide
group health benefits to Continuing Employees (a "Purchaser Group Health
Plan") shall not include with respect to any Continuing Employee any
restrictions or limitations with respect to pre-existing condition exclusions
or any actively-at-work requirements (except to the extent such restrictions
or limitations were applicable as of the Closing Date under the current group
health plans of the Seller in effect as of the Closing Date (an "Existing
Group Health Plan")), and any eligible expenses incurred by any Continuing
Employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year
of such Existing Group Health Plan ending on the date such Continuing
Employee's participation in such Purchaser Group Health Plan begins shall be
taken into account under the Purchaser Group Health Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, co-pay, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in
accordance with such Purchaser Group Health Plan.

accordance with their terms, all employment agreements or plans or other
written arrangements of Continuing Employees, to the extent that they are set
forth on Schedule 4.15 (including change-in-control provisions), and pay to
each Continuing Employee any amounts that become payable to such Continuing
Employee following the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of the
applicable employment agreement, plan or other written arrangement. No
provision of this Section 7.15 shall create any third party beneficiary or
other rights in any Continuing Employee or former employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) in respect of continued employment (or
resumed employment) with Purchaser, and no provision of this Section 7.15
shall create any such rights in any such Persons in respect of any benefits
that may be provided, directly or indirectly, under any employee benefit plans
(within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) or any similar plan or
arrangement, whether or not subject to ERISA) which may be maintained by the
Purchaser for Continuing Employees. Nothing contained in this Section 7.15
shall constitute or be deemed to be an amendment to any such employee benefit
plan or any other compensation or benefit plan, program or arrangement of the
Seller.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Closing Date, the Parties will negotiate in good faith to
provide new incentive plans or arrangements acceptable to the Parties
consistent with past practices of the Purchaser.

otherwise supplement the Defined Benefit Pension Plans in accordance with the
terms of the Defined Benefit Pension Plans, ERISA and the Internal Revenue
Code.

  

  

7.16 Transition Services Agreement

  

  

. The Parties hereto agree that, if at any time within the six months
following the Closing the Seller shall so request, the Purchaser and the
Seller agree to negotiate in good faith and enter into a transition services
agreement (the "Transition Services Agreement") on customary and mutually
agreeable terms, pursuant to which the Purchaser shall, for a term extending
no longer than six months after the Closing, provide certain transitional
services to the Seller in return for customary and mutually agreeable
compensation.

reorganization or liquidation, unless this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Section 3.4.

Closing Date.

  

  

(b) Seller shall not amend any Tax Return related to the Business or the
Purchased Assets that relate to any Tax period without the prior written
consent of the Purchaser. Purchaser shall have the right to amend any Tax
Return related to the Business or the Purchased Assets that relate to any Tax
period without the prior written consent of the Seller, provided that such
amendment will not increase the amount of Taxes of RSA Holdings Corp. of
Delaware or the Seller for which the Purchaser is not liable hereunder.

. The Seller acknowledges and agrees that the Purchaser may, after the entry

Change. The Seller's consent to a Structural Change shall not be unreasonably

the Sale Order, the Seller, and inure to the benefit of the Parties and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, including any trustee or estate

unenforceability shall not affect any other provision or portion of any
provision in such jurisdiction and in lieu of such invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision or portion of any provision, there will be added
automatically as a part of this Agreement a valid legal and enforceable
provision as similar in terms to such invalid, illegal or unenforceable
provision as may be possible.

  

  

12.10 Injunctive Relief

  

  

. The Parties agree that damages at Law may be an inadequate remedy for the
breach of any of the covenants, promises and agreements contained in this
Agreement by the Parties, and, accordingly, the Parties shall be entitled to
injunctive relief with respect to any such breach, including specific
performance of such covenants, promises or agreements or an order enjoining
the other Parties from any threatened, or from the continuation of any actual,
breach of the covenants, promises or agreements contained in this Agreement by
the other Parties. The rights set forth in this Section 12.10 shall be in
addition to any other rights which any Party may have at Law or in equity
pursuant to this Agreement.

contemplated hereby and thereby.

Safety Razor Company, LLC ("ASR") and its affiliated debtors and debtors-in-

Purchased Assets2 free and clear of all Claims and Encumbrances (other than
Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities), (ii) authorizing the

substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (as may be amended, the
"Purchase Agreement") between ASR (the "Seller") and Acquisition Company LLC
(the "Purchaser") is the Successful Bid and the Purchaser is the Successful
Bidder; and it appearing that the relief requested in the Motion is in the

interest; and it appearing that this Court has jurisdiction over this matter
pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยงยง 157 and 1334; and it appearing that the Motion is a
core proceeding pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ยง 157(b)(2); and adequate notice of the
Motion and opportunity for objection having been given; and adequate notice
with respect to the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts having
been given pursuant to the Debtors' Motion Pursuant to Sections 105(a) and 365
of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules 2002 and 6006 for Entry of an
Order Establishing Certain Notice Procedures Related to the Assumption and
Assignment of Executory Contracts and Leases [Docket No. 27] (the "Assumption
Notice Motion"); and this Court having reviewed and considered the Motion and
the objections thereto; and this Court having heard statements of counsel and
the evidence presented at a hearing before this Court on September 28, 29 and

hereinafter, the "Revised Bidding Procedures"); and upon consideration of all
the pleadings filed with this Court; and upon the record made by the Debtors
and other parties, and the evidence, testimony, exhibits, and arguments of
counsel presented at the Sale Hearing; and it appearing that no other notice
need be given; and upon the full record of these cases; and after due
deliberation and sufficient cause therefor:

E. The Debtors published notice of (i) the Sale, (ii) the deadlines by which
potential bidders must submit bid materials, (iii) that the Auction would be
held if Qualified Bids were received, and (iv) where parties could obtain
further information about the sale process in the national editions of USA
Today and The Wall Street Journal on September 8, 2010.

  

F. Pursuant to the Assumption Notice Motion, the Debtors have served notice
upon the Contract Counterparties: (i) that the Seller seeks to assume and
assign certain executory contracts and unexpired leases as provided for in the
Purchase Agreement as of the Closing Date; and (ii) of the relevant proposed
Cure Costs for each of the Assigned Contracts. The service of such notice was
good, sufficient and appropriate under the circumstances and no further notice
need be given in respect of establishing a Cure Cost for the Assigned
Contracts. Each of the Contract Counterparties has had an opportunity to
object to the Cure Costs set forth in the notice.

  

G. The Debtors have articulated good and sufficient reasons for this Court to
grant the relief requested in the Motion regarding the sales process,
including, without limitation: (i) determination of final Cure Costs; and (ii)
approval and authorization to serve notice of the Auction and Sale Hearing.

  

H. The notice of the Revised Bidding Procedures, the Auction and the Sale
Hearing provided all interested parties with timely and proper notice of the
Sale, the Revised Bidding Procedures, the Sale Hearing and the Auction.

  

I. As evidenced by the affidavits of service previously filed with this Court,
proper, timely, adequate, and sufficient notice of the Motion, the Auction,
the Revised Bidding Procedures, the Sale Hearing, and the Sale has been
provided in accordance with sections 102(1), 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy
Code and Bankruptcy Rules 2002, 6004, 6006 and 9014. The notices described
above were good, sufficient and appropriate under the circumstances, and no
other or further notice of the Motion, the Revised Bidding Procedures, the
Auction, the Sale, the Sale Hearing, or the assumption and assignment of the
Assigned Contracts is required. No other or further notice of the Sale Motion,
the Revised Bidding Procedures, the Sale Hearing, or of the entry of this
Order is necessary or shall be required.

  

J. The disclosures made by the Debtors concerning the Purchase Agreement, the
Revised Bidding Procedures, the Sale, the Sale Hearing, and the assumption and
assignment of the Assigned Contracts were good, complete and adequate.

  

Good Faith of the Purchaser

  

  

K. The Purchaser is not an "insider" of any of the Debtors, as that term is
defined in section 101(31) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  

L. The Purchaser is purchasing the Purchased Assets in good faith and is a
good faith buyer within the meaning of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code,
and is therefore entitled to the full protection of that provision, and
otherwise has proceeded in good faith in all respects in connection with this
proceeding in that, inter alia: (i) the Purchaser recognized that the Seller
was free to deal with any other party interested in acquiring the Purchased
Assets; (ii) the Purchaser agreed to subject its bid to competitive bidding at
the Auction; (iv) all payments to be made by the Purchaser and other
agreements or arrangements entered into by the Purchaser in connection with
the Sale have been disclosed; (v) the Purchaser has not violated section
363(n) of the Bankruptcy Code by any action or inaction; (vi) no common
identity of directors or controlling stockholders exists between the Purchaser
and the Seller or any of the other Debtors; and (vii) the negotiation and
execution of the Purchase Agreement was at arms' length and in good faith.

  

Highest and Best Offer

  

  

M. The Debtors conducted a marketing process in accordance with, and have
otherwise complied in all material respects with, the Revised Bidding
Procedures. The process set forth in the Revised Bidding Procedures, including
the Auction, was conducted in a noncollusive, fair and good faith manner and a
reasonable opportunity has been given to any interested party to make a higher
or otherwise better offer for the Purchased Assets. The Debtors and their
professionals (i) provided potential purchasers, upon request, sufficient
information to enable them to make an informed judgment on whether to bid on
the Purchased Assets, (ii) afforded interested parties a full, fair and
reasonable opportunity to conduct due diligence and submit offers prior to the
Bid Deadline.

  

N. The Purchase Agreement constitutes the highest and best offer for the
Purchased Assets.

  

O. The Purchase Agreement represents a fair and reasonable offer to purchase
the Purchased Assets under the circumstances of the Bankruptcy Cases.

  

P. Approval of the Motion and the Purchase Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated thereby are in the best interests of the
Debtors, their creditors, their estates and other parties in interest.

  

Q. The Debtors have demonstrated compelling circumstances and a good,
sufficient, and sound business purpose and justification for the Sale prior
to, and outside of, a plan of reorganization.

  

No Fraudulent Transfer

  

  

R. The consideration provided by the Purchaser pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement is fair and adequate and constitutes reasonably equivalent value and
fair consideration under the Bankruptcy Code and under the laws of the United
States, any state, territory, possession, or the District of Columbia.

  

S. The Purchaser is not a mere continuation of the Seller, the other Debtors
or their respective estates and there is no continuity between the Purchaser
and the Seller, the other Debtors or their respective estates. The Purchaser
is not holding itself out to the public as a continuation of the Seller or the
other Debtors. The Purchaser is not a successor to the Seller or the other
Debtors or their respective estates and the Sale does not amount to a
consolidation, merger or de facto merger of the Purchaser and the Seller or
the other Debtors.

  

Validity of Transfer

  

  

T. Upon entry of this Sale Order, the Seller has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver the Purchase Agreement and all other
documents contemplated thereby, and no further consents or approvals are
required for the Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement, except as otherwise set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

  

U. The transfer of each of the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser will be as of
the Closing Date a legal, valid, and effective transfer of such Purchased
Assets, and vests or will vest the Purchaser with all right, title, and
interest of the Seller to the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Claims
and Encumbrances accruing, arising or relating thereto any time prior to the
Closing Date, except for any Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities.

  

  

Section 363(f) Is Satisfied

  

  

V. The Purchaser would not have entered into the Purchase Agreement and would
not consummate the transactions contemplated thereby if the sale of the
Purchased Assets to the Purchaser, and the assumption and assignment and sale
of the Assigned Contracts to the Purchaser, were not free and clear of all
Encumbrances of any kind or nature whatsoever (except the Permitted
Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities), or if the Purchaser would, or in the
future could, be liable for any of such Encumbrances.

  

W. The Seller may sell the Purchased Assets free and clear of all Encumbrances
against the Seller and the other Debtors, their respective estates or any of
the Purchased Assets (except for the Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed
Liabilities) because, in each case, one or more of the standards set forth in
section 363(f)(1)-(5) of the Bankruptcy Code has been satisfied. Those holders
of Encumbrances against the Seller, the other Debtors, their respective
estates or any of the Purchased Assets who did not object, or who withdrew
their objections, to the Sale or the Motion are deemed to have consented
thereto pursuant to section 363(f)(2) of the Bankruptcy Code. Those holders of
such Encumbrances who did object fall within one or more of the other
subsections of section 363(f) and are adequately protected by having their
Encumbrances, if any, in each instance against the Seller, the other Debtors,
their respective estates or any of the Purchased Assets (other than the Wind
Down Amount), attach to the proceeds of the Sale ultimately attributable to
the Purchased Assets in which such creditor alleges an interest, in the same
order of priority, with the same validity, force and effect that such creditor
had prior to the Sale, subject to any claims and defenses the Seller or the
other Debtors and their estates may possess with respect thereto.

  

  

Assumption and Assignment of the Assigned Contracts

  

  

X. The assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts pursuant to the
terms of this Sale Order is integral to the Purchase Agreement and is in the
best interests of the Debtors and their estates, creditors and other parties
in interest, and represents the reasonable exercise of sound and prudent
business judgment by the Debtors.

  

Y. The respective Cure Costs amounts, as set forth on Schedule 1 annexed
hereto, are the sole amounts necessary under sections 365(b)(1)(A) and (B) and
365(f)(2)(A) of the Bankruptcy Code to cure all monetary defaults and pay all
actual pecuniary losses under the Assigned Contracts.

  

Z. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement and in accordance with
section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, upon payment of the Cure Costs, the
Purchaser shall have: (i) cured and/or provided adequate assurance of cure of
any monetary default existing prior to the Closing Date under any of the
Assigned Contracts, within the meaning of section 365(b)(1)(A) of the
Bankruptcy Code; (ii) provided compensation or adequate assurance of
compensation to any party for actual pecuniary loss to such party resulting
from a default prior to the Closing Date under any of the Assigned Contracts,
within the meaning of section 365(b)(1)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code; and (iii)
provided adequate assurance of its future performance under the relevant
Assigned Contracts within the meaning of sections 365(b)(1)(C) and
365(f)(2)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  

  

Compelling Circumstances for an Immediate Sale

  

  

AA. To maximize the value of the Purchased Assets and preserve the viability
of the business to which the Purchased Assets relate, and to reduce the amount
of postpetition debtor-in- possession financing borne by the Debtors, it is
essential that the Sale of the Purchased Assets occur within the time
constraints set forth in the Purchase Agreement. Time is of the essence in
consummating the Sale.

  

BB. The consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase
Agreement is legal, valid and properly authorized under all applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including, without limitation, sections
105(a), 363(b), 363(f), 363(m) 365(b), and 365(f), and all of the applicable
requirements of such sections have been complied with in respect of the
transaction.

  

CC. The Sale does not constitute a de facto plan of reorganization or
liquidation or an element of such a plan for any of the Debtors, as it does
not and does not propose to: (i) impair or restructure existing debt of, or
equity interests in, the Debtors; (ii) impair or circumvent voting rights with
respect to any future plan proposed by the Debtors; (iii) circumvent chapter
11 plan safeguards, such as those set forth in sections 1125 and 1129 of the
Bankruptcy Code; or (iv) classify Claims or Equity Encumbrances, compromise
controversies or extend debt maturities.

  

NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED, ADJUDGED AND DECREED THAT:

1. Relief Granted. The relief requested in the Motion as modified by the Court is granted and approved, and the Sale to Purchaser under the Purchase Agreement is approved as set forth in this Sale Order.

This Sale Order and the Purchase Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the Debtors, their estates and creditors, the Purchaser and their respective successors and assigns.

  

  

Transfer of the Purchased Assets

  

  

6. Transfer of Purchased Assets Authorized. Pursuant to Bankruptcy Code sections 105(a), 363(b), and 363(f) the Debtors are authorized to transfer the Purchased Assets on the Closing Date, and the Purchaser is directed to pay the Purchase Price to the Debtors as provided in the Purchase Agreement.

  

7. Transfer "As Is", Etc. Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement, the Purchased Assets shall be transferred to the Purchaser "as is, where is" with all faults in accordance with the Purchase Agreement upon and as of the Closing Date and such transfer shall constitute a legal, valid, binding, and effective transfer of such Purchased Assets and, upon the Seller's receipt of the Purchase Price, shall be free and clear of all Encumbrances, except any Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities. Upon the closing of the Sale contemplated within the Purchase Agreement (the "Transactions"), the Purchaser shall take title to and possession of the Purchased Assets, subject to Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities.

  

8. Surrender of Purchased Assets by Third Parties. All entities that are in possession of some or all of the Purchased Assets on the Closing Date are directed to surrender possession of such Purchased Assets to the Purchaser at the closing of the Sale. All entities are hereby forever prohibited and enjoined from taking any action that would adversely affect or interfere with the ability of the Sellers to sell and transfer the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms of the Purchase Agreement and this Sale Order.

  

9. Transfer Free and Clear of Encumbrances. Pursuant to section 363(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the transfer of title to the Purchased Assets shall be free and clear of any and all Encumbrances, except for any Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities. The Purchaser is not and shall not be liable as a successor under any theory of successor liability for Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities) that encumber or relate to the Purchased Assets.

  

10. Creditors Directed to Release Encumbrances. On the Closing Date, each creditor shall be authorized and directed to execute such documents and take all other actions as may be necessary to release Encumbrances (except for Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities) on the Purchased Assets, if any, as provided for herein, as such Encumbrances may have been recorded or may otherwise exist.

  

11. Debtors' and Purchaser's Authorization to Record Releases. If any Person or entity which has filed statements or other documents or agreements evidencing Encumbrances (other than the Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities) on or in all or any portion of the Purchased Assets shall not have delivered to the Seller prior to the Closing, in proper form for filing and executed by the appropriate parties, termination statements, instruments of satisfaction, releases of liens and easements, and any other documents necessary or desirable to the Purchaser for the purpose of documenting the release of all Encumbrances, which the Person or entity has or may assert with respect to all or any portion of the Purchased Assets, the Seller is hereby authorized and directed, and the Purchaser is hereby authorized, to execute and file such statements, instruments, releases and other documents on behalf of such Person or entity with respect to the Purchased Assets. The Transactions authorized herein shall be of full force and effect, regardless of any Seller's lack of good standing in any jurisdiction in which it is formed or authorized to transact business. A certified copy of this Sale Order may be filed with the appropriate clerk(s) and/or recorded with the recorder(s) which, once filed, registered, or otherwise recorded, shall constitute conclusive evidence of the release of all Encumbrances in the Purchased Assets as of the Closing Date of any kind or nature whatsoever, other than the Permitted Encumbrances or Assumed Liabilities.

  

12. Permanent Injunction. Except as expressly permitted or otherwise specifically provided by the Purchase Agreement or this Sale Order, all Persons and entities holding Encumbrances in or against all or any portion of the Purchased Assets (other than Permitted Encumbrances and the Assumed Liabilities) arising under or out of, in connection with, or in any way relating to the Seller or any of the other Debtors, the Purchased Assets, the operation of the Debtors' business prior to the Closing Date or the transfer of the Purchased Assets to the Purchaser, hereby are forever barred, estopped and permanently enjoined from asserting against the Purchaser or its successors or assigns, their property or the Purchased Assets, such Persons' or entities' Encumbrances in and to the Purchased Assets.

  

13. Recording Offices. This Sale Order is and shall be binding upon and govern the acts of all Persons and entities, including, without limitation, all filing agents, filing officers, title agents, title companies, recorders of mortgages, recorders of deeds, registrars of deeds, administrative agencies, governmental departments, secretaries of state, federal and local officials, and all other Persons and entities who may be required by operation of law, the duties of their office, or contract, to accept, file, register or otherwise record or release any documents or instruments, or who may be required to report or insure any title or state of title in or to any lease; and each of the foregoing Persons and entities is hereby directed to accept for filing any and all of the documents and instruments necessary and appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement.

  

  

Assigned Contracts

  

  

14. Authorization to Assume and Assign. Upon the Closing of the Sale, the Seller is authorized and empowered to assume and assign each of the Assigned Contracts to the Purchaser free and clear of all Encumbrances (other than Cure Costs, the Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities) as of the Closing Date. The payment of the applicable Cure Costs (if any) by the Purchaser shall (a) effect a cure or adequate assurance of cure of all defaults existing thereunder as of the Petition Date and (b) compensate for any actual pecuniary loss to such Contract Counterparty resulting from such default. The Purchaser shall then have assumed the Assigned Contracts and, pursuant to section 365(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the assignment by the Seller of such Assigned Contracts shall not be a default thereunder. After the payment of the relevant Cure Costs, none of the Seller, the other Debtors, or the Purchaser shall have any further liabilities to the Contract Counterparties other than the Purchaser's obligations under the Assigned Contracts under the Purchase Agreement or that accrue and become due and payable on or after the Closing Date.

  

15. Assignment Requirements Satisfied. Any provisions in any Assigned Contracts that restrict, prohibit or condition the assignment of such Assigned Contracts or allow the party to such Assigned Contracts to terminate, recapture, impose any penalty, condition on renewal or extension or modify any term or condition upon the assignment of such Assigned Contract, constitute unenforceable anti-assignment provisions that are void and of no force and effect. All other requirements and conditions under sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code for the assumption by the Seller and assignment to the Purchaser of the Assigned Contracts have been satisfied. Upon the Closing, in accordance with sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, the Purchaser shall be fully and irrevocably vested with all right, title and interest of the Debtors under the Assigned Contracts.

  

16. Section 365(k). Upon the Closing, the Purchaser shall be deemed to be substituted for the Seller as a party to the applicable Assigned Contracts and the Seller and the other Debtors shall be relieved, pursuant to section 365(k) of the Bankruptcy Code, from any further liability under the Assigned Contracts.

  

17. No Default. Upon the payment of the applicable Cure Costs, if any, the Assigned Contracts will remain in full force and effect, and no default shall exist under the Assigned Contracts nor shall there exist any event or condition which, with the passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would constitute such a default.

  

18. Adequate Assurance Provided. The Purchaser has provided adequate assurance of future performance under the relevant Assigned Contracts within the meaning of Bankruptcy Code sections 365(b)(1)(C) and 365(f)(2)(B).

  

19. No Fees. There shall be no rent accelerations, assignment fees, increases or any other fees charged to the Purchaser or the Seller as a result of the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts. The failure of the Seller or the Purchaser to enforce at any time one or more terms or conditions of any Assigned Contract shall not be a waiver of such terms or conditions, or of the Debtors' and Purchaser's rights to enforce every term and condition of the Assigned Contracts.

  

20. Injunction. Pursuant to sections 105(a), 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code, other than the right to payment of the Cure Costs, if any, all Contract Counterparties are forever barred and permanently enjoined from raising or asserting against the Seller or the Purchaser any assignment fee, default, breach or claim or pecuniary loss arising under or related to the Assigned Contracts existing as of the Petition Date or any assignment fee or condition to assignment arising by reason of the Closing.

  

  

Other Provisions

  

  

21. DIP Payoff. After depositing the Wind Down Amount, as provided in the Purchase Agreement, in connection with the Closing: (i) the Seller shall pay in cash in full all Obligations (as defined in the DIP Credit Agreement) to the administrative agent under the DIP Credit Agreement (the "DIP Agent"), for the benefit of itself and the lenders party to the DIP Credit Agreement (the "DIP Lenders"), in accordance with the DIP Credit Agreement; and (ii) other than obligations that specifically survive termination as provided in the DIP Credit Agreement, such as any indemnification obligations, the DIP Credit Agreement, the DIP Lenders' commitments thereunder, and any of the DIP Agent's or DIP Lenders' obligations or liabilities under the DIP Order shall be deemed terminated after such DIP payoff.

  

22. First Lien Payoff. On the Closing Date and immediately following the Closing, unless the Court orders otherwise, the Seller shall pay in cash the amount necessary to repay the First Lien Indebtedness in full to the First Lien Agent, for the benefit of itself and the First Lien Lenders, in accordance with the First Lien Credit Agreement.

  

23. Second Lien Payoff. On the Closing Date and immediately following the Closing, unless the Court orders otherwise, any amount of the Cash Consideration (which, for the sake of clarity, does not include the Wind Down Amount) in excess of the amount required to repay the First Lien Indebtedness in cash in full, shall be paid to the Second Lien Agent on account of the Second Lien Indebtedness.

  

24. Segregation of Wind Down Amount. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the DIP Credit Agreement, on the Closing Date, but prior to the DIP Payoff described in paragraph 21 herein, the Debtors shall be authorized to use cash collateral or borrowings under the DIP Credit Agreement to fund the amounts specified in the last sentence of Section 3.12 of the DIP Credit Agreement, including the Wind Down Amount, and the Debtors are authorized and directed to deposit such funds in the account specified in Section 7.18 of the Purchase Agreement. Upon payment of all Wind Down Expenses, the Debtors shall remit the remaining outstanding balance of the Wind Down Amount, if any (the "Wind Down Surplus"), to the Purchaser; provided, however, that the Wind Down Expenses shall be paid, and the Wind Down Surplus shall be remitted to the Purchaser, not later than ninety (90) days after the consummation of a plan of reorganization. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Final DIP Order or in the DIP Facility Documents (as defined in the Final DIP Order), no DIP Facility Lien, Prepetition Lien, Replacement Lien, Permitted Senior Lien, DIP Facility Superpriority Claim, First Lien Administrative Claim or Adequate Protection Payment (each as defined in the Final DIP Order) shall attach to or have any right to payment from the Wind Down Amount.

  

25. Injunction. Effective upon the Closing Date and except as otherwise provided by stipulations filed with or announced to this Court with respect to a specific matter, except as explicitly provided in the Purchase Agreement, all Persons and entities are forever prohibited and permanently enjoined from commencing or continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding, whether in law or equity, in any judicial, administrative, arbitral or other proceeding against the Purchaser, its successors and assigns, or the Purchased Assets, with respect to any (a) Encumbrance (other than an Assumed Liability or a Permitted Encumbrance) arising under, out of, in connection with or in any way relating to the Debtors, the Purchaser, the Purchased Assets, or the operation of the Purchased Assets prior to the Closing of the Sale, or (b) successor liability, including, without limitation, the following actions: (i) commencing or continuing in any manner any action or other proceeding against the Purchaser, its successors or assigns, Purchased Assets or properties; (ii) enforcing, attaching, collecting or recovering in any manner any judgment, award, decree or order against the Purchaser, its successors, Purchased Assets or properties; (iii) creating, perfecting or enforcing any Encumbrance against the Purchaser, its successors or assigns, Purchased Assets or properties; (iv) asserting any setoff, right of subrogation or recoupment of any kind against any obligation due the Purchaser or its successors or assigns; (v) commencing or continuing any action, in any manner or place, that does not comply or is inconsistent with the provisions of this Sale Order or other orders of this Court, or the agreements or actions contemplated or taken in respect thereof; or (vi) revoking, terminating or failing or refusing to issue or renew any license, permit or authorization to operate any of the Purchased Assets or conduct any of the businesses operated with the Purchased Assets.

  

26. No Liability for Claims Against Seller or Other Debtors. Except for the Permitted Encumbrances and Assumed Liabilities or as otherwise expressly set forth in this Sale Order or the Purchase Agreement, the Purchaser and its employees, officers, directors, advisors, lenders, affiliates, owners, successors and assigns shall not have any liability (successor, vicarious or otherwise), or any other obligation of the Seller or any of the other Debtors. The Purchaser has given substantial consideration under the Purchase Agreement for the benefit of the holders of any Encumbrance. The consideration given by the Purchaser shall constitute valid and valuable consideration for the releases of any potential claims of successor liability of the Purchaser, which releases shall be deemed to have been given in favor of the Purchaser by all holders of Encumbrances against or interests in the Seller or any of the other Debtors or any of the Purchased Assets.

  

27. Good Faith. The transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement are undertaken by the Purchaser without collusion and in good faith, as that term is defined in section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code, and accordingly, the reversal or modification on appeal of the authorization provided herein to consummate the Sale shall not affect the validity of the Sale (including the assumption and assignment of the Assigned Contracts), unless such authorization and consummation of such Sale are duly stayed pending such appeal. The Purchaser is a good faith buyer within the meaning of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code and, as such, is entitled to, and granted, the full protections of section 363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code.

  

28. Allocation of Purchased Assets. Purchaser is hereby authorized in connection with consummation of the Purchase Agreement to allocate the Purchased Assets and Assigned Contracts (subject to the terms thereof) among its affiliates, designees, assignees, and/or successors in a manner as it in its discretion deems appropriate and to assign, sublease, sublicense, transfer or otherwise dispose of any of the Purchased Assets or the rights under any Assigned Contract (subject to the terms thereof) to its affiliates, designees, assignees, and/or successors with all of the rights and protections accorded under this Order and the Purchase Agreement, and the Seller shall cooperate with and take all actions reasonably requested by Purchaser to effectuate any of the foregoing.

  

29. Plan Not to Conflict. Nothing contained in any plan of reorganization or liquidation, or order of any type or kind entered in (a) these Bankruptcy Cases, (b) any subsequent chapter 7 case into which any such chapter 11 case may be converted, or (c) any related proceeding subsequent to entry of this Sale Order, shall conflict with or derogate from the provisions of the Purchase Agreement or the terms of this Sale Order.

  

30. Effective Immediately. Pursuant to Bankruptcy Rules 7062, 9014, 6004(h) and 6006(d), this Sale Order shall be effective immediately upon entry and the Seller and the Purchaser are authorized to close the Sale immediately upon entry of this Sale Order.

  

31. Bulk Sales Law. No bulk sales law or any similar law of any state or other jurisdiction applies in any way to the Sale.

  

32. Brokers. Except for the fees and expenses of brokers, finders, or financial advisors for the Seller set forth on Schedule 4.10 of the Purchase Agreement (for which the Seller is solely responsible), the Seller does not have any obligation to pay any fees, commissions or other similar compensation to any broker, finder, or financial advisor in connection with the Transactions.

  

33. Purchase Agreement Approved in Entirety. The failure specifically to include any particular provision of the Purchase Agreement in this Sale Order shall not diminish or impair the effectiveness of such provision, it being the intent of this Court that the Purchase Agreement be authorized and approved in its entirety.

  

34. Standing. The transactions authorized herein shall be of full force and effect, regardless of any Seller's lack of good standing in any jurisdiction in which such Seller is formed or authorized to transact business.

  

35. Timing. All time periods set forth in this Sale Order shall be calculated in accordance with Bankruptcy Rule 9006(a).

  

36. Authorization to Effect Order. The Seller is authorized to take all actions necessary to effect the relief granted pursuant to this Order in accordance with the Motion.

  

37. Automatic Stay. The automatic stay pursuant to Section 362 is hereby lifted with respect to the Seller to the extent necessary, without further order of this Court, to (i) allow the Purchaser to deliver any notice provided for in the Purchase Agreement, and (ii) allow the Purchaser to take any and all actions permitted under the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions thereof.

  

38. Escrow Agent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Purchase Agreement, the Court shall serve as the Escrow Agent (as such term is defined in the Purchase Agreement).

  

39. The Backup Bid. The Court approves the asset purchase agreement (the "Back- Up Bid") between Seller and RZR Acquisition Company LLC, along with its parent entity, RZR Holding Corporation, and UBS AG, Stamford Branch, in its capacity as First Lien Agent on behalf of First Lien Lenders, for certain limited provisions thereof, dated October __, 2010 (collectively, the "Back-Up Bidder") and all related ancillary documents as the Back-Up Bid (as defined in the Revised Bidding Procedures). If the Seller or the Purchaser terminates the Purchase Agreement in accordance with the terms thereof, which each of the Seller and the Purchaser is hereby authorized to do:

(a)

  |  

all findings of fact, conclusions of law and all decretal paragraphs of this
Sale Order pertaining to the Purchaser and the Purchase Agreement shall apply

under, and implement the Back-Up Bid, together with all additional instruments
and documents that may be reasonably necessary or desirable to implement the
Back-Up Bid and the Sale, including any other ancillary documents, or as may
be reasonably necessary or appropriate to the performance of the obligations
as contemplated by the Back-Up Bid and such other ancillary documents;

   
---|---|---

in interest (except the Committee but including, without limitation, a

or any successor case or in any jurisdiction) without further action by any
party or this Court, and all parties in interest (except the Committee but
including, without limitation, a receiver, administrator, or trustee appointed
in any of the Bankruptcy Cases or any successor case or in any jurisdiction)
shall thereafter be forever barred from bringing any Challenge (as defined in
