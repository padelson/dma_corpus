ARTICLE II    

PURCHASE AND SALE    

SECTION 2.01. _Purchase and Sale of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased
Business Assets_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Sellers agree to and shall sell to Purchaser or
its designated subsidiaries the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Business
Assets. The Purchased Shares will be transferred by Sellers to Purchaser or
its designated subsidiaries free and clear of all Encumbrances other than
Encumbrances created by Purchaser. The Purchased Business Assets will be
transferred by Sellers to Purchaser or its designated subsidiaries free and
clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances. At the Closing,
Sellers waive (for themselves and their Affiliates) all applicable rights
of preemption, purchase rights and other restrictions relating to any
transfer of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Business Assets. Sellers
are not selling, and Purchaser is not purchasing, any of the Excluded Assets,
including assets listed on _Schedule 2.01_.   

SECTION 2.02. _Purchase Price; Adjustments to Purchase Price_. (a) The
purchase price to be paid at the Closing by Purchaser or its designated
subsidiaries for the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Business Assets shall
be an aggregate of Two Hundred Twenty-Three Million Eight Hundred Thousand
Dollars ($223,800,000), plus the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment (the "
_Base Purchase Price_ ") subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections 2.03 and
2.04 below and subject to further adjustment pursuant to Sections 5.21 and
5.23 hereof. The Base Purchase Price will be paid at the Closing by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the applicable SellersÂ’ Bank
Account designated by Sellers.   

(b) No later than three (3) Business Days prior to Closing, the parties shall
calculate the Estimated Working Capital Payment (as defined below), calculate
the Estimated Customer Advances Amount, calculate the Estimated Capital Lease
Amount and calculate the total projected purchase price adjustments that
would be payable pursuant to Section 2.03 but for the operation of
this Section 2.02(b) (the " _Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment_ "), with an
Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment payable to Sellers at Closing being
expressed as a positive number, or an Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment
payable to Purchaser at Closing being expressed as a negative number. The
"Estimated Working Capital" shall be equal to the Working Capital of the
Business as of 12:01 a.m. (local time in each applicable jurisdiction) on the
most recent month end prior to (but not including) the Closing Date. For
purposes of calculating the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment, the
difference (positive or negative) between the Estimated Working Capital and
the Working Capital Threshold shall be multiplied by 75% (the " _Estimated
Working Capital Payment_ ").   

SECTION 2.03. _Purchase Price Adjustment_.   

(a) For purposes of establishing the Purchase Price, Purchaser and Sellers
have assumed that the sum of the Working Capital of the Business at Closing
would be $124,000,000 (" _Working Capital Threshold_ ").   

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any
event within 120 days thereafter, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to
Sellers a calculation of (i) the actual Working Capital of the Business,
prepared in accordance with the accounting principles and procedures and in
the format set forth on _Schedule 2.03(b)_ as of 12:01 a.m. (local time
in each applicable jurisdiction) on the Closing Date (the " _Final Working
Capital_ "), (ii) the Final Customer Advances Amount, and (iii) the Final
Capital Lease Amount, together with reasonably detailed supporting
information, (collectively set forth on the " _Final Closing Statement_ ").
The difference (positive or negative) between the Final Working Capital and
the Working Capital Threshold shall be referred to as the "Final Working
Capital Payment."    

(i) From and after the delivery of the Final Closing Statement, Purchaser
shall provide Sellers and their representatives reasonable access to the
books and records of the Business relating to the calculation of the Final
Working Capital, the Final Customer Advances Amount and the Final Capital
Lease Amount as Sellers shall reasonably request and that are available to
Purchaser.    

(ii) Within 45 days after SellersÂ’ receipt of the Final Closing Statement,
Sellers shall notify Purchaser as to whether Sellers agree or disagree with
the calculation of the Final Working Capital or the Final Customer Advances
Amount as reflected on the Final Closing Statement and, if Sellers disagree,
such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the particulars of such
disagreement. If Sellers provide a notice of agreement or do not provide a
notice of disagreement within such 45 day period, then Sellers shall be deemed
to have accepted the calculations and the amounts set forth in the Final
Closing Statement delivered by Purchaser, which shall then be final, binding
and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If any such notice of disagreement
is timely provided, then Purchaser and Sellers shall each use reasonable
efforts for a period of 25 days thereafter to resolve any disagreements with
respect to the calculations in the Final Closing Statement.    

(iii) If, at the end of the 25-day resolution period referred to in (ii)
above, the parties are unable to resolve any disagreements as to items in the
Final Closing Statement, then Grant Thornton LLP will be asked to resolve
such dispute (the " _Purchase Price Arbiter_ "). If Grant Thornton LLP is
unable or unwilling to serve as the Purchase Price Arbiter and Purchaser and
Sellers are unable to agree upon a mutually acceptable Person to serve as the
Purchase Price Arbiter, then Grant Thornton LLP shall select a Person who
(A) is a retired partner of a national accounting firm which partner has not
performed any audit, tax or other accounting services for either Sellers or
Purchaser in the previous three years, and does not have a conflict of
interest with either party, (B) has experience in arbitration and (C) holds a
certified public accountant certificate, to serve as the Purchase Price
Arbiter. Sellers and Purchaser shall submit, in writing, detailed briefs
to the Purchase Price Arbiter setting forth their views as to the correct
nature and amount of each item remaining in dispute and the amount of the
Final Working Capital or Final Customer Advances Amount, as the case may be,
and the Purchase Price Arbiter shall make a written determination as promptly
as practicable, but in any event within 30 days after the date on which such
dispute is referred to the Purchase Price Arbiter, as to the Final
Working Capital or Final Customer Advances Amount, which determination shall
be final and binding on the parties for all purposes hereunder. The Purchase
Price Arbiter shall be authorized to select only the amount of the Final
Working Capital or Final Customer Advances Amount as presented by either
Sellers or Purchaser and shall not select any other figure or amount as the
Final Working Capital or Final Customer Advances Amount. The costs and
expenses of the Purchase Price Arbiter shall be borne 50% by Sellers and 50%
by Purchaser. The determination of the Purchase Price Arbiter shall be final,
binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder.   

Within five Business Days of the date on which the last disputed item required
to determine the Final Working Capital, Final Customer Advances Amount and
the Final Capital Lease Amount is resolved pursuant to this Section 2.03, the
Purchase Price shall be increased by the excess, if any, of the Final Working
Capital Payment over the Estimated Working Capital Payment, or decreased by
the excess, if any, of the Estimated Working Capital Payment over the Final
Working Capital Payment. The Purchase Price shall be further adjusted as
follows: (i) increased by the excess, if any, of the Estimated Customer
Advances Amount over the Final Customer Advances Amount, or decreased by the
excess, if any, of the Final Customer Advances Amount over the Estimated
Customer Advances Amount, and (ii) increased by the excess, if any, of the
Estimated Capital Lease Amount over the Final Capital Lease Amount, or
decreased by the excess, if any, of the Final Capital Lease Amount over the
Estimated Capital Lease Amount. The Sellers shall pay to Purchaser any
net decrease in the Purchase Price, as determined under this Section 2.03,
from the Base Purchase Price. The Purchaser shall pay to Sellers any net
increase in the Purchase Price, as determined under this Section 2.03, over
the Base Purchase Price. Any payments made pursuant to this Section 2.03
shall include interest on the amount of such payment at the Libor Rate on an
annualized basis for the period between the Closing Date and the date of
payment.   

The Base Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to this Section 2.03 and Section
2.04 below shall be referred to as the " _Purchase Price_."   

SECTION 2.04. _Prorations; Transfer Taxes_. (a) All ad valorem and personal
property Taxes with respect to the Business Assets (including the Purchased

(including Transfer Taxes) arising out of any pre-Closing restructuring or

Taxes actually payable by Purchaser during the period including the Closing

the Closing Date. To the extent Purchaser does not actually claim and utilize
a credit for such payment and experience a reduction in Taxes actually

the period including the third anniversary of the Closing Date, Sellers shall
reimburse Purchaser for one-half of any such payment. For any Transfer Taxes
that are paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Purchaser, Sellers and
Purchaser likewise shall share on a 50/50 basis any cash refunds of such
shared Transfer Taxes actually received by Purchaser or Seller prior to the
third anniversary of the Closing as and when received. The parties shall
cooperate as reasonably requested in order to secure any such refunds
or credits.

(b) Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchasers and the Purchased

Purchaser or any Purchaser Company as a result of the actions referenced in
Section 5.06(a).   

SECTION 5.07. _Further Action_. Each of the Parties hereto shall use all
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, do
or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable Law, and execute and deliver such documents and other papers, as

Related Agreements.   

SECTION 5.08. _Exclusivity_ (a) . From the date of this Agreement through the
Closing Date, Sellers will not (and Sellers will not permit the other
Business Companies or any of their respective officers, directors, managers,
advisors or representatives to), directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate,
encourage, negotiate with, engage in discussions with, accept any proposal
or offers from, or provide any information or access to any Person relating
to the acquisition of all or substantially all of the equity securities or
assets of any of the Business Companies by such Person (including any
acquisition structured as a merger, consolidation or share exchange).   

SECTION 5.09. _Non-Solicitation_. (a) For a period of one year from the
Closing, Sellers shall not, and Sellers shall cause each of their Affiliates
not to, directly or indirectly perform any action, activity or course of
conduct consisting of or encouraging the following: (A) soliciting or
recruiting any key employees of the Business (as continued following the
Closing); or (B) soliciting or directly encouraging any key employees of the
Business (as continued following the Closing) to leave the employment of
Purchaser, a Purchased Business Company, or any of their respective

Closing) shall include any officer or director of Purchaser, a Purchased
Business Company or any of their respective Affiliates and any
employee involved in the Business (as continued following the Closing) who
has management or supervisory responsibilities, including division or group
managers. The foregoing shall not prohibit (i) a general solicitation to the
public of general advertising or similar methods of solicitation by search
firms not specifically directed at employees of the Business (as continued
following the Closing) or (ii) Sellers or any of their Affiliates from
soliciting, recruiting, or hiring any employee of the Business (as continued
following the Closing) who has ceased to be employed or retained by
Purchaser, the Purchased Company or their Affiliates (as the case may be) for

(b) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the
parties hereto recognize and agree that in the event of a breach of the
covenants set forth in this Section 5.09 by any party, money damages would
not be an adequate remedy to the injured party for such breach and, even if
money damages were adequate, it would be impossible to ascertain or measure
with any degree of accuracy the damages sustained by such injured party
therefrom. Accordingly, if there should be a breach or threatened breach by
any party of any provisions of this Section 5.09, the injured party shall be
entitled, either with or without pursuing any potential damage remedies,
to immediately obtain an injunction prohibiting the breaching party from
violating this section without showing or proving actual damage sustained by
the injured party. Nothing in the preceding sentence shall limit or otherwise
affect any remedies that a party may otherwise have under applicable
law.   

SECTION 5.10. _Other Agreements_. At the Closing, Sellers and Purchaser shall
enter into (i) a non-competition agreement attached hereto as Exhibit B (the
" _Non-Competition Agreement_ "), (ii) a global transition and services

SECTION 5.11. _Employees; Offers of Employment_. (a) Prior to the Closing
Date, Sellers will deliver _Schedule 5.11_ to Purchaser, which will set
forth a list as of the date hereof of all Business Employees by name,
position or job title, work location, rate of pay and date of hire;
_provided_ that _Schedule 5.11_ shall exclude such information with respect
to certain Business Employees that is protected by applicable privacy Laws and
regulations.   

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Purchaser shall make an offer of employment
effective as of the Closing Date to all Business Employees (except as listed
on _Schedule 5.11(b)_) as of the Closing (or, if later, the date the
Business Employee returns to work). The initial terms of such offer of
employment by Purchaser to each such Business Employee shall be at
substantially the same base salary or hourly rate of pay, as applicable, as
exists on the date of this Agreement with respect to such Business Employee,
and with either substantially the same benefit coverage provided for
similarly situated employees of Purchaser or its Affiliates as of the Closing
Date (other than benefit coverages for which newly hired employees cannot,
with future service, become eligible) or with benefit coverage comparable in
the aggregate to that provided to such Business Employee immediately prior to
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all employees of
the Purchased Business Companies shall remain employees of such Purchased
Business Companies or another Affiliate of Purchaser after the Closing Date.
Business Employees who accept PurchaserÂ’s offer and employees referred to in
the immediately preceding sentence shall be referred to in this Agreement as
" _Transferred Employees_." The Parties hereto do not intend to create any
third-party beneficiary rights respecting any Business Employee as a result
of the provisions in this Section 5.11 or Section 5.12 and specifically
hereby negate any such intention, and nothing contained in this Agreement
shall affect PurchaserÂ’s rights to alter after the Closing Date the terms
and conditions (including, but not limited to the wages or benefits) of each
such employeeÂ’s employment, or to terminate any such employeeÂ’s employment,
at PurchaserÂ’s discretion.   

(c) Sellers shall be responsible for continuing to employ or terminating as of
the Closing Date each Business Employee who has not accepted the offer of
employment from Purchaser as of the Closing Date, and Sellers shall be
responsible for any and all obligations and liabilities arising in connection
with such continuing employment with Sellers or their Affiliates of any such
Business Employee, including, but not limited to, any obligations respecting
Benefit Plans, and in connection with terminations of employment by Sellers
or their Affiliates of any such Business Employee, including, but not limited
to, any severance or other termination pay. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold harmless Sellers
with respect to, any severance obligations with respect to any Business
Employee whose offer of employment does not satisfy the requirements set
forth in Section 5.11(b) above.   

(d) The benefit plans of Purchaser in which Transferred Employees participate
shall, to the extent allowable under the governing requirements applicable
under PurchaserÂ’s benefit plans, provide or be amended to provide credit for
all purposes (except for benefit accrual purposes under any defined benefit
pension plan) for all Transferred EmployeesÂ’ service with Sellers and
their Affiliates, except to the extent that such crediting would result in
duplication of benefits.   

(e) Purchaser shall assume all vacation and paid time off liability with
respect to the Transferred Employees and shall credit all service with
Sellers and their Affiliates for purposes of determining post-Closing
vacation accruals of Transferred Employees.   

(f) Purchaser shall comply with all applicable laws relating to negotiations
with labor unions and works councils in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. With respect to any collective bargaining or
works council agreements, Purchaser shall (i) on the Closing Date, recognize
the applicable union as the exclusive representative of the Business Employees
covered by the applicable agreement; (ii) on the Closing Date, accept and
assume each such agreement; and (iii) fulfill any and all bargaining
obligations imposed by applicable Law.   

SECTION 5.12. _Welfare Plans_.   

(a) Effective as of the Closing Date or such later date as the Business
Employee returns to work as referenced in Section 5.11, (i) Sellers shall
cause each Business Employee who transfers employment to Purchaser or its
Affiliates as of the Closing Date (" _Transferring Employee_ ") to cease to
participate in each welfare benefit plan sponsored by Sellers or their
Affiliates, and (ii) Purchaser shall cause each Transferring Employee to be
covered by the welfare benefit plans provided by Purchaser or their
Affiliates for similarly situated employees. Sellers or their Affiliates
shall be liable for claims for benefits (other than for short-term disability,
workersÂ’ compensation and medical and dental benefits) by Transferring
Employees under such welfare benefit plans arising out of occurrences on or
prior to the Closing Date. Sellers or their Affiliates shall be liable for
claims for short-term disability benefits and workersÂ’ compensation benefits
by Transferring Employees under such welfare benefit plans with respect to
payments otherwise due on or prior to the Closing Date. Sellers or their
Affiliates shall be liable for claims for medical and dental benefits by
Transferring Employees under such welfare benefit plans with respect
to services and treatment rendered on or prior to the Closing Date. Purchaser
or their Affiliates shall cause each of the Transferring Employees to be
granted credit under its health benefit plans, for the year during which the
Closing Date occurs, with any deductibles, co-insurance payments or out-of-
pocket expenses already incurred by such Transferring Employees for such year
under the plans of Sellers or their Affiliates, and Purchaser or their
Affiliates shall cause there to be waived any preexisting condition
restrictions under its medical and dental benefits plans to the extent
necessary to provide immediate coverage under such plans. Purchaser or their
Affiliates shall provide the Transferring Employees (and their respective
beneficiaries) with medical benefits sufficient to satisfy the obligations of
Sellers or their Affiliates under Section 4980B of the Code respecting
Transferring Employees. Unless otherwise specifically agreed to by
Purchasers, Sellers or their Affiliates shall be liable for all welfare
benefits for Business Employees that are not Transferring Employees.   

(b) Sellers shall retain liability for all retiree medical and life benefit
liabilities with respect to the Transferred Employees and their eligible
dependents to the extent provided under the Dresser, Inc. Welfare Benefits
Plan, 750 (the " _Dresser Plan_ ") and shall provide such benefits to
Transferred Employees eligible for such benefits under the terms of the
Dresser Plan upon their retirement from Purchaser and their Affiliates (or
any successor thereto).   

SECTION 5.13. _Guarantees_. Within 120 days following the Closing Date,
Purchaser shall either (a) arrange for substitute letters of credit,
Purchaser guarantees and other obligations to replace (i) the project-related
performance and advance payment and retention bonds, project-related
performance guaranties, other guaranty obligations, letters of credit and
other similar arrangements of Sellers and their Affiliates relating to the
obligations of the Business Companies relating to the Business or otherwise
relating to or for the benefit of the Business that remain outstanding as of
the Closing Date, all of which relate to the Business to be conducted
from and after the Closing (the " _Guarantees_ ") and (ii) any Guarantees
entered into by or on behalf of Sellers or any of their Affiliates on or
after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Closing which are entered
into in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practices for
the benefit of the Business and consistent with the provisions contained in
Section 5.01 and are outstanding as of the Closing Date, it being understood
that Purchaser shall only be required to substitute a Purchaser guarantee for
any guarantees of Sellers or (b) assume all obligations under each Guarantee,
and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the creditor or other
counterparty a full release of all parties liable, directly or indirectly,
for reimbursement to the creditor or fulfillment of other obligations to a
counterparty in connection with amounts drawn under a Guarantee. Within 120
days following the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, if unsuccessful in its
efforts to replace the Guarantees, (x) provide to Sellers a stand-by
letter of credit, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Sellers,
from a nationally recognized bank or financial institution and in favor of
Sellers for the full amount of the obligations under each such Guarantee and
(y) indemnify, defend and hold harmless Sellers and their Affiliates against
and reimburse Sellers and their Affiliates for any and all amounts paid under
such Guarantees and costs and expenses associated with such Guarantees.   

SECTION 5.14. _Release of Certain Obligations_. Except for the agreements
listed in  _Schedule 5.14_, Sellers, for themselves and their Affiliates,
hereby agree, from and after the Closing, not to make or allow any of their
Affiliates to make any claims against and hereby releases, acquits and
discharges Purchaser and the Purchased Business Companies from any and
all claims, demands, obligations or causes of action which Sellers or any of
their Affiliates may have against Purchaser or the Purchased Business
Companies arising out of or relating to the activities of Sellers and their
Affiliates prior to the Closing Date, including any claims,
demands, obligations or causes of action which have arisen or may arise under
any agreements between Sellers or any Affiliates of Sellers (other than the
Purchased Business Companies), on the one hand, and the Purchased Business
Companies, on the other hand. Nothing in this Section 5.14 shall
be interpreted or construed as a release of any claims, demands, obligations
or causes of action pursuant to this Agreement or pursuant to the agreements
listed in _Schedule 5.14_ which continue beyond the Closing or other
agreements entered into after the Closing Date.   

SECTION 5.15. _Environmental Reports_. (a) Prior to the Closing Date, Sellers
shall permit Purchaser and its representatives to conduct and prepare, at
PurchaserÂ’s expense, Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments
(collectively, the " _Environmental Reports_ ") of Owned Real Property or
Leased Real Property selected by Purchaser provided that no Phase II
reports will be conducted on Voghera Grove properties unless otherwise agreed
between the Sellers and Purchaser. Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser and
permit access to the Owned Real Property, including buildings and structures
located thereon, during normal business hours in order for Purchaser or its
representatives to inspect such property and related environmental records in
the possession of Sellers. Purchaser shall not undertake sampling of any kind
at any Leased Real Property or any Owned Real Property without the express
written permission of Sellers which will not be unreasonably withheld.
Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a copy of any prepared Environmental
Report within five Business Days of receipt of such report by Purchaser and
permit Sellers to have input into, and conduct discussions with the
independent consultants preparing, such Environmental Report with requests to
any preliminary results which Seller reasonably finds objectionable.   

(b) Sellers and Purchaser agree prior to Closing to prepare a _Schedule
5.15(b)_ to this Agreement reflecting those items which Sellers and Purchaser
mutually agree will be deemed to be Pre-Closing Environmental Matters,
provided such schedule shall not be prejudicial to the PartiesÂ’ respective
positions with respect to the characterization of environmental matters not
reflected on such schedule.   

SECTION 5.16. _Foreign Jurisdictions_. Promptly after the date hereof,
Purchaser and Sellers shall cooperate in providing the appropriate
notifications to, and securing any required consents or approvals from the

Affiliates following the Closing Date), and Purchaser or the Purchased
Business Company shall cause such Tax Return to be filed as prepared by the
Purchaser, and adjusted with appropriate changes recommended by Seller, if
any, and shall pay (or cause to be paid) all Taxes set forth as due on such
Tax Returns. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practices of the Purchased Business Companies unless otherwise required
by Law.   

(ii) Except as provided in (i) or elsewhere in this Section 5.17, Purchaser

for additional Taxes, notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes
of or relating to any liability of the Business or the Transferred Assets
(including the Purchased Business Companies) for any period which includes or
ends on or prior to the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that Sellers
shall not, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, enter into any settlement of
any contest or otherwise compromise any issue that affects or may affect the
Tax liability of Purchaser any of its Affiliates for any taxable year or other
taxable period ending after the Closing Date.   

(ii) Purchaser and the Purchased Business Companies shall promptly forward to
Sellers all written notifications and other communications from any taxing

unreasonably withheld or delayed. Purchaser shall not amend or permit the
amendment of any Tax Returns that are the responsibility of any Seller
pursuant to Section 5.17(b)(i)(A), and shall not, without the prior consent
of such Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed)
amend or permit the amendment of any Tax Returns that are the responsibility
of any Seller pursuant to Section 5.17(b)(i)(B) except to the extent required
under applicable Law.   

(e) _Refunds_. Any Tax refund (including any interest in respect thereof)

Affiliate thereof), and any amounts of overpayments of Tax credited against
Tax that Purchaser or the Purchased Business Companies (or any Affiliate
thereof) otherwise would be or would have been required to pay that relates to
any period or portion thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date shall,
to the extent Purchaser actually receives a cash benefit from such Tax
refund, be for the account of Sellers, and Purchaser shall, to the extent
Purchaser actually receives a cash benefit from such Tax refund, pay over to
Sellers any such refund or the amount of any such credit within fifteen (15)
days after receipt or entitlement thereto, net of any Taxes incurred as a
result of the receipt of such refund or credit.   

(f) _Carrybacks_. To the extent required under applicable Law or with the
consent of the Sellers, the Purchaser or the Purchased Business Companies may
carry back any net operating loss or other item or attribute from a taxable

Purchased Business Companies.   

(i) _Check the Box Elections_. Sellers in their sole discretion may cause an
election under Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3 (and any comparable
provision of United States federal, state or local Tax Law) to be made with
respect to any of the Purchased Business Companies, effective on or prior to
the Closing Date, and Purchaser shall and shall cause its Affiliates to
cooperate in the making of any such elections as requested by Sellers.   

SECTION 5.18. _Product Warranty Claims_. Warranty claims involving products of
the Business distributed or sold by the Business prior to the Closing Date,
including product liability and negligence claims and liabilities for
refunds, adjustments, allowances, repairs, exchanges, returns and warranty or
similar claims (" _Pre-Closing Product Warranty Claims_ ") shall be handled
as follows:   

(a) Purchaser shall manage, administer and process all Pre-Closing Product
Warranty Claims in a manner generally no more favorable to the third party as
Purchaser applies with respect to similar warranty claims involving products
of the Business distributed or sold by the Business following the Closing
Date including product liability and negligence claims and liabilities
for refunds, adjustments, allowances, repairs, exchanges, returns and
warranty or similar claims (" _Post-Closing Product Warranty Claims_
");   

(b) Purchaser shall bear and be responsible for the Liabilities associated
with or arising out of the Pre-Closing Product Warranty Claims up to the
reserve set forth in the Final Closing Statement (the " _Product Warranty
Reserve_ "); and   

(c) Sellers shall bear and be responsible for the Liabilities associated with
or arising out of Pre-Closing Product Warranty Claims in excess of the
Product Warranty Reserve; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that Sellers shall not be
responsible for such costs in excess of the Product Warranty Reserve unless
(i) Sellers have consented to such costs in advance thereof, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned, or (ii)
such costs are incurred by Purchaser in a manner generally no more favorable
to the third party as Purchaser applies with respect to similar warranty
claims involving products of the Business distributed or sold by the Business
following the Closing.   

SECTION 5.19. _Liquidated Damages._    

(a) Sellers and Purchaser acknowledge and agree that certain of the customer
contracts and agreements which are to be assigned to Purchaser by Sellers or
which are held by Purchased Business Companies, contain liquidated damages ("
_Liquidated Damages_ ") provisions which could entitle the customers under
such contracts and agreements to receive Liquidated Damages upon a failure
by any Seller or Purchased Business Company to timely perform its obligations
under such contracts and agreements.   

(b) Liquidated Damages that are associated with products of the Business and
arise out of any of the contracts or agreements assumed by Purchaser as
Assumed Liabilities shall be handled as follows:    

(i) Purchaser agrees to assume and to indemnify and hold harmless Sellers with
respect to all liabilities and obligations with respect to such Liquidated
Damages associated with products of the Business distributed or shipped by
the Business prior to the Closing Date (" _Pre-Closing Liquidated Damages_ ")
up to the total amount reserved therefor on the Final Closing Statement (the
" _Liquidated Damages Reserve_ ").    

(ii) Purchaser and Sellers further agree that any liability or obligation for
such Liquidated Damages that arise with respect to products of the Business
that are shipped on or after the Closing Date and within 180 days thereof
pursuant to contracts and agreements relating to the Business which are
included in the Business Assets and which have Liquidated Damages provisions
or could subject the Purchaser or any Purchased Business Company
to Liquidated Damages or similar penalties (the " _Post-Closing Liquidated
Damages_ ") shall be borne as follows:    

(A) by Purchaser, to the extent the Liquidated Damages Reserve exceeds
the actual amount of Pre-Closing Liquidated Damages, then    

(B) 50 percent by the Purchaser and 50 percent by Sellers.   

SECTION 5.20. _Gazprom Order_. Sellers and Purchaser agree that with regard to
the Contract No. 548-3515-40016 between Sellers and GAZKOMTLEKTIMTEX, Ltd. ("
_Gazprom_ ") (the " _Gazprom Order_ ") Purchaser shall, at Closing, enter
into an agreement with Sellers whereby, (i) Sellers shall retain
responsibility for and be the primary obligor under the Gazprom Order with no
incremental cost to Sellers relating to the performance of the Gazprom Order;
(ii) Purchaser will serve as Sellers subcontractor to perform the Gazprom
Order and (iii) Purchaser will receive all payments payable by Gazprom for
such services and products under the Gazprom Order.   

SECTION 5.21. _Customer Advances_. (a) As set forth in Sections 2.02 and 2.03,
the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the total amount of Customer Advances
(as defined in the definition of "Business Assets" in Exhibit A to this
Agreement) outstanding at the Closing Date that have not been applied to
Inventories as of the Closing Date (the " _Customer Advances Amount_ "). At
Closing, Sellers shall estimate in good faith the Customer Advances Amount
and such amount shall be included in the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment
pursuant to Section 2.02(b) (such amount being referred to as the "
_Estimated Customer Advances Amount_ "). For purposes of calculating the
Estimated Customer Advances Amount only, all Customer Advances
received within 45 days prior to the Closing Date shall be presumed to be
unapplied to Inventories and shall constitute, in the aggregate, the
Estimated Customer Advances Amount.   

(b) Purchaser and Sellers shall determine the Final Customer Advances Amount
which should have been paid at Closing (" _Final Customer Advances Amount_ ")
within 120 days following Closing pursuant to Section 2.03. For purpose of
calculating the Final Customer Advances Amount, the amount of Customer
Advances applied to Inventories as of the Closing Date shall be calculated
by Sellers and Purchaser as follows: (i) the aggregate amount of unapplied
Customer Advances received prior to August 1, 2005 shall be determined in
good faith by Purchaser and the amount of such Customer Advances that have
been applied to Inventories shall be calculated taking into consideration (A)
actual cash payments to suppliers in full payment for such Inventories and
(B) direct labor charges and internal overhead allocations allocable to such
Inventories in accordance with the inventory costing accounting principles
set forth in the notes to the Financial Statements, excluding any amounts
related to depreciation and amortization; and (ii) the determination of when
all subsequent unapplied Customer Advances have been applied to
Inventories shall be calculated on a contract by contract basis using the
same methodology.   

(c) Any reductions in Purchase Price as a result of the Estimated Customer
Advances Amount, and any final payments with respect to the Final Customer
Advances Amount made pursuant to Section 2.03 will be deemed to be an
adjustment to the Purchase Price.   

SECTION 5.22. _Reserves_. Sellers agree that (i) any reserves contained in
the calculation of Final Working Capital shall be determined in accordance
with the same policies and practices for establishing financial statement
reserves used in establishing reserves in the Financial Statements as
disclosed in the notes thereto and (ii) Sellers will not be allowed to reduce
any of the reserves contained in the calculation of Final Working Capital from
the respective amounts contained in the Financial Statements as of June 30,
2005 (including reserves for doubtful account receivables and account
payables) except to the extent of an event involving the receipt of cash or
payment of cash by the Business which cash event would support a reduction in
the applicable reserve; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Liquidated Damages
Reserve shall be reduced on the Final Closing Statement if, consistent with
the policies and practices of Sellers, there has occurred a contract
concession or other action by the customer counter-party to the contract in
question that is properly reflected in the books and records of the
Business.   

SECTION 5.23. _Italian Asset Drop-down_.   

(a) Sellers and Purchaser agree that Sellers and Purchaser shall take the
following actions to accomplish a sale of the Italian assets and business
included in the Business: (A) at or prior to Closing, all of the assets of
Dresser Italia and Ring-O that are Business Assets shall be contributed to
Cooper Cameron Valves Italy, SrL in exchange for the Cooper Cameron Valves
Italy Shares, and (B) at Closing Purchaser or its designee will repurchase
the Cooper Cameron Valves Italy Shares previously issued to Sellers, in each
case either (i) on terms that are reasonably acceptable to both parties and
consistent with the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, or (ii)
as reasonably determined by Purchaser; provided Purchaser indemnifies
Sellers for any incremental costs to Sellers as a result of such actions
associated with PurchaserÂ’s alternative structure under (ii) above as opposed
to the structure in (i) above.   

(b) Sellers and Purchaser agree that, to the extent Purchaser so requests,
Sellers shall contribute inter-company Indebtedness and accounts and related
assets of Dresser Italia and Ring-O into Cooper Cameron Valves Italy,
contemporaneous with actions taken under subsection (a) above in each case
either (i) on terms reasonably acceptable to both parties, or (ii) as
reasonably determined by Purchaser, provided Purchaser indemnifies Sellers
for any incremental costs to Sellers as a result of such actions associated
with PurchaserÂ’s alternative structure under (ii) above as opposed to the
structure in (i) above.   

(c) Purchaser agrees to repay to Sellers an amount equal to all inter-company
Indebtedness contributed into Cooper Cameron Valves Italy pursuant to Section
5.23(b) on the Closing Date, and Purchaser and Sellers agree that the
Purchase Price will be reduced at Closing by a corresponding amount.   

SECTION 5.24. _Covenant to Provide Schedule of Material Permits, Business IP
Licenses and Customer Property Schedules_. (a) Within 15 Business Days
following the date of this Agreement, Sellers agree to provide Purchaser with
(i) Schedule 3.07 setting forth each of the Material Permits, (ii) Schedule
3.09 (xix) setting forth a list of all Business IP Licenses required by that
Section, and (iii) Schedule 3.26 setting forth a list of all Customer
Property.   

(b) Within ten (10) days prior to Closing, Sellers will cause to be prepared
and will deliver to Purchaser (i) unaudited consolidated statements of
operating income of the Business for the twelve-month period ending December
31, 2004 and for the six-month period ending on June 30, 2005 that carve out
the operations and assets comprising the Excluded Assets relating to the
Port Northwest facilities and operations and (ii) unaudited consolidated
statements of operating income of the Excluded Assets relating to the Port
Northwest facilities and operations for the twelve-month period ending
December 31, 2004 and for the six-month period ended on June 30, 2005. Such
financials will be prepared in accordance with the same accounting principles
applied in the preparation of the Financial Statements.   

SECTION 5.25. _Joinder Agreement_. Within 15 Business Days following the date
of this Agreement, Dresser shall cause the Retained Business Companies to
deliver joinder agreements to Purchaser, pursuant to which each Retained
Business Company shall become a Party to this Agreement with the same force
and effect as if such Retained Business Company had executed and delivered
this Agreement on the date hereof.   

SECTION 5.26. _Environmental Waste Removal_. Sellers agree, prior to the
Closing, to remove and dispose offsite all plant trash, non-hazardous waste
and hazardous waste generated prior to the Closing at all of SellersÂ’ sites
and facilities included in the Business Assets, including sites and
facilities located at Colico, Italy, Voghera, Italy, Ledeen Italy, Ponca City
(Ponca Fab - 900 E. Oakland), Oklahoma and Jacarei, Brazil in a manner which
complies with applicable Laws.   

SECTION 5.27. _Brazilian Manifold Contract_. Notwithstanding PurchaserÂ’s
assumption of the Contract No. P-52BP3026 with FSTP Brazil S/A (the
"Brazilian Manifold Contract"), Sellers and Purchaser agree that, in the
event deliveries are made under the Brazilian Manifold Contract following the
Closing then, to the extent any consequential damages (not including
Liquidated Damages which are addressed in Section 5.19) arise under the
Brazilian Manifold Contract, the first $7.5 million in such consequential
damages will be split 50% by Sellers and 50% by Purchaser.

except where the failure to be so true and correct (without giving effect to

terms and limitations in this Article VII, Sellers, jointly and severally,
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Purchaser and PurchaserÂ’s
Affiliates (including the Purchased Business Companies following the Closing)
and their respective directors, officers and shareholders (the "
_Purchaser Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all Losses actually
incurred by any of Purchaser Indemnitees (i) that arise out of any breach of
SellersÂ’ representations or warranties made in this Agreement (other than
Section 3.12 which is addressed in Section 7.01(c) below), (ii) that
arise out of any breach of the covenants or obligations of Sellers under this
Agreement, or (iii) that arise out of the Retained Liabilities.   

(b) _Purchaser Â’s Indemnity_. From and after the Closing, subject to the
other terms and limitations in this Article VII, Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Sellers and SellersÂ’ Affiliates which shall include
the Purchased Business Companies and their respective directors, officers and
shareholders (the " _Sellers Indemnitees_ ") from and against any and all
Losses actually incurred by any of the Sellers Indemnitees (i) that arise out
of any breach of PurchaserÂ’s representations or warranties made in this
Agreement, (ii) that arise out of any breach of the covenants or obligations
of Purchaser under this Agreement, or (iii) that arise out of the Assumed
Liabilities.   

(c) _Tax Indemnity_. Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees from and
against (i) all Pre-Closing Taxes to the extent not paid prior to the Closing
and (ii) against any and all Losses actually incurred by any of the Purchaser
Indemnitees that arise out of any breach by Sellers of Section 3.12.   

(d) _Pension Indemnity_. Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees from
and against all amounts that become due and payable by Purchaser Indemnitees
(including any such amounts imposed by Law) at any time following the Closing
Date in connection with or arising out of the Pension and Retirement
Obligations.   

(e) _Limitations on Indemnity_.    

(i) None of Purchaser Indemnitees shall be entitled to assert any right
to indemnification under Section 7.01(a)(i) or 7.01(a)(ii) with respect to
covenants to be performed prior to Closing until the aggregate amount of all
the Losses actually suffered by the Purchaser Indemnitees exceeds $2,500,000
(the " _Deductible Amount_ ") and then only to the extent such Losses exceed,
in the aggregate, the Deductible Amount provided such Deductible amount shall
not apply to any claim for recovery of an uncollected account receivable
pursuant to Section 3.25.    

(ii) In no event shall Sellers ever be required to indemnify Purchaser
Indemnitees for Losses (A) in the case of claims under Section 7.01(a)(i)
(except as provided in subsection B below) or 7.01(a)(ii) with respect to

party shall be required to indemnify any indemnified party for Losses that do
not exceed $50,000 resulting from any single claim or aggregated claims
arising from out of the same facts, events, or circumstances (the " _Minimum
Claim Amount_ ") provided such Minimum Claim Amount shall not apply to any
claim for recovery of an uncollected account receivable pursuant to Section

(iv) In no event shall Sellers ever be required to indemnify Purchaser
Indemnitees for any Losses resulting from a claim under Section 7.01(a)(i),
or 7.01(a)(ii) with respect to covenants to be performed prior to Closing, if
prior to Closing Purchaser (A) had actual knowledge of the breach giving rise
to such claim, (B) had the reasonable belief that such breach by Sellers
would result in a Loss in excess of $17,500,000, and (C) did not
inform Sellers in writing concerning such breach prior to Closing. In the
event Purchaser has actual knowledge of such a breach and claim, then
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
PurchaserÂ’s sole recourse for any breach relating to the particular claim
meeting the criteria in the preceding sentence shall be to either
(A) terminate the Agreement or (B) waive any rights to indemnification
hereunder for such breach. In no event will Purchaser ever be deemed to have
waived any rights to indemnification under this subsection (iv) with regard
to any breach of which any of the Sellers was aware prior to Closing.    

(v) In no event shall Seller ever be required to indemnify Purchaser
Indemnitees for Losses arising from changes in Law or accounting policies or
principles, in each case occurring after the Closing.    

(vi) For purposes of computing the aggregate amount of claims against Seller,
the amount of each claim by a Purchaser Indemnitee shall be deemed to be an
amount equal to, and any payments by Seller pursuant to this Article VII
shall be limited to, the amount of Losses that remain after deducting
therefrom (A) the amount of any accrued liability or reserve included in the
calculation of the Working Capital and specifically identified to such Loss
or category of such Loss, and (B) any net Tax benefit actually recognized
that reduced cash Taxes on a net tax basis otherwise actually payable by a
Purchaser Indemnitee or any Affiliate thereof with respect to the Losses or
items giving rise to such claim for indemnification within two years from the
date of the applicable Losses or items giving rise to such claim for
indemnification.    

(vii) In any claim for indemnification under this Agreement, no indemnifying
party shall be required to indemnify any indemnified party for its indirect,
punitive, special, or consequential damages, nor for any multiple of loss of
its profits, revenue, or reduced cash flow, except to the extent such matters
are the subject of a third party claim;  _provided_ , _however_ , that an
indemnifying party shall be required to indemnify any indemnified party for
actual loss of such indemnified partyÂ’s profits.    

(viii) In no event will Seller be allowed to receive a double recovery with
respect to applicable adjustments relating to accounts receivable and
liquidated damages.   

(f) _Survival_. All of the representations and warranties of the Parties set
forth in this Agreement and all covenants to be consummated prior to the
Closing shall survive the Closing until the earlier of (x) the date on which
Purchaser files its annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange Commission and (y) the date
on which Purchaser is required to file its annual report on Form 10-K for the
fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 with the Securities and Exchange

12b-25 (or any successor form) (such date, the " _Survival Date_ "), except
that (i) the Fundamental Representations and Warranties shall
survive indefinitely and (ii) the representations and warranties in Section
3.12 shall survive until 30 days following the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations period. Sellers shall not have any liability for
indemnification claims made under Section 7.01(a)(i) or (ii) or
Section 7.01(b)(i) or (ii) with respect to any such representation, warranty
or pre-closing covenant unless a claim notice is provided by Purchaser to
Sellers or Sellers to Purchaser as the case may be, prior to the expiration
of the applicable survival period for such representation, warranty or pre-
closing covenant. If a claim notice has been timely given in accordance with
this Agreement prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period for
such representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant, then the applicable
representation, warranty or pre-closing covenant shall survive as to such
claim, until such claim has been finally resolved.   

(g) EXPRESS NEGLIGENCE. THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS IN THIS ARTICLE VII
SHALL BE ENFORCEABLE REGARDLESS OF WHETHER ANY PERSON (INCLUDING THE PERSON
FROM WHOM INDEMNIFICATION IS SOUGHT) ALLEGES OR PROVES THE SOLE, CONCURRENT,
CONTRIBUTORY OR COMPARATIVE NEGLIGENCE OF THE PERSON SEEKING INDEMNIFICATION
OR THE SOLE OR CONCURRENT STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED ON THE PERSON SEEKING
INDEMNIFICATION.   

SECTION 7.02. _Defense of Claims_.   

(a) _Notice_ _._ If an indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any
claim or of the commencement of any third party claim, audit or examination
with respect to which Indemnification is to be sought from the indemnifying
party (" _Indemnifying Party_ "), the indemnitee will give such Indemnifying
Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in no event later
than ten (10) days after the indemniteeÂ’s receipt of notice of such third
party claim, audit or examination. However, the failure to give timely notice
will not affect the rights or obligations of the Indemnifying Party except
and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the Indemnifying
Party was prejudiced. Such notice shall describe the nature of the third party
claim, audit or examination in reasonable detail and will indicate the
estimated amount, if practicable, of the Loss that has been or may be
sustained by the indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to
participate in or, by giving notice to the indemnitee, to elect to assume the
defense of, any third party claim, audit or examination at such Indemnifying
PartyÂ’s own expense and by such Indemnifying PartyÂ’s own counsel, and the
indemnitee will cooperate in good faith in such defense at such indemniteeÂ’s
own expense.   

(b) _Opportunity to Defend_ _._ If within ten (10) days after an indemnitee
provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of any third party claim, the
indemnitee receives notice from the Indemnifying Party that such Indemnifying
Party has elected to assume the defense of such third party claim, the
Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently
incurred by the indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof.   

SECTION 7.03. _Special Environmental Indemnification Provisions_.   

(a) From and after the Closing, subject to the other terms and limitations in
this Section 7.03, Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Purchaser Indemnitees from and against any and all Losses
actually incurred by any of Purchaser Indemnitees that arise out of any Pre-
Closing Environmental Matters.   

(b) Sellers shall have the obligation to assume control of the defense,
response, proceedings, settlement and resolution of any Pre-Closing
Environmental Matters, including any Environmental Activities, enforcement
actions or administrative proceedings; provided that Sellers shall not agree
to any Environmental Activities, settlements or resolutions that (i)
unreasonably interfere with any operations of the Business as conducted from
and after the Closing Date, (ii) that would be reasonably likely to subject
any Purchaser Indemnitee to any Losses which are not paid by Sellers or (iii)
that would require any admission of liability or wrong doing by any of
the Purchased Companies, except with the prior written consent of Purchaser,
which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. In the event Sellers or
SellersÂ’ Indemnitor (as defined below) agree to any such permitted settlement
or resolution, Sellers shall indemnify Purchaser Indemnitees for any and all
Losses and incremental costs actually incurred by any of the Purchaser
Indemnitees that arise out of such settlement or resolution. Purchaser shall
cooperate in all reasonable ways with Sellers or SellersÂ’ Indemnitor in the
investigation, remediation, defense, contest, settlement of or prosecution of
any Pre-Closing Environmental Matters.   

(c) SellersÂ’ indemnity obligations with respect to Pre-Closing Environmental
Matters under this Article VII shall not apply to any Losses: (i) arising
with respect to any Pre-Closing Environmental Matter to the extent that
Environmental Activities are required as a result of any intentional act or
act of gross negligence by Purchaser pursuant to which PurchaserÂ’s
applicable facility HSandE director and applicable facility operations
management should reasonably have known that such action was likely to result
in Sellers having an indemnity obligation under this Agreement, (ii) to the
extent resulting from a use for any purpose other than for conducting
the Business following the Closing, of any Owned Real Property, the Leased
Real Property or any other facility that is the subject of a Pre-Closing
Environmental Matter indemnification claim under this Article VII (such
facilities together with all Owned Real Property and Leased Real Property
are collectively, " _Covered Facilities_ ") by Purchaser, _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) lawful actions taken by any Purchaser Indemnitee at a
Covered Facility that are consistent with the past business practices and
operations of Sellers, (B) a discontinuation of any operation by Purchaser
Indemnitees at any of the Covered Facilities which is not followed by any
change in use for any purpose other than conducting the Business following
the Closing or (C) a change in operations, use or other action that is
required by Law shall not constitute an actionable change in use of any such
Covered Facility) or (iii) arising as a result of Purchaser encouraging
or inviting any Governmental Authority to require any Environmental
Activities or undertake any enforcement action except to the extent, and only
to the extent, necessary for Purchaser to comply with any Continuing
Environmental Law or to comply with reporting obligations under
applicable Continuing Environmental Law. Any Environmental Activities that
Sellers undertake or are required to indemnify Purchaser for under this
Article VII shall only be required to be conducted in accordance with clean-
up standards or remedial goals, policies or guidelines that are
established by applicable Continuing Environmental Laws and necessary for the
continuing conduct of the Business.   

(d) Purchaser acknowledges that certain Pre-Closing Environmental Matters are
the subject of the indemnification provisions of the Amended and Restated
Agreement and Plan of Recapitalization dated as of April 10, 2001 among
Halliburton Company, Dresser B.V. and DEG Acquisitions, LLC (the " _2001
Halliburton Agreement_ "). Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it is
possible that Sellers may discharge some or all of its obligations under this
Article VII with respect to certain Pre-Closing Environmental Matters by
enforcement or operation of SellersÂ’ indemnity rights under the 2001
Halliburton Agreement. Sellers acknowledge that the existence or absence of
SellersÂ’ indemnity rights under the 2001 Halliburton Agreement does not in

writing prior to the Closing) in each case as a result of SellersÂ’ obligations
to applicable Governmental Authorities, and that such Environmental
Activities may continue after the Closing Date. All such Environmental
Activities shall be conducted by Sellers or SellersÂ’ Indemnitor in a manner
consistent with sound investigation and remediation practices and in a manner
that that does not unreasonably interfere with any operations of the Business

Activities are conducted in compliance with the provisions of this Section
7.03. In addition, Sellers agree to and shall (i) provide to the Purchaser,

that arise out of and are proximately caused by any Environmental Activities
undertaken by or on behalf of Sellers or SellersÂ’ Indemnitor at the Covered
Facilities; and _provided_ _further_ , that Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser
Indemnitees for any and all increased costs actually incurred by Purchaser as
a result of any such Environmental Activities.

(iv) Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser against any Losses
arising out of such rights of access, the entry of Sellers, SellersÂ’
Indemnitor or any their respective Affiliates and their agents,
representatives and invitees on to the Covered Facilities and the conduct of
Environmental Activities except for any such Losses that arise out of
or result from the negligence of Purchaser or any Persons acting on its
behalf.    

(v) Sellers and SellersÂ’ Indemnitor shall take and shall cause their
respective agents, representatives and invitees to take all necessary
precautions to avoid any damage to or loss of any equipment or facilities
owned or leased by any Purchaser Indemnitee or invitees, as applicable, on
the Covered Facilities in connection with the conduct of any
Environmental Activities, and shall pay for all damages to or loss of such
equipment or facilities resulting from any acts or omissions of the damaging
party. In addition, Purchaser shall use reasonable efforts to avoid damage to
or loss of any equipment of Sellers or SellersÂ’ Indemnitor, as applicable, on
the Covered Sites which are used in conducting Environmental Activities and
shall pay for all damages to or loss of such equipment to the
extent resulting from any negligent actions by the Purchaser.   

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Article VII to the contrary, if
Purchaser, by any intentional act or an act of gross negligence, pursuant to
which PurchaserÂ’s applicable facility HSandE director and applicable facility
operations management should reasonably have known that such action was
likely to result in Sellers losing their rights to indemnity under the 2001
Halliburton Agreement, causes any Seller to lose its rights to
indemnification under the 2001 Halliburton Agreement, PurchaserÂ’s recovery
under this Article VII with respect to the Pre-Closing Environmental Matters
for which such Seller lost its indemnity rights under the 2001
Halliburton Agreement shall be subject in all respects to, and limited by,
the Deductible Amount and the Liability Ceiling, and Sellers shall not have
any liability for indemnification claims with respect to Pre-Closing
Environmental Matters for which any Seller lost its indemnity rights under the
2001 Halliburton Agreement unless a claim notice has been or is provided by

Matters and (ii) Sellers unconditionally release Purchaser Indemnitees from

any other claim against Sellers in connection with any Pre-Closing
Environmental Matters.
