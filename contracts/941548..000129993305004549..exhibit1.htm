<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>PURCHASE AND SALE</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 2.01. <U>Purchase and Sale of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Business
Assets</U>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, at the Closing,
Sellers agree to and shall sell to Purchaser or its designated subsidiaries the Purchased Shares
and the Purchased Business Assets. The Purchased Shares will be transferred by Sellers to
Purchaser or its designated subsidiaries free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Encumbrances
created by Purchaser. The Purchased Business Assets will be transferred by Sellers to Purchaser or
its designated subsidiaries free and clear of all Encumbrances other than Permitted Encumbrances.
At the Closing, Sellers waive (for themselves and their Affiliates) all applicable rights of
preemption, purchase rights and other restrictions relating to any transfer of the Purchased Shares
and the Purchased Business Assets. Sellers are not selling, and Purchaser is not purchasing, any
of the Excluded Assets, including assets listed on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.01</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 2.02. <U>Purchase Price; Adjustments to Purchase Price</U>. (a)&nbsp;The purchase price
to be paid at the Closing by Purchaser or its designated subsidiaries for the Purchased Shares and
the Purchased Business Assets shall be an aggregate of Two Hundred Twenty-Three Million Eight
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($223,800,000), plus the Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment (the
&#147;<U>Base Purchase Price</U>&#148;) subject to adjustment pursuant to Sections&nbsp;2.03 and 2.04 below and
subject to further adjustment pursuant to Sections&nbsp;5.21 and 5.23 hereof. The Base Purchase Price
will be paid at the Closing by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the applicable
Sellers&#146; Bank Account designated by Sellers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;No later than three (3)&nbsp;Business Days prior to Closing, the parties shall calculate the
Estimated Working Capital Payment (as defined below), calculate the Estimated Customer Advances
Amount, calculate the Estimated Capital Lease Amount and calculate the total projected purchase
price adjustments that would be payable pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.03 but for the operation of this
Section&nbsp;2.02(b) (the &#147;<U>Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment</U>&#148;), with an Estimated Purchase
Price Adjustment payable to Sellers at Closing being expressed as a positive number, or an
Estimated Purchase Price Adjustment payable to Purchaser at Closing being expressed as a negative
number. The &#147;Estimated Working Capital&#148; shall be equal to the Working Capital of the Business as
of 12:01&nbsp;a.m. (local time in each applicable jurisdiction) on the most recent month end prior to
(but not including) the Closing Date. For purposes of calculating the Estimated Purchase Price
Adjustment, the difference (positive or negative) between the Estimated Working Capital and the
Working Capital Threshold shall be multiplied by 75% (the &#147;<U>Estimated Working Capital
Payment</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 2.03. <U>Purchase Price Adjustment</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(a)&nbsp;For purposes of establishing the Purchase Price, Purchaser and Sellers have assumed that
the sum of the Working Capital of the Business at Closing would be $124,000,000 (&#147;<U>Working
Capital Threshold</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;As soon as reasonably practicable following the Closing Date, and in any event within 120
days thereafter, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a calculation of (i)&nbsp;the actual
Working Capital of the Business, prepared in accordance with the accounting principles and
procedures and in the format set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.03(b)</U> as of 12:01&nbsp;a.m. (local time in
each applicable jurisdiction) on the Closing Date (the &#147;<U>Final Working Capital</U>&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;the
Final Customer Advances Amount, and (iii)&nbsp;the Final Capital Lease Amount, together with reasonably
detailed supporting information, (collectively set forth on the &#147;<U>Final Closing
Statement</U>&#148;). The difference (positive or negative) between the Final Working Capital and the
Working Capital Threshold shall be referred to as the &#147;Final Working Capital Payment.&#148;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(i)&nbsp;From and after the delivery of the Final Closing Statement, Purchaser shall provide
Sellers and their representatives reasonable access to the books and records of the Business
relating to the calculation of the Final Working Capital, the Final Customer Advances Amount
and the Final Capital Lease Amount as Sellers shall reasonably request and that are
available to Purchaser.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(ii)&nbsp;Within 45&nbsp;days after Sellers&#146; receipt of the Final Closing Statement, Sellers
shall notify Purchaser as to whether Sellers agree or disagree with the calculation of the
Final Working Capital or the Final Customer Advances Amount as reflected on the Final
Closing Statement and, if Sellers disagree, such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail
the particulars of such disagreement. If Sellers provide a notice of agreement or do not
provide a notice of disagreement within such 45&nbsp;day period, then Sellers shall be deemed to
have accepted the calculations and the amounts set forth in the Final Closing Statement
delivered by Purchaser, which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes
hereunder. If any such notice of disagreement is timely provided, then Purchaser and
Sellers shall each use reasonable efforts for a period of 25&nbsp;days thereafter to resolve any
disagreements with respect to the calculations in the Final Closing Statement.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(iii)&nbsp;If, at the end of the 25-day resolution period referred to in (ii)&nbsp;above, the
parties are unable to resolve any disagreements as to items in the Final Closing Statement,
then Grant Thornton LLP will be asked to resolve such dispute (the &#147;<U>Purchase Price
Arbiter</U>&#148;). If Grant Thornton LLP is unable or unwilling to serve as the Purchase Price
Arbiter and Purchaser and Sellers are unable to agree upon a mutually acceptable Person to
serve as the Purchase Price Arbiter, then Grant Thornton LLP shall select a Person who (A)
is a retired partner of a national accounting firm which partner has not performed any
audit, tax or other accounting services for either Sellers or Purchaser in the previous
three years, and does not have a conflict of interest with either party, (B)&nbsp;has experience
in arbitration and (C)&nbsp;holds a certified public accountant certificate, to serve as the
Purchase Price Arbiter. Sellers and Purchaser shall submit, in writing, detailed briefs to
the Purchase Price Arbiter setting forth their views as to the correct nature and amount of
each item remaining in dispute and the amount of the Final Working Capital or Final Customer
Advances Amount, as the case may be, and the Purchase Price Arbiter shall make a written
determination as promptly as practicable, but in any event within 30&nbsp;days after the date on
which such dispute is referred to the Purchase Price Arbiter, as to the Final Working
Capital or Final Customer Advances Amount, which determination shall be final and binding on
the parties for all purposes hereunder. The Purchase Price Arbiter shall be authorized to
select only the amount of the Final Working Capital or Final Customer Advances Amount as
presented by either Sellers or Purchaser and shall not select any other figure or amount as
the Final Working Capital or Final Customer Advances Amount. The costs and expenses of the
Purchase Price Arbiter shall be borne 50% by Sellers and 50% by Purchaser. The
determination of the Purchase Price Arbiter shall be final, binding and conclusive for all
purposes hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">Within five Business Days of the date on which the last disputed item required to determine
the Final Working Capital, Final Customer Advances Amount and the Final Capital Lease Amount is
resolved pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.03, the Purchase Price shall be increased by the excess, if
any, of the Final Working Capital Payment over the Estimated Working Capital Payment, or decreased
by the excess, if any, of the Estimated Working Capital Payment over the Final Working Capital
Payment. The Purchase Price shall be further adjusted as follows: (i)&nbsp;increased by the excess, if
any, of the Estimated Customer Advances Amount over the Final Customer Advances Amount, or
decreased by the excess, if any, of the Final Customer Advances Amount over the Estimated Customer
Advances Amount, and (ii)&nbsp;increased by the excess, if any, of the Estimated Capital Lease Amount
over the Final Capital Lease Amount, or decreased by the excess, if any, of the Final Capital Lease
Amount over the Estimated Capital Lease Amount. The Sellers shall pay to Purchaser any net
decrease in the Purchase Price, as determined under this Section&nbsp;2.03, from the Base Purchase
Price. The Purchaser shall pay to Sellers any net increase in the Purchase Price, as determined
under this Section&nbsp;2.03, over the Base Purchase Price. Any payments made pursuant to this Section
2.03 shall include interest on the amount of such payment at the Libor Rate on an annualized basis
for the period between the Closing Date and the date of payment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">The Base Purchase Price as adjusted pursuant to this Section&nbsp;2.03 and Section&nbsp;2.04 below shall
be referred to as the &#147;<U>Purchase Price</U>.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 2.04. <U>Prorations; Transfer Taxes</U>. (a)&nbsp;All ad valorem and personal property
Taxes with respect to the Business Assets (including the Purchased Business Assets and the Business
Assets held by the Purchased Business Companies) shall be apportioned and shall be adjusted, as of
the Closing Date, and the net amount thereof shall be added to or deducted from, as the case may
be, that portion of the Base Purchase Price paid by Purchaser on the Closing Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(b)&nbsp;Sellers and Purchaser shall each pay one-half of the Transfer Taxes payable with respect
to the sale by Sellers in the aggregate, on the one hand, and purchase by Purchaser, on the other
hand, of the Purchased Business Assets and the Purchased Shares. Purchaser shall pay all Taxes
arising out of any post-Closing restructuring or reorganization of the Purchased Business Companies
or the Purchased Business Assets. Sellers shall pay all Taxes (including Transfer Taxes) arising
out of any pre-Closing restructuring or reorganization of the Business Companies or Business
Assets, including, without limitation, any assignment, conveyance or transfer of Business Assets
from a Seller, any Business Company or any of their Affiliates to a Purchased Business Company or
Cooper Cameron Valves Italy (the &#147;<U>Restructuring</U>&#148;). Notwithstanding the forgoing, the cash
deliverable by Purchaser at Closing shall be reduced by the amount of any applicable withholding
Taxes relating to such purchase. Notwithstanding the forgoing, Purchaser shall pay all of the
Transfer Taxes with respect to the sale by Sellers of the Purchased Business Assets and the
Purchased Shares in the amount and to the extent that Purchaser reasonably believes it will receive
and actually utilize a credit generated for such payment from any relevant taxing authority and
that such credit will result in a reduction in Taxes actually payable by Purchaser during the
period including the Closing Date and ending at the end of the period including the third
anniversary of the Closing Date. To the extent Purchaser does not actually claim and utilize a
credit for such payment and experience a reduction in Taxes actually payable during the period
including the Closing Date and ending at the end of the period including the third anniversary of
the Closing Date, Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser for one-half of any such payment. For any
Transfer Taxes that are paid one-half by Sellers and one-half by Purchaser, Sellers and Purchaser
likewise shall share on a 50/50 basis any cash refunds of such shared Transfer Taxes actually
received by Purchaser or Seller prior to the third anniversary of the Closing as and when received.
The parties shall cooperate as reasonably requested in order to secure any such refunds or
credits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 2.05. <U>Closing</U>. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the sale and purchase of the Purchased Shares and the Purchased Business Assets
contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at a closing (the &#147;<U>Closing</U>&#148;) to be held at
the offices of Vinson &#038; Elkins L.L.P., 1001 Fannin, Houston, Texas 77002, on the last day of the
month following the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the obligations of the parties set
forth in Article&nbsp;VI, or at such other place or at such other date or time as Sellers and Purchaser
may mutually agree upon in writing (the day on which the Closing takes place being the &#147;<U>Closing
Date</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 2.06. <U>Allocation of Consideration</U>. The Purchase Price (together with Assumed
Liabilities to the extent the assumption thereof is treated as purchase price for applicable Tax
purposes) shall be allocated in the manner set forth on <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.06</U>. Purchaser and
Sellers shall use such allocations as the basis for reporting asset values and other items for
purposes of all Tax Returns. Purchaser and Sellers agree to treat and report (and, if necessary,
to cause each of their Affiliates to treat and report) the transactions provided for in this
Agreement in a manner consistent with <U>Schedule&nbsp;2.06</U>.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 2.07. <U>Assumption and Retention of Liabilities</U>. (a)&nbsp;The only liabilities and
obligations to be assumed by Purchaser or Cooper Cameron Valves Italy or assumed or retained by the
Purchased Business Companies with respect to the Business Assets and the Business are the following
liabilities and obligations of the Sellers, in each case as and to the extent such liabilities and
obligations relate to the Business (the &#147;<U>Assumed Liabilities</U>&#148;):



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(i)&nbsp;Subject to the terms of Sections&nbsp;5.18, 5.19 and 5.20, all obligations arising from
and after the Closing under customer, vendor and supplier contracts or open bids of the
Business held by and binding upon the Purchased Business Companies or included in the
Purchased Business Assets at the Closing that have been entered into in the ordinary course

indemnity rights under the 2001 Halliburton Agreement does not in any way restrict or limit
Sellers&#146; indemnification obligations under this Agreement except and to the extent as expressly
provided in this Agreement, if any. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that Sellers&#146; indemnitor
under the 2001 Halliburton Agreement or such indemnitor&#146;s agents (collectively, &#147;<U>Sellers&#146;
Indemnitor</U>&#148;) may undertake Environmental Activities at Covered Facilities in order to perform
and satisfy any or all of Sellers&#146; obligations under this Article&nbsp;VII and that Sellers&#146; Indemnitor
may exercise rights and undertake obligations of Seller under this Article&nbsp;VII in order to satisfy
any of Sellers&#146; obligations under this Article&nbsp;VII (such Covered Facilities that are subject to the
2001 Halliburton Agreement are those that were acquired from Halliburton Company and are listed on
Schedule&nbsp;3.11(a) and are referred to herein as &#147;<U>Covered Halliburton Facilities</U>&#148;).
Purchaser agrees that Purchaser Indemnitees and their Affiliates will not interfere with any
Environmental Activities undertaken by Sellers&#146; Indemnitor under the 2001 Halliburton Agreement and
Sellers&#146; Indemnitor&#146;s right to exclusive control of any Environmental Activities under the 2001
Halliburton Agreement, provided, that such activities shall not unreasonably interfere with the
operations of the Business as conducted from and after the Closing and shall not subject any
Purchaser Indemnitee to any Losses. Purchaser further agrees that it shall not use any Covered
Halliburton Facility for any residential, health care, childcare or school purposes, and upon the
transfer of any such Covered Halliburton Facility, Purchaser shall impose such restrictions on the
use of such Covered Halliburton Facility for residential, health care, childcare or school purposes
upon the transferee as a condition to the transfer. Purchaser further agrees and binds itself to
execute and file any and all documents restricting the use of such Covered Halliburton Facilities
as may be reasonably required to impose the foregoing use restrictions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(e)&nbsp;Purchaser acknowledges that, prior to the Closing Date, Sellers or Sellers&#146; Indemnitor (x)
have initiated Environmental Activities at the facility in Voghera, Italy and (y)&nbsp;may initiate
Environmental Activities at other Covered Facilities (in which event, Sellers shall notify
Purchaser in writing prior to the Closing) in each case as a result of Sellers&#146; obligations to
applicable Governmental Authorities, and that such Environmental Activities may continue after the
Closing Date. All such Environmental Activities shall be conducted by Sellers or Sellers&#146;
Indemnitor in a manner consistent with sound investigation and remediation practices and in a
manner that that does not unreasonably interfere with any operations of the Business from and after
the Closing or subject any Purchaser Indemnitee to any Losses. Subject to the foregoing, Purchaser
agrees and acknowledges as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(i)&nbsp;Any Environmental Activities conducted after the Closing Date in accordance with
this Article&nbsp;VII or continued from Environmental Activities prior to the Closing Date may
involve the filing of land use and deed restrictions, institutional and engineering
controls, groundwater use restrictions, soil management requirements, access and easement
rights, and restrictive covenants (including a prohibition against installation of water
wells on the Covered Facilities).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(ii)&nbsp;Purchaser shall at all times cooperate with Sellers and Sellers&#146; Indemnitor in
obtaining and maintaining any necessary documents, permits or conditions, and Purchaser
shall not take any action in contravention of such land use or deed restrictions or other
requirements.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(iii)&nbsp;With respect to any Environmental Activities:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:16%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(A)&nbsp;Sellers&#146; environmental obligations hereunder may include sampling and
excavating soil, the sampling, operation and maintenance of groundwater monitoring
and recovery wells, associated piping, groundwater pumping and treatment equipment
and other facilities or equipment;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:16%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(B)&nbsp;Prior to Sellers or Sellers&#146; Indemnitor conducting any Environmental
Activities on a Covered Site, Sellers shall deliver to Purchaser, a written notice
describing such proposed Environmental Activities in reasonable detail. To the
extent within its control, Seller will provide Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to
provide its input into the manner for conducting such Environmental Activities as to
assure that such Environmental Activities are conducted in compliance with the
provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.03. In addition, Sellers agree to and shall (i)
provide to the Purchaser, copies of all notices, filings, correspondence and reports
made or received by the Sellers and, to the extent available to the Sellers, by the
Sellers&#146; Indemnitor in connection with the Covered Sites promptly following delivery
or receipt of such items and (ii)&nbsp;from time to time, and as may be reasonably
requested by Purchaser, meet and consult with Purchaser on a regular basis to
discuss the status of ongoing actions involving the Covered Sites including
alternatives and strategy with respect thereto. Purchaser shall have the right,
upon request to Sellers, to review and audit all supporting documentation relating
to Environmental Activities taken by Sellers or Sellers&#146; Indemnitor relating to the
Covered Sites.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:16%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(C)&nbsp;Purchaser shall, without further compensation, costs or fees to Sellers,
grant and provide, after reasonable advance notice, all reasonable and necessary
access to Sellers, Sellers&#146; employees, agents, contractors, subcontractors,
indemnitors, representatives and Governmental Authority representatives to enter
onto the Covered Facilities after the Closing Date to undertake any Environmental
Activities; provided, that Sellers, jointly and severally, shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Purchaser from and against any and all Losses actually incurred by
any of Purchaser Indemnitees that arise out of and are proximately caused by any
Environmental Activities undertaken by or on behalf of Sellers or Sellers&#146;
Indemnitor at the Covered Facilities; and <U>provided</U> <U>further</U>, that
Sellers shall reimburse Purchaser Indemnitees for any and all increased costs
actually incurred by Purchaser as a result of any such Environmental Activities.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:16%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(D)&nbsp;Sellers&#146; rights of access to use the Covered Facilities to undertake any
Environmental Activities are non-exclusive and shall continue as long as is
necessary to complete any Environmental Activities.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(iv)&nbsp;Sellers shall indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser against any Losses arising out
of such rights of access, the entry of Sellers, Sellers&#146; Indemnitor or any their respective
Affiliates and their agents, representatives and invitees on to the Covered Facilities and
the conduct of Environmental Activities except for any such Losses that arise out of or
result from the negligence of Purchaser or any Persons acting on its behalf.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:8%; font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">(v)&nbsp;Sellers and Sellers&#146; Indemnitor shall take and shall cause their respective agents,
representatives and invitees to take all necessary precautions to avoid any damage to or
loss of any equipment or facilities owned or leased by any Purchaser Indemnitee or invitees,
as applicable, on the Covered Facilities in connection with the conduct of any Environmental
Activities, and shall pay for all damages to or loss of such equipment or facilities
resulting from any acts or omissions of the damaging party. In addition, Purchaser shall
use reasonable efforts to avoid damage to or loss of any equipment of Sellers or Sellers&#146;
Indemnitor, as applicable, on the Covered Sites which are used in conducting Environmental
Activities and shall pay for all damages to or loss of such equipment to the extent
resulting from any negligent actions by the Purchaser.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(f)&nbsp;Notwithstanding anything in this Article&nbsp;VII to the contrary, if Purchaser, by any
intentional act or an act of gross negligence, pursuant to which Purchaser&#146;s applicable facility
HS&#038;E director and applicable facility operations management should reasonably have known that such
action was likely to result in Sellers losing their rights to indemnity under the 2001 Halliburton
Agreement, causes any Seller to lose its rights to indemnification under the 2001 Halliburton
Agreement, Purchaser&#146;s recovery under this Article&nbsp;VII with respect to the Pre-Closing
Environmental Matters for which such Seller lost its indemnity rights under the 2001 Halliburton
Agreement shall be subject in all respects to, and limited by, the Deductible Amount and the
Liability Ceiling, and Sellers shall not have any liability for indemnification claims with respect
to Pre-Closing Environmental Matters for which any Seller lost its indemnity rights under the 2001
Halliburton Agreement unless a claim notice has been or is provided by Purchaser to Sellers prior
to the date that is the later of (i)&nbsp;five years following the Closing Date or (ii)&nbsp;the date on
which Sellers actually loses its right to indemnification under the 2001 Halliburton Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(g)&nbsp;This Article&nbsp;VII shall provide Purchaser&#146;s sole and exclusive remedy as against Sellers
with respect to Pre-Closing Environmental Matters. Except as set forth in this Article&nbsp;VII, (i)
Purchaser unconditionally releases Sellers from any and all Losses incurred in connection with
Pre-Closing Environmental Matters and (ii)&nbsp;Sellers unconditionally release Purchaser Indemnitees
from and against any and all Losses incurred in connection with Pre-Closing Environmental Matters.
Provided that Sellers are in material compliance with its obligations under this Article&nbsp;VII,
Purchaser hereby covenants and agrees that neither Purchaser nor any of their Affiliates will file
suit or bring any other claim against Sellers in connection with any Pre-Closing Environmental
Matters.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(h)&nbsp;Nothing herein shall be interpreted to prohibit, restrict or limit Purchaser from taking
any and all actions reasonably required under the circumstances to respond to any emergency
conditions which may arise at any of the Covered Sites to prevent or limit any acute or immediate
harm to human health or the environment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">(i)&nbsp;In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.03 and any other
provision of Article&nbsp;7, the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.03 shall control.

Purchaser will upon such termination be required to pay to Sellers a payment of $10,000,000 (the
&#147;<U>Liquidation Payment</U>&#148;) within five days following receipt or delivery of such termination
notice. Receipt of the Liquidation Payment shall be the sole remedy of Sellers in the event of a
termination of the Agreement as contemplated in Section&nbsp;8.01(a) and upon Purchaser making such
payment, Purchaser shall be fully released and discharged from any liability or obligation under,
resulting from or arising out of this Agreement and Sellers shall have no other remedy or cause of
action under or relating to this Agreement or other applicable Law. The Liquidation Payment shall
not be payable if there exists any breach or default by Sellers of its obligations under this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 8%">SECTION 8.04. <U>Waiver</U>. Either Sellers or Purchaser may (a)&nbsp;extend the time for the

waiver of the same term or condition, or a waiver of any other term or condition, of this
Agreement. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights hereunder shall not constitute a
waiver of any of such rights.
