Section 6.05. _Directors  and Officers Insurance_. On or before the Closing,

including in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the Merger,
and such insurance policy shall be on terms at least as favorable to the

Section 6.07. _Tax Matters_.

 



 

(a) _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(i) With respect to any Tax Returns that are to be filed after the Closing
Date, the Securityholder Representative shall engage the Companys existing
accountant, at its expense, to prepare all Tax Returns for the Company and the
Company Subsidiary that relate to a taxable period ending on or prior to the
Closing Date (collectively, the " ** _Company Tax Returns_** "). Such Company
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practice and
custom of the Company, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws. The
Securityholder Representative shall provide a copy of all such Company Tax
Returns at least fifteen (15) days before the anticipated filing date for
Parents review. The Securityholder

 



     

 

 



 

Representative shall consider in good faith comments received from Parent.
Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall timely file or cause to be timely
filed such Tax Returns.

 



 

(ii) Parent shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) at its expense all other
Tax Returns of the Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiary (" **
_Parent Tax Returns_** "), which returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past customs and practices employed by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, unless otherwise required by applicable
Laws. To the extent that a Parent Tax Return relates to a Straddle Period ("
** _Straddle Period Return_** "), Parent shall provide a copy of all such
Straddle Period Returns (together with the related work papers and supporting
information, including the allocation between the pre-Closing and post-Closing
portions of the Straddle Period (consistent with Straddle Period allocations
described in _Section 6.07(a)(iii)_)) to the Securityholder Representative at
least fifteen (15) prior to the anticipated filing date for the Securityholder
Representatives review and consent (not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned). The Securityholder Representative (or its designee) shall
review and comment on such Straddle Period Returns (including the Straddle
Period allocations) in good faith within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
If Securityholder Representative (or its designee) deliver comments in writing
to Parent within such period, Parent shall cause any such reasonable comments
to be reflected on such Straddle Period Returns unless such comments: (i) are
inconsistent with past practices of the Company; or (ii) are inconsistent with
applicable Laws as of the date the applicable Straddle Period Return is filed.
In the event of a disagreement concerning any Straddle Period Return
(including the Straddle Period allocations) or any comments made by
Securityholder Representative thereto pursuant to this _Section 6.07(a)(ii)_,
the Securityholder Representative and Parent shall use their respective good
faith efforts to resolve any disagreement in connection with such
Securityholder Representatives comments. In the event Parent and the
Securityholder Representative are unable to agree on any such revisions within
five (5) days after the Securityholder Representative provides its comments,
any such dispute with respect to such Tax Returns shall be resolved by a
nationally or regionally-recognized accounting firm mutually agreed upon by
Parent and the Securityholder Representative (the " ** _Accountant_** ") in a
final binding manner. Upon the final resolution of such disagreement, Parent
shall file such Straddle Period Returns promptly after such final
determination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
6.07(a)(ii)_, Parent shall be entitled to file such Straddle Period Returns
without having incorporated the disagreed upon changes to avoid a late filing
of such Straddle Period Returns. In the event the Accountants resolution of
the disagreement necessitates that a Straddle Period Return filed in
accordance with the previous sentence be amended, Parent shall cause an
amended Straddle Period Return to be filed that reflects such resolution. The
fees and expenses of the Accountant shall be borne equally by the Parent, on
the one hand, and the Former Securityholders (out of the Escrow Fund), on the
other hand.

 



 

(iii) _Straddle Period Allocations_. In the case of any Straddle Period, the
amount of any Taxes of the Company and/or any Company Subsidiary not based
upon or measured by income, activities, events, gain, receipts, proceeds,
profits, payroll or similar items for the portion of such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date will be deemed to be the amount of
such Taxes for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period.
The amount of any other Taxes that relate to the portion of such Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date

 



      

 

 



 

will be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close of
business on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that any item
determined on an annual or periodic basis (such as deductions for depreciation
or real estate Taxes) shall be apportioned on a daily basis. Parent, the
Company and the Securityholder Representative hereby agree, and shall take all
commercially reasonable actions necessary to ensure, that the taxable year of
the Company shall terminate at the close of business on the Closing Date for
U.S. federal income tax purposes and, to the extent permitted by applicable
Laws, for state and local tax purposes, and neither Parent, the Company,
Surviving Corporation, the Securityholder Representative, or any Affiliate of
the foregoing shall take any position contrary thereto, unless otherwise
required by a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the
Code.

 



 

(iv) Parent shall be indemnified for Pre-Closing Taxes as provided in _Section
8.02_.

 



 

(b) _Amendment of Tax Returns by Parent_. Without the prior written consent of
the Securityholder Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned, Parent shall not, with respect to the
Company: (i) file or amend any Tax Return with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period; (ii) amend any Straddle Period Returns that have been filed, except as
provided in _Section 6.07(a)(ii)_; or (iii) extend or waive any statute of
limitations or other period for the assessment of any Tax that relates to a
Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 



 

(c) _Tax Refunds_. Any refunds of or credits against Taxes in lieu of cash Tax
refunds (including any interest paid or credited with respect thereto)
received by the Company, any Company Subsidiary, Parent or the Surviving
Corporation (or Affiliates thereof) that are attributable to any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or the portion of any Straddle Period ending on and including the
Closing Date will be for the benefit of the Former Securityholders (" ** _Tax
Refunds_** "). Parent will pay (or cause to be paid) to the Securityholder
Representative any such Tax Refund actually received in cash by, or the value
of any credit available to the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates
as a result of the Surviving Corporation electing to receive such credit in
lieu of a cash Tax Refund, Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company, the
Company Subsidiary or the Surviving Corporation or any Affiliate thereof
within fifteen (15) days after the receipt or availability thereof.

 



 

(d) _Post-Closing Actions_. Parent covenants that it will not cause or permit
the Surviving Corporation or the Company Subsidiary: (i) to take any action on
or after the Closing Date that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any Tax liability of the Company (or the Company Subsidiary) or that would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any indemnity obligation in favor of
Parent under this Agreement; or (ii) make or change any Tax election, or take
any Tax Return position on any Tax Return, take any action, omit to take any
action or enter into any transaction, merger or restructuring that results in
any increased Tax liability of the Company in respect of any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or the pre-Closing portion of a Straddle Period.

 



 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. Parent shall be responsible for 50% and the Former
Securityholders shall be responsible for the remaining 50% of all transfer,
value-added, documentary, sales, excise, use, stamp, registration and other
such Taxes, and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other fees and
charges (including any penalties and interest) incurred

 



     

 

 



 

in connection with the consummation of the Transactions (collectively, the "
** _Transfer Taxes_** "), and Parent (at its expense) shall also file all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to all such
Transfer Taxes and, if required by applicable Laws or to the extent reasonably
requested, each party shall, cooperate in the preparation and filing and join
in the execution of any such Tax Returns and other documentation.

 



 

(f) _Cooperation and Records Retention_. The Securityholder Representative and
Parent shall (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to): (i) each
provide the other with such assistance as may reasonably be requested by any
of them in connection with the preparation or filing of any Tax Return, audit,
or other examination by any Taxing Authority or judicial or administrative
proceedings relating to liability for Taxes; (ii) each retain and provide the
other with any records or other information that may be relevant to such Tax
Return, audit or examination, proceeding, or determination; and (iii) each
provide the other with any final determination of any such audit or
examination, proceeding, or determination that affects any amount required to
be shown on any Tax Return of the other for any period. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
retain, until the applicable statutes of limitations (including any extensions
or tolling thereof) have expired, copies of all Tax Returns, supporting work
schedules, and other records or information that may be relevant to such
returns for all Tax periods or portions thereof ending before or including the
Closing Date and shall not destroy or otherwise dispose of any such records
without first providing Securityholder Representative with a reasonable
opportunity to review and copy the same.

 



 

Section 6.08. _Tax Controversies; Assistance and Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) In the event that any party receives notice from any Taxing Authority of
any proposed audit, claim, assessment or other dispute concerning an amount of
Taxes (a " ** _Tax Proceeding_** "), such party shall promptly notify the
other parties of such matter. Such notice shall contain factual information
(to the extent known) describing any asserted Tax liability in reasonable
detail and shall be accompanied by copies of any notice or other documents
received from any Taxing Authority with respect to such matter. If any party
receives written notice of an asserted Tax liability with respect to a matter
for which it has a right to reimbursement hereunder (and the other parties do
not have knowledge of the asserted Tax liability) and fails to provide the
other parties with prompt notice thereof after actual receipt of such written
notice and as a result such other parties are precluded from contesting the
asserted Tax liability in the applicable forum as a result of such failure to
notify, then such other parties shall be relieved of its obligations with
respect to such asserted Tax liability.

 



 

(b) The Securityholder Representative shall have the right (at its expense) to
control any Tax Proceeding that relates to any Pre-Closing Tax Period. The
Securityholder Representative shall control such Tax Proceeding in good faith
and with reasonable diligence thereafter to preserve its rights. Parent shall
be entitled to fully participate in any such Tax Proceeding and shall have the
right to consent to the settlement of any such Tax Proceeding (provided such
consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). In the case
that Parent controls such Tax Proceeding because the Securityholder
Representative conceded or loses its right to control such Tax Proceeding,
Parent shall act in good faith and the Securityholder Representative shall be
entitled to fully participate in any such Tax Proceeding

 



     

 

 



 

and shall have the right to consent to the settlement of any such Tax
Proceeding (provided such consent cannot be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). Parent shall control Tax Proceedings that relates to a Straddle
Period provided that it control such Tax Proceeding in good faith and with
reasonable diligence. The Securityholder Representative shall be entitled to
fully participate in any such Tax Proceeding and shall have the right to
consent to the settlement of any such Tax Proceeding (provided such consent
cannot be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

 



 

(c) The Surviving Corporation or Parent, as applicable, shall bear their
respective expenses incurred in connection with any Tax Proceeding and
Securityholder Representative (on behalf of the Former Securityholders) shall
bear its expenses incurred in connection with any such Tax Proceeding.

 



 

(d) To the extent that there are any inconsistencies between _Section 6.08_
and _Article VIII_, the provisions of _Section 6.08_ shall control.

suffered by the Parent Indemnified Parties

 



     

 

 



 

collectively exceeds $** (the " ** _Threshold Amount_** "), in which case the
Parent Indemnified Parties shall only be entitled to recover for Losses in
excess of the Threshold Amount; _provided_ that the Threshold Amount shall not
apply with respect to Losses (A) for any breach or inaccuracy of any
Fundamental Representation or (B) in the case of Fraud;

 



 

(ii) the aggregate amount of all payments to which the Parent Indemnified
Parties shall be entitled to receive under _Section 8.02(a)(i)_ or _Section

_plus_ (B) the Additional Escrow Amount if (and only if) a Milestone Payment
is made pursuant to _Section 3.01_; _provided_ , _however_ , that (A) the
foregoing cap shall not apply to any Losses for any breach or inaccuracy of
any Fundamental Representation and (B) the Parent Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to set-off from the first Milestone Payment an amount equal to the
Additional Escrow Amount if the first Milestone is achieved after the Escrow

(iv) in no event shall a Parent Indemnified Party be permitted to seek any
recovery for consequential, exemplary, special, speculative or punitive
damages, regardless of the theory of recovery, except to the extent awarded to
a third party;

 



 

(v) each Parent Indemnified Party shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to mitigate any Losses for which it is entitled to indemnification
pursuant to _Section 8.02_; and

of one or more other representations, warranties, covenants or agreements to
the extent that any Parent Indemnified Party has been compensated for such
matter pursuant to a separate indemnity claim for a breach of one or more
other representations, warranties, covenants or agreements giving rise to the
same or duplicative damages.

 



 

(b) _Source and Order of Recovery_.

 



 

(i) From and after the Closing, if there is determined to be any amount owing
to a Parent Indemnified Party as a result of indemnification under _Section

remaining funds in the Escrow Fund, (B) second, the Parent Indemnified Parties
shall be entitled to set-off from any Milestone Payment due pursuant to
_Section 3.01_ (subject to the limitations of _Section 8.03(a)_); and (C)
third, after the Escrow Fund has been fully exhausted and the set-off from any
applicable Milestone Payment has been made, any additional amount shall be
recovered directly from the Former Securityholders, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article VIII_, pursuant to _Section 8.03(b)(ii)_.

  ** This portion has been redacted pursuant to a confidential treatment
request.

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) From and after the Closing, if there is determined to be any amount owing
to a Parent Indemnified Party as a result of indemnification under _Section
8.02_ and such amount is required to be paid by the Former Securityholders,
each Former Securityholder shall be required to pay an amount equal to its Pro
Rata Indemnity Percentage of the amount owing to a Parent Indemnified Party as
a result of indemnification under _Section 8.02_, subject to the limitations
set forth in this _Article VIII_.

 



 

(c) _Exclusive Remedy_. Following the Effective Time, except for claims for
equitable relief pursuant to _Section 11.06_ or for Fraud, the
indemnification provisions of this _Article VIII_ shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Parent Indemnified Parties, whether in contract, tort
or otherwise, for all matters arising out of or relating to the Merger, this
Agreement and the Transactions (or in any certificate, schedule or other
instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement), including for any inaccuracy
or breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement set forth
herein. For the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 8.03(c)_ will not prevent
or limit a cause of action to obtain an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of any covenants set forth in this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof in accordance with _Section
11.06_.

 



 

Section 8.04. _Claims for Escrow Recovery and Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) If any Legal Proceeding is commenced or threatened that may give rise to a
claim for indemnification (a " ** _Claim_** ") by any Parent Indemnified Party
for a matter involving a third party, then such Parent Indemnified Party shall
promptly, and in any event within twenty (20) days after receiving written
notice of any third party Claim or Legal Proceeding, (i) notify the
Securityholder Representative and (ii) deliver to the Securityholder
Representative a written notice (such written notice, a " ** _Third Party
Claim Notice_** ") (A) describing in reasonable detail the nature of the Legal
Proceeding to the extent known, (B) including a copy of all papers served with
respect to such Legal Proceeding, (C) including the Parent Indemnified Partys
good faith estimate of the amount of Losses that may arise from such Legal
Proceeding, to the extent known, and (D) describing in reasonable detail, to
the extent known, the basis for the Parent Indemnified Partys request for
indemnification under this Agreement. Failure to notify the Securityholder
Representative in accordance with this _Section 8.04(a)_ will not relieve the
Former Securityholders or any other party of any liability that it may have to
the Parent Indemnified Party, except to the extent (but only to the extent
that) (1) the defense of such Legal Proceeding is materially prejudiced by the
Parent Indemnified Partys failure to give such notice or (2) the Parent
Indemnified Party fails to notify the Securityholder Representative of such
Claim in accordance with _Section 8.04(a)_ or prior to the end of the
applicable survival period.

 



 

(b) The Securityholder Representative may elect, within thirty (30) days after
receipt of the Third Party Claim Notice, upon written notice to the Parent
Indemnified Party, to assume and thereafter conduct the defense of any Legal
Proceeding subject to any such Claim with counsel of the Securityholder
Representatives choice (at its expense). In the event the Securityholder
Representative elects to assume and conduct the defense of any such Legal
Proceeding in accordance with this _Section 8.04(b)_, (A) the Securityholder
Representative (i) will have the right to settle or compromise any such Legal
Proceeding, subject to the terms hereof, (ii) shall conduct the defense of
such Legal Proceeding in good faith and with reasonable diligence and keep
each Parent Indemnified Party reasonably informed of material developments

 



     

 

 



 

in the Legal Proceeding at all stages thereof and promptly submit to each
Parent Indemnified Party copies of all legal documentation received or filed
in connection therewith, and (iii) will acknowledge that the applicable Parent
Indemnified Parties are entitled to indemnification under, but subject to the
limitations in, this _Article VIII_ with respect to such Legal Proceeding and
(B) each Parent Indemnified Party shall reasonably cooperate with the conduct
of such defense by the Securityholder Representative and the settlement of
such Legal Proceeding by the Securityholder Representative; provided, however,
that the Securityholder Representative will not approve of the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Legal
Proceeding unless the Securityholder Representative has obtained Parent
Indemnified Partys prior written approval (which approval must not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless (x) the terms of such
settlement involves solely money damages having a value less than the
remaining amount of the funds in the Escrow Fund and provides for a complete
and unconditional release of the claims, obligations and liabilities that are
the subject of such Legal Proceeding in favor of the Parent Indemnified Party,
and (y) such settlement or compromise does not involve any finding or
admission or any violation of Laws or admission of any wrongdoing by the
Parent Indemnified Party. To the extent the defense of any Legal Proceeding
subject to any Claim is properly assumed by the Securityholder Representative
in accordance with this _Section 8.04(b)_, the costs and expenses of such
defense of, and any payment in respect of, any Legal Proceeding, including any
settlement thereof, shall be paid by the Securityholder Representative (on
behalf of the Former Securityholders). The Parent Indemnified Party shall have
the right to participate in the defense of any Legal Proceeding with counsel
selected by it subject to the Securityholder Representatives right to control
the defense thereof. The fees and disbursements of such counsel shall be at
the expense of the Parent Indemnified Party, provided, that if in the
reasonable opinion of counsel to the Parent Indemnified Party, there exists a
conflict of interest between Former Securityholders and the Parent Indemnified
Party that cannot be waived, then the Securityholder Representative shall be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one (1) counsel to the Parent
Indemnified Parties.

 



 

(c) If the Securityholder Representative does not, within thirty (30) days
after receiving the Third Party Claim Notice: (i) give written notice to the
Parent Indemnified Party of its election to assume the defense of the Legal
Proceeding or Legal Proceedings subject to such Claim, and (ii) thereafter
promptly assume such defense, then the Parent Indemnified Party may conduct
the defense and settlement of such Legal Proceeding in good faith and with
reasonable diligence and keep the Securityholder Representative reasonably
informed of material developments in the Legal Proceeding at all stages
thereof and promptly submit to the Securityholder Representative copies of all
legal documentation received or filed in connection therewith; provided, that
the Parent Indemnified Party will not agree to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement or compromise with respect to such Legal Proceeding
or Legal Proceedings without the prior written consent of the Securityholder
Representative (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned).

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Securityholder Representative shall not
be entitled to assume or continue to assume the defense of any third party
Claim (which third party Claim shall be controlled by the Parent Indemnified
Party unless otherwise consented to in writing by the Parent Indemnified
Party) if (i) the Claim seeks injunctive or equitable relief against the
Parent Indemnified Party (or any Subsidiary of the Parent Indemnified Party),
(ii) the Claim involves a criminal Legal Proceeding, indictment, allegation or
investigation of or against

 



      

 

 



 

a Parent Indemnified Party, or (iii) the Claim has a reasonable likelihood of
resulting in Losses that would exceed the balance remaining in the Escrow
Fund.

 



 

(e) If any Parent Indemnified Party has a Claim under this _Article VIII_
against any Former Securityholder that does not involve a third party Claim,
then such Parent Indemnified Party shall promptly (i) notify the
Securityholder Representative and (ii) deliver to the Securityholder
Representative a written notice (A) describing in reasonable detail the nature
of the circumstances giving rise to the Claim, to the extent known, (B)
including the Parent Indemnified Partys good faith estimate of the amount of
Losses that may arise from such circumstances, to the extent known, and (C)
describing in reasonable detail, to the extent known, the basis for the Parent
Indemnified Partys request for indemnification under this Agreement. Failure
to notify the Securityholder Representative in accordance with this _Section
8.04(e)_ will not relieve the Former Securityholders of any liability that it
may have to the Parent Indemnified Party, except to the extent (1) the defense
of such Claim is materially and adversely prejudiced by the Parent Indemnified
Partys failure to give such notice or (2) the Parent Indemnified Party fails
to notify the Securityholder Representative of such Claim in accordance with
this _Section 8.04(e)_ on or prior to the end of the applicable survival
period.

 



 

(f) At the reasonable request of the Securityholder Representative, Parent
shall (and shall cause each Parent Indemnified Party to) grant the
Securityholder Representative and its authorized Representatives all
reasonable access to the books, records, employees and properties of such
Parent Indemnified Party to the extent reasonably related to the matters to
which the applicable Claim relates, in each case other than to the extent
necessary to preserve attorney-client privilege. All such access shall be
granted during normal business hours and shall be granted under the conditions
that shall not unreasonably interfere with the business and operations of such
Parent Indemnified Party.

 



 

Section 8.05. _Indemnification of Former Securityholders_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing, and subject to _Section 8.05(b)_, the Former
Securityholders, and each of their respective successors and permitted assigns
(collectively, the " ** _Former Securityholders Indemnified Parties_** "),
shall be indemnified and held harmless by Parent for all Losses incurred or
suffered by the Former Securityholders Indemnified Parties, directly or
indirectly, as a result of the following:

 



 

(i) any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of Parent or
Merger Sub contained in this Agreement or in any certificate, schedule or
other instrument delivered by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement;
and

 



 

(ii) any failure by Parent to perform, comply with, satisfy and discharge any
covenant, agreement or obligation contained in this Agreement and applicable
to Parent or Merger Sub, including any failure by Parent to pay any Milestone
Payment or Net Sales Payment as required by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Any decision to make any claim for indemnification pursuant to _Section
8.05(a)_ or to settle or dismiss any claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 8.05(a)_ shall be made by the Securityholder Representative in
accordance with the terms of _Article IX_.

the Former Securityholders as provided herein and in the Allocation Schedule
and the Escrow Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Securityholder

former employees of the Company, then such amounts shall be remitted by the

Former Securityholder through the Surviving Corporations payroll procedures
after applicable withholding. If the Securityholder Representative determines,
in its sole discretion, that any remaining portion of the Representative

shall affect the right of any party to this Agreement to serve process in any
other manner permitted by Law.

 



 

(c) _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY
CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE
COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF
ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE SUCH WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER

Section 11.06. _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
hereto will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy.
The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of
the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the
parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

 



 

Section 11.07. _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_.

 



 

(a) _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (together with the Annexes, Exhibits
and Company Disclosure Letter) contains the entire agreement among the parties
hereto with respect to the Merger and the Transactions and the subject matter
of this Agreement and supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both
written and oral, among the parties, or any of them, with respect to these
matters. Each party hereto has participated in the drafting of this Agreement,
which each party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between
the parties. In the

 



     

 

 



 

event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party
by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

(b) _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to, and
does not, confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any legal or
equitable rights or remedies, except for (i) the right of the holders of
Company Stock, Company Options and the Company Warrant to receive, from and
after the Effective Time, the consideration which they are entitled to receive
pursuant to _Article II_ and (ii) the provisions of _Article VIII_ of this
Agreement which are intended to be for the benefit of the Parent Indemnified
Parties covered thereby and may be enforced by such Parent Indemnified Parties
after the Effective Time.

 



 

Section 11.08. _Severability_. If any term or provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any applicable Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nonetheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic and legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the
end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 11.09. _Interpretation_. When a reference is made in this Agreement to
an Article or to a Section, Subsection, Exhibit or Schedule, such reference
shall be to an Article of, a Section or Subsection of, or an Exhibit or
Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference purposes only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
The words "include", "includes" and "including" shall be deemed to be followed
by the words "without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and
"hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this Agreement shall
refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular provision of this
Agreement. The term "or" shall be deemed to mean "and/or". All terms defined
in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any certificate
or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless otherwise defined
therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are applicable to the
singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to the masculine as
well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any agreement,
instrument or statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or
instrument that is referred to herein shall mean such agreement, instrument or
statute as from time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in
the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case
of statutes) by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to
all attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a
Person are also to its permitted successors and assigns. References to
monetary amounts are to the lawful currency of the United States. References
to days mean calendar days unless otherwise specified.

 



 

Section 11.10. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except otherwise

 



     

 

 



 

as provided herein and except that Merger Sub may assign any of its rights and
obligations hereunder to Parent or one or more direct or indirectly wholly-
owned Subsidiaries of Parent so long as such assignment does not prevent or
impair the satisfaction of any of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
or delay consummation of the Merger; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
assignment shall relieve either Parent or Merger Sub of their obligations
hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding
upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties and their
respective successors and assigns.

 



 

Section 11.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in multiple
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original and all of which
together shall constitute one instrument. Counterparts may be delivered via
facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature
complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, e.g., www.docusign.com) or
other transmission method and any counterpart so delivered shall be deemed to
have been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all
purposes.
