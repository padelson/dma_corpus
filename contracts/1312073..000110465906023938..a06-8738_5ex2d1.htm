 _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

  



  

AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (hereinafter called this " _ _Agreement__ "),
dated as of April 10, 2006, among LIPMAN ELECTRONIC ENGINEERING LTD., an
Israeli company (" _ _Lipman__ "), VERIFONE HOLDINGS, INC., a Delaware
corporation (" _ _VeriFone__ "), and LION ACQUISITIONS LTD., an Israeli
company and a wholly-owned subsidiary of VeriFone (" _ _Merger Sub__ ," Lipman
and Merger Sub sometimes being hereinafter collectively referred to as the "
_ _Constituent Corporations__ ").

  



  

RECITALS

  



  

WHEREAS, upon the terms and subject to the conditions of the Agreement and in
accordance with Sections 314-327 of the Israeli Companies Law, 5759-1999 (the
" _ _Israeli Companies Law__ "), VeriFone, Merger Sub and Lipman intend to
effect the merger of Merger Sub with and into Lipman, pursuant to which
Merger Sub will cease to exist and Lipman will become a wholly-owned
subsidiary of VeriFone; and

  



  

WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of VeriFone, Merger Sub
and Lipman have approved the merger of Merger Sub with and into Lipman (the "
_ _Merger__ ") upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement and have approved and declared advisable this Agreement; and

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to VeriFones willingness to enter into
this Agreement, each of the Lipman shareholders identified in Schedule R-1
has entered into a Voting Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
A and the shareholders identified in Schedule R-2 have entered into
an Investment Agreement in the form attached as Exhibit B; and

  



  

WHEREAS, prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and as a
further condition and inducement to VeriFones willingness to enter into
this Agreement, each of the individuals identified in Schedule R-3 has
(except as described therein) signed a term sheet regarding employment in
form and substance satisfactory to VeriFone and it is expected that each of
the individuals identified in Schedule R-5 will enter into an Employment
Letter (the " _ _Employment Letter__ ") as promptly as possible after the
date of this Agreement;

  



  

WHEREAS, prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, each of the
VeriFone stockholders identified in Schedule R-4 has entered into a Voting
Agreement in the form attached hereto as Exhibit C;

        
   

  



  

WHEREAS, because VeriFone believes that Lipman has a surplus of cash,
which VeriFone does not desire to acquire as part of the Merger (the " _
_Unwanted Assets__ "), the parties intend that after the date the Requisite
Vote (as defined below) is obtained and prior to the Effective Time (as
defined below), Lipman will declare and pay the Special Cash Dividend (as
defined below), in an aggregate amount of not less than $23 million; and

  



  

WHEREAS, Lipman, VeriFone and Merger Sub desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with this
Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

# ARTICLE I _ 
  
 The Merger; Closing; Effective Time_

  

# 

  

## 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3) and
subject to and upon the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
applicable provisions of the Israeli Companies Law, Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into Lipman in accordance with Section 323 of the Israeli
Companies Law, and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub shall
thereupon cease. Lipman shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _ _Surviving Corporation__ "), and
the separate corporate existence of Lipman with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by
the Merger in accordance with the Israeli Companies Law.

  

## 

  

## 1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between Lipman
and VeriFone, the closing for the Merger (the " _ _Closing__ ") shall take
place, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, at the offices
of Sullivan and Cromwell, 125 Broad Street, New York, New York 10004, at a time
and date to be designated by the parties (the " _ _Closing Date__ ") which
shall be no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or
waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) or at such
other time, date and location as the parties hereto shall mutually agree.
For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _business day__ " shall mean
any day ending at 11:59 p.m. (Eastern Time) other than a Friday, Saturday or
Sunday or a day on which banks are required or authorized to close in The
City of New York or in the State of Israel.

  



        
   

  



  

## 1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than those
conditions that by their nature may only be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions), Merger Sub shall,
in coordination with Lipman, deliver (and VeriFone shall cause Merger Sub to
deliver) to the Registrar of Companies of the State of Israel (the " _
_Companies Registrar__ ") a notice informing the Companies Registrar of such
fact and the proposed date of the Closing and requesting the Companies
Registrar to issue a certificate evidencing the completion of the Merger in
accordance with Section 323(5) of the Israeli Companies Law (the " _ _Merger
Certificate__ ") after notice that the Closing has occurred. The Merger shall
become effective upon the issuance by the Companies Registrar, after the
Closing, of the Merger Certificate (the " _ _Effective Time__ ").

  

## 

  

# ARTICLE II 
  
  _Memorandum of Association 
 of the Surviving Corporation_

  



  

## 2.1. _The Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association_. The
parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that Articles of
Association of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the articles of association of the Surviving Corporation (the "
_ _Charter__ "), until duly amended as provided therein or by applicable law,
subject to Section 6.18(d).

  

## 

  

# ARTICLE III 
  
  _Officers and Directors 
 of the Surviving Corporation_

  

# 

  

## 3.1. _Directors_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that the board of directors of Merger Sub at the Effective Time shall, from
and after the Effective Time, be the directors of the Surviving Corporation
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Charter.

  

## 

  

## 3.2. _Officers_. The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so
that from and after the Effective Time, the individuals designated by
VeriFone, after consultation with Lipman, not later than 10 days prior to the
Closing Date shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their
successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or until their
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the Charter.

  



        
   

  



  

# ARTICLE IV 
  
  _Effect of the Merger on Capital Stock; 
 Exchange of Certificates_

  

# 

  

## 4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of Lipman:

  

## 

  

### (a) _Merger Consideration_. Subject to the allocation, proration and
election procedures in Section 4.2, each Ordinary Share, par value NIS 1 per
share, of Lipman (a " _ _Share__ " or collectively, the " _ _Shares__ ")
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Shares owned by VeriFone, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly-
owned subsidiary of VeriFone and Shares that are owned by Lipman or any
direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Lipman, in each case not
held on behalf of third parties (each, an " _ _Excluded Share__ " and
collectively, " _ _Excluded Shares__ "), shall be converted into, and become
exchangeable for the following (the " _ _Merger Consideration__ "):
a combination of cash and shares of VeriFone Common Stock, par value
$0.01 per share (the " _ _VeriFone Common Stock__ ") consisting of 0.5
shares (the " _ _Exchange Ratio__ ") of VeriFone Common Stock (the " _
_Stock Consideration__ ") plus an amount in cash (the " _ _Cash
Consideration__ " and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _ _Mixed
Consideration__ ") determined as described below. Each Lipman shareholder
will be entitled to and given the opportunity to elect to receive, in lieu of
the Mixed Consideration described in the prior sentence, for each Share
either (i) an amount in cash determined as described below (the " _ _Cash
Election Consideration__ ") or (ii) the fraction of one share of VeriFone
Common Stock (the " _ _Stock Election Consideration__ ") as determined below,
subject to the proration and allocation provisions of Section 4.2 which are
intended to provide that any election by a holder of Shares to receive Cash
Election Consideration is given effect only to the extent of offsetting
elections by other holders to receive Stock Election Consideration. The Cash
Consideration per Share will be determined as the difference between (i)
$14.304 minus (ii) (A) the aggregate amount of the Special Dividend divided
by (B) the number of Shares issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time
(the result of clause (A) divided by clause (B) is hereinafter referred to as
the " _ _Per Share Special Dividend__ ") and the Cash Election Consideration
per Share (the " _ _Per Share Cash Election Consideration__ ") will be
determined as the difference between (i) $29.07 minus (ii) (A) the Per Share
Special Dividend. The Stock Election Consideration per Share will be
determined as the product of (1) one, multiplied by (2) the quotient of (x)
29.07 minus the absolute amount of the Per Share Special Dividend, divided by
(y) 29.53. Following the Effective Time, each certificate (a " _
_Certificate__ ") representing any of such Shares (other than Excluded
Shares) and non-certificated Shares (other than Excluded Shares) represented
by book entry (a " _ _Book-Entry Share__ ") shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of VeriFone Common Stock pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and any dividends
or other distributions pursuant to Section 4.2(c).

  



        
   

  



  

### (b) _Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall remain outstanding and
no Merger Consideration shall be delivered with respect thereof.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Merger Sub_. At the Effective Time, each Ordinary Share, par value
NIS 1 per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted into one Ordinary Share, par value NIS
1 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

## 4.2. _Exchange for Shares_.

  

## 

  

### (a) _Allocation_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary (i) the aggregate Cash Consideration to be delivered in the Merger
(the " _ _Aggregate Cash Consideration__ ") shall be equal to the product
of (A) $14.304 times (B) the number of Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding the number of
Excluded Shares), less the aggregate amount of the Special Dividend and (ii)
the aggregate number of VeriFone Shares to be issued in the Merger (the " _
_Aggregate Stock Consideration__ ") shall be equal to the product of (i) 0.5
times (ii) the number of Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time of the Merger (excluding the number of Excluded Shares).
To the extent that, as a result of any elections made by Lipman shareholders
pursuant to the penultimate sentence of Section 4.1(a), the Aggregate Cash
Consideration and Aggregate Stock Consideration would not meet the
requirements set forth in the preceding sentence, such elections will be
subject to the election procedures set forth in Section 4.2(b).

  

### 

  

### (b) _Election Procedures_.

  

### 

  

#### (i) Prior to the Effective Time, VeriFone shall, after consultation with
Lipman, appoint a bank or trust company that maintains offices in Israel and
the United States to act as exchange agent (the " _ _Exchange Agent__ ") for
the exchange of the Merger Consideration following the Effective Time
upon surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof
as provided in Section 4.2(g)) or Book-Entry Shares. At or prior to the
Effective Time, VeriFone shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with
the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Shares, (A)
certificates representing the shares of VeriFone Common Stock aggregating to
the Aggregate Stock Consideration, (B) cash necessary for the Aggregate Cash
Consideration, (C) cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of
fractional shares of VeriFone Common Stock to which holders of Shares may be
entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(e), and (D) any dividends and distributions
to which holders of Shares may be entitled pursuant to Section 4.2(c) (such
cash and certificates for shares of VeriFone Common Stock, being hereinafter
referred to as the " _ _Exchange Fund__ "). With respect to the amount of
cash to be deposited as of the Effective Time to satisfy its obligations
under Section 4.2(e), Parent shall only be required to make a reasonable
estimate of the amount of such cash that will be necessary. In the event that
the cash and VeriFone Common Stock in the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient
to satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made

  



        
   

  



  

by the Exchange Agent pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant
to Sections 4.2(c) and 4.2 (e)), VeriFone shall promptly make available to
the Exchange Agent the amounts of cash or VeriFone Common Stock so required
to satisfy such payment obligations in full. The Exchange Agent shall invest
the Exchange Fund as directed by VeriFone, _provided_ that such
investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of
America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by
Moodys Investor Services, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation,
respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or
bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1 billion.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investment shall become a
part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
under Section 4.1(a) shall be promptly returned to VeriFone. Following the
Effective Time, subject to surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section 4.2(g)) or the Book-Entry Shares,
the Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
any fractional shares of VeriFone Common Stock and any dividends or
distributions contemplated to be paid in respect of the Shares (other than
the Special Cash Dividend) pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange
Fund. Exchange of any Book-Entry Shares shall be effected in accordance with
VeriFones customary procedures with respect to securities represented by
book-entry. Except as contemplated in this Agreement, the Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any other purpose.

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) Subject to allocation and proration in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 4.2, each record holder of Shares (other than
Excluded Shares) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Election
Deadline (as defined below) shall be entitled (A) to elect to receive in
respect of each such Share (x) Cash Election Consideration (a " _ _Cash
Election__ "), or (y) Mixed Consideration (a "Mixed _ _Election__ ") or (z)
Stock Election Consideration (a " _ _Stock Election__ ") or (B) to indicate
that such record holder has no preference as to the receipt of Cash
Consideration, Mixed Consideration or Stock Consideration for such Shares (a
" _ _Non-Election__ "). Shares in respect of which a Non-Election is made
(including shares in respect of which such an election is deemed to have been
made pursuant to this Section 4.2 (the " _ _Non-Election Shares__ ")) shall
be deemed by VeriFone, in its sole and absolute discretion, subject to
Section 4.2(b)(v), to be, in whole or in part, Shares in respect of which a
Cash Election, a Mixed Election or a Stock Election has been made.

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) Elections pursuant to Section 4.2(b)(ii) shall be made on a form
and with such other provisions to be reasonably agreed upon by Lipman and
VeriFone (a " _ _Form of Election__ ") to be provided by the Exchange Agent
for that purpose to holders of record of Shares (other than holders of
Excluded Shares), together with appropriate transmittal materials and a
declaration form in which the holder of record states whether the holder is a
resident of Israel as defined in the Israeli Income Tax Ordinance
[New Version], 1961, as amended (the " _ _Ordinance__ "), at the time of
mailing to holders of record of Shares of the Prospectus/Proxy Statement (as
defined in Section 6.3(a)) and including any other declarations that may be
required for Israeli Tax

  



        
   

  



  

purposes. VeriFone shall use commercially reasonable efforts to provide that
the Form of Election and any applicable transmittal materials will, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, provide that such form and materials
may be executed jointly by two or more holders of record with instructions as
to the distribution of the Merger Consideration among such holders of record.
Elections shall be made by mailing to the Exchange Agent a duly completed
Form of Election. To be effective, a Form of Election must be (x)
properly completed, signed and submitted to the Exchange Agent at its
designated office, by 5:00 p.m., on the business day prior to the date of the
Lipman Shareholders Meeting (as defined in Section 6.5) (the " _ _Election
Deadline__ ") and (y) (A) accompanied by the Certificate(s) representing the
Shares as to which the election is being made (or by an appropriate guarantee
of delivery of such Certificate(s) by a financial institution reasonably
acceptable to the Exchange Agent, _provided_  that such Certificates are in
fact delivered to the Exchange Agent within three trading days after the date
of execution of such guarantee of delivery); or (B) in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, any additional documents required by the procedures set forth in the
Form of Election. If the Lipman Shareholders Meeting is delayed, the Election
Deadline will be similarly delayed and VeriFone will promptly announce the
rescheduled Election Deadline. A holder of record of Shares holding such
Shares as nominee or in another representative capacity may submit separate
Forms of Election for each beneficial owner on whose behalf such Shares are
held. Lipman shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make a Form of
Election available to all Persons who become holders of record of Shares
(other than Excluded Shares) between the date of mailing described in the
first sentence of this Section 4.2(b)(iii) and the date that is three
business days prior to the Election Deadline. VeriFone shall determine, in
its sole and absolute discretion, which authority it may delegate in whole or
in part to the Exchange Agent and whether Forms of Election have been
properly completed, signed and submitted or revoked. The decision of VeriFone
(or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be) in such matters shall
be conclusive and binding. Neither VeriFone nor the Exchange Agent will be
under any obligation to notify any Person of any defect in a Form of
Election submitted to the Exchange Agent. A holder of Shares that does not
submit an effective Form of Election prior to the Election Deadline shall be
deemed to have made a Non-Election. For the purposes of this Agreement, the
term " _ _Person__ " shall mean any individual, corporation (including not-
for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture, estate, trust, association, organization, Governmental Entity (as
defined in Section 5.1(d)(i)) or other entity of any kind or nature.

  

#### 

  

#### (iv) An election may be revoked, but only by written notice received by
the Exchange Agent prior to the Election Deadline. Any Certificate(s)
representing Shares that have been submitted to the Exchange Agent in
connection with an election shall be returned to the holder thereof in the
event such election is revoked as aforesaid and such holder requests in
writing the return of such Certificate(s). Upon any such revocation, such
Shares shall be Non-Election Shares unless and until a duly completed Form of
Election is thereafter properly submitted. In the event that this Agreement
is terminated pursuant to the provisions hereof and any Shares have been
transmitted to

  



        
   

  



  

the Exchange Agent pursuant to the provisions hereof, such Shares
shall promptly be returned to the Person submitting the same.

  

#### 

  

#### (v) (A) Each Share for which a Cash Election has been made and not
revoked or lost pursuant to Section 4.2(g) (each, a " _ _Cash Election
Share__ ") shall be converted (provided that the Available Cash Election
Amount (as defined below) equals or exceeds the Cash Election Amount (as
defined below)) into the right to receive the Per Share Cash Election
Consideration in cash without interest; _provided_ , _however_ , that if (A)
the product of the number of Cash Election Shares and the Per Share Cash
Election Consideration (such product being the " _ _Cash Election Amount__
") exceeds (B) the difference between (x) the product of the Cash
Consideration and the total number of Shares (other than the Excluded Shares)
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time minus (y) the
product of the number of Shares with respect to which an election to receive
the Mixed Election has been effectively made and not revoked or lost pursuant
to Section 4.2(g) (each, a " _ _Mixed Consideration Election Shares__ ")
(provided that Non-Election Shares shall be deemed to be Mixed Consideration
Election Shares for purposes of this Section 4.2(b)(v)) and the Cash
Consideration (such difference being the " _ _Available Cash Election Amount__
"), then each Cash Election Share shall be converted into a right to receive
(1) an amount of cash (without interest) equal to the product of (p) the
Per Share Cash Election Consideration and (q) a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the Available Cash Election Amount and the denominator of
which shall be the Cash Election Amount (such fraction being the " _
_Cash Fraction__ ") and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and non-
assessable shares of VeriFone Common Stock equal to the product of (r)
the Allocation Ratio and (s) one (1) minus the Cash Fraction, _provided_
that the Aggregate Cash Consideration issued as a result of the Merger,
together with the cash amounts to be paid pursuant to Section 4.2(e), shall
be determined as provided in Section 4.2(a); and

  

#### 

  

##### (B) Each Stock Election that is properly made and not revoked or lost
pursuant to Section 4.2(g) (each, a " _ _Stock Election Share__ ") shall be
converted (provided that the Cash Election Amount equals or exceeds the
Available Cash Election Amount), into the right to receive a number, equal to
the Exchange Ratio, of validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
shares of VeriFone Common Stock (together with any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of VeriFone Common Stock to be paid pursuant to Section 4.2(e), the "
_ _Per Share Stock Consideration__ "); provided however, if the Available
Cash Election Amount exceeds the Cash Election Amount, then each Stock
Election Share shall be converted into the right to receive (1) an amount of
cash (without interest) equal to the amount of such excess divided by the
number of Stock Election Shares together with the cash amounts to be paid
pursuant to Section 4.2(e) and (2) a number of validly issued, fully paid and
non-assessable shares of VeriFone Common stock equal to the product of (x)
the Allocation Ratio and (y) a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the
Per Share Cash Election Consideration minus the amount calculated in clause
(1) of this paragraph and the denominator of which shall be the Per Share
Cash Election Consideration; _provided_ , that the aggregate number of Shares
issued in the Merger shall be determined as provided Schedule 4.2(a). For
purposes of this Section 4.2(b)(v), the

  



        
   

  



  

" _ _Allocation Ratio__ " means the quotient of (A) the difference between
(x) $29.07 minus (y) the Per Share Special Dividend, divided by (B) $29.53.

  

##### 

  

#### (vi) The Exchange Agent, in consultation with VeriFone, shall make all
computations to give effect to this Section 4.2.

  

#### 

  

### (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of
VeriFone Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed
issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and whenever a dividend or
other distribution is declared by VeriFone in respect of the VeriFone Common
Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that
declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in respect of all
shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement. No dividends or other
distributions in respect of the VeriFone Common Stock shall be paid to any
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share until such
Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(g)) or Book-Entry Share is surrendered for exchange in accordance with
this Article IV. Subject to the effect of applicable laws, following
surrender of any such Certificate (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) or Book-Entry Share, there shall be issued and/or
paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole shares of VeriFone
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, (A) at the time
of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore payable with respect to such whole
shares of VeriFone Common Stock and not paid and (B) at the appropriate
payment date, the dividends or other distributions payable with respect to
such whole shares of VeriFone Common Stock with a record date after the
Effective Time but with a payment date subsequent to surrender.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of Lipman of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, no fractional shares of VeriFone Common Stock will be issued and
any holder of Shares entitled to receive a fractional share of VeriFone
Common Stock but for this Section 4.2(e) shall be entitled to receive an
amount in cash (without interest and rounded to the nearest whole cent)
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing price per share of
VeriFone Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange on the trading day
immediately prior to the Effective Time. The parties hereto acknowledge that
payment of the cash consideration in lieu of issuing fractional shares of
VeriFone Common Stock is not separately bargained for consideration, but
merely represents a mechanical rounding off for purposes of simplifying the
corporate and accounting complexities that would otherwise be caused by the
issuance of fractional shares.

  



        
   

  



  

### (f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any VeriFone Common
Stock) that remains unclaimed by Lipman shareholders for 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to VeriFone. Any holder of Shares (other
than Excluded Shares) who has not theretofore complied with this Article IV
shall thereafter look only to VeriFone for delivery of any Cash Consideration
or certificates for shares of VeriFone Common Stock representing Stock
Consideration, in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of VeriFone, the Surviving Corporation, the Exchange
Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of Shares for
any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any
Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an
affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by VeriFone, the posting by such Person
of a bond in customary amount and upon such terms as may be required by
VeriFone as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with
respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the shares of VeriFone Common
Stock and any cash, unpaid dividends or other distributions that would be
payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been surrendered.

  

### 

  

### (h) _Affiliates_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares surrendered for exchange by any "affiliate"
(as determined pursuant to Section 6.9) of Lipman shall not be exchanged
until VeriFone has received a written agreement from such Person as provided
in Section 6.9 hereof.

  

### 

  

### (i) _Withholding Rights_. Each of VeriFone and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares such amounts as
VeriFone reasonably determines it may be required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of any payment pursuant to this Agreement under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended and by rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder (the " _ _Code__ "), the Ordinance, or any other
applicable state, local, Israeli or foreign Tax (as defined in Section
5.1(n)) law, provided, however, that (i) in the event the Israeli Withholding
Tax Ruling (as defined in Section 6.15(c)(ii)) is obtained, deduction and
withholding of any amounts under the Ordinance or any other provision of
Israeli law or requirement, if any, shall be made only in accordance with the
provisions of the Israeli Withholding Tax Ruling; (ii) in the event a
Withholding Tax Extension (as defined in Section 6.15(c)(ii)) is obtained,
the parties shall fully comply with the provisions of any such Withholding
Tax Extension, and (iii) in the event any holder of record of Shares provides
the Exchange Agent, VeriFone or the Surviving Corporation with a valid
approval or ruling issued by the applicable Governmental Entity regarding the
withholding (or exemption from withholding) of

  



        
   

  



  

### Israeli Tax from the Merger Consideration in a form reasonably
satisfactory to VeriFone, then the deduction and withholding of any amounts
under the Ordinance or any other provision of Israeli law or requirement, if
any, from the Merger Consideration payable to such holder of record of Shares
shall be made only in accordance with the provisions of such approval;
provided, further, that VeriFone shall be entitled but not obligated to
deduct and withhold from any Merger Consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable by withholding a portion or all of the Stock
Consideration otherwise deliverable and selling such Stock Consideration to
cover its withholding obligations. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by the Surviving Corporation or VeriFone, as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be remitted by VeriFone or the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the
Surviving Corporation or VeriFone, as the case may be.

  

### 

  

### (j) _Uncertificated Lipman Shares_. VeriFone shall cause the Exchange
Agent to (i) issue in registered form, as of the Effective Time, to each
holder of Book-Entry Shares that number of whole shares of VeriFone Common
Stock that such holder is entitled to receive in respect of each such Book-
Entry Share pursuant to this Article IV and (ii) mail to each such holder
materials (to be reasonably agreed by VeriFone and Lipman prior to the
Effective Time) advising such holder of the effectiveness of the Merger and
the conversion of such holders Shares into Merger Consideration pursuant to
the Merger and a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required Tax
withholdings) for any cash payable pursuant to Section 4.2(e) in lieu of
fractional shares or 4.2(c) in payment of any dividend or other distribution
in respect of such Book-Entry Shares, in each case without any action by such
holders.

  

### 

  

## 4.3. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, if, (a) between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
the issued and outstanding Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable
into or exercisable for Shares or the issued and outstanding shares of
VeriFone Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for shares of VeriFone Common Stock, shall have been changed into
a different number of shares or a different class by reason of any
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or distribution, recapitalization, redenomination, merger (but only
a merger involving Lipman and not VeriFone), issuer tender or exchange offer,
or other similar transaction, or (b) at the Effective Time, Lipmans
representations and warranties in Section 5.1(b) (Capital Structure) are not
true in any non- _de minimis_  respect, then the Merger Consideration, the
Special Cash Dividend and any other dependent items shall be equitably
adjusted and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be
the Merger Consideration, the Special Cash Dividend or other dependent item.

  

## 

  

## 4.4. _Treatment of Stock Plans and Options_. At the Effective Time,
each outstanding option to purchase Shares (a " _ _Lipman Option__ ") under
the Stock Plans

  



        
   

  



  

(as defined in Section 5.1(b)(i)), whether vested or unvested, shall
be assumed by VeriFone such that it is converted into an option to purchase
an equal number of shares of VeriFone Common Stock, at an exercise price per
share equal to the exercise price per Share of such Lipman Option immediately
prior to the Effective Time and with such other terms and conditions
(including without limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions);
provided, however, that the exercise price and the number of shares of
VeriFone Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Lipman Options shall be
determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of
the Code; provided, further, that in the case of any Lipman Option to which
Section 422 of the Code applies, the exercise price and the number of shares
of Parent Company Stock purchasable pursuant to such option shall be
determined in accordance with the foregoing, subject to such adjustments as
are necessary in order to satisfy the requirements of Section 424(a) of the
Code. Except as specifically provided above, following the Effective Time,
each Lipman Option shall continue to be governed by the same terms and
conditions as were applicable under such Lipman Option immediately prior to
the Effective Time. VeriFone agrees to file a registration statement on Form
S-8 (if available for use by VeriFone) for the shares of VeriFone Common
Stock issuable with respect to such Lipman Options (to the extent such shares
qualify for registration on Form S-8), as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, but not more than 60 days following the Effective Time.

procedures are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed
by Lipman is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the individuals
responsible for the preparation of Lipmans filings with the SEC and other

respective employees. No attorney representing Lipman or any of its
Subsidiaries, whether or not employed by Lipman or any of its Subsidiaries,

assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date
hereof, could subject Lipman or any Subsidiary to a Tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA in an amount which
would be material. Neither Lipman nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred or
reasonably expects to incur a Tax or penalty imposed by Section 4980F of the

material liability under Section 4071 of ERISA.

entity which is considered one employer with Lipman under Section 4001 of

and its Subsidiaries have not incurred and do not expect to incur any
withdrawal liability with respect to a multiemployer plan under Subtitle E of
Title IV of ERISA (regardless of whether based on contributions of a Lipman
ERISA Affiliate).

health and life benefits.

  

#### 

  

#### (vi) There has been no amendment to, announcement by Lipman or any of
its Subsidiaries relating to, or change in employee participation or coverage
under, any Lipman Benefit Plan which would increase materially the expense of
maintaining such plan above the level of the expense incurred therefor for
the most recent fiscal year. Except as set forth in Section 5.1(h)(vi) of the
Lipman Disclosure Letter, neither the execution of this Agreement,
shareholder adoption of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will (w) entitle any employees of Lipman or
any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay or any increase in severance
pay upon any termination of employment after the date hereof, (x) accelerate
the time of payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a
grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under, increase the
amount payable or result in any other material obligation pursuant to, any
of Lipman Benefit Plans, (y) limit or restrict the right of Lipman or, after
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, VeriFone to merge,
amend or terminate any of Lipman Benefit Plans or (z) result in payments
under any of Lipman Benefit Plans which would not be deductible under Section
280G of the Code.

  

#### 

  

#### (vii) All Lipman Non-U.S. Benefit Plans comply in all material respects
with applicable local law. All Lipman Non-U.S. Benefit Plans are listed on

have no material unfunded liabilities with respect to any such Lipman
Non-U.S. Benefit Plan required to be funded under applicable local law. As of

contract between Lipman and any of its Israeli Employees or directors that
cannot be terminated by Lipman upon less than thirty days notice without
giving rise to a claim for damages or compensation (except for statutory

its Israeli Employees pursuant to the Israeli Severance Pay Law (5723-1963)
and vacation pursuant to the Israeli Annual Leave Law 1951 and any Contract

that could give rise to any valid claim by a current or former Israeli
Employee for compensation on termination of employment (beyond the statutory
severance pay to which employees are entitled); all amounts that Lipman is
legally or contractually required either (x) to deduct from its Israeli
Employees salaries or to transfer to such Israeli Employees pension or

Financial Statements. Except as set forth in Section 5.1(i) of the Lipman
Disclosure Letter, as of the date hereof, Lipman has not engaged any Israeli
Employees whose employment would require special licenses or permits, and
there are no unwritten Lipman policies or customs which, by extension, could
entitle Israeli Employees to benefits in addition to what they are entitled
by Law. Except as set forth in Section 5.1(i) of the Lipman Disclosure
Letter, Lipman has not engaged any consultants, sub-contractors, sales agents
or freelancers who, according to Israeli law, would be entitled to the rights
of an employee vis-a-vis Lipman, including rights to severance pay, vacation,
recuperation pay ( _dmei havraa_ ) and other employee-related statutory and
contractual benefits. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _ _Israeli
Employee__ " shall be construed to include consultants, sales agents and

## 6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.

  



  

### (a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. Lipman agrees that, except as
expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, until the earlier of (i) the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms and (ii) the Effective
Time, neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective
officers and directors shall, and that it shall use its reasonable best
efforts to instruct and cause its and its Subsidiaries employees, investment
bankers, attorneys, accountants, and other agents, advisors or
representatives (such officers, directors, employees, investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other agents, advisors or
representatives, collectively, " _ _Representatives__ ") not to, directly or
indirectly:

  



        
   

  



  

#### (i) initiate, solicit or knowingly encourage any inquiry or the making
of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, any Acquisition Proposal (as defined below);

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any non-public information or data to any
Person who has made or proposed to make, any Acquisition Proposal; or

  

#### 

  

#### (iii) otherwise knowingly facilitate any effort or attempt to make an
Acquisition Proposal.

  

#### 

  

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary prior to the time,
but not after, the Requisite Lipman Vote is obtained, Lipman may (A) provide
information in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an
unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal if Lipman receives from
the Person so requesting such information an executed
confidentiality agreement on terms substantially similar to those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 9.7) and
promptly discloses (and, if applicable, provides copies of) any such
information to VeriFone to the extent not previously provided; (B) engage or
participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
such an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal; or (C) after
having complied with Section 6.2(c), approve, recommend, or otherwise declare
advisable or propose to approve, recommend or declare advisable (publicly or
otherwise) such an Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x)
prior to taking any action described in clause (A), (B) or (C) above, the
board of directors of Lipman determines in good faith after consultation with
outside legal counsel and financial advisors that the failure to take such
action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (y) in each such case referred to above, the board of
directors of Lipman has determined in good faith based on the information
then available and after consultation with its legal counsel and financial
advisor that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes, or is reasonably
likely to constitute, a Superior Proposal (as defined below).

  



  

### (b) _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

### 

  

" _ _Acquisition Proposal__ " means (i) any proposal or offer with respect to
a merger, joint venture, partnership, consolidation, dissolution,
liquidation, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization, share exchange,
business combination or similar transaction outside the ordinary course of
business involving Lipman or any of its Significant Subsidiaries; or (ii) any
proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or indirectly, 20% or
more of the total voting power of the equity securities of Lipman or 20% or
more of the consolidated total assets (including, without limitation, equity
interests in Lipmans Subsidiaries) of Lipman, in each case other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

" _ _Superior Proposal__ " means an unsolicited _bona fide_ Acquisition
Proposal involving all or a substantial majority of the assets (on a
consolidated basis) or at least

  



        
   

  



  

50% of the total voting power of the equity securities of Lipman, that its
board of directors has determined in its good faith judgment after
consultation with outside legal counsel and financial advisors that is
reasonably likely to be consummated in accordance with its terms, taking into
account all legal, financial and regulatory aspects of the proposal and the
Person making the proposal, and if consummated, would result in a transaction
more favorable to Lipmans shareholders from a financial point of view to
such shareholders, than the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Special Cash Dividend and after taking into account any
revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement
agreed to by VeriFone pursuant to Section 6.2(c) of this Agreement).

  



  

### (c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.
The board of directors of Lipman and any committee thereof shall not:

  

### 

  

#### (i) Except as permitted by this Section 6.2, withhold or withdraw, or
qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to withhold, withdraw,
qualify or modify), in a manner reasonably likely to be adverse to VeriFone,
the Lipman Recommendation with respect to the Merger (it being understood
that publicly taking a neutral position or no position with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal at any time beyond twenty (20) business days after the
first public announcement of such Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification); or

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) except as expressly permitted by, and after compliance with,
Section 8.3(a) hereof, cause or permit Lipman to enter into or approve any
letter of intent, terms sheet, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or other agreement (other
than a confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into
in compliance with Section 6.2(a)) (an " _ _Alternative Acquisition
Agreement__ ") for any Acquisition Proposal.

  

#### 

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior
to the time, but not after, the Requisite Lipman Vote is obtained, the board
of directors of Lipman may withhold, withdraw or qualify or modify the Lipman
Recommendation in a manner reasonably likely to be adverse to VeriFone or
approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any Superior Proposal made
after the date hereof that was not solicited, initiated, encouraged or
facilitated in breach of this Agreement, if but only if the board of
directors of Lipman determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and financial advisors, that the failure to take such action would
not be consistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law (a " _
_Change of Recommendation__ "); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no Change of
Recommendation may be made until after at least 48 hours following VeriFones
receipt of notice from Lipman advising that management of Lipman currently
intends to recommend to its board of directors that it take such action and
the basis therefor, including all necessary information under Section 6.2(e).
In determining whether to make a Change of Recommendation in response to a
Superior Proposal or otherwise, the Lipman board of directors shall take into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by VeriFone and
any other information provided

  



        
   

  



  

by VeriFone in response to such notice. Any material amendment to any
Acquisition Proposal will be deemed to be a new Acquisition Proposal for
purposes of this Section 6.2, including with respect to the notice period
referred to in this Section 6.2(c).

  



  

### (d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Section 6.2
shall be deemed to prohibit Lipman from complying with its disclosure
obligations under Israeli or U.S. federal law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that if VeriFone reasonably determines
that such disclosure has the effect of withdrawing or adversely modifying the
Lipman Recommendation, VeriFone shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement as set forth in Section 8.4.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Notice_. Lipman agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within 24 hours) notify VeriFone if any inquiries, proposals or offers with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any such information is
requested from, or any such discussions or negotiation are sought to be
initiated or continued with, it or any of its Representatives indicating, in
connection with such notice, the name of such Person and the material terms
and conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, and
subject to any applicable confidentiality obligations, copies of any written
requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and thereafter
shall keep VeriFone informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of
any such proposals or offers (including any amendments thereto) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in
Lipmans intentions as previously notified.

delayed. VeriFone will promptly advise Lipman of the receipt of any comments
