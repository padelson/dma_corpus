WHEREAS, the Company Board has (i) determined that this Agreement and the
Transactions, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable to, and in

4 ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.01. _The Offer_.

 

(a) _Commencement of the Offer_. Provided that this Agreement shall not
have been terminated in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, on January
10, 2018, or as promptly thereafter as practicable, but in no event later than
January 16, 2018, Purchaser shall (and Parent shall cause Purchaser to)
commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d -2 under the Exchange Act) the Offer
to Purchase all of the outstanding Company Shares at a price per Company Share
equal to the Offer Price, net to the seller in cash, without interest.

 

(b) _Terms and Conditions of the Offer_. The obligations of Purchaser to,
and of Parent to cause Purchaser to, accept for payment, and pay for, any
Company Shares validly tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer are
subject only to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the
prior satisfaction of the Minimum Condition and the satisfaction or, to the
extent waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver of the other conditions set
forth in Annex I (collectively, the " _Offer Conditions_ "). The Offer shall
be made by means of an offer to purchase (the " _Offer to Purchase_ ") that
contains the terms set forth in this Agreement, including the Minimum
Condition and the other Offer Conditions. Purchaser expressly reserves the
right to (i) increase the Offer Price, (ii) waive any Offer Condition and
(iii) make any other changes in the terms and conditions of the Offer not
inconsistent with the terms of this Agreement; provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, without
the prior written consent of the Company, Parent and Purchaser shall not (A)
decrease the Offer Price, (B) change the form of consideration payable in the
Offer, (C) decrease the maximum number of Company Shares sought to
be purchased in the Offer, (D) impose conditions or requirements to the Offer
in addition to the Offer Conditions, (E) amend, change or modify any of the

Stockholders_ "), (F) amend, change, modify or waive the Minimum Condition or
the Offer Conditions set forth in clauses (d), (g) or (h) in Annex I, or (G)
except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 1.01(c)_ or _Section_ __ _ 1.01(d)_,
terminate or withdraw the Offer or accelerate, extend or otherwise change the
Expiration Date. The Offer may not be withdrawn prior to the Expiration Date
(or any rescheduled Expiration Date) of the Offer, unless this Agreement is
terminated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 7.01_.

 

(c) _Expiration and Extension of the Offer_. The Offer shall initially be
scheduled to expire at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on the twentieth (20th)
Business Day following the Offer Commencement Date, determined as set forth in
Rule 14d-1(g)(3) and Rule 14e-1(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act (unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company) (the " _Initial
Expiration Date_ ," such date or such subsequent date and time to which the
expiration of the Offer is extended in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, the " _Expiration Date_ "). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, but subject to the Parties respective
termination rights under  _Section_ __ _ 7.01_: (i) if, as of the scheduled
Expiration Date, any Offer Condition is not satisfied and has not been waived,
Purchaser shall extend the Offer on one or more occasions, for an additional
period of up to ten (10) Business Days per extension, to permit such Offer
Condition to be satisfied; and (ii) Purchaser shall extend the Offer from time
to time for any period required by any Law, any rule or regulation of 

 



5  the SEC or NASDAQ applicable to the Offer; provided, however, that in no
event shall Purchaser: (1) be required to extend the Offer beyond the earlier
to occur of (the " _Extension Deadline_ ") (x) the valid termination of this
Agreement in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 7.01_ and (y) the Outside Date;
or (2) be permitted to extend the Offer beyond the Extension Deadline without
the prior written consent of the Company. Purchaser shall not terminate the
Offer, or permit the Offer to expire, prior to any scheduled Expiration Date
without the prior written consent of the Company except in the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01_.

(d) _Termination of Offer_. In the event that this Agreement is validly
terminated pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, Purchaser shall, and Parent
shall cause Purchaser to, immediately, irrevocably and unconditionally
terminate the Offer and shall not acquire any Company Shares pursuant to the
Offer. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Purchaser in accordance with
the terms hereof, Purchaser shall immediately return, and shall cause any
depository acting on behalf of Purchaser to return, in accordance
with applicable Laws, all tendered Company Shares to the registered holders
thereof.

(e) _Offer Documents_. As promptly as practicable on the Offer
Commencement Date, Parent and Purchaser shall (i) file with the SEC a tender
offer statement on Schedule TO with respect to the Offer (together with all
amendments and supplements thereto and including exhibits thereto, the "
_Schedule_ __ _ TO_") that, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.02(f)_, will contain
or incorporate by reference the Offer to Purchase and form of the related
letter of transmittal and (ii) cause the Offer to Purchase and related
documents to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares. Parent and
Purchaser agree that they shall cause the Schedule TO and all exhibits,
amendments or supplements thereto (which together constitute the " _Offer
Documents_ ") filed by either Parent or Purchaser with the SEC (x) to comply
in all material respects with the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and other applicable Laws and (y) to not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided,
however, that no covenant is made by Parent or Purchaser with respect to
information supplied by or on behalf of the Company for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Purchaser
and the Company agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for
use in the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall
have become false or misleading in any material respect, and Parent further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents as so
corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of
Company Shares, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable
federal securities laws. The Company shall promptly furnish or otherwise make
available to Parent and Purchaser or Parents legal counsel all information
concerning the Company and the Company Stockholders that may be required in
connection with any action contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 1.01(e)_.
The Company and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Offer Documents (including any response to any comments
(including oral comments) of the SEC or its staff with respect thereto) prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC, and Parent and Purchaser shall give
reasonable and good faith consideration to any such comments made by the
Company or its counsel. Parent and Purchaser agree to provide the Company and
its counsel with any comments that Parent, Purchaser or their counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents promptly
after receipt of such comments (including oral comments). Each of Parent and
Purchaser shall respond promptly to any comments (including oral comments) of
the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents or the Offer.

 



6 (f) _Funds_. Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited with
the Paying Agent, concurrently with or promptly following the Offer Acceptance
Time, all of the funds necessary to purchase all Company Shares that Purchaser
becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.01(b)_, and shall
cause Purchaser to perform, on a timely basis, all of Purchasers obligations
under this Agreement. Parent and Purchaser shall, and each of Parent and
Purchaser shall ensure that all of their respective Affiliates shall, tender
any Company Shares held by them into the Offer.

(g) _Adjustments_. If, between the Agreement Date and the
Offer Acceptance Time, the outstanding Company Shares are changed into a
different number or class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or
subdivision of shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of
shares, reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then
the Offer Price shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

(h) _Acceptance_. Subject only to the satisfaction or, to the extent
waivable by Purchaser or Parent, waiver by Purchaser or Parent of each of the
Offer Conditions, Purchaser shall, and Parent shall cause Purchaser to, (i)
promptly after (and in any event no later than the first (1st) Business Day
after) the Expiration Date (ii) accept for payment all Company Shares validly
tendered (and not withdrawn) pursuant to the Offer and (iii) promptly after
(and in any event no later than the third (3rd) Business Day after) the
Expiration Date pay for such Company Shares.

 

Section 1.02. _Company Actions_.

 

(a) _Schedule_ __ _ 14D-9_. As promptly as practicable on the day that
the Offer is commenced, following the filing of the Schedule TO, the Company
shall file with the SEC and disseminate to holders of Company Shares, in each
case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities Laws
and Section 262 of the DGCL, a Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation
Statement on Schedule 14D-9 (together with any exhibits, amendments or
supplements thereto, the " _Schedule_ __ _ 14D-9_") that, subject to
_Section_ __ _ 5.02(f)_ shall reflect the Company Board Recommendation and
include a notice of appraisal rights in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL. Prior to such filing and dissemination, the Company shall set the
Stockholder List Date as the record date for the purpose of receiving the
notice required by Section 262(d)(2) of the DGCL. The Company agrees that it
will cause the Schedule 14D-9 to (i) comply in all material respects with the
Exchange Act and other applicable Laws and for the notice to comply with
Section 262 of the DGCL and (ii) to not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided, however,
that no covenant is made by the Company with respect to information supplied
by or on behalf of Parent or Purchaser for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in the Schedule 14D-9. The Company agrees to provide Parent and its
counsel with any comments the Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC
or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after receipt of such
comments. Each of Parent, Purchaser and the Company agrees to respond
promptly to any comments of the SEC or its staff

 



7  and to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further
agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected
to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to holders of Company Shares,
in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
laws. Parent and its counsel shall be given reasonable opportunity to review
and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendment thereto prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC.

 

(b) _Stockholder Lists_. As requested by Parent or its agents, the Company
shall promptly furnish Parent with a list of its stockholders, mailing labels
and any available listing or computer file containing the names and addresses
of all record holders of Company Shares and lists of securities positions of
Company Shares held in stock depositories, in each case accurate and complete
as of the most recent practicable date, and shall provide to Parent such
additional information (including updated lists of stockholders, mailing
labels and lists of securities positions) and such other assistance as Parent
may reasonably request in connection with the Offer and the Merger. The date
of the list used to determine the Persons to whom the Offer Documents and
Schedule 14D-9 are first disseminated is referred to in this Agreement as the
" _Stockholder List Date_." Parent and Purchaser and their agents shall hold
in confidence the information contained in any such labels, listings and
files, shall use such information only in connection with the Offer and the
Merger and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request by the
Company, deliver, and shall use their reasonable efforts to cause their agents
to deliver, to the Company (or destroy) all copies and any extracts or
summaries from such information then in their possession or control and, if
requested by the Company, promptly certify to the Company in writing that all
such material has been returned or destroyed.

 

Section 1.03. _Merger of Purchaser into the Company_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), at the Effective Time, Purchaser shall be merged
with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). Following the Merger, the
separate corporate existence of Purchaser shall cease, and the Company shall
continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") under the name "Ignyta, Inc." as a wholly owned Subsidiary of
Parent. The Merger will be governed by Section 251(h) of the DGCL.

 

Section 1.04. _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ")
shall occur on the same date as the Offer Acceptance Time and immediately
following the Offer Acceptance Time, unless the conditions set forth in
_Article VI_ shall not have not been satisfied or waived by such date (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to their satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and this Agreement, waiver of those conditions), in which case
on the date no later than the first (1st) Business Day on which
the conditions set forth in _Article VI_ are satisfied or waived, at the
offices of Latham and Watkins LLP, 12670 High Bluff Drive, San Diego, California
92130.

 

Section 1.05. _Effective Time_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth herein, concurrently with the Closing, the parties shall
cause the Merger to be consummated by filing with the Secretary of State of
the State of Delaware a duly executed certificate of merger as required by the
DGCL (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). The Merger shall become effective at

 



8  such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such other time as Parent and the Company
shall agree in writing and shall specify in the Certificate of Merger (the
time the Merger becomes effective in accordance with the DGCL is referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ " and the date on which the Closing occurs is
referred to as the " _Closing Date_ "). 

Section 1.06. _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects
set forth herein, the Certificate of Merger and in the applicable provisions
of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of the Company shall continue, and those of the Purchaser

duties of the Company shall remain, and those of Purchaser shall become, the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

Time, the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in its entirety to read as the certificate of

_ 5.06(a)_), except that all references therein to Purchaser shall be
automatically amended and shall become references to the Surviving

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.01. _Treatment and Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company,
Parent, Purchaser or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the
Company, Parent or Purchaser:

 

(a) Each share of Common Stock of the Company (each, a " _Share_ "), issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any
Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares, which, with respect to the Dissenting
Shares, shall have only those rights set forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.07_) shall
be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Offer Price, in cash, without interest, and subject to any
deduction for

 



9  withholding Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance with _Section_ __
_ 2.05_ (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such
Shares shall no longer be outstanding, shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter only represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration, if any, to be paid in accordance with  _Section_ __
_ 2.04_, without interest.

(b) Each Share held in the treasury of the Company or owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent or Purchaser immediately prior to the Effective Time
(collectively, " _Excluded Shares_ ") shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable
share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

Section 2.02. _Treatment of Company Warrants_. Prior to the Effective
Time, the Company shall, in accordance with the terms of all unexercised and
unexpired warrants to purchase Shares under any warrant agreements entered
into by the Company and the warrant holders party thereto (collectively, the "
_Company Warrants_ "), deliver notices to the holders of the Company
Warrants, informing such holders of the Merger and containing such other
information as the Company reasonably determines to be required pursuant to
the terms of the Company Warrants. At the Effective Time, each
Company Warrant, whether vested or unvested and exercisable or unexercisable,
that is issued, outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and not terminated pursuant to its terms in connection with the Merger,
shall thereupon represent the right to receive, in exchange for the surrender
and cancellation therefor, an amount in cash (without interest and subject to
any deduction for withholding Taxes required by applicable Law in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 2.05_) to be paid to each former holder of any such
cancelled Company Warrant equal to the product, if any, of (i) the number of
Shares subject to such Company Warrant and (ii) the excess, if any, of
the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per Share under such Company
Warrant (the " _Warrant Consideration_ "); _provided_ that, if the exercise
price per Share of any such Company Warrant is equal to or greater than
the Merger Consideration, such Company Warrant shall be cancelled without any
payment being made in respect thereof. Upon the surrender and cancellation of
each Company Warrant in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 2.02_, each
former holder of such cancelled Company Warrant shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation the Warrant Consideration payable with respect thereto pursuant to
this  _Section_ __ _ 2.02_.

Section 2.03. _Treatment of Company Options and Restricted Stock Units_.
At the Effective Time:

(a) Each option to purchase Shares (each, a " _Company Option_ ") granted
pursuant to any of the Companys Amended and Restated 2011 Equity Incentive
Award Plan, the Companys Amended and Restated 2014 Equity Incentive Award
Plan, the Companys Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan, the Companys
2015 Employment Inducement Incentive Award Plan, the Companys 2017 Employment
Inducement Incentive Award Plan, or

 



10  any other plan, agreement or arrangement (together, the " _Company Stock
Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall automatically (i) be accelerated and vest in
full, (ii) be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time (to the extent
not exercised prior to the Effective Time), and, in exchange therefor, the
Surviving Corporation shall pay, through its payroll system by the later of
(x) five (5) days following the Effective Time and (y) the first payroll date
after the Effective Time, to each former holder of any such cancelled Company
Option an amount in cash (without interest, and subject to deduction for any
required withholding Taxes in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.05_) equal to
the product of (A) the number of Shares subject to such Company Option
_multiplied by_ (B) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the
exercise price per Share under such Company Option (the " _Option
Consideration_ "); _provided_ that, if the exercise price per Share of any
such Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration,
then such Company Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being
made in respect thereof.

 

(b) Each restricted stock unit awarded pursuant to any Company Stock Plan
(each, a " _Restricted Stock Unit_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, (i) shall automatically
be fully accelerated and vest in full, (ii) the restrictions thereon shall
lapse, and (iii) shall be cancelled and terminated as of the Effective Time,
and, in exchange therefor, the Surviving Corporation shall pay, through its
payroll system by the later of (x) five (5) days following the Effective Time
and (y) the first payroll date after the Effective Time, to each former
holder of any such cancelled Restricted Stock Unit an amount in cash (without
interest, and subject to deduction for any required withholding Taxes in
accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 2.05_) equal to the Merger Consideration
(the " _RSU Consideration_ ") on the terms and conditions set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 2.01_, this _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ and  _Section_ __ _ 2.04_.

Section 2.04. _Exchange and Payment_.

 

(a) On or prior to the Effective Time, (i) Parent will, or will cause to be
deposited, with a paying agent, bank or trust company designated by Parent
and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying Agent_ "), in trust
for the benefit of holders of Shares and Company Warrants immediately prior to
the Effective Time (other than holders to the extent they hold Excluded
Shares), cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and the aggregate
Warrant Consideration to be paid pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ (which,
for the avoidance of doubt, in each case shall not include the Option
Consideration or the RSU Consideration) and (ii) Parent will, or will cause to
be deposited with the Surviving Corporation, cash in an amount sufficient to
pay the aggregate Option Consideration, if any, and the aggregate RSU
Consideration to be paid in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.03_ (such cash
in clauses (i) and (ii), in the aggregate, the " _Payment Fund_ "). The
Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other than to fund payments due
pursuant to this _Article_ __ _ II_.

 

(b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each Person who
was the record holder of a certificate (each, a " _Certificate_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Shares that
were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration and to each
holder of uncertificated Shares represented by book entry (" _Book-Entry
Shares_ "): (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss 

 



11  and title to the Certificates and Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, to
the Paying Agent, and which shall be in customary form and contain such other
provisions as Parent, the Company or the Paying Agent may reasonably specify)
and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
(or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for
the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender to the Paying Agent of a Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares, together with
such letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be reasonably
required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange for the Shares formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares (other than Excluded
Shares and Dissenting Shares) the Merger Consideration for each such Share
(subject to deduction for any required withholding Taxes), and the Certificate
or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall immediately be canceled. No
interest will be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration.

 

(c) If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other
than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share
is registered, it shall be a condition of payment that such Certificate so
surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be otherwise in proper form
for transfer or such Book-Entry Share shall be properly transferred and that
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share or shall have established to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax is
not applicable.

 

(d) Until surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this _Section_
__ _ 2.04_, each Certificate or Book-Entry Share (other than Certificates
and Book-Entry Shares representing any Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares)
shall be deemed after the Effective Time to represent solely the right to
receive the Merger Consideration payable in respect thereof pursuant to this
_Article_ __ _ II_, without any interest thereon.

(e) All cash paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article_ __ _ II_ shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Shares formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. At the
Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and
there shall be no further registration of transfers of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer or transfer is sought for Book-Entry Shares, such
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall be cancelled and exchanged as
provided in this _Article_ __ _ II_, subject to applicable Law in the case of
Dissenting Shares.

 

(f) The Paying Agent shall invest any cash remaining in the Payment Fund as
directed by Parent, on a daily basis,  _provided_ , that (i) no such
investment or losses thereon shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to
the holders of Shares and the Warrant Consideration payable to holders of
Company Warrants, (ii) following any such losses or events that result in the
Payment Fund becoming not immediately available or that result in the amount
of funds in the Payment Fund being insufficient to promptly pay the portion of
the aggregate Merger 

 



12  Consideration and the portion of the aggregate Warrant Consideration that
remains unpaid, Parent shall promptly provide additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the holders of Shares and Company Warrants to the
extent of such insufficiency and (iii) such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or in commercial
paper obligations rated P-1 or A-1 or better by Moodys Investor Services,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively.

 

(g) Any portion of the Payment Fund (and any interest or other income
earned thereon) that remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates,
Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrants one (1) year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any remaining holders of
Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Company Warrants (except to the extent
representing Excluded Shares or Dissenting Shares) shall thereafter look only
to Parent as general creditors thereof for payment of the Merger Consideration
and Warrant Consideration (subject to abandoned property, escheat or other
similar laws), without interest.

(h) None of Parent, Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any holder of Shares or Company Warrants for any
amounts (whether in respect of such Shares or Company Warrants or otherwise)
delivered from the Payment Fund or otherwise to a public official pursuant to
any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been exchanged prior to two
(2) years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date
on which the related Merger Consideration or Warrant Consideration would
otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity), any
such Merger Consideration or Warrant Consideration in respect thereof shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
Parent, free and clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

(i) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Paying Agent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such amount as Parent or the Paying
Agent may determine is reasonably necessary or, if required by Parent or the
Paying Agent, agreeing to provide indemnity against any claim that may be made
against the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent will deliver to such Person in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 

(j) Any portion of the Payment Fund made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_ to pay for Shares for which appraisal
rights have been perfected as described in _Section_ __ _ 2.07_ shall be
returned to Parent, upon demand.

 

Section 2.05. _Withholding Taxes_. Each of the Company, Parent, the
Purchaser, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration, otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement or otherwise, such amounts as are required to be deducted or
withheld under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ ")
or the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any applicable
provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so deducted and/or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes
of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such
deduction and/or withholding was made. Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent, as the case may be, shall timely remit to the
appropriate Governmental Entity any and all amounts so deducted or withheld.

 



13 Section 2.06. _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. If at any time during
the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any
change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of
such capital stock, shall occur as a result of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split) or subdivision
or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or
stock distribution with a record date during such period, merger or other
similar transaction, the Merger Consideration, Warrant Consideration, Option
Consideration and RSU Consideration shall be equitably adjusted so as to
provide Parent and the holder of Shares the same economic effect
as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event; _provided_ , that in
any case, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 2.06_ shall be construed to permit
the Company to take any action that is prohibited by the terms of
this Agreement.

Section 2.07. _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time that are held by any holder who has not voted in favor of
the Merger and who properly demands appraisal of such Shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration, but shall be converted
into the right to receive such consideration as may be determined to be due to
the holders of Dissenting Shares pursuant to the DGCL, unless and until such
holders shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost, such holders right to appraisal under the DGCL. Dissenting Shares shall
be treated in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL. If any such holder
fails to perfect or withdraws or loses any such right to appraisal, each such
Share of such holder shall thereupon be converted into and become exchangeable
only for the right to receive, as of the later of the Effective Time and the
time that such right to appraisal has been irrevocably lost, withdrawn or
expired, the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_.
The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any Shares, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company relating to rights to
be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in Section 262 of
the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not, except
with the prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make
any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of capital stock of the
Company, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal
of any such demands.

 

Section 2.08. _Loan Payoff_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
satisfy all notification and consent requirements, as applicable, under the
terms of the Loan Agreement. No less than five business days prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall obtain a customary payoff letter signed by
each lender under the Loan Agreement (the " _Payoff Letter_ ") for the Loan
Agreement, which Payoff Letter shall provide (a) the dollar amount of all
indebtedness, all accrued but unpaid interest and all fees and expenses
required to be paid under the Loan Agreement in order to fully and finally
pay off all obligations under the Loan Agreement as of the Closing (the "
_Payoff Amount_ "), (b) that upon receipt of the Payoff Amount, the Loan
Agreement and all related instruments evidencing the obligations
thereunder shall be terminated or fully satisfied and discharged, (c) that
guarantees, if any, securing such borrowings or

 



14  obligations under the Loan Agreement shall be, upon the payment of the
Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, released and terminated and (d) upon the
payment of the Payoff Amount on the Closing Date, that the Liens under the
Loan Agreement are released and the Company shall be authorized to make all
appropriate termination filings to effect such release and termination. Parent
shall pay or cause to be paid the Payoff Amount in full on the Closing Date
on behalf of the Company.

Section 2.09. _Further Action_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
any further action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving
Corporation with full right, title and possession of and to all rights
and property of Purchaser and the Company, the officers and directors of the
Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of
Purchaser, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take such action.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except (i) as set forth in the corresponding section or subsection of the
disclosure letter delivered by the Company to Parent immediately prior to or
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the " _Disclosure Letter_
") (it being agreed that the disclosure of any information in a particular
section or subsection of the Disclosure Letter shall be deemed disclosure of
such information with respect to any other section or subsection of this
Agreement to which the relevance of such information is readily apparent on
its face and that any update of or modification to the Company
Disclosure Letter made or purported to have been made after the date of the
Agreement shall be disregarded) or (ii) as disclosed in the reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed by the Company with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") or furnished by the
Company to the SEC and publicly available, in each case, since January 1, 2016
(excluding any disclosures set forth in any such Company SEC document in any
risk factor section, any disclosure in any section relating to forward-
looking statements or any other statements that are non-specific, predictive
or primarily cautionary in nature but for purposes of clarification, including
and giving effect to any factual or historical statements included in any
such statements) where the relevance of the information as an exception to (or
disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation is readily apparent on
the face of such disclosure, the Company represents and warrants to Parent
and Purchaser as follows:

 

Section 3.01. _Organization and Qualification_.

 

(a) The Company is a duly organized and validly existing corporation in
good standing under the DGCL, with all corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to conduct its business as
currently conducted. The Company is duly qualified and in good standing as a
foreign corporation authorized to do business in each of the jurisdictions in
which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the
nature of the business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary,
except to the extent the failure to be so qualified or in good standing has
not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result, individually or
in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect. The Company has heretofore
made available to Parent true, correct and complete copies of the Companys 

 



15  certificate of incorporation and bylaws as currently in effect, which
certificate of incorporation and bylaws are all in full force and effect. The
Company is not in material violation of any of the provisions of its
certificate of incorporation or bylaws.

(b) The Company does not, directly or indirectly, own any equity,
membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest, or other
equity or voting interest in, or any interest convertible into, exercisable or
exchangeable for any of the foregoing, nor is the Company under any current
or prospective obligation to provide funds to, make any loan, capital
contribution, guarantee, credit enhancement or other investment in, or assume
any liability or obligation of, any Person.

 

Section 3.02. _Capitalization_.

 

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 150,000,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (" _Common Stock_ "), and
10,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share ("
_Preferred Stock_ "). At the close of business on December 21, 2017 (the "
_Measurement Date_ "), (a) 67,591,938 shares of Common Stock were issued and
67,588,990 shares of Common Stock were outstanding, (b) no shares of Preferred
Stock were issued and outstanding, (c) an aggregate of 2,948 shares of Common
Stock were held by the Company in its treasury, (d) an aggregate of 5,701,819
shares of Common Stock were reserved for issuance pursuant to outstanding
awards and rights under the Company Stock Plans, of which 5,470,299 shares of
Common Stock were underlying outstanding and unexercised Company Options and
231,520 shares of Common Stock were underlying unvested Restricted Stock Units
and (e) an aggregate of 98,698 shares of Common Stock were reserved for
issuance pursuant to outstanding Company Warrants. Except for changes since
the close of business on the Measurement Date resulting from the exercise of
Company Options, the vesting of Restricted Stock Units or the exercise of the
Company Warrants, from the Measurement Date until the date hereof, the
Company has not issued any shares of its capital stock, has not granted any
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights,
warrants or rights or entered into any other agreements or commitments to
issue any shares of its capital stock, or granted any other awards in respect
of any shares of its capital stock and has not split, combined or reclassified
any of its shares of capital stock. All of the outstanding Shares have been,
and all shares of Common Stock reserved for issuance as noted in (d) and (e)
above will be, when issued in accordance with the terms thereof, duly
authorized and validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free of
preemptive rights.

 

(b) _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ of the Disclosure Letter contains a true,
correct and complete list, as of the close of business of the Measurement
Date, of (i) the name of each holder of Company Options and Restricted Stock
Units, the type and number of outstanding Company Options and Restricted Stock
Units held by such holder, the grant date of each such Company Option and
Restricted Stock Unit, the number of Shares such holder is entitled to receive
upon the exercise of each Company Option and the corresponding exercise price,
the expiration date of each Company Option and the name of the Company Stock
Plan pursuant to which each such Company Option or Restricted Stock Unit was
granted, and (ii) the name of each holder of Company Warrants, the number of
Shares such holder is entitled to receive upon the exercise of each
Company Warrant and the corresponding exercise price and the expiration date
of each Company Warrant.

 



16 (c) Except for the Company Options, the Restricted Stock Units and
the Company Warrants, there are, as of the Measurement Date, no outstanding
(w) securities of the Company convertible into or exchangeable for shares of
capital stock or voting securities or ownership interests in the Company, (x)
options, warrants, rights or other agreements or commitments requiring the
Company to issue, or other obligations of the Company to issue, any capital
stock, voting securities or other ownership interests in (or securities
convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting securities or
other ownership interests in) the Company (or, in each case, the economic
equivalent thereof), (y) obligations of the Company to grant, extend or enter
into any subscription, warrant, right, convertible or exchangeable security
or other similar agreement or commitment relating to any capital stock, voting
securities or other ownership interests in the Company (the items in clauses
(w), (x) and (y), together with the capital stock of the Company, being
referred to collectively as " _Company Securities_ ") or (z) obligations by
the Company to make any payments based on the price or value of the Shares.
There are, as of the Measurement Date, no outstanding obligations of the
Company to purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company Securities. There
are no voting trusts or other agreements or understandings to which the
Company is a party with respect to the voting of capital stock of the
Company. All outstanding securities of the Company have been offered and
issued in all material respects in compliance with the Securities Act of 1933,
as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "). The exercise price of each Company
Option is not less than the fair market value of a Share on the date of grant
of such Company Option. No Company Option provides for the deferral of
compensation within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code. Except as set
forth on  _Section_ __ _ 3.02_ of the Disclosure Letter, there are no
outstanding or authorized equity-based compensation awards with respect to the
Company.

 

Section 3.03. _Authority; Board Action_.

 

(a) The Company has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder and
consummate the Transactions. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, including
the Offer and the Merger, have been duly, validly and unanimously authorized
by the Company Board and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are necessary to authorize this Agreement or to consummate the
Transactions. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by the Company and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
Parent and Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms, except
to the extent that enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar Laws affecting the
enforcement of creditors rights generally or by general principles of equity.

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting or meetings duly called and held, has
adopted resolutions (i) determining that the terms of this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby are fair to
and in the best interests of the Companys stockholders, (ii) approving and
declaring advisable this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Offer and the Merger, and (iii) resolving to recommend that the
Companys stockholders accept the Offer and tender their Company Shares to
Purchaser pursuant to the Offer, which resolutions have not been subsequently
rescinded, modified or withdrawn, except as may be permitted by _Section_ __ _
5.02_.

 



17 Section 3.04. _No Conflict; Consents and Approvals_. Except for matters
that have not resulted and would not reasonably be expected to result,
individually or in the aggregate, in a Material Adverse Effect solely with
respect to clauses (b) through (e) below, neither the execution and delivery
of this Agreement by the Company nor the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will (a) violate or conflict with or result in any breach
of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company,
(b) require any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with
or notification to, any supranational, national, foreign, federal, state or
local government or subdivision thereof, or governmental, judicial,
legislative, executive, administrative or regulatory authority (including the
FDA), agency, commission, tribunal or body (a " _Governmental Entity_ ")
except (i) as may be required under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and any applicable
foreign antitrust or competition Laws (" _Foreign Antitrust Laws_ "), (ii) the
applicable requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the " _Exchange Act_ ") and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, (iii) the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents
as required by the DGCL, and (iv) the applicable requirements of the Nasdaq
Global Market, (c) violate, conflict with, or result in a breach of any
provisions of, or require any consent, waiver or approval or result in a
default (or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation, modification,
purchase or repurchase, option exercise, put or call, acceleration or any
event that, with the giving of notice, the passage of time or otherwise, would
constitute a default or give rise to any such right) under any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of any Contract to which the Company is a party or by

Section 3.05. _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

 

(a) Since January 1, 2016, the Company has timely filed or furnished all
reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents required to be
filed or furnished by it with or to the SEC, all of which have complied as of
their respective filing dates or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent
filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing, in
all material respects with all applicable requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley
Act_ ") and, in each case, the rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated
thereunder. No executive officer of the Company has failed in any material
respect to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any Company SEC Report. None
of the reports, schedules, forms, statements and other documents filed with
or furnished to the SEC by the Company since January 1, 2016, including any
financial statements or schedules included or incorporated by reference
therein (all such documents, together with all exhibits and schedules to the
foregoing materials and all information incorporated therein by reference, the
" _Company SEC Reports_ "), at the time filed or, if amended or superseded by
a subsequent filing, as of the date of the last such amendment or superseding
filing, contained any untrue statement

 



18  of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. As of the date of
this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment
letters received from the SEC staff with respect to the Company SEC Reports.

 

(b) The financial statements (including the related notes and schedules
thereto) of the Company included (or incorporated by reference) in the
Company SEC Reports (i) have been prepared in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved and fairly present in all material respects the financial
position of the Company as of their respective dates, and the income,
stockholders equity, results of operations and changes in
consolidated financial position or cash flows for the periods presented
therein (subject, in the case of the unaudited financial statements, to the
absence of footnotes and normal year-end audit adjustments) and (ii) comply
in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with
the rules and regulations of the SEC, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act.
As of the date of this Agreement, the Company does not intend to correct
in any material respect or restate, and to the Knowledge of the Company there
is not any basis to restate, any of the audited financial statements or
unaudited interim financial statements (including, in each case, the notes, if
any, thereto) of the Company filed in or furnished with the Company SEC
Reports. No financial statements of any Person other than the Company are
required by GAAP to be included in the financial statements of the Company.

 

(c) The Company has established and maintained disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material information
relating to the Company is made known to the Companys principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities, particularly during the periods in which the periodic reports
required under the Exchange Act are being prepared. Such disclosure controls
and procedures are effective in timely alerting the Companys principal
executive officer and principal financial officer to material information
required to be included in the Companys periodic and current reports required
under the Exchange Act. For purposes of this Agreement, "principal executive
officer" and "principal financial officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

(d) The Company has established and maintained a system of internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act)
sufficient to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the
Companys financial reporting and the preparation of Company financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation of internal controls prior to
the date hereof, to the Companys auditors and audit committee (i) any
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation
of internal controls which are reasonably likely to adversely affect the
Companys ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in internal
controls. To the Knowledge of the Company, any material change in internal
control over financial reporting required to be disclosed in any Company
SEC Report has been so disclosed. The Company has made available to Parent
and

 



19  Purchaser (or outside counsel) prior to the date of this Agreement a summary
of any such disclosure made by management to the Companys auditors and audit
committee since January 1, 2015 through the date hereof.

(e) The Company is not party to, nor has entered into any Contract to
become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract or arrangement (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among the Company, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or intended effect of such Contract is
to avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, the Companys in the Companys audited financial statements
or other Company SEC Reports.

(f) To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the Company SEC Reports is
the subject of ongoing SEC review and there are no inquiries or investigations
by the SEC or any internal investigations pending or threatened, in each case
regarding any accounting practices of the Company. Since January 1, 2016, (i)

assertion or claim regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of the Company or its internal accounting controls
relating to periods since January 1, 2016, including any credible complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim that the Company has engaged in questionable
accounting or auditing practices and (ii) no attorney representing the
Company, whether or not employed by the Company, has reported evidence of a
material violation of applicable Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar
violation by the Company or their respective officers, directors, employees

Section 5.02. _No Solicitation_.

 

(a) For the purposes of this Agreement, " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ " means any customary confidentiality agreement that is executed
prior to the date of this Agreement or, if executed thereafter, does not
prohibit the Company from providing any information to Parent in accordance
with this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or otherwise prohibit the Company from
complying with its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_.

 

(b) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_, until the earlier of
the Offer Acceptance Time and the termination of this Agreement, the Company
shall not, and shall direct and use reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives not to, (i) continue any solicitation, knowing encouragement,
or negotiations with any Persons that may be ongoing with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or
knowingly encourage any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or

destruction of all material non-public information provided to third parties
prior to the date of this Agreement that have, within the twelve

 



40  (12) month period preceding the date of this Agreement, entered into
confidentiality agreements relating to a possible Acquisition Proposal and
immediately terminate access by any third party to any data room (virtual or

(c) If at any time on or after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time the Company or any of its Representatives receives a
_bona_ __ _ fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from any Person or group of
Persons, which Acquisition Proposal was made or renewed on or after the date
of this Agreement and did not result from any breach of this _Section_ __ _
5.02_, (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such Person or
group of Persons to clarify the terms and conditions thereof and (ii) if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal, then the
Company and its Representatives may (x) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement, information (including material non-public
information) with respect to the Company to the Person or group of Persons who
has made such Acquisition Proposal and (y) engage in or otherwise participate
in discussions or negotiations with the Person or group of Persons making such
Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ , that the Company shall concurrently provide

(d) Following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall (i) promptly

(including changes to any material terms of, and any other material
developments with respect to) such Acquisition Proposal on a prompt basis.
Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours after any determination) advise Parent in
writing if the Company Board determines to begin providing information or
engaging in discussions or negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to the Company
Stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the Exchange Act, (ii) making any
disclosure to the Company Stockholders that the Company determines is required
by applicable Laws or (iii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act; _provided_ ,
_that_ this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_ shall not be deemed to permit the
Company Board to make an Adverse Recommendation Change except to the extent
permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.02(f)_.

 

(f) The Company hereby consents to the Offer and represents that the
Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, has made the Company Board
Recommendation. Subject to this _Section_ __ _ 5.02_, the Company hereby
consents to the inclusion of a description of the

 



41  Company Board Recommendation in the Offer Documents. Except as provided
below, neither the Company nor the Company Board shall (i) (A) change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Board Recommendation, (B) make, or publicly propose to make, any
recommendation in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer other than
a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen"
communication by the Company Board of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act, (D) fail to recommend against an Acquisition Proposal
within five (5) Business Days after a request by Parent to do so or (E)
resolve, agree or publicly propose to take any such actions (each such action
set forth in clause (i) being referred to herein as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) authorize, approve, recommend or publicly
propose to, or cause or permit the Company to, enter into any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement or any other agreement
(other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement) related to any
Acquisition Proposal.

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, at any
time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 

(A) if the Company has received a _bona_ __ _ fide_ written Acquisition
Proposal that did not result from, directly or indirectly, a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.02_ from any Person that has not been withdrawn and, after
consultation with outside legal counsel and its financial advisors, the
Company Board shall have determined, in good faith, that such Acquisition
Proposal is a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may make an Adverse
Recommendation Change, or (y) the Company may terminate this Agreement to
enter into a binding written definitive acquisition agreement providing for
the consummation of a transaction constituting a Superior Proposal (a "
_Specified Agreement_ "), with respect to such Superior Proposal, in each case
if and only if: (a) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws; (b)
the Company shall have given Parent prior written notice of its intention to
consider making an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(ii)_ at least three (3) Business Days
prior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change or termination (a "
_Determination Notice_ ") (which notice shall not constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change or termination); and (c)(1) the Company shall have
provided to Parent the material terms and conditions of the Acquisition
Proposal and the identity of the Person making the Acquisition Proposal), (2)
the Company shall have given Parent the three (3) Business Days after the
Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement or
make another proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal would cease to
constitute a Superior Proposal, and shall have negotiated in good faith with
Parent (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) with respect to such
proposed revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the
results of such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by
Parent, if any, after consultation with outside legal counsel and its
financial advisors, the Company Board shall have determined, in good faith,
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
make an Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(ii)_

 



42  would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of
the Company Board to the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws. Issuance
of any "stop, look and listen" communication by or on behalf of the Company
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f), in compliance with _Section_ __ _ 5.02(e)_, shall
not be considered an Adverse Recommendation Change and shall not require the
giving of a Determination Notice or compliance with the procedures set forth
in this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(f)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(f)(A)_ shall also apply to any material
amendment to any Acquisition Proposal and require a new Determination Notice,
except that the references to three (3) Business Days shall be deemed to be
two (2) Business Days; and

 

(B) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company
Board may make an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an Intervening
Event, if and only if: (a) the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that the failure to do
so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties
of the Company Board to the Company stockholders under applicable Laws; (b)
the Company shall have given Parent a Determination Notice at least three (3)
Business Days prior to making any such Adverse Recommendation Change; and (c)
(1) the Company shall have specified the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail, (2) the Company shall have given Parent the three (3) Business Days
after the Determination Notice to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement or make another proposal so that such Intervening Event would no
longer necessitate an Adverse Recommendation Change, and shall have made its
Representatives reasonably available to negotiate in good faith with Parent
(to the extent Parent desires to do so) with respect to such proposed
revisions or other proposal, if any, and (3) after considering the results of
such negotiations and giving effect to the proposals made by Parent, if any,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, the Company Board shall have
determined, in good faith, that the failure to make the Adverse Recommendation
Change in response to such Intervening Event would reasonably be expected to
be inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Company Board to the Company
Stockholders under applicable Laws. For the avoidance of doubt, the provisions
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.02(f)(B)_ shall also apply to any material change to
the facts and circumstances relating to such Intervening Event and require a
new Determination Notice, except that the references to three (3) Business
Days shall be deemed to be two (2) Business Days.

 

Section 5.03. _Access to Information_.

 

(a) From and after the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the
Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms, the Company will (i) give Parent and Purchaser and their authorized
Representatives reasonable access (during regular business hours upon
reasonable notice) to such employees, offices, and other facilities and to
such books, contracts, commitments and records (including Tax Returns) of the
Company as Parent may reasonably request and instruct the Companys
independent public accountants to provide access to their work papers and
such other information as Parent or Purchaser may reasonably request, (ii)
permit Parent and Purchaser to make such inspections as they may reasonably
require, (iii) furnish Parent and Purchaser with such financial and operating
data and 

 



43  other information with respect to the business, properties and personnel of
the Company as Parent or Purchaser may from time to time reasonably request
and (iv) furnish promptly to Parent and Purchaser a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or received by the Company during such
period pursuant to the requirements of the federal or state securities Laws,
provided, however, that the foregoing shall not require the Company to
disclose or provide access to the extent that such disclosure or access in the
Companys judgment (A) contravenes applicable Law, (B) causes a waiver of an
attorney-client privilege or other privilege or loss of attorney work product
protection, (C) violates a confidentiality obligation to any Person or (D)
interferes unreasonably with the business and operations of the Company.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts from and after the date of this Agreement until the
earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement in
accordance with its terms to make appropriate substitute arrangements to
permit reasonable disclosure not in violation of such Laws, agreements or
duty and information shall be disclosed subject to execution of a joint
defense agreement in customary form, and disclosure may be limited to external
counsel for Parent, to the extent that the Company determines is reasonably
required for the purpose of complying with the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, the
Clayton Act, the FTC Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law. No information or
knowledge obtained by Parent in any investigation pursuant to this  _Section_
__ _ 5.03(a)_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or
warranty made by the Company hereunder.

 

(b) All information obtained by Parent or Purchaser pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 5.03(a)_ shall be subject to the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

Section 5.04. _Notices of Certain Events_. The Company shall promptly
notify Parent of

(a) to the Knowledge of the Company, any written notice or
other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person
is or may be required in connection with or relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

 

(b) any written notice or other communication from any Governmental Entity
received by the Company in connection with or relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and

(c) any suits or proceedings commenced against the Company that relate to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;

_provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 5.04_
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to
Parent.

 

Section 5.05. _Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the
Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions that are necessary or advisable to
consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including filing within ten (10) Business Days any required submissions under
the HSR Act and using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i)
filing any required submissions as soon as is reasonably practicable under
any Foreign Antitrust Law which Parent

 



44  determines should be made, in each case, with respect to this Agreement, the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, (ii)
furnishing information required in connection with such submissions under the
HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law (including responding to any "second
request" for additional information or documentary material under the HSR Act
as promptly as reasonably practicable), (iii) keeping the other parties
reasonably informed with respect to the status of any such submissions under
the HSR Act or any Foreign Antitrust Law, including with respect to: (A) the
receipt of any non-action, action, clearance, consent, approval or waiver,
(B) the expiration of any waiting period, (C) the commencement or proposed or
threatened commencement of any investigation, administrative or judicial
action or proceeding or Legal Proceeding under the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended (the " _FTC Act_ "), the Clayton Act of 1914, as
amended (the " _Clayton Act_ "), the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as
amended (the " _Sherman Act_ ") or any Foreign Antitrust Law and (D) the
nature and status of any objections raised or proposed or threatened to be
raised under the HSR Act, the FTC Act, the Clayton Act, the Sherman Act or
any Foreign Antitrust Law with respect to this Agreement, the Offer, the
Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) obtaining all
necessary actions or non-actions, waivers, consents, clearances and approvals
from any Governmental Entity. The Company, Parent and Purchaser shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with each other: (1) in promptly
determining whether any filings are required to be or should be made or
consents, approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be or should be
obtained under any other supranational, national, federal, state, foreign or
local Law or regulation or whether any consents, approvals or waivers
are required to be or should be obtained from other parties to loan
agreements or other Contracts material to the Companys business in connection
with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or the consummation of the other
transactions contemplated hereby and (2) in promptly making any such filings,
furnishing information required in connection therewith and seeking to obtain
timely any such consents, permits, authorizations, approvals or waivers.
Parent shall be responsible for all filing fees in connection with the
filings determined to be required by the parties under the HSR Act or any
Foreign Antitrust Law.

 

(b) The Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other
hand, shall: (i) promptly notify each other party of, and if in writing,
furnish the others with copies of (or, in the case of oral communications,
advise the others of the contents of) any communication to such Person from a
Governmental Entity and permit the others to review and discuss in advance
(and to consider in good faith any comments made by the others in relation to)
any proposed written communication to a Governmental Entity and (ii) keep each
other party reasonably informed of any developments, requests for meetings or
discussions with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning the Transactions. The Company, Parent and
Purchaser agree not to participate in any meeting or discussion, either in
person or by telephone, with any Governmental Entity in connection with the
proposed transaction unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Entity or by Law, gives the
other party the opportunity to attend and participate where appropriate and
advisable under the circumstances.

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser shall not be
required to commit to or effect, by consent decree, hold-separate orders or
similar arrangements, trust, or otherwise, conduct of business restrictions,
or the sale or disposition of any assets or businesses in order to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any order, decree
or ruling, that would otherwise have the effect of preventing or delaying the
consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

 



45 (d) In the event that any Legal Proceeding or other administrative
or judicial action is commenced challenging any of the transactions
contemplated hereby and such Legal Proceeding or other action seeks to
prevent, impede or delay the consummation of the Offer, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall cooperate
with Parent and Purchaser and use its best efforts if and as requested by
Parent to contest and resist any such Legal Proceeding or other action and to
have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction
or other order that may result from such litigation, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; 
_provided_ that neither Parent nor Purchaser shall be required to contest or
resist any such Legal Proceeding or other action or to seek to have vacated,
lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order
that may result from such Legal Proceeding or other action, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, nor shall Parent or Purchaser be required to commence any Legal
Proceeding or other action for the purpose of removing any impediment to
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

Section 5.06. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent and Purchaser agree that all rights to indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or
former directors, officers and employees of the Company (each an "
_Indemnified Person_ ") as provided in the Companys certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or under any agreement filed as an exhibit to
a Company SEC Report filed at least two (2) Business Days prior to the date
hereof or listed on _Section_ __ _ 3.17_ of the Disclosure Letter, in each
case, as in effect on the date hereof, for acts or omissions occurring
prior to or at the Effective Time shall be assumed and performed by the
Surviving Corporation and shall continue in full force and effect for a period
not less than six (6) years.

 

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be maintained
in effect for a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, in respect
of acts or omissions occurring prior to or at the Effective Time, the
Companys current directors and officers liability insurance covering each
Person currently covered by the Companys directors and officers liability
insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ that Parent may (i) substitute therefor policies of an insurance
company the material terms of which, including coverage and amount, are no
less favorable in any material respect to such directors and officers than the
Companys existing policies as of the date hereof or (ii) request that the
Company obtain such extended reporting period coverage under its existing
insurance programs (to be effective as of the Effective Time); and _provided_
_further_ that in no event shall Parent or the Company be required to pay
annual premiums for insurance under this  _Section_ __ _ 5.06(b)_ in excess
of 300% of the amount of the annual premiums paid by the Company in fiscal
year 2017 for such purpose, it being understood that Parent shall nevertheless
be obligated to provide as much coverage as may be obtained for such 300%
amount. Prior to the Effective Time, notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, the Company may purchase a six-year "tail" prepaid policy
on the directors and officers liability insurance policies on terms and

 



46  conditions no less advantageous than the directors and officers liability
insurance policies. In the event that the Company purchases such a "tail"
policy prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain such "tail" policy in full force and effect and continue to
honor their respective obligations thereunder, in lieu of all other
obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under the first sentence
of this _Section_ __ _ 5.06(b)_ for so long as such "tail" policy shall be
maintained in full force and effect.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any Indemnified
Person notifies the Surviving Corporation on or prior to the sixth
anniversary of the Effective Time that a claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before, at or after the Effective Time) has
been made against such Indemnified Person, the provisions of this  _Section_
__ _ 5.06_ shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation.

 

(d) This _Section_ __ _ 5.06_ shall survive the acceptance of Company
Shares for payment pursuant to the Offer and the consummation of the Merger
and is intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified
Persons and their respective heirs and legal representatives.

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or Parent or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, shall succeed to the
obligations set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 5.06_. 

Section 5.07. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to assume, honor and fulfill all of the Companys
employment, retention, severance and change in control obligations in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Plan as in effect immediately
prior to the date of this Agreement. In addition, Parent agrees to cause
the Surviving Corporation to pay any earned but unpaid bonuses earned for
2017 in accordance with the Companys annual bonus Plan to the extent such
amounts remain unpaid as of the Closing Date.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date and for a period ending not earlier than
December 31, 2018, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
provide or maintain for employees of the Company who continue in the employ of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries
following the Closing Date (" _Continuing Employees_ "), a base salary or
hourly wage, annual target cash bonus opportunity and employee benefits which,
in the aggregate, are substantially comparable to those provided to the
Continuing Employees immediately prior to Closing (other than benefits
pursuant to any equity compensation plan or defined benefit pension plan), in
each case, subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.07(a)_. This _Section_ __ _ 5.07_
shall not require Parent to maintain any compensation arrangement or benefit
plan for any period of time after Closing. No provision of this Agreement
shall be construed as a guarantee of continued employment of any Continuing
Employee and this Agreement shall not be construed so as to prohibit Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries from having the right to terminate the employment
of any Continuing Employee, provided that any such termination is effected in
accordance with applicable Law.

 



47 (c) From and after the Closing, Parent shall provide, or shall cause
its Subsidiaries to provide, each Continuing Employee full credit for
purposes of eligibility to participate, vesting and accrual of severance
benefits under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries for such Continuing Employees service with the
Company, and with any predecessor employer, to the same extent recognized by
the Company, except (i) to the extent such credit would result in the
duplication of benefits for the same period of service and (ii) for any
purpose under any sabbatical benefit provided by Parent or its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive for each
Continuing Employee and his or her dependents, any waiting period provision,
pre-existing condition limitation, actively at work requirement or any other
restriction that would prevent immediate or full participation under the
health and welfare plans of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries applicable to
such Continuing Employee to the extent such waiting period, pre-existing
condition limitation, actively at work requirement or other restriction would
not have been applicable to such Continuing Employee under the terms of the
welfare plans of the Company, (ii) waive any and all evidence of insurability
requirements (including pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
waiting periods and actively-at-work requirements) with respect to such
Continuing Employees to the extent such evidence of insurability requirements
were not applicable to the Continuing Employees under the Plans immediately
prior to the Closing, and (iii) give full credit under the welfare plans of
Parent and its Subsidiaries applicable to each Continuing Employee and his or
her dependents for all co-payments and deductibles satisfied prior to the
Closing in the same plan year as the Closing, and for any lifetime maximums,
as if there had been a single continuous employer.

(e) If, and only if, requested by Parent at least five (5) days before the
Closing Date, the Company shall take (or cause to be taken) all actions
necessary or appropriate to terminate, effective no later than the day
immediately preceding the Closing Date, the Companys 401(k) Plan. If Parent
so provides notice to the Company, the Company shall deliver to Parent, prior
to the Closing Date, evidence that the Company Board has validly adopted
resolutions to terminate such Plan (the form and substance of which
resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), effective no
later than the date immediately preceding the Closing Date.

 

(f) No provision of this Agreement shall create any third-party beneficiary
or other rights in any current or former employee, director or other service
provider of the Company in respect of any benefits that may be provided,
directly or indirectly, under any Plan or benefit plan of Parent. Nothing
herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to (i)
constitute an amendment to any of the compensation and benefits plans
maintained for or provided to Continuing Employees prior to or following the
Effective Time, (ii) impede or limit Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their Affiliates from amending or terminating any Plan
or other plan, arrangement, policy or agreement following the Effective Time
or (iii) confer upon or give to any Person (including for the avoidance of
doubt any current or former employees, labor unions, directors, or
independent contractors of the Company, or on or after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation or any of its future Subsidiaries), other than the
parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns, any
legal or equitable or other rights or remedies under or by reason of any
provision of this Agreement.

 



48 Section 5.08. _Takeover Laws_. If any Takeover Law may become, or may
purport to be, applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
or the tender and support agreements, the Company and the members of its board
of directors will grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary
so that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the tender and
support agreements may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
and conditions contemplated hereby and thereby and otherwise act to exclude
the applicability of any Takeover Laws and to assist in any challenge by
Parent or Purchaser to the validity or applicability to the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement of any Takeover Laws.

 

Section 5.09. _Stockholder Litigation_. In the event that any stockholder
litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated hereby is brought against the Company and/or its directors, the
Company shall promptly notify Parent of such litigation and shall keep Parent
reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall
give Parent the right to review and comment on all material filings or
responses to be made by the Company in connection with any such stockholder
litigation, the right to participate (at Parents expense) in connection with
any such stockholder litigation, and the right to consult on the settlement
with respect to such stockholder litigation, and the Company will in good
faith take such comments into account, and, no such settlement shall be agreed
to without Parents prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed with respect to any such
settlement that would not alter the terms of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement).

 

Section 5.10. _Press Releases_. The parties agree that the initial press
release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties and
thereafter Parent and the Company shall obtain prior written consent from each
other before issuing any press release, having any communication with the
press (whether or not for attribution) or making any other public statement,
or scheduling any press conference or conference call with investors or
analysts, with respect to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing each party may, without
such consultation or consent, (a) make any such release or announcement as may
be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any applicable U.S. or
non-U.S. securities exchange or regulatory or governmental body to which the
relevant party is subject or submits, in which case the party required to make
the release or announcement shall use its reasonable best efforts to allow
each other party reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in
advance of such issuance, it being understood that the final form and content
of any such release or announcement, to the extent so required, shall be
at the final discretion of the disclosing party and (b) make any public
statement in response to questions from the press, analysts, investors or
those attending industry conferences, make internal announcements to employees
and make disclosures in Company SEC Reports, so long as such statements are
consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements approved by the other party. The restrictions set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall not apply to any release, announcement or
disclosure made or proposed to be made by the Company with respect to an
Acquisition Proposal, Superior Proposal, Intervening Event or Adverse
Recommendation Change.

 



49 Section 5.11. _Rule_ __ _ 16b-3_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, the Company shall be permitted
to take such steps as may be necessary or appropriate to cause the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any disposition of
Shares (including derivative securities with respect to such Shares)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section
16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.12. _Employee Communications_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall not communicate (and shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to ensure that no employee or director of the Company so communicates)
with any employee regarding post-Closing employee benefit plans and
compensation matters, without the prior written approval of Parent, which
shall not be unreasonably withheld.

Section 5.13. _Transfer Taxes_. Parent shall be liable for any
documentary, sales, use, registration, stamp, or other similar transfer Taxes
payable by reason of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement ("
_Transfer Taxes_ "). Parent shall file any Tax Returns with respect to
such Transfer Taxes in the time and manner prescribed by Law. The Company
shall cooperate with the preparation and filing of any such Tax Return with
respect to such Transfer Taxes.

 

Section 5.14. _Rule_ __ _ 14d-10 Matters_. Prior to the Offer Acceptance
Time and to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, the Compensation
Committee of the Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, will
approve, as an "employment compensation, severance or other employee
benefit arrangement" within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the
Exchange Act, each agreement, arrangement or understanding between Purchaser,
the Company or their respective Affiliates and any of the officers, directors
or employees of the Company that are effective as of the Agreement Date or are
entered into after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time pursuant
to which compensation is paid to such officer, director or employee and will
take all other action reasonably necessary to satisfy the requirements of the
non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d) (2) under the
Exchange Act.

Section 5.15. _Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration_. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably
necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable laws and rules and
policies of NASDAQ to enable the delisting by the Surviving Corporation of
the Shares from NASDAQ and the deregistration of the Shares under the Exchange
Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, and in any event no
more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date.

right to terminate under this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(i)_ shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill in any material respect

been the primary cause of, or the primary factor that resulted in, the failure
of the Offer Acceptance Time to occur on or before the Outside Date and (B)
the Company or Parent may extend the Outside Date to a date no later than
September 21, 2018 solely with respect to obtaining the necessary regulatory

or making consummation of the Offer or the Merger illegal and such order,
decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-appealable;

 



51 (c) by the Company at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 

(i) if Parent or Purchaser shall have breached or failed to perform any of
its covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if any
representation or warranty of Parent or Purchaser shall have become untrue,
which breach or failure to perform or to be true, either individually or in
the aggregate, if occurring or continuing at the Offer Acceptance Time (A)
would reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions and
(B) cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier of (1) the Outside Date
and (2) thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to Parent of such
breach or failure; _provided_ that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 7.01(c)(i)_ if it
is then in breach of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements set forth in this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in
clauses (b) or (c) of Annex I would not be satisfied; or

(ii) in order to accept a Superior Proposal and enter into a Specified
Agreement, subject to the prior or concurrent payment of the Termination Fee
as provided in _Section_ __ _ 7.03_;

 

(d) by Parent at any time prior to the Offer Acceptance Time:

 

(i) if the Company shall have breached or failed to perform any of its
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement, or if any representation
or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, which breach or failure
to perform or to be true, either individually or in the aggregate, if
occurring or continuing at the Effective Time (A) would result in the failure
of any of the conditions set forth in clauses (b) or (c) of Annex I and (B)
cannot be or has not been cured by the earlier of (1) the Outside Date and (2)
thirty (30) days after the giving of written notice to the Company of such
breach or failure; _provided_ that Parent shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)(i)_ if
Parent or Purchaser is then in breach of any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement that would
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to prevent,
materially impede or materially delay the consummation of the Transactions;
or

(ii) if, prior to the Offer Acceptance Time, (A) an Adverse
Recommendation Change shall have occurred, (B) the Company Board shall have
formally resolved to make an Adverse Recommendation Change or (C) the Company
Board shall have failed to include the Company Board Recommendation in the
Schedule 14D-9 when mailed.

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this  _Section_ __
_ 7.01_ (other than clause (a) thereof) shall give written notice of
termination to the other party in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 8.05_,
specifying the provision or provisions hereof pursuant to which such
termination is effected.

Section 7.02. _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is terminated
and the Offer and Merger is abandoned pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01_, this
Agreement shall immediately become void and have no effect, without any
liability on the part of any party, _provided_ however, that (a) the

 



52  Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_
(Access to Information), _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ (Press Releases), this 
_Section_ __ _ 7.02_, _Section_ __ _ 7.03_ (Fees and Expenses) and _Article_
__ _ VIII_ (General Provisions) shall survive the termination hereof; (b) no
such termination shall relieve any party from any liability for common law
fraud or Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement prior to the date of
termination, in which case the non-breaching party shall be entitled to all
rights and remedies available at law or in equity; (c) no termination of this
Agreement shall in any way affect any of the parties rights or obligations
with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock accepted for payment

_Section_ __ _ 8.03_ in lieu of terminating this Agreement pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 7.01_.

Section 7.03. _Fees and Expenses_.

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) an Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed and is not withdrawn
(in the case of a termination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(i)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 7.01(d)(i)_, prior to such termination), (B) this Agreement is
terminated by Parent or the Company pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(i)_

months after the date of such termination, the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with a third party with respect to an Acquisition
Transaction and such Acquisition Transaction is consummated, or consummates a
transaction that constitutes an Acquisition Transaction with a third party
(provided, however, that for purposes of this Section 7.03(b)(i), each

being understood that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion.

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company or
Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.01(b)(ii)_ under circumstances in which
the Termination Fee is not then payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _

all of their reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, investment bankers, experts and
consultants to Parent and Purchaser and their Affiliates) incurred by Parent
or Purchaser or on their behalf in connection with or related to the

 



53  authorization, preparation, investigation, negotiation, execution and
performance of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Parent Expenses_ "), up to a maximum amount of $9,680,000; _provided_ that
the payment by the Company of the Parent Expenses pursuant to this _Section_
__ _ 7.03(c)_, shall not relieve the Company of any subsequent obligation to
pay the Termination Fee pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.03(b)_ except to the
extent indicated in such Section.

(d) Payment of the Termination Fee shall be made by wire transfer of same
day funds to the accounts designated by Parent (i) on the consummation of any
transaction contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal, in the case of a
Termination Fee payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.03(b)(i)_, (ii) as
promptly as reasonably practicable after termination (and, in any event,
within two (2) Business Days thereof), in the case of a Termination Fee
payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 7.03(b)(ii)_ or (iii) concurrently with,
and as a condition to the effectiveness of, termination of this Agreement in
the case of a Termination Fee payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _
7.03(b)(iii)_. Payment of the Parent Expenses shall be made by wire transfer
of same day funds to the accounts designated by Parent within two (2) Business
Days after the Companys having been notified of the amounts thereof by
Parent and delivery to the Company of documentation (reasonably satisfactory
to the Company) substantiating such fees and expenses. In the event that
Parent or its designee shall receive payment pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
7.03(d)_, the receipt of the Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated
damages for any and all losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent,
Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person in
connection with this Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Offer and the
Merger (and the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of Parent, Purchaser, any of their respective Affiliates
or any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action
or proceeding against the Company or any of its Affiliates arising out of or
in connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger or any matters
forming the basis for such termination; _provided_ _,_ however, that payment
of the Termination Fee will not be liquidated damages in the case of common
law fraud or a Willful and Material Breach of this Agreement.

 

(e) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
_Section_ __ _ 7.03_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty, and
that, without these agreements, the parties would not have entered into this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.04. _Amendment or Supplement_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented by the consent of all parties by action taken or
authorized by their respective boards of directors at any time prior to the
Offer Acceptance Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that after the Offer
Acceptance Time, no amendment shall be made that pursuant to applicable Law
requires further approval or adoption by the Company Stockholders without such
further approval or adoption. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented in any manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except
by an instrument in writing specifically designated as an amendment hereto,
signed on behalf of each of the parties.

 

Section 7.05. _Extension of Time; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Offer
Acceptance Time, (a) the Company may, by action taken or authorized by the
Company Board, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or

 



54  acts of Parent or Purchaser, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties of Parent or Purchaser set forth in this
Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto or (iii) subject to
applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or
conditions of Parent or Purchaser contained herein, and (b) Parent and
Purchaser may, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards
of directors, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, (i) extend the time
for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of the Company, (ii)
waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in this Agreement or any document delivered pursuant hereto or
(iii) subject to applicable Law, waive compliance with any of the covenants,
agreements or conditions of the Company contained herein; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that after the Offer Acceptance Time, no waiver may be made that
pursuant to applicable Law requires further approval or adoption by the
Company Stockholders without such further approval or adoption. Any agreement
on the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if
set forth in a written instrument executed and delivered by a duly authorized
officer on behalf of such party. No failure or delay of any party in
exercising any right or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof,
nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or power, or any
abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such right or power, or any
course of conduct, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right or power. The rights and remedies of the parties
hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or remedies which
they would otherwise have hereunder.

the rights, interests or obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or
delegated, in whole or in part, by operation of law, by merger or otherwise,
by any party without the prior written consent of the other parties, and any
such assignment without such prior written consent shall be null and void;
