(d) The member interests of the Partnership GP issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time will automatically be cancelled and no

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time, all Partnership Common Units (if any) owned by the Partnership

consideration will be received therefor.

3.2 Rights As Unitholders; Unit Transfers.

(a) All Partnership Common Units converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1(c) will cease to be outstanding
and will automatically be canceled and will cease to exist when converted as a
result of and pursuant to the Mergers. At the Effective Time, subject to
Section 3.1(f), each holder of a certificate representing Partnership Common
Units, (a "Certificate") and each holder of non-certificated Partnership
Common Units (other than any Parent Affiliate Units), represented by book-
entry ("Book-Entry Units"), will cease to be a unitholder of the Partnership
and cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive
(a) the Merger Consideration, and the right to be admitted as an additional
limited partner in connection therewith, (b) any cash to be paid in lieu of
any fractional Parent Common Unit in accordance with Section 3.3(d), and (c)
any distributions in accordance with Section 3.3(c), in each case, to be
issued or paid, without interest, in consideration therefor in accordance with
Section 3.3. In addition holders as of the relevant record date of Partnership
Common Units outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time will have
continued rights to any distribution, without interest, with respect to such
Partnership Common Units with a record date occurring prior to the Effective
Time that may have been declared or made by the Partnership with respect to
such units in accordance with the terms of the Existing Partnership Agreement
and this Agreement and which remains unpaid as of the Effective Time. Such
distributions by the Partnership are not part of the Merger Consideration, and
will be paid on the payment date set therefor to such holders of Partnership
Common Units whether or not they exchange their Partnership Common Units
pursuant to Section 3.3. At the Effective Time, the unit transfer books of the
Partnership will be closed immediately and there will be no further
registration of transfers on the unit transfer books of the Partnership with
respect to Partnership Common Units.

(b) All member interests of the Partnership GP cancelled pursuant to Section
3.1(d) will cease to be outstanding and will cease to exist as a result of and

Parent will cease to be the sole member of the Partnership GP and cease to
have any rights with respect thereto. At the Effective Time, the member
interest transfer books of the Partnership GP will be closed immediately and
there will be no further registration of transfers on the member interest
transfer books of the Partnership GP.

3.3 Exchange of Certificates.

(a) Exchange Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent will appoint a
commercial bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Partnership to
act as exchange agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging applicable
Partnership Common Units for the Merger Consideration as required by this
Article III (the "Exchange Agent"). Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
will deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the
benefit of the holders of the applicable Partnership Common Units, for
exchange in accordance with this Article III, through the Exchange Agent,
Parent Common Units and cash as required by this



21







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



Article III. Parent agrees to make available to the Exchange Agent, from time
to time as needed, cash sufficient to pay any distributions pursuant to
Section 3.3(c) and to make payments in lieu of any fractional Parent Common
Units pursuant to Section 3.3(d), in each case without interest. Any cash
(including as payment for any fractional Parent Common Units in accordance
with Section 3.3(d) and any distributions with respect to such fractional
Parent Common Units in accordance with Section 3.3(c)) and Parent Common Units
deposited with the Exchange Agent are hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange
Fund." The Exchange Agent will, pursuant to irrevocable instructions from
Parent, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid for
Partnership Common Units pursuant to this Agreement out of the Exchange Fund.
Except as contemplated by Sections 3.3(c) and 3.3(d), the Exchange Fund will
not be used for any other purpose. Parent or its designee shall pay all
charges and expenses of the Exchange Agent in connection with the provisions
of this Article III.

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will
instruct the Exchange Agent to mail to each record holder of Partnership
Common Units as of the Effective Time (other than the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries and Parent and its Subsidiaries and any holder of Parent
Affiliate Units) (i) a letter of transmittal (specifying that in respect of
certificated Partnership Common Units, delivery will be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which will be in customary form and
agreed to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) (the
"Letter of Transmittal") and (ii) instructions (in customary form and agreed
to by Parent and the Partnership prior to the Effective Time) for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units in exchange
for the Merger Consideration payable in respect of Partnership Common Units
represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry Units, as applicable. Promptly
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of Certificates, if any, for
cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such letters of transmittal,
properly completed and duly executed, and such other documents (including in
respect of Book-Entry Units) as may be reasonably required pursuant to such
instructions, each holder who held Partnership Common Units immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and
Parent and its Subsidiaries and any holder of Parent Affiliate Units) will be
entitled to receive upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Units
therefor (A) Parent Common Units representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of Parent Common Units that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to this Article III (after taking into account all Partnership Common
Units then held by such holder) and (B) a check in an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to
this Article III, including cash payable in lieu of any fractional Parent
Common Units pursuant to Section 3.3(d) and distributions pursuant to Section
3.3(c). No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, any
cash payment in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units, or any Parent
distributions payable pursuant to Section 3.3(c). In the event of a transfer
of ownership of Partnership Common Units that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Partnership, the Merger Consideration, payable in
respect of such Partnership Common Units may be paid to a transferee, if the
Certificate representing such Partnership Common Units or evidence of
ownership of the Book-Entry Units is presented to the Exchange Agent, and in
the case of both certificated and book-entry Partnership Common Units,
accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence and effect such
transfer and the Person requesting such exchange will pay to the Exchange
Agent in advance any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
delivery of the Merger Consideration,



22







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



in any name other than that of the record holder of such Partnership Common
Units, or will establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
Taxes have been paid or are not payable. Until such required documentation has
been delivered and Certificates, if any, have been surrendered, as
contemplated by this Section 3.3, each Certificate or Book-Entry Unit will be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such delivery and surrender the Merger Consideration, payable in
respect of Partnership Common Units, and (without the necessity of such
surrender) any cash or distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant
to Section 3.3.

(c) Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Partnership Common Units. No
distributions declared or made with respect to Parent Common Units with a
record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any
Partnership Common Units with respect to Parent Common Units that such holder
would be entitled to receive in accordance herewith and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional Parent Common Units will be paid to any such holder until
such holder has delivered the required documentation and surrendered any
Certificates or Book-Entry Units as contemplated by this Section 3.3. Subject
to applicable Law, following compliance with the requirements of Section
3.3(b), there will be paid to such holder of Parent Common Units issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (i) promptly after the time of such
compliance, the amount of any cash payable in lieu of fractional Parent Common
Units to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(d) (which shall
be paid by the Exchange Agent as provided therein) and the amount of
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid
with respect to Parent Common Units and payable with respect to such Parent
Common Units, and (ii) promptly after such compliance, or, if later, at the
appropriate payment date, the amount of distributions with a record date after
the Effective Time but prior to such delivery and surrender and a payment date
subsequent to such compliance payable with respect to such Parent Common Units
(which shall be paid by Parent).

(d) Fractional Parent Common Units. No certificates or scrip of Parent Common
Units representing fractional Parent Common Units or book entry credit of the
same will be issued upon the surrender of Partnership Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time in accordance with Section 3.3(b), and
such fractional interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
have any rights as a holder of any Parent Common Units. Notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, each holder of Partnership Common Units
converted in the Mergers who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a
fraction of a Parent Common Unit (after taking into account all Partnership
Common Units exchanged by such holder) will receive, in lieu thereof, cash
(without interest rounded up to the nearest whole cent) in an amount equal to
the product of (i) the Average Closing Price as of the Closing Date and (ii)
the fraction of a Parent Common Unit that such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive pursuant to this Article III. As promptly as practicable
after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of fractional interests, Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to forward
payments to such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance
with the terms hereof. The Parties acknowledge that payment of the cash in
lieu of issuing fractional shares of Parent Common Units was not separately
bargained-for consideration but merely represents a mechanical rounding off
for purposes of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent that would
otherwise be caused by the issuance of fractional Parent Common Units.



23







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



(e) Further Rights in Partnership Common Units. The Merger Consideration
issued upon conversion of a Partnership Common Unit in accordance with the
terms hereof (including any cash paid pursuant to Section 3.3(d)) and any
declared distributions to be paid on Parent Common Units as described in
Section 3.3(c) will be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Partnership Common Unit.

(f) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains undistributed to the holders of Partnership Common Units after one (1)
year following the Effective Time will be delivered to Parent upon demand by
Parent and, from and after such delivery, any former holders of Partnership
Common Units who have not theretofore complied with this Article III will
thereafter look only to Parent for the Merger Consideration, payable in
respect of such Partnership Common Units, any cash in lieu of fractional
Parent Common Units to which they are entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(d), or
any distributions with respect to Parent Common Units to which they are
entitled pursuant to Section 3.3(c), in each case, without any interest
thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Partnership Common
Units immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat
to or become the property of any governmental entity will, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, be held by Parent. Without limitation of the
foregoing, after one (1) year following the Effective Time any amounts
remaining unclaimed by holders of Partnership Common Units will become the
property of Parent, subject to the legitimate claims of any Person previously
entitled thereto under abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

(g) Lost Certificates. If any Certificate is lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if reasonably required by
Parent, the posting by such Person of an indemnity agreement or a bond, in a
customary amount, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it
with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration payable
in respect of Partnership Common Units represented by such Certificate and any
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section
3.3(c).

(h) Withholding. Parent and the Exchange Agent are entitled to deduct and
withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any holder of Partnership Common Units such amounts as Parent or the
Exchange Agent reasonably deems to be required to deduct and withhold under
the Code or any provision of state or local Tax Law, with respect to the
making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted and
withheld and timely remitted to the appropriate taxing authority, such amounts
will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of Partnership Common Units in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding was made by the Exchange Agent.

(i) Book Entry and Admission of Holders of Parent Common Units as Additional
Limited Partners of Parent. All Parent Common Units to be issued in the
Mergers will be issued in book-entry form, without physical certificates. Upon
the issuance of Parent Common Units to the holders of Partnership Common Units
in accordance with this Section 3.3, and the compliance by such holders with
the requirements of the Parent Agreement, which requirements may be satisfied
by each holder of Parent Common Units by the execution and delivery by such
holder of a completed



24







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



and executed Letter of Transmittal, Parent will be deemed to have
automatically consented to the admission of such holder as a member of Parent
in respect of its Parent Common Units and will reflect such admission on the
books and records of Parent.

(j) Investment of the Exchange Fund. Parent will cause the Exchange Agent to
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis in (i) short
term direct obligations of the United States of America with maturities of no
more than thirty (30) days, (ii) short term obligations for which the full
faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to provide for
payment of all principal and interest or (iii) commercial paper obligations
receiving the highest rating from either Moody's Investor Services, Inc. or
Standard and Poor's; provided, however, that no such investment or loss thereon
affects the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to the
Partnership Unitholders pursuant to the other provisions of this Section 3.3.
Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be paid
promptly to Parent.

(k) Tax Characterization of Partnership Merger. The Partnership and Parent
each acknowledges and agrees that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes each of
the holders of Partnership Common Units that exchanges its Partnership Common
Units pursuant to the Partnership Merger will be deemed to contribute its
Partnership Common Units to Parent in exchange for the Merger Consideration
(including any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent Common Units
pursuant to Section 3.3(d)) and the deemed assumption of each such holder's
share of the liabilities of the Partnership. The Partnership and Parent each
acknowledges and agrees that for U.S. federal income Tax purposes such deemed
transaction will qualify in part for nonrecognition of gain or loss pursuant
to Section 721 of the Code and will be characterized as a disguised sale
transaction described in Section 707(a)(2)(B) of the Code with respect to any
amounts treated as a transfer of consideration pursuant to Treasury Regulation
Section 1.707-3(a)(1) (the "Section 707 Consideration," which, for the
avoidance of doubt, includes, any cash received in lieu of fractional Parent
Common Units pursuant to Section 3.3(d), the Cash Consideration and any amount
of liabilities other than "qualified liabilities" (within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.707-5(a)(6)) deemed to be assumed as part of
such transaction) (such sale, a "Disguised Sale"). Each of the Partnership and
Parent agrees to prepare and file all U.S. federal income Tax Returns in
accordance with the foregoing and shall not take any position inconsistent
therewith on any such Tax Return, or in the course of any audit, litigation or
other proceeding with respect to U.S. federal income Taxes, except as
otherwise required by applicable Laws following a Final Determination.

(l) Pasadena Distribution. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, in the event that the Pasadena Distribution occurs, the Mergers
shall not affect the right of any holder of Partnership Common Units as of the
record time for the Pasadena Distribution to receive its share of SpinCo
Common Units pursuant to the Pasadena Distribution.

3.4 Anti-Dilution Provisions. Without limiting the covenants in Sections 6.1
and 6.2, in the event the outstanding Partnership Common Units or Parent
Common Units shall have been changed into a different number of units or a
different class after the date hereof by reason of any subdivisions,
reclassifications, splits, unit distributions, combinations or exchanges of
Partnership Common Units or Parent Common Units, the Merger Consideration will
be correspondingly



25







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



adjusted to provide to the holders of such Partnership Common Units the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

3.5 Treatment of Phantom Units. Prior to the Effective Time, the Partnership
Board (or any committee responsible for administering the Partnership LTIP)
shall pass resolutions to effect any necessary actions required by this
Section 3.5.

(a) Continuing Employees. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, all
outstanding Phantom Units that are held by any Employee who is a Continuing
Employee will be automatically cancelled and forfeited in exchange solely for
the consideration contemplated by this Section 3.5(a). At the Effective Time,
Parent shall grant a replacement incentive award to each such Continuing
Employee that was required to forfeit such Continuing Employee's Phantom Units
pursuant to the preceding sentence which replacement incentive award is equal
in value (determined by reference to the closing price of the units underlying
such replacement award (on the primary exchange on which such units are
traded) on the Closing Date) to the aggregate value of such Continuing
Employee's cancelled and forfeited Phantom Units (such value to be determined
by multiplying the Closing Date value of the Merger Consideration per
Partnership Common Unit by the number of Phantom Units cancelled and forfeited
by such Continuing Employee in accordance with this Section 3.5(a)). The new
incentive award will be granted under the Parent LTIP in the form of a
"Phantom Unit" as defined under the Parent LTIP, and will be subject to
substantially the same terms and conditions (including without limitation,
applicable vesting and payment timing provisions) as those applicable to the
cancelled and forfeited Phantom Units as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, and shall otherwise be subject to the terms of the Parent LTIP. All new
incentive awards granted under the Parent LTIP pursuant to Section 3.5(a)
shall be designed to be compliant with or exempt from, as applicable, Section
409A of the Code. For the avoidance of doubt, any then-accumulated
distribution equivalents payable upon a subsequent vesting date pursuant to
distribution equivalent rights linked to any Phantom Unit forfeited in
accordance with this Section 3.5(a) shall be paid by Parent to the Continuing
Employee upon the vesting of the Parent "Phantom Unit" corresponding to such
forfeited Phantom Unit.

(b) Employees That Will Not Be Continuing Employees and Partnership Board
Members. Each Phantom Unit granted under the Partnership LTIP and held by (i)
an Employee who is terminated at the Effective Time and does not become a
Continuing Employee or (ii) any member of the Partnership Board, in any case,
that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest in full and be cancelled and, in consideration therefor, the
holder of such Phantom Unit shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration. In addition, any then-accumulated distribution equivalents
payable pursuant to distribution equivalent rights with respect to each
Phantom Unit that vests pursuant to this Section 3.5(b) shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest in full and be paid to the holder thereof in cash.

Subsidiaries as set forth in Section 4.1 of the Partnership Disclosure
Schedule, neither the Partnership nor Partnership GP owns beneficially,

(a) Each of the Partnership Entities has the requisite limited partnership or
limited liability company power and authority, as applicable, to execute,

maintains internal control over financial reporting and disclosure controls
and procedures (as such terms are defined in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under
the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to
ensure that material information relating to the Partnership, including its
Included Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and
communicated to the Partnership's principal executive officer and its
principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Partnership in the
reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC

which would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit
under, or acceleration of an obligation of the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries under, any Partnership Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew, extend,
any Partnership Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time

Parent Material Adverse Effect. Copies of the Organizational Documents of each

the Securities Act, Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may

such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that
information required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or

Section 5.12), Parent and its Subsidiaries are, and since December 31, 2012
have been, in compliance with all, and are and were not in default under or in
violation of any, applicable Law, other than any noncompliance, default or
violation that has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

its Subsidiaries under, any Parent Permit, or has caused (or would cause) an
applicable Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew, extend,
any Parent Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or

failures that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (iv) obtain all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, nothing in this Agreement shall require the
Partnership Entities or the Parent Entities to pay any consideration to a
third party

from whom consent, approval or waiver is requested. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Antitrust Laws" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton
Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended,
and all other applicable Laws issued by a Governmental Authority that are
designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening of
competition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable and in any event within ten (10) Business Days
after the date of this Agreement and to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the HSR Act or any other
Antitrust Law and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions
consistent with this Section 6.3 necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date). Parent will pay
any HSR Act filing fee.

(c) Each of the Parties hereto will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
(i) cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission with a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any proceeding initiated by a
private Person, (ii) promptly inform the Other Parties of (and supply to the
Other Parties) any communication received by such Party from, or given by such
Party to, the Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice, or any other Governmental Authority and any material
communication received or given in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, in each case regarding the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) permit the Other Parties to review in advance and incorporate
the Other Parties' reasonable comments in any communication to be given by it
to any Governmental Authority with respect to obtaining any clearances
required under any Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and (iv) where reasonably practicable, consult with the
Other Parties in advance of any meeting or teleconference with any
Governmental Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private
Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not prohibited by the
Governmental Authority or other Person, where reasonably practicable, give the
Other Parties the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
teleconferences. The Parties will take reasonable efforts to share information
protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product
doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this
Section 6.3(c) in a manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege.

(d) Parent agrees to take, or cause to be taken (including by its
Subsidiaries), any and all steps and to make, or cause to be made (including
by its Subsidiaries), any and all undertakings necessary to resolve
objections, if any, that a Governmental Authority may assert under any
Antitrust Law with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to
avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Law that may
be asserted by any Governmental Authority with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, in each

case, so as to enable the Closing to occur as promptly as practicable and in
any event no later than the Outside Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Parent will be under no obligation to propose, negotiate, commit to or effect,
by consent decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
disposition of any assets, equity interests, product lines or properties of
Parent (or any of its Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Entities (or any of their
Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in any joint venture held by Parent (or
any of its Subsidiaries) or the Surviving Entities. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, any agreement entered into by Parent prior to the Closing with
respect to any action that limits the Surviving Entities' (or any of their
Subsidiaries') freedom of action with respect to, or ability to conduct,
directly or indirectly, any of the businesses, assets, equity interests,
product lines or properties of the Surviving Entities (or any of their
Subsidiaries) or any equity interest in any joint venture held by the
Surviving Entities (or any of their Subsidiaries) (each, a "Compliance
Action") shall provide that the consummation of the transactions provided for
in any such agreement for a Compliance Action will be conditioned upon the
Closing or satisfaction of all of the conditions to the Closing in a case
where the Closing will occur immediately following such Compliance Action (and
where Parent has irrevocably committed to effect the Closing immediately
following such Compliance Action). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, nothing in this Section 6.3 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall require Parent or any of its Affiliates to take or agree to take any
action that would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect
on Parent, its Subsidiaries, the Partnership and its Subsidiaries and their
respective businesses, taken as a whole.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 6.3, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of Parent and the
Partnership will use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist any
such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned
any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of Parent and the Partnership shall
reasonably cooperate and consult each other in good faith on any material
decisions in the defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
through any investigation or litigation by, or negotiation with, any
Governmental Authority or private Person, including pursuant to any Antitrust
Laws (and with respect thereto, including any determination in respect of the
scope of any offered remedy and the timing of any such offer), provided that
Parent shall have the right to take any of the actions described in this
subclause (e), if after good faith efforts to secure agreement from the
Partnership, the parties fail to reach an agreement.

(f) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in this Section 6.3, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding, including any proceeding by a private Person, is instituted (or
threatened to be instituted) challenging the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement other than such actions or proceedings contemplated by Section
6.3(e) ("Transaction Litigation"), such Party against whom the action or
proceeding has been brought or that has knowledge of such action or
proceeding, shall promptly notify the Other Party thereof. Each of Parent and
the Partnership shall reasonably cooperate and consult each other in good
faith on any material decisions in the defense of any Transaction Litigation,
and neither Parent



47

or the Partnership Entities shall settle, compromise, come to an arrangement
regarding or agree to settle, compromise or come to an arrangement regarding
any such Transaction Litigation, without the Other Party's prior written
consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed); provided, however, that the Partnership may settle any Transaction
Litigation without the prior written consent of Parent if such settlement
provides (i) for a complete release of the claims, if any, related to or
against the Partnership Entities, all directors and officers of the
Partnership Entities, and all other Indemnitees, and the Parent, Parent GP and
all of their respective directors, officers and Affiliates and (ii) that the
sole remedy shall be monetary damages not to exceed $750,000 (not including
amounts covered by insurance).

6.4 Registration Statement; Proxy Statement.

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement (but no later
than twenty (20) Business Days after the date of this Agreement unless
otherwise mutually agreed by the Parties), the Partnership and Parent will
prepare and file with the SEC the Proxy Statement, and the Partnership and
Parent will prepare and Parent will file with the SEC the Registration
Statement, in which the Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus. Each
of the Partnership and Parent will use its commercially reasonable efforts to
have the Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as
promptly as practicable after such filing and keep the Registration Statement
effective for so long as necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Parent also agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
any necessary state securities law or "Blue Sky" permits and approvals
required to carry out the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Partnership will use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Proxy
Statement to be mailed to the Partnership Unitholders as promptly as
practicable after the Registration Statement is declared effective under the
Securities Act. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Registration
Statement will be made by Parent, and no filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, the Proxy Statement will be made by the Partnership without providing the
Other Parties a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any information relating to the
Partnership or Parent, or any of their respective Affiliates, directors or
officers, is discovered by the Partnership or Parent that should be set forth
in an amendment or supplement to either the Registration Statement or the
Proxy Statement, so that either such document would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information will
promptly notify the Other Parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information will be promptly filed with the SEC
and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to the Partnership
Unitholders. The Parties will (i) notify each other promptly of the receipt of
any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC and of any request by the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or the Registration Statement or for additional information, (ii)
use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly respond to such comments and
(iii) will supply each other with copies of (A) all correspondence between it
or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of
the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement, the
Registration Statement or the transactions contemplated hereby and (B) all
orders of the SEC relating to the Registration Statement.

(b) The Partnership will, as soon as reasonably practicable following the date
of this Agreement, establish a record date for, and as soon as reasonably
practicable following the Registration Statement being declared effective by
the SEC, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold, the Partnership Meeting.
The Partnership Meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable, and, if
reasonably practicable, shall be held within forty-five (45) days after the
mailing of the Proxy Statement. Subject to Section 6.5, the Partnership will,
through the Partnership Board, (x) determine that it is in the best interests
of the Partnership and the Partnership Unitholders, and declare it advisable,
to enter into this Agreement and (y) recommend adoption of this Agreement by
the Partnership Unitholders (the "Partnership Board Recommendation"). The
Proxy Statement shall include (i) a copy of the Partnership Fairness Opinion
and (ii) subject to Section 6.5, the Partnership Board Recommendation. Subject
to the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Article VIII, the
Partnership's obligations to call, give notice of and hold the Partnership
Meeting in accordance with this Section 6.4 shall not be limited by the
making, commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission of any Superior
Proposal or Alternative Proposal, or by any Partnership Change in
Recommendation. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Partnership agrees that: (A) unless this Agreement is validly terminated in
accordance with Article VIII (including, if applicable, upon payment of the
fees and expenses required by Article VIII), the Partnership shall not submit
any Alternative Proposal (other than one proposed by the Parent Entities) to a
vote of the Partnership Unitholders; and (B) it shall not adjourn, postpone or
cancel (or propose, publicly or otherwise, or resolve to, to adjourn, postpone
or cancel) the Partnership Meeting, except: (1) in the absence of proxies
sufficient to obtain the Partnership Unitholder Approval, to solicit
additional proxies for the purpose of obtaining Partnership Unitholder
Approval, (2) in the absence of a quorum or (3) to allow reasonable additional
time for the filing and/or mailing of any supplemental or amended disclosure
that the Partnership has determined after consultation with outside legal
counsel is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by the Partnership Unitholders
prior to Partnership Meeting; provided, however, that in each case, the
Partnership shall not be permitted to adjourn, postpone or delay the
Partnership Meeting to a date after the date that is two (2) Business Days
prior to the Outside Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, if there occurs a Partnership Change in Recommendation, the
Partnership shall remain required to call, hold and convene the Partnership
Meeting unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

6.5 Alternative Proposals; Change in Recommendation.

(a) The Partnership Entities will, and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries and directors, officers, and employees, and will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause their respective other Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations
with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to an Alternative Proposal.
Except as permitted by this Section 6.5, the Partnership Entities will not,
and will cause their respective Subsidiaries and directors, officers and
employees not to, and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause their
respective other Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by providing
information or granting any waiver, amendment or release under any Takeover
Law) any inquiry, proposal or offer that would reasonably be expected to lead
to an Alternative Proposal, or (ii) participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish (or afford access to) to any Person (other
than the Parent Entities



49







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



and their Representatives) any non-public information that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Alternative Proposal. The Partnership Entities
agree that any such discussions or negotiations (other than negotiations with
the Parent Entities and their Representatives) in progress as of the date of
this Agreement have been terminated prior to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement. Promptly following the date hereof, the Partnership Entities
shall: (A) withdraw and terminate access that was granted to any Person (other
than the Parent Entities and their Representatives) to any "data room"
(virtual or physical) that was established in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) exercise any contractual rights
available to any of them to cause each Person (other than the Parent Entities
and their Representatives) who received non-public or confidential information
of any of the Partnership Entities or any of their Subsidiaries to cause such
Persons to promptly return to the Partnership Entities or destroy such
information. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 6.5, if at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Partnership Unitholder Approval, (1) the Partnership has
received a written Alternative Proposal, which was not solicited after the
date of this Agreement, that the Partnership Board believes is bona fide and
did not result from a breach of this Section 6.5 and (2) the Partnership
Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal constitutes
or could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal,
then the Partnership may, subject to clauses (x) and (y) below, (I) furnish
information, including confidential information, with respect to the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Alternative
Proposal and (II) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding such
Alternative Proposal; provided that (x) (I) at least 24 hours prior to
furnishing non-public information to, or entering into discussions or
negotiations with, such Person, the Partnership gives Parent written notice of
the identity of such Person, and the Partnership's intention to furnish non-
public information to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person and (II) the Partnership received from such Person, and delivers to
Parent a copy of, an executed confidentiality agreement containing provisions,
including limitations on the use and disclosure of non-public written and oral
information furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Partnership, not
materially less favorable to the Partnership than the provisions of the
Confidentiality Agreements and (y) the Partnership will provide to Parent any
non-public information about the Partnership and its Subsidiaries that was not
previously provided or made available to Parent prior to or substantially
concurrently with providing or making available such non-public information to
such other Person.

(b) In addition to the obligations of the Partnership set forth in this
Section 6.5, the Partnership will promptly (and in no event later than twenty-
four (24) hours after receipt) advise Parent in writing if any proposal, offer
or inquiry is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated with, the Partnership
Entities in respect of any Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice
to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer, or
inquiry and the terms and conditions of any proposals or offers (and shall
include with such notice copies of any written materials received from or on
behalf of such Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request),
and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all material
developments affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests (and the Partnership Entities shall promptly, and in any
event within twenty-four (24) hours, provide Parent with copies of any
additional written materials received by the Partnership Entities or that the
Partnership Entities have delivered to any third party



50







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



making an Alternative Proposal that relate to such proposals, offers,
inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such discussions or
negotiations. The Partnership Entities agree that neither Partnership Entity
nor any of the Subsidiaries of the Partnership will enter into any agreement
with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the
Partnership from providing any information to Parent in accordance with this
Section 6.5.

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 6.5, the
Partnership Board will not: (i) (A) withdraw, modify or qualify (or publicly
propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent, the
Partnership Board Recommendation, (B) fail to include the Partnership Board
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (C) publicly approve or recommend, or
publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Alternative Proposal (any action
described in this Section 6.5(c)(i) being referred to as a "Partnership Change
in Recommendation"); (ii) approve, adopt or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve, adopt or recommend, or allow the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement,
or other similar contract or any tender or exchange offer providing for, with
respect to, or in connection with, any Alternative Proposal; or (iii) resolve,
agree or publicly propose to, or permit the Partnership or any Representative
of the Partnership to agree or publicly propose to take any of the actions
referred to in this Section 6.5(c). For the avoidance of doubt, a public
statement that describes the Partnership's receipt of an Alternative Proposal
and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto shall not be deemed a
Partnership Change in Recommendation.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if, prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, the Partnership receives a written Alternative Proposal
(and such proposal is not withdrawn) that the Partnership Board believes is
bona fide, did not result from any breach of this Section 6.5 and the
Partnership Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, concludes that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, and that the failure to effect a Partnership Change in
Recommendation would result in a breach of its duties under applicable Law,
then the Partnership Board may at any time prior to obtaining the Partnership
Unitholder Approval, effect a Partnership Change in Recommendation; provided,
however, that the Partnership Board may not take such action pursuant to the
foregoing unless:

(i) the Partnership has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal) and delivering to Parent a copy of
the proposed definitive agreement providing for the Alternative Proposal for
such Superior Proposal in the form to be entered into and any other relevant
proposed transaction agreements, at least three (3) Business Days in advance
of its intention to take such action with respect to a Partnership Change in
Recommendation, unless at the time such notice is otherwise required to be
given there are less than three (3) Business Days prior to the Partnership
Meeting, in which case the Partnership will provide as much notice as is
reasonably practicable (the period inclusive of all such days, the "Notice
Period") (it being understood and agreed that any material amendment to the
terms of Alternative Proposal shall require a new notice pursuant to this
Section 6.5(d) and a new Notice Period, except that such new



51







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



Notice Period in connection with any such amendment shall be for two (2)
Business Days from the time Parent receives such notice (as opposed to three
(3) Business Days)); and

(ii) during the Notice Period the Partnership has negotiated (and has used its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its financial and legal advisors to
negotiate) with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to
negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
determination of the Partnership Board, after consultation with its financial
advisors and outside legal counsel) a Superior Proposal.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Partnership or the
Partnership Board from taking and disclosing to the Partnership Unitholders a
position with respect to an Alternative Proposal initiated by a Person other
than the Parent Entities contemplated by Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to the
Partnership Unitholders) or from making any legally required disclosure to
Partnership Unitholders. Any "stop-look-and-listen" communication by the
Partnership or the Partnership Board to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant
to Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar
communication to the Partnership Unitholders) will not (to the extent required
or reasonably advisable under applicable Law to be made by the Partnership or
the Partnership Board) in and of itself be considered a failure to make, or a
withdrawal, modification or change in any manner adverse to Parent, the
Partnership Board Recommendation.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

(i) "Alternative Proposal" means any proposal or offer from any Person or
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent
and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
assets of the Partnership equal to 15% or more of the consolidated assets of
the Partnership or to which 15% or more of the Partnership's revenues or
earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions) of beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of
the Exchange Act) of 15% or more of any class of the Partnership's equity
securities, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of the Partnership's equity
securities, or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Partnership or its Subsidiaries which is structured to permit
such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least 15% of the
Partnership's consolidated assets or equity interests; in each case, other
than the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, an
"Alternative Proposal" shall not include any proposal or offer relating solely
to a Qualified Pasadena Sale and not involving, directly or indirectly, the
transfer of any assets of or interests in the Included Subsidiaries.

(ii) "Superior Proposal" means an unsolicited written offer, obtained after
the date of this Agreement and not obtained as a result of a breach of this
Section 6.5, to acquire, directly or indirectly, and which is not subject to
any financing condition, more than 75% of the outstanding equity securities of
the Partnership or more than 75% of the assets of the Partnership



52







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



and its Subsidiaries, made by a third party, which is on terms and conditions
which the Partnership Board determines in good faith, after consultation with
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, to be more favorable from a
financial point of view to the Partnership Unitholders than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account at the time of
determination, (A) relevant financial considerations, (B) the identity of the
Person making such offer, (C) the anticipated timing, conditions and
prospectus for completion of the transactions contemplated by such offer, (D)
the other terms and conditions of such offer and the implications thereof on
the Partnership, including relevant legal, regulatory and other aspects of
such offer, and (E) any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that
time had been committed to be made by Parent in writing.

(g) All of the "standstill" provisions, if any, included in each effective
confidentiality agreement that the Partnership or the Partnership GP entered
into prior to the date hereof automatically terminate upon entry into this
Agreement by the terms of such confidentiality agreements.

6.6 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

(a) Upon reasonable notice, each Party shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to afford to the Other Parties and their Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours (and, with respect to books and
records, the right to copy) to all of its and its Subsidiaries' properties,
books, contracts and records, officers, accountants, counsel, financial
advisors and other Representatives. Any request for access to any facility-
level employee of a Party or any of such Party's Subsidiaries shall be
submitted or directed exclusively to (and shall be subject to the prior
consent of) (i) with respect to facility-level employees of the Partnership or
its Subsidiaries, Joe Herold or such other individuals as the Partnership may
designate in writing from time to time and (ii) with respect to facility-level
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries, William White or such other
individuals as Parent may designate in writing from time to time. Each Party
shall furnish promptly to the Other Parties (A) a copy of each report,
schedule and other document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the
requirements of federal or state securities Laws and a copy of any
communication (including "comment letters") received by such Party from the
SEC concerning compliance with securities Laws and (B) all other information
concerning its and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel in its
possession or control as the Other Parties may reasonably request (including
information necessary to prepare the Proxy Statement and the Registration
Statement).

(b) This Section 6.6 shall not require either Party to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of such Party
would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any contract or
Law to which such Party or its Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause
any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to
such information and such undermining of such privilege could in such Party's
good faith judgment (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house
counsel) adversely affect in any material respect such Party's position in any
pending or, what such Party believes in good faith (after consultation with
counsel, which may be



53







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



in-house counsel) is reasonably expected to be, future litigation or (ii) if
such Party or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Other Parties
or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand, are adverse parties in a
litigation, such information being reasonably pertinent thereto; provided
that, in the case of clause (i), the Parties hereto shall cooperate in seeking
to find a way to allow disclosure of such information (including by entering
into a joint-defense or similar agreement) to the extent doing so (A) would
not (in the good faith belief of the Party being requested to disclose the
information (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel))
reasonably be expected to result in the violation of any such contract or Law
or reasonably be expected to cause such privilege to be undermined with
respect to such information or (B) could reasonably (in the good faith belief
of the Party being requested to disclose the information (after consultation
with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be managed through the use of
customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to which non-employee
Representatives of the Other Parties shall be provided access to such
information; provided, further, that the Party being requested to disclose the
information shall (x) notify the Other Parties that such disclosures are
reasonably expected to violate its or its Subsidiaries' obligations under any
such contract or Law or are reasonably expected to cause such privilege to be
undermined and (y) communicate to the Other Parties in reasonable detail the
facts giving rise to such notification and the subject matter of such
information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance with the first
proviso in this Section 6.6(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in
this Section 6.6 shall require any Party to permit any access for Phase II
environmental site assessments or other environmental sampling.

6.7 Public Statements. The initial press release with respect to the execution
of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be reasonably agreed upon
by Parent and the Partnership. Parent and the Partnership will not, and each
of the foregoing will cause its Representatives not to, issue any public
announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, without the prior written approval of the
Parties; provided, however, that a Party or its Representatives may issue a
public announcement or other public disclosures required by applicable Law or
the rules of any stock exchange upon which such Party's or its parent entity's
capital stock is traded, provided such Party uses commercially reasonable
efforts to afford the Other Parties an opportunity to first review the content
of the proposed disclosure and provide reasonable comments regarding same;
provided, however, that this Section 6.7 shall not be deemed to restrict in
any manner the Partnership's ability to communicate with its employees and
that the Partnership shall not be required by this Section 6.7 to consult with
any Other Parties with respect to a public announcement in connection with the
receipt and existence of an Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto
or a Partnership Change in Recommendation. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing in this Section 6.7 limits the obligations of the Partnership under
Section 6.5.

6.8 Confidentiality. The obligations of the applicable Affiliate of Parent and
the Partnership Entities under the Confidentiality Agreements shall remain in
full force and effect and all information provided to Parent or its
Representatives pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement is deemed to
be "Evaluation Material" as defined under the Confidentiality Agreements;
provided, however, that nothing in the Confidentiality Agreements shall be
deemed to restrict the performance by the Parties of their respective
obligations under this Agreement, and in the case of



54







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



any conflict between the terms of this Agreement and the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreements the terms of this Agreement shall control.

6.9 Takeover Laws. Neither the Partnership nor Parent will take any action
that would cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be subject
to requirements imposed by any Takeover Laws, or grant any waiver under any
Takeover Law with respect to any Alternative Proposal or other transaction
with a third party, and each of them will take all reasonable steps within its
control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement from the Takeover Laws of any state that
purport to apply to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

6.10 Parent Common Units Listed; Partnership Common Units De-Listed. Parent
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to list, prior to the Closing, on
the NYSE, upon official notice of issuance, the Parent Common Units included
in the Merger Consideration. The Parties shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to take such actions reasonably required under applicable
Law (including the rules and regulations of the NYSE) to cause the Partnership
Common Units to be de-listed from the NYSE and de-registered under the
Exchange Act at or as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

6.11 Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

(a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer,
trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or
indemnification agreement or under the Existing Partnership Agreement, the
Director and Officer Indemnification Agreements, this Agreement or, if
applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the
Partnership's Subsidiaries, commencing from and after the Effective Time and
continuing for six (6) years thereafter, Parent and the Surviving Entities,
jointly and severally, will: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who
is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the Effective Time, an
officer, director or employee of the Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of
its Subsidiaries and also with respect to any such Person, in their capacity
as a director, officer, employee, member, trustee or fiduciary of another
corporation, foundation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other
employee benefit plan or enterprise (whether or not such other entity or
enterprise is affiliated with the Partnership, but with respect to all such
other positions and other entities and enterprises, only to the extent listed
on Section 6.11 of the Partnership Disclosure Schedule) serving at the express
request of or on behalf of the Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries and together with such Person's heirs, executors or
administrators (collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") to the fullest extent
authorized or permitted by applicable Law in connection with any Claim or
Action against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
Indemnification Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in
settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or
payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom;
and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within fifteen (15) days after any
request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, any
Indemnification Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with
respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim or Action in
advance of the final disposition of such Claim or Action, including payment on
behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Indemnification
Expenses incurred by such

Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such
indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of
any bond or other security, but subject, in each and every case, to Parent's
receipt of an undertaking by such Indemnified Party to repay all such advanced
amounts if it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified. The indemnification and advancement obligations of
Parent and the Surviving Entities pursuant to this Section 6.11(a) extend to
acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any Claim or
Action relating thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions
occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Mergers and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the consideration and approval thereof and the process
undertaken in connection therewith and any Claim or Action relating thereto),
and all rights to indemnification and advancement conferred hereunder continue
as to any Indemnified Party who has ceased to be a director or officer of the
Partnership or any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and inure to the
benefit of such person's heirs, executors and personal and legal
representatives. As used in this Section 6.11: (x) the term "Claim" means any
threatened, asserted, pending or completed action or proceeding, whether
instituted by any Party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other
person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the
institution of any action or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other
alternative dispute resolution mechanism ("Action"), arising out of or
pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Party's duties or
service as a director or officer of the Partnership GP or of any of its
Subsidiaries or as a trustee of (or in a similar capacity with) any
compensation and benefit plan of any thereof; (y) the term "Indemnification
Expenses" means documented out-of-pocket attorneys' fees and all other
documented out-of-pocket costs, expenses and obligations (including experts'
fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating,
printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier
charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a
witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to
investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which
indemnification is sought pursuant to this Section 6.11(a), including any
Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an
Indemnified Party; and (z) the phrase "to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by applicable Law" includes, but is not limited to (1) to the
fullest extent authorized or permitted by any provision of the DRULPA and the
DLLCA that authorizes or permits additional indemnification by agreement or
otherwise, or the corresponding provision of any amendment to or replacement
of the DRULPA and the DLLCA and (2) to the fullest extent authorized or
permitted by any amendments to or replacements of the DRULPA and the DLLCA
adopted after the date of this Agreement that increase the extent to which an
entity may indemnify its directors, officers, trustees, employees, agents, or
fiduciaries or persons serving in any capacity in which any Indemnified Party
serves. Any amendment, alteration or repeal of the DRULPA or the DLLCA that
adversely affects any right of any Indemnified Party will be prospective only
and does not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim or
Action involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or
omission to act that took place prior to such amendment or repeal. Neither
Parent nor the Surviving Entities will settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Claim or Action in respect
of which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless such settlement, compromise or judgment includes an
unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out



56







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



of such Claim or Action without admission or finding of wrongdoing, or such
Indemnified Party otherwise consents thereto.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and the Merger Subs agree that all
rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from
liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnitees as provided in the Existing
Partnership Agreement (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership
agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational
documents of any of the Partnership GP or the Partnership's Subsidiaries) and
indemnification agreements (including, without limitation, the Director and
Officer Indemnification Agreements) of the Partnership GP, the Partnership or
any of its Subsidiaries will be assumed by the Surviving Entities and Parent
in the Mergers, without further action, at the Effective Time and will survive
the Mergers and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the rights to indemnification and
advancement of expenses of the direct and indirect owners or controlling
persons of the Partnership GP pursuant to this Section 6.11(b) will be limited
to claims against such Persons by the Partnership Unitholders (directly or
derivatively) and the Partnership, to the extent they relate to claims against
such Persons in their capacities as owners or controlling persons of the
Partnership GP.

(c) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, the Organizational
Documents of the Partnership and its Subsidiaries will contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
exculpation and limitations on liability of directors and officers than are
set forth in the Existing Partnership Agreement, and Director and Officer
Indemnification Agreements, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in
any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals
who, at or prior to the Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such
modification is required by applicable Law and then only to the minimum extent
required by applicable Law; provided, however, that, to the fullest extent
permitted by Law, any such modification shall be prospective only and shall
not limit or eliminate any such right with respect to any Claim or Action
involving any occurrence or alleged occurrence of any action or omission to
act that took place prior to modification; and provided, further, that, to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, all rights to indemnification in respect of
any Action pending or asserted or any Claim made within such period continue
until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such Claim.

(d) For a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time, Parent will
maintain (or will cause to be maintained) in effect the current directors' and
officers' liability and fiduciary liability insurance policies covering the
Indemnified Parties (but may substitute therefor other policies (including
"tail" policies with a claims period of six (6) years from the Effective Time)
of at least the same coverage and amounts containing terms and conditions that
are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties so long as that
substitution does not result in gaps or lapses in coverage) with respect to
matters occurring on or before the Effective Time, but Parent is not required
to pay annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual premiums paid
therefor prior to the date hereof and will purchase the maximum amount of
coverage that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in
this Section 6.11(d) would cost in excess of that amount.

(e) If Parent, the Surviving Entities or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and is
not the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of
such consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, proper provision will be made so that the successors and
assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entities assume the obligations set forth
in this Section 6.11.

(f) From and after the Effective Time, each Partnership Entity hereby releases
and forever discharges Partnership Parents and their respective Affiliates
(collectively, the "Releasees") from any and all Claims which any of the
Partnership Entities now has or have ever had or may hereafter have against
the respective Releasees arising prior to the Effective Time or on account of
or arising out of any matter, cause or event occurring prior to the Effective
Time, whether pursuant to their respective Organizational Documents, contract
or otherwise and whether or not relating to claims pending on, or asserted
after, the Effective Time; provided, however, that nothing in this Section
6.11(f) shall release any Releasee from liability with respect to, or restrict
the ability of any Person to make a Claim in any circumstance where such
Releasee acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud, willful misconduct or, in the
case of a criminal matter, acted with knowledge that the Releasee's knowledge
was criminal.

(g) Parent will cause the Surviving Entities to perform all of the obligations
of the Surviving Entities under this Section 6.11.

(h) This Section 6.11 survives the consummation of the Mergers and is intended
to be for the benefit of, and to be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties
and the Indemnitees and their respective heirs and personal representatives,
and will be binding on Parent, the Surviving Entities and their respective
successors and assigns.

6.12 Notification of Certain Matters. The Partnership shall give prompt notice
to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Partnership, to the
extent in each case it obtains Knowledge thereof of (a) any notice or other
communication received by such Party from any Governmental Authority in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any Person
alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the subject matter of such
communication or the failure of such Party to obtain such consent would
reasonably be expected to be material to the Partnership or Parent, (b) any
actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or threatened
against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such Party or any of
its Subsidiaries and that relate to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (c) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in Article VII and (d) any material failure of such Party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in Article VII; provided that in the case
of clauses (a) and (b), the failure to comply with this Section 6.12 shall not
result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing
in Article VII, or give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under
Article VIII, if the



58







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself
give rise to such failure or right.

6.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and the
Partnership will take all such steps as may be required (to the extent
reasonably necessary and permitted under applicable Law) to cause any
dispositions of Partnership Common Units (including derivative securities with
respect to Partnership Common Units) resulting from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Partnership, or will become subject to such reporting requirements with
respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the
Exchange Act.

6.14 Distributions. Each of the Partnership and Parent will consult with the
Other Parties regarding the declaration and payment of distributions in
respect of Partnership Common Units, and the Parent Common Units and the
record and payment dates relating thereto, so that no Partnership Unitholder
receives two (2) distributions, or fails to receive one (1) distribution, for
any single calendar quarter with respect to its applicable Partnership Common
Units, or any Parent Common Units any such Partnership Unitholder receives in
exchange therefor pursuant to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.15 Employee Benefits.

(a) During the period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending no
earlier than December 31, 2016 (the "Post-Closing Period"), Parent shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates to, provide each Employee who is not a Union
Employee (as defined below) (each, a "Non-Union Employee") and who continues
in the employment of Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the
Partnership or the Partnership GP) following the Effective Time (each, a "Non-
Union Continuing Employee") with (i) a base salary or hourly wage rate, as
applicable, and bonus opportunity that are no less than such Non-Union
Continuing Employee's base salary or hourly wage rate, as applicable, and
bonus opportunity as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
employee benefits (including, health, welfare and retirement benefits, but
expressly excluding fringe benefits, equity-based incentives, defined benefit
pension plan benefits, retiree medical benefits and nonqualified deferred
compensation plan benefits) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to
those provided to such Non-Union Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time. Without limiting the foregoing, during the Post-Closing
Period, Parent shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, maintain and honor in
accordance with its existing terms, and not to amend or modify, the RNP 2015
Transaction Severance Policy for Non-Bargaining Unit Employees for the benefit
of each Non-Union Continuing Employee.

(b) Without limiting the foregoing or any other provision hereof, as of the
Effective Time, Parent shall be bound by the Partnership CBAs and responsible
for all liabilities and obligations thereunder, and shall perform all duties
and obligations thereunder in accordance with the terms of the applicable
Partnership CBA. With respect to each Employee who is covered by the East
Dubuque CBA (each, a "Union Employee") and who continues in the employment of
the Partnership GP following the Effective Time (each, a "Union Continuing
Employee" and, together with the Non-Union Continuing Employees, the
"Continuing Employees"), his or her



59







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



employment will continue to be subject to the terms of the East Dubuque CBA,
as it may exist and be amended from time to time.

(c) For purposes of eligibility, participation, benefit accruals and vesting
(but not benefit accruals under defined benefit pension plans) under Parent
Employee Benefit Plans providing employee benefits to Continuing Employees
after the Closing Date, each Continuing Employee shall be credited with his or
her years of service with the Partnership, the Partnership GP and/or the
Included Subsidiaries (and their predecessors) prior to the Closing Date to
the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the Closing
Date, to credit for such service under Partnership Employee Benefit Plans,
except to the extent providing such credit would result in any duplication of
benefits. In addition, Parent shall (or shall cause an Affiliate of Parent to)
use commercially reasonable efforts to cause (i) each Continuing Employee to
be immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and
all Parent Employee Benefit Plans to the extent such Continuing Employee would
have been then-eligible to participate in a comparable Partnership Employee
Benefit Plan; (ii) each Parent Employee Benefit Plan providing medical,
dental, hospital, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any employee, to waive
all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively at work requirements (to
the extent permissible under any applicable insurance contracts) of such
Parent Employee Benefit Plan for such Continuing Employee and his or her
covered dependents (except to the extent that such exclusions or requirements
applied to the Continuing Employee under comparable Partnership Employee
Benefit Plans); and (iii) any deductibles and other eligible expenses
(including co-payments) incurred by such Continuing Employee and/or his or her
covered dependents during the plan year ending on the Closing Date to be
credited for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Continuing Employee and his or
her covered dependents for the applicable plan year of each comparable Parent
Employee Benefit Plan (to the extent such credit would have been given under
comparable Partnership Employee Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time).

(d) For purposes of determining the number of vacation days and other paid
time off to which each Continuing Employee is entitled during the calendar
year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent will assume and honor all
vacation and other paid time off days accrued or earned but not yet taken by
such Continuing Employee as of the Effective Time (subject to the terms of any
applicable Partnership CBA in the case of any Union Continuing Employee).

(e) If requested by Parent at least ten (10) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, the Partnership shall terminate any and all Partnership Employee
Benefit Plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that
include a cash or deferred arrangement intended to satisfy the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code, effective not later than immediately preceding the
Effective Time. In the event that Parent requests that such 401(k) plan(s) be
terminated, the Partnership shall provide Parent with evidence that such
401(k) plan(s) have been terminated pursuant to a duly adopted resolution of
the Partnership or Partnership GP (the form and substance of which shall be
subject to review and approval by Parent, which approval shall not be
unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed) not later than the day
immediately preceding the Effective Time. If Parent requires the Partnership
to terminate its 401(k) plan(s), Parent shall make available to all Continuing
Employees (to the extent such Continuing Employees were eligible to
participate in



60







LA\\\4224998.8

US 3682459v.19

* * *



any such terminated 401(k) plan), a 401(k) plan of Parent or one of its
Affiliates in which (i) such Continuing Employees are entitled to participate
as of the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less favorable, in the
aggregate, than the terms and conditions applicable to such Continuing
Employees under the applicable terminated 401(k) plan, and (ii) each such
Continuing Employee who receives an "eligible rollover distribution" (within
the meaning of Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the Partnership's 401(k)
plan(s) shall be eligible to rollover such distribution (including an in-kind
rollover of non-defaulted, outstanding notes associated with plan loans) to
such 401(k) plan of Parent or one of its Affiliates in accordance with the
terms of such plan.

(f) Within sixty (60) days after the execution of this Agreement, the
Partnership will provide Parent with a list of all persons who are Employees
and individual independent contractors of the Partnership, the Partnership GP
and the Included Subsidiaries as of the date such list is provided, including
any Employee who is on a leave of absence of any nature, paid or unpaid,
authorized or unauthorized, and that sets forth for each such individual the
following: (i) name of employing entity(ies); (ii) employee number and
principal location of employment; (iii) title or position (including whether
full or part time); (iv) employment status (e.g., full-time, part-time,
temporary, or independent contractor); (v) hire date; (vii) status as exempt
or non-exempt under the FLCA; (vii) whether or not such individual is subject
to any collective bargaining agreement; (viii) current annual base
compensation rate; (ix) commission, bonus or other incentive-based
compensation opportunity for which he or she is eligible for the year in which
such list is provided; (x) the employee's leave status (including type of
leave and expected duration or return date, if known) and (xi) service
credited for purposes of vesting, eligibility, participation, and benefit
accruals, under any Partnership Employee Benefit Plan. The Partnership shall
provide Parent with an updated list at least three (3) days prior to the
Closing Date.

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.15 to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any Parent Employee Benefit Plan, or shall limit the
right of Parent to amend, terminate or otherwise modify any Parent Employee
Benefit Plan following the Effective Time. The provisions of this Section 6.15
are for the sole benefit of the Parties to this Agreement and nothing herein,
expressed or implied, is intended or will be construed to confer upon or give
to any person any right (including, for the avoidance of doubt, any current or
former employee of Parent, the Partnership GP, the Partnership or any of their
respective Affiliates, other than the Parties hereto).

6.16 Fees and Expenses. Except as expressly provided herein (including under
Section 8.4), all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby, including all legal, accounting,
financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of third
parties incurred by a Party in connection with the negotiation and
effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, will be the obligation of the respective
Party incurring such fees and expenses.

6.17 Tax Representation Letters. Each of the Parent and the Partnership shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to each of Vinson and Elkins
L.L.P., counsel to the Parent ("Vinson and Elkins"), or other nationally
recognized tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent (which Parent agrees
for the purposes of this Section 6.17 shall include Latham and Watkins), and
Latham and Watkins, counsel to the Partnership, or other nationally recognized
tax counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Partnership (which the Partnership
agrees for purposes of this Section 6.17 shall include Vinson and Elkins), a
certificate, dated as of the Closing Date and signed by an officer of Parent
or the Partnership, as the case may be, containing such representations,
warranties and covenants as shall be reasonably necessary or appropriate to
enable Vinson and Elkins and Latham and Watkins or such other satisfactory counsel
to render the respective opinions described in Section 7.2(d) and Section
7.3(f) of this Agreement (each an "Officer's Certificate"). Parent and the
Partnership shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
further cause Vinson and Elkins and Latham and Watkins or such other satisfactory
counsel to render the respective opinions described in Section 7.2(d) and
Section 7.3(f) of this Agreement.

6.18 Pasadena Facility.

(a) From the date of this Agreement to the Spin-Off Trigger Date (or, in the
discretion of the Partnership, after such date), the Partnership will use
commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the sale for cash of all of the
limited liability company interests in Pasadena Holdings to a Person other
than the Partnership or its Subsidiaries in a manner that would not impose or
leave outstanding any continuing liabilities or obligations related to or
arising out of the ownership of operation of the business of the Pasadena
Subsidiaries on the Partnership or its Included Subsidiaries after the
Effective Time (a "Qualified Pasadena Sale"). A Qualified Pasadena Sale in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.18 shall not be a breach or
violation of this Agreement. The Partnership shall keep Parent reasonably
apprised regarding the status of the Pasadena Sale and Parent shall have the
right to review, comment upon and approve the definitive transaction documents
for such Pasadena Sale (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned); provided, however, that any withholding of approval by Parent
shall be unreasonable if the definitive transaction documents would not impose
any material continuing liabilities or obligations on Parent, the Partnership
or its Included Subsidiaries after the Effective Time (including contingent
liabilities or obligations due to purchase price adjustment, earnout or other
similar provisions set forth in such documents). Upon the execution of any
definitive transaction documents with respect to a Qualified Pasadena Sale,
the Partnership (i) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to use
commercially reasonable efforts to, perform their respective obligations
thereunder and cause the closing conditions with respect thereto to be timely
satisfied and (ii) shall not, and shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to,
modify, amend or waive any provision of such definitive transaction documents
in a manner adverse to the Partnership or the Included Subsidiaries, or
terminate or assign any such document, without the prior written consent of
Parent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

(b) Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to the date of consummation of a
Qualified Pasadena Sale, if any, the Partnership shall deliver to Parent its
good faith calculation of the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds, together with
reasonable supporting documentation with respect thereto (the "Initial
Pasadena Statement"). Parent and the Partnership will negotiate in good faith
with regards to any objections that Parent has to the Partnership's
calculation of the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds, and endeavor to agree in
writing on the amount of such Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds within thirty (30)
days of the consummation of any Qualified Pasadena Sale or, if earlier, seven
(7) Business Days prior to the date of the Partnership Meeting (the "Target
Resolution Date"). During such period, the Partnership Entities shall and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to, provide Parent with reasonable
access to information, books and records of the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries in accordance with Section 6.6. In the event that any amount of
the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds is in dispute on the Target Resolution Date
(such amount, which shall be the aggregate of all Disputed Items, the
"Disputed Amount"), the Partnership shall be permitted to distribute any and
all amounts of the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds that are not Disputed Amounts to
the Partnership Unitholders in accordance with Section 6.18(c).

(c) Upon the determination of the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds in accordance
with Section 6.18(b), the Partnership shall be permitted, subject to
applicable Law and any obligations in the Partnership Material Contracts, to
distribute pro rata to the Partnership Unitholders all or any portion of such
Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds. If a Qualified Pasadena Sale is consummated prior
to the Closing and any of the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds have been retained by
the Partnership as cash (excluding any Disputed Amounts) or applied to reduce
amounts outstanding under the GE Credit Facility or repurchase or repay the
Second Lien Notes, then the Cash Consideration per Partnership Common Unit
shall be increased by the amount of the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds so retained
or applied, divided by the number of Partnership Common Units outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. To the extent that there remain any
Disputed Amounts as of the Closing, such amounts shall be placed into escrow,
and Parent shall instruct the escrow agent to transfer any portion of the
Disputed Amounts ultimately determined to be Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds in
accordance with Section 6.18(e), if any, to be disbursed to the Exchange Agent
for further disbursement to the Partnership Unitholders, and all remaining
amounts, if any, to be disbursed to Parent.

(d) Prior to or substantially concurrently with the consummation of a
Qualified Pasadena Sale, the Partnership shall take and cause its Subsidiaries
to take all actions reasonably necessary to cause (i) all of the Pasadena
Liabilities to be transferred to and assumed by, or otherwise retained by, the
Pasadena Subsidiaries and (ii) any assets of the Pasadena Subsidiaries other
than the Pasadena Assets, to be transferred to the Partnership, in the case of
each (i) and (ii), to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. The
Partnership shall keep Parent reasonably apprised of such transfer of the
Pasadena Liabilities, including by providing Parent with copies of any
definitive transaction documents with respect thereto, or any other
information or access to personnel requested in accordance with Section 6.6.

(e) In the event the Parties have not agreed on the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds
as of the Target Resolution Date, Parent shall deliver written notice (a
"Dispute Notice") to the Partnership of each outstanding disputed item (the
disputed items being the "Disputed Items"), to the Partnership within ten (10)
days following such Target Resolution Notice, which Dispute Notice shall: (i)
set forth Parent's proposed resolution of the Disputed Items, (ii) specify in
reasonable detail Parent's basis for disagreement with the Disputed Items and
(iii) include materials showing in reasonable detail Parent's support for such
position. Any matters set forth in the Initial Pasadena Statement that are not
adjusted in a manner agreed to in writing by the Parties prior to the Target
Resolution Date or included as Disputed Items in a timely delivered Dispute
Notice shall be deemed accepted by Parent and shall be binding and final for
all purposes of this Agreement. If Parent and the Partnership are unable to
agree upon the Disputed Items within ten (10) days after the delivery of a
Dispute Notice by Parent to the Partnership, then the Disputed Items (but no
others) may be referred by Parent or the Partnership for determination to KPMG
LLP (or, if KPMG LLP is unable or unwilling to serve or if Parent and the
Partnership otherwise agree, another nationally recognized accounting firm
that has not had a material engagement with any Party or its Affiliates during
the one (1) year prior to the date of the Dispute Notice, that is mutually
selected by Parent and the Partnership). If Parent and the Partnership are
unable to select a nationally recognized accounting firm within ten (10)
Business Days of KPMG LLP declining to accept such engagement or because KPMG
LLP is not independent as described in the prior sentence, either the
Partnership or Parent may thereafter request that the American Arbitration
Association make such selection (as applicable, KPMG LLP, the firm selected by
the Partnership and Parent or the firm mutually selected by the American
Arbitration Association is referred to herein as the "Independent
Accountant"). Parent and the Partnership shall provide the Independent
Accountant and the other Party with a statement of its position as to the
amount for each Disputed Item within fifteen (15) days from the date of the
appointment of the Independent Accountant. The Independent Accountant shall
make a written determination as promptly as practicable, but in any event
within thirty (30) days after the date on which the dispute is referred to the
Independent Accountant, by selecting from the position of either Parent or the
Partnership as to each Disputed Item. The Independent Accountant shall be
authorized to select only the position as to each Disputed Item as presented
by either Parent or the Partnership. If at any time Parent or the Partnership
resolve their dispute, then, notwithstanding the preceding provisions of this
Section 6.18(e), the Independent Accountant's involvement promptly shall be
discontinued and the calculations of Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds shall be
revised, if necessary, to reflect such resolution and thereupon shall be final
and binding for all purposes of this Agreement. The Parties shall make readily
available to the Independent Accountant all relevant books and records
relating to the Pasadena Sale Net Proceeds and all other items reasonably
requested by the Independent Accountant in connection with resolving the
Disputed Items. The costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be
allocated between Parent, on the one hand, and the Partnership, on the other
hand, in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of Disputed Items so
submitted to the Independent Accountant that are ultimately unsuccessfully
disputed by each such Party (as finally determined by the Independent
Accountant) bears to the total amount of Disputed Items so submitted. The
decision of the Independent Accountant shall be final and binding for all
purposes of this Agreement.

(f) Parent acknowledges and agrees that the Partnership Ultimate Parent, from
and after Closing, shall be entitled to participate in, and control, the
resolution of any Disputed Items on behalf of the Partnership.

execute and deliver, at the Closing, one or more supplemental indentures,
officers' certificates, board resolutions or other documents or instruments
required for the due assumption of, and succession to, the Second Lien Notes
and related guarantees, security documents, intercreditor agreements and other
similar agreements and instruments (collectively, the "Second Lien Notes
Documents") to the extent required by the terms of such Second Lien Notes
Documents, and the Partnership and its Subsidiaries shall provide, at the sole
cost of Parent, all assistance reasonably required by Parent in connection
with obtaining the execution of such instruments by any other required
parties.

(b) In the event that Parent desires to consummate an exchange offer, tender
offer, repurchase offer, consent solicitation, discharge, defeasance,
redemption or similar transaction, or any combination thereof (collectively,
the "Debt Transactions") with respect to the Second Lien Notes, the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries shall use their respective commercially
reasonable efforts to, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause
their respective Representatives (including the trustee and collateral trustee
for the Second Lien Notes) to, cooperate in good faith to permit such Debt
Transactions to be effected on such terms, conditions and timing as reasonably
requested by Parent, including if so requested by Parent, causing the Debt
Transactions to be consummated substantially concurrently with, but not prior
to, the Closing. Upon request of Parent, the Partnership and its Subsidiaries
shall execute and deliver one or more supplemental indentures, board
resolutions, officers' certificates or other documents or instruments
reasonably required in connection therewith (it being understood such
documentation may be required to be executed and delivered and such amendments
to the Second Lien Notes Documents may be required to be effectuated prior to
Closing so long as any such amendments cease to be effective if Closing does
not occur). For the avoidance of doubt, the consummation of any Debt
Transaction shall not be a condition to Closing.

(c) Parent shall prepare all necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with any Debt Transactions, and the Partnership shall have a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such documents (the "Offer
Documents"). The parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries and Representatives to, reasonably cooperate with each other in
the preparation of the Offer Documents. If, at any time prior to the
completion of the Debt Transactions, the Partnership or any of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the
other hand, discovers any information that should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to the Offer Documents, so that the Offer Documents shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, such party that discovers such information shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to promptly notify the other party, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement prepared by Parent describing such information shall
be disseminated by or on behalf of the Partnership or its Subsidiaries to the
holders of the Second Lien Notes.

(d) In connection with any Debt Transaction, Parent may select one or more
dealer managers, information agents, solicitation agents, depositaries and
other agents, in each case as shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Partnership, to provide assistance in connection therewith, and the
Partnership shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into customary
agreements with such parties so selected; provided, that neither the
Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless, or pay the fees or reimburse the costs and expenses of, any
such party, which indemnification, fee and reimbursement obligations shall be
borne by Parent pursuant to separate agreements with such parties to which
neither the Partnership nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be a party or have
any obligations under.

(e) The Partnership shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, at the
reasonable request of Parent, deliver all notices and to take all other
actions required to facilitate (i) the termination of commitments in respect
of the GE Credit Facility and (ii) the repayment in full of all obligations
for borrowed money outstanding thereunder and the release of any Liens
securing such indebtedness and guarantees in connection therewith on the
Closing Date. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Partnership and its
Subsidiaries that are party to the GE Credit Facility shall deliver to Parent
on the Closing Date a payoff letter and related lien release documentation
with respect to such indebtedness in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type from General Electric Capital Corporation, as agent
on behalf of the lenders under the GE Credit Facility, which payoff letter and
related lien release documentation shall, among other things, include the
payoff amount and provide that liens (and guarantees), if any, granted in
connection therewith relating to the assets, rights and properties of the
Partnership and its Subsidiaries that are party to the GE Credit Facility
securing such indebtedness and any other obligations secured thereby, shall,
upon the payment of the amount set forth in the applicable payoff letter at or
substantially concurrently with the Closing, be released and terminated,
provided, that Parent shall provide all funds required to effect all such
repayments at or substantially concurrently with the Closing.

(f) From and after the date of this Agreement, and through the earlier of the
Closing and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article VIII, the Partnership shall, and the Partnership shall cause each of
its Included Subsidiaries, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause their Representatives (including their auditors) to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to provide all customary cooperation (including providing
reasonably available financial and other information regarding the Included
Subsidiaries for use in marketing and offering documents and assisting in the
preparation of pro forma financial statements) as reasonably requested by
Parent to assist Parent in (i) the arrangement of any bank debt financing or
any capital markets debt financing for the purposes of financing the payment
of the Cash Consideration and (ii) any other amounts required to be paid in
connection with the consummation of such transactions, any repayment of
refinancing of debt contemplated by this Agreement or required in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that
(x) no obligation or liability of the Included Subsidiaries under such bank
debt financing or any capital markets debt financing shall be effective prior
to the Closing and (y) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to the
extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operation of the
Partnership and its Included Subsidiaries.

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Partnership and each of its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys'
fees) interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred in
connection with any and all of the matters contemplated by this Section 6.19
(other than arising from a material misstatement or omission on the part of
the Partnership or its Subsidiaries), whether or not the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is
terminated. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Partnership, reimburse
the Partnership for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs (including reasonable
attorneys' fees) incurred by the Partnership or its Subsidiaries in connection
with this Section 6.19, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are consummated or this Agreement is terminated.

(h) Parent shall provide the Partnership with true and correct copies of any
material documents in connection with any consent solicitation, tender offer,
bank debt financing or capital markets debt financing proposed or entered into
for the purposes of financing the payment of the Cash Consideration. As and
when requested by the Partnership, Parent shall keep the Partnership
reasonably informed of any material developments with respect to any such
transaction (including by providing copies to the Partnership of any
amendments or supplements to, or replacements of, the any material documents
in connection with any such transaction) until the first to occur of the
Closing Date and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its
terms.

(i) The Parent Entities acknowledge and agree that obtaining any consent
solicitation, tender offer, bank debt financing or capital markets debt
financing is not a condition to their obligations to effect the Closing and
the Mergers. For the avoidance of doubt, if any financing, has not been
obtained, the Parent Entities shall each continue to be obligated, subject to
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article II, to
consummate the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

6.20 Spin-Off Transactions.

(a) If the Partnership has not consummated a Qualified Pasadena Sale by the

Trigger Date" and such non-consummation of a Qualified Pasadena Sale by the
Spin-Off Trigger Date, a "Spin-Off Trigger Event"), (i) the Partnership shall
promptly take, or cause its Subsidiaries to take, such actions as are
reasonably necessary to form SpinCo and (if SpinCo is a limited partnership)

Liabilities (as defined in the Separation Agreement) (the "Separation"), and
(B) the Partnership will effect a distribution of SpinCo Common Units
representing a 100% limited partnership or limited liability company interest
in SpinCo to the Partnership Unitholders pursuant to a special distribution
(the "Pasadena Distribution" and, together with the Separation, the "Spin-Off
Transaction"). For the avoidance of doubt, the Partnership may continue to
pursue a Qualified Pasadena Sale after the Spin-Off Trigger Event has
occurred.

(b) In the event of a Spin-Off Trigger Event, from and after the Spin-Off
Trigger Date, subject to the terms and conditions of the Separation Agreement,
the Partnership shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take
promptly, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do promptly, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to
consummate and make effective the Spin-Off Transaction and the other
transactions contemplated by the Separation Agreement, in coordination with
the Closing. Without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), none of Partnership,
Partnership GP, SpinCo or (if SpinCo is a limited partnership) SpinCo GP shall
(i) terminate the Separation Agreement, (ii) amend or waive any provision of
the Separation Agreement in a manner that is materially adverse to the
Partnership, Partnership GP or Parent or any of its Affiliates or that would
prevent or materially impede or delay the consummation of the Merger or (iii)
agree to any place of arbitration other than Wilmington, Delaware under
Section 4.4(d) of the Separation Agreement.

financial statements required to be included therein with respect to SpinCo
and its business. In the event of a Spin-Off Trigger Event, the Partnership
will, and will cause the Spin-Off Companies to, file with the SEC a Form 10
with respect to the Spin-Off Transaction as soon as practicable following the
Spin-Off Trigger Date; provided, however, that the Partnership may elect to
file such Form 10 at an earlier date.

(d) Parent will cooperate with and use commercially reasonable efforts to
facilitate the Spin-Off Transaction as contemplated in the Separation
Agreement.

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, unless a Qualified
Pasadena Sale is consummated, during the Pre-Closing Period, each of the
Parent Entities, on the one hand, and the Partnership Entities, on the other
hand, will cooperate with the other and use (and will cause their respective
Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable efforts to consummate the Spin-
Off Transaction in a manner that complies with any applicable Partnership
Material Contracts, including by taking the actions contemplated by Section
6.20(e) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule.

6.21 Services Agreement. At or prior to the Closing, the Partnership Entities
shall enter into, and shall cause their respective Included Subsidiaries to
enter into, a termination and release agreement with Partnership Parents
pursuant to which the Services Agreement shall be terminated without any
further liability to the parties thereto and the Partnership Entities and
their respective Included Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and each Partnership
Parent on behalf of itself and its Affiliates (other than the Partnership
Entities and their Subsidiaries), on the other hand, shall release each other
from all liabilities arising prior to Closing thereunder; provided, however,
that the obligations of the Partnership and the Included Subsidiaries to
reimburse Partnership Parents or their Affiliates for reasonable out-of-pocket
costs under the Services Agreement incurred prior to the date of such
termination shall survive such termination.

funds affiliated with or managed by GSO Capital Partners LP (the "GSO Funds")

is vested exclusively in the Federal courts of the United States, the Federal

Section 9.9 with any court as written evidence of the consent of each such
Party to the waiver of its right to trial by jury.

9.10 No Recourse. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and any claims,
obligations, liabilities or causes of action (whether in contract or in tort,
in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be based upon, in respect
of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with or relate in any
manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution or performance of this

entities that are expressly identified as Parties hereto. No Person who is not
a Party, including without limitation any past, present or future Affiliate,
director, officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner,
stockholder, agent, attorney or representative of, and any financial advisor
or lender to, any Party, or any past, present or future Affiliate, director,
officer, employee, incorporator, member, manager, partner, stockholder, agent,
attorney or representative of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any of
the foregoing ("Nonparty Affiliates") shall have any liability (whether in

claims, causes of action, obligations or liabilities arising under, out of, in
connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in
respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance or breach. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law, each
Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities, claims, causes of
action and obligations against any such Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting

Party hereby waives and releases any and all rights, claims, demands or causes

Party disclaims any reliance upon any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the
performance of this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to this Agreement.

9.11 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the Parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the

accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and it is

injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with
this Section 9.11 in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any state or federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties
agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(a) such Party has an adequate remedy at law or (b) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each
Party further agrees that no Party shall be required to obtain, furnish or
post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to
obtaining any remedy referred to in this Section 9.11, and each Party
