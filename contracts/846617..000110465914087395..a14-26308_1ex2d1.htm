(a) CNB shall merge with and into Bridge Bank, with Bridge Bank as the
resulting or surviving corporation (the " **Surviving Corporation** "); and
(b) the separate existence of CNB shall cease and all of the rights,

action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to be

If, at any time after the Effective Time, Bridge Bank shall consider or be
advised that any further deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any other

directors of Bridge Bank are authorized in the name of CNB or otherwise to
take any and all such action.

 



 

 **ARTICLE III 
CONVERSION OF SHARES**

 



 

3.1. _Conversion of CNB Common Stock; Merger Consideration._

 



 

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Bridge Bancorp, CNB or the holders of any of the shares of CNB Common
Stock, the Merger shall be effected in accordance with the following terms:

 



 

3.1.1. Each share of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock and Bridge Bank common stock
that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
remain issued and outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be
unchanged by the Merger.

 



 

3.1.2. All shares of CNB Common Stock held in the treasury of CNB and each
share of CNB Common Stock owned by Bridge Bancorp prior to the Effective Time
(other than shares held in a fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts
previously contracted) (" **Treasury Stock** ") shall, at the Effective Time,
cease to exist, and such shares, including any Certificates therefor, shall be
canceled as promptly as practicable thereafter, and no payment or distribution
shall be made in consideration therefor.

 



       
 

 



 

3.1.3. Subject to the foregoing provisions of this Section 3.1, each
outstanding share of CNB Common Stock that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Dissenting Shares) shall
become and be converted into the right to receive 0.79 shares (the "
**Exchange Ratio** ") of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock (the " **Merger
Consideration** ").

 



 

3.1.4. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Bridge Bank
shall pay for any Dissenters Shares in accordance with 12 U.S.C. Section
215a(b), and the holders thereof shall not be entitled to receive any Merger
Consideration; _provided_ , _that_ if appraisal rights under 12 U.S.C. Section
215a(b) with respect to any Dissenters Shares shall have been effectively
withdrawn or lost, such shares will thereupon cease to be treated as
Dissenters Shares and shall be converted into the right receive the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1.2.

 



 

3.1.5. Upon the Effective Time, outstanding shares of CNB Common Stock shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease

this Section 3.1 represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

 



 

3.1.6. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Bridge Bancorp Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Bridge Bancorp Common Stock shall be
payable on or with respect to any fractional share interests, and such
fractional share interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a shareholder of Bridge Bancorp. In lieu of the issuance
of any such fractional share, Bridge Bancorp shall pay to each former holder
of CNB Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional
share of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the
nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of
a share to which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the
Bridge Bancorp Closing Price. For purposes of determining any fractional share
interest, all shares of CNB Common Stock owned by a CNB shareholder shall be
combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of Bridge
Bancorp Common Stock issuable to such CNB shareholder.

 



 

3.1.7. In the event Bridge Bancorp changes (or establishes a record date for
changing) the number of, or provides for the exchange of, shares of Bridge
Bancorp Common Stock issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a
result of a stock split, stock dividend, reclassification, or similar
transaction with respect to the outstanding Bridge Bancorp Common Stock and
the record date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration shall be proportionately and appropriately adjusted; _provided_
, _that_ no such adjustment shall be made with regard to Bridge Bancorp Common
Stock if Bridge Bancorp issues additional shares of Common Stock and receives
fair value consideration for such shares.

 



 

3.2. _Procedures for Exchange of CNB Common Stock._

 



 

3.2.1. _Bridge Bancorp to Make Merger Consideration Available._ No later than
the Closing Date, Bridge Bancorp shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of CNB
Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this

 



      
 

 



 

Section 3.2, certificates representing the shares of Bridge Bancorp Common
Stock, or at its option, evidence of shares in book entry form, and cash in
lieu of fractional shares (such certificates for or evidence of shares of
Bridge Bancorp Common Stock, together with any cash respect to fractional
shares, being hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** ").

 



 

3.2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_. Bridge Bancorp shall take all steps
necessary to cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the
Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates, a
form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares, if any, into which the
CNB Common Stock represented by such Certificates shall have been converted as
a result of the Merger. The letter of transmittal shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent or as prescribed
by Section 3.2.7. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and
cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter
of transmittal, duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor, as applicable, (i) a certificate
representing that number of shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock (if any) to
which such former holder of CNB Common Stock shall have become entitled
pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.1 hereof and (ii) a check representing
the amount of cash (if any) payable in lieu of fractional shares of Bridge
Bancorp Common Stock, which such former holder has the right to receive in
respect of the Certificate surrendered pursuant to the provisions of Section
3.2, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on the cash payable in lieu of fractional
shares.

 



 

3.2.3. _Rights of Certificate Holders after the Effective Time_. The holder of
a Certificate that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding CNB
Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with respect to
such CNB Common Stock except to surrender the Certificate in exchange for the
Merger Consideration as provided in this Agreement and as to Dissenting Shares
such rights as provided under the National Bank Act. No dividends or other
distributions declared after the Effective Time with respect to Bridge Bancorp
Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate
until the holder thereof shall surrender such Certificate in accordance with
this Section 3.2. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Section 3.2, the record holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such
dividends or other distributions, without any interest thereon, which
theretofore had become payable with respect to shares of Bridge Bancorp Common
Stock represented by such Certificate.

 



 

3.2.4. _Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders_. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then it shall be a condition of the payment
of the Merger Consideration that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed to
such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate,
and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate
evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such Certificate and
signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder; and
(ii) the person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in
advance any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
person other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or
required for any other

 



      
 

 



 

reason, or shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such
tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



 

3.2.5. _Closing of Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, there
shall be no transfers on the stock transfer books of CNB of the CNB Common
Stock that was outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are presented for
transfer to the Exchange Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger
Consideration and canceled as provided in this Section 3.2.

 



 

3.2.6. _Return of Exchange Fund_. At any time following the one (1) year
period after the Effective Time, Bridge Bancorp shall be entitled to require
the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portions of the Exchange Fund which
had been made available to the Exchange Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Certificates (including, without limitation, all interest and other income
received by the Exchange Agent in respect of all funds made available to it),
and thereafter such holders shall be entitled to look to Bridge Bancorp
(subject to abandoned property, escheat and other similar laws) with respect
to any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates held by them. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Bridge
Bancorp nor the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate
for any Merger Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a
public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar
law.

 



 

3.2.7. _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Bridge Bancorp, the posting by such person of a
bond in such amount as Bridge Bancorp may reasonably direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect
thereof.

 



 

3.2.8. _Withholding._ Bridge Bancorp or the Exchange Agent will be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to any holder of CNB Common
Stock such amounts as Bridge Bancorp (or any Affiliate thereof) or the
Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making
of such payment under the Code, or any applicable provision of U.S. federal,
state, local or non-U.S. Tax law. To the extent that such amounts are properly
withheld by Bridge Bancorp or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the CNB Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and
withholding were made by Bridge Bancorp or the Exchange Agent.

 



 

3.2.9. _Reservation of Shares._ Bridge Bancorp shall reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of the Bridge Bancorp Common Stock for the purpose
of issuing shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock to the CNB shareholders in
accordance with this Article III.

 



      
 

 



 

3.3. _Treatment of CNB Stock Options._

 



 

 **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.3.2** sets forth all of the outstanding CNB
Stock Options as of the date hereof. As of the Effective Time, all issued and
outstanding CNB Stock Options set forth on **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.3.2,
**whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be terminated and the holder
thereof shall be paid by Bridge Bancorp an amount determined by multiplying
(a) the excess, if any, of the Per Bridge Bancorp Share Cash Consideration
over the applicable per share exercise price of that option by (b) the number
of shares of CNB Common Stock subject to such option, and at the holders
election payment (less applicable tax withholding) will be made in the form of
(i) cash, or (ii) 40% cash and 60% Bridge Bancorp Common Stock, or (iii)
Bridge Bancorp Common Stock. In all instances the fair market value of Bridge
Bancorp Common Stock issued pursuant to this Section 3.3 will be determined by
the Bridge Bancorp Closing Price. In lieu of the issuance of any such
fractional share, Bridge Bancorp shall pay to each former holder of CNB Stock
Options who otherwise would be entitled to receive a fractional share of
Bridge Bancorp Common Stock, an amount in cash, rounded to the nearest cent
and without interest, equal to the product of (i) the fraction of a share to
which such holder would otherwise have been entitled and (ii) the Per Bridge
Bancorp Share Cash Consideration. Any CNB Stock Options with an exercise price
equal to or greater than the Per Bridge Bancorp Share Cash Consideration shall
be cancelled as of the Effective Time and such CNB Stock Options shall not be
entitled to any payment. Subject to the foregoing, the CNB Stock Option Plans
and all CNB Stock Options issued thereunder shall terminate at the Effective
Time. Prior to the Effective Time, CNB shall take such actions as may be
necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section 3.3,
including, without limitation, the provision of any notices to holders of CNB
Options as may be provided for in the CNB Stock Option Plans and the adoption
of any necessary amendments to such plans. The shares of Bridge Bancorp Common
Stock to be issued to the holders of CNB Stock Options shall be registered
with the SEC under the Merger Registration Statement and listed on the Nasdaq
as of the Effective Time.

4.6. _Financial Statements._

 



 

4.6.1. CNB has previously made available to Bridge Bancorp the CNB Regulatory

information, have been prepared in all material respects in accordance with
applicable regulatory accounting principles and practices throughout the
periods covered by such statements.

 



 

4.6.2. CNB has previously made available to Bridge Bancorp the CNB Financial
Statements. The CNB Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP, and (including the related notes where applicable) fairly present in
each case in all material respects (subject in the case of the unaudited
interim statements to normal year-end adjustments and to any other adjustments
described therein), the consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows of CNB as of and for the respective periods ending on the dates
thereof, in accordance with GAAP during the periods involved, except as
indicated in the notes thereto.

 



 

4.6.3. At the date of each balance sheet included in the CNB Financial
Statements or the CNB Regulatory Reports, CNB had no liabilities, obligations
or loss contingencies of any nature (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a type required to be reflected in such CNB Financial Statements
or CNB Regulatory Reports or in the footnotes thereto which are not fully
reflected or reserved against therein or fully disclosed in a footnote
thereto, except for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are
not material, either individually or in the aggregate, or which were incurred
in the ordinary course of business, consistent with past practice, and except
for liabilities, obligations and loss contingencies which are within the
subject matter of a specific representation and warranty herein and subject,
in the

 



      
 

 



 

case of any unaudited statements, to normal, recurring audit adjustments and
the absence of footnotes.

 



 

4.6.4. The records, systems, controls, data and information of CNB are
recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means (including any
electronic, mechanical or photographic process, whether computerized or not)
that are under the exclusive ownership and direct control of CNB or its
accountants (including all means of access thereto and there from), except for
any non-exclusive ownership and non-direct control that would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the system of internal
accounting controls described below in this Section 4.6.4. CNB (x) has
implemented and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting that is designed to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of its financial
statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP, which system has
been reviewed by CNBs external auditors, and (y) has disclosed to CNBs
outside auditors and the audit committee of CNBs Board of Directors any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in CNBs internal control over financial
reporting. These disclosures (if any) were made in writing by management to
CNBs auditors and audit committee and a copy has previously been made
available to Bridge Bancorp.

 



 

4.6.5. Since January 1, 2010, (i) CNB has not, nor to the Knowledge of CNB,
has any director, officer, employee, auditor, accountant or representative of
CNB, received any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim, whether
written or oral, regarding the accounting or auditing practices, procedures,
methodologies or methods of CNB or their respective internal accounting
controls, including any material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim
that CNB has engaged in illegal accounting or auditing practices, and (ii) no
attorney representing CNB has reported evidence of a material violation of
Securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation with respect to
CNB, or any of its officers, directors, employees or agents to the Board of
Directors of CNB.

 



 

4.7. _Taxes._

 



 

4.7.1 CNB has duly filed all federal, state and material local Tax Returns
required to be filed by or with respect to CNB on or prior to the date hereof,
taking into account any extensions (all such returns, to CNBs Knowledge,
being accurate and correct in all material respects) and has duly paid or made
provisions for the payment of all material federal, state and local Taxes
which have been incurred by or are due or claimed to be due from CNB by any
taxing authority or pursuant to any written Tax sharing agreement on or prior
to the Closing Date other than Taxes or other charges which (i) are not
delinquent, (ii) are being contested in good faith, or (iii) have not yet been

authority in a jurisdiction where CNB does not file Tax Returns that CNB is
subject to taxation in that jurisdiction. CNB has not executed an extension or
waiver of any statute of limitations on the assessment or collection of any
material Tax due that is currently in effect. CNB has withheld and paid all
material Taxes required to have been withheld and paid in connection with
amounts paid or owing to any employee, independent contractor, creditor,
shareholder or other third party, and CNB, to CNBs

 



      
 

 



 

Knowledge, has timely complied in all material respects with all applicable

requirements. CNB (A) has never been a member of an affiliated group filing a
consolidated federal income Tax Return, and (B) has no liability for the Taxes
of any person under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar
provision of state, local or foreign law), as a transferee or successor, by
contract or otherwise. CNB has not been, within the past two years or
otherwise, part of a "plan (or series of related transactions)" within the
meaning of Section 355(e) of the Code of which the Merger is also a part, a

of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code) in a distribution of stock intending to
qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code. CNB has never
participated in a "reportable transaction" within the meaning of Treasury

CNB is an obligor to any person, which instrument evidences or relates to
indebtedness other than deposits, repurchase agreements, FHLB advances,
bankers acceptances, and "treasury tax and loan" accounts and transactions in
"federal funds" in each case established in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past practice, or which contains financial covenants or other
restrictions (other than those relating to the payment of principal and
interest when due) which would be applicable on or after the Closing Date to
Bridge Bancorp, Bridge Bank or any Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary; (vi) any other
agreement, written or oral, that obligates CNB for the payment of more than
$25,000 annually or for the payment of more than $50,000 over its remaining
term, which is not terminable without cause on 60 days or less notice without
penalty or payment (other than agreements for

 



      
 

 



 

commercially available "off-the-shelf" software), or (vii) any agreement
(other than this Agreement), contract, arrangement, commitment or
understanding (whether written or oral) that restricts or limits in any
material way the conduct of business by CNB (it being understood that any non-
compete or similar provision shall be deemed material, but any limitation on
the scope of any license granted under any such agreement shall not be deemed
material).

 



 

4.8.2. Each real estate lease that requires the consent of the lessor or its
agent resulting from the Merger by virtue of the terms of any such lease, is
listed in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.8.2** identifying the section of the
lease that contains such prohibition or restriction.

 



 

4.8.3. True and correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and
instruments referred to in Sections 4.8.1 and 4.8.2 ( **"Material Contracts"**
) have been made available to Bridge Bancorp on or before the date hereof, and
are, including to the extent applicable in the case of CNB Compensation and
Benefit Plans, in full force and effect on the date hereof and CNB has not
(nor, to the Knowledge of CNB, has other party to any such contract,
arrangement or instrument) materially breached any provision of, or is not in
material default in any respect under any term of, any Material Contract, and
there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or the giving of
notice or both, would constitute such a default or breach. Except as listed on
**CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.8.3**, no party to any Material Contract will
have the right to terminate any or all of the provisions of any such Material
Contract as a result of the execution of, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by, this Agreement.

not (i) except for (A) normal increases for employees made in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, or (B) as required by
applicable law or the terms of agreements listed on **CNB Disclosure Schedule

employee benefit plan, except to the extent required by the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act and the regulations issued thereunder, (iv) made any

(viii) changed any accounting methods, principles or practices of CNB
affecting its assets, liabilities or businesses, including any reserving,
renewal or residual method, practice or policy or (ix) suffered any strike,
work stoppage, slow-down, or other labor disturbance.

 



 

4.9. _Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage._

 



 

4.9.1. CNB has good and, as to real property, marketable title to all material
assets and properties owned by CNB in the conduct of its businesses, whether
such assets and properties are real or personal, tangible or intangible,
including assets and property reflected in the balance sheets contained in the
CNB Regulatory Reports and in the CNB Financial Statements or acquired
subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have
been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such
balance sheets), subject to no material encumbrances, liens, mortgages,
security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure liabilities
for public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or
other obligations to FHLB, inter-bank credit facilities, or any transaction by
an CNB acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii) statutory liens for amounts not
yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith, (iii) non-monetary
liens affecting real property which do not adversely affect the value or use
of such real property, and (iv) those described and reflected in the CNB
Financial Statements. CNB, as lessee, has the right under valid and existing
leases of real and personal properties used by CNB in the conduct of their
businesses to occupy or use all such properties as presently occupied and used
by each of them.

 



 

4.9.2. With respect to all material agreements pursuant to which CNB has
purchased securities subject to an agreement to resell, if any, CNB has a lien
or security interest (which to CNBs Knowledge is a valid, perfected first
lien) in the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement,
and the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt
secured thereby.

 



 

4.9.3. CNB currently maintains insurance considered by it to be reasonable for
its operations. Except as disclosed in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3**, CNB
has not received notice from any insurance carrier during the past five years
that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that coverage thereunder will be
reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs (other than with respect to
health or disability insurance) with respect to such policies of insurance
will be materially increased. There are presently no material claims pending
under such policies of insurance and no notices have been given by CNB under
such policies (other than with respect to health or disability insurance). All
such insurance is valid and enforceable and in full force and effect, and
within the last three years CNB has received each type of insurance coverage
for which it has applied and during such periods has not been denied
indemnification for any material claims submitted under any of its insurance
policies. **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3** identifies all material policies
of insurance maintained by CNB, as well as the other matters required to be
disclosed under this Section.

 



      
 

 



 

4.10. _Legal Proceedings._

 



 

 **Except as set forth in CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.10,** there is no suit,
action, investigation or proceeding pending or, to its Knowledge, threatened
against or affecting CNB (and CNB is not aware of any facts that reasonably
could be expected to be the basis for any such suit, action or proceeding) (1)
that involves a Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, or (2) that,
individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to CNB, would be (A)
material to its businesses, or (B) reasonably likely to prevent or delay it
from performing its obligations under, or consummating the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement. There is no injunction, order, award,
judgment, settlement, decree or regulatory restriction imposed upon or entered
into by CNB or to which its assets are subject.

 



 

4.11. _Compliance With Applicable Law._

 



 

4.11.1. Except as set forth in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.11.1** , to CNBs
Knowledge, CNB is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
federal, state, local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances,
rules, judgments, orders or decrees applicable to it, its properties, assets
and deposits, its business, and its conduct of business and its relationship
with its employees, including, without limitation, the Bank Secrecy Act, the
USA PATRIOT Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act and Regulation B, the Fair
Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act of 1977, the Fair Credit Reporting
Act, the Truth in Lending Act, Regulation Z, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act,
and all other applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to
discriminatory business practices and CNB has not received any written notice
to the contrary. The Board of Directors of CNB has adopted and CNB has
implemented an anti-money laundering program that contains adequate and
appropriate customer identification verification procedures, that has not been
declared ineffective by any Governmental Entity and that meets the
requirements of Sections 352 and 326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the
regulations thereunder. CNB is not a party to any agreement with any
individual or group regarding CRA matters.

 



 

4.11.2. CNB has all material permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and
approvals of, and has made all filings, applications and registrations with,
all Governmental Entities and Bank Regulators that are required in order to
permit it to own or lease its properties and to conduct its business as
presently conducted except where the failure to hold such permits, licensees,
authorizations, orders or approvals, or the failure to make such filings,
applications or registrations would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on CNB; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full
force and effect in all material respects and, to the Knowledge of CNB, no
suspension or cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or
approval is threatened or will result from the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining Regulatory
Approvals.

 



 

4.11.3. Except as set forth in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.11.3** , CNB is
not, and since January 1, 2010 has not been, subject to any cease-and-desist
or other order or enforcement action issued by, or a party to any written
agreement, consent agreement or memorandum of understanding with, or a party
to any commitment letter or similar undertaking to, or subject to any order or
directive by, or ordered to pay any civil money penalty by, any Bank
Regulator.

 



      
 

 



 

Except as set forth in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.11.3** , since January 1,
2010, CNB has not received any written notification or, to CNBs Knowledge,
any other communication from any Bank Regulator (i) asserting that CNB is not
in material compliance with any of the statutes, regulations or ordinances
which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening to revoke any license,
franchise, permit or governmental authorization which is material to CNB;
(iii) requiring, or threatening to require, CNB, or indicating that CNB may be
required, to enter into a cease and desist order, agreement or memorandum of
understanding or any other agreement with any federal or state governmental
agency or authority which is charged with the supervision or regulation of
banks or engages in the insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or
purporting to restrict or limit, in any material respect the operations of
CNB, including without limitation any restriction on the payment of dividends;
or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict
or limit, in any manner the operations of CNB, including without limitation
any restriction on the payment of dividends (any such notice, communication,
memorandum, agreement or order described in this sentence is hereinafter
referred to as a " **CNB Regulatory Agreement** "). The most recent regulatory
rating given to CNB as to compliance with the Community Reinvestment Act (
**"CRA"** ) is satisfactory or better.

 



 

4.11.4. **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.11.4** sets forth, as of December 31,
2013 and continuing to the date of this Agreement, a schedule of all executive
officers and directors of CNB who have outstanding loans from CNB, and there
has been no default on, or forgiveness or waiver of, in whole or in part, any
such loan during the two years immediately preceding the date hereof.

other material benefit practices, policies and arrangements maintained by CNB
in which any employee or former employee, consultant or former consultant or
director or former director of CNB participates or to which any such employee,
consultant or director is a party or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits
(the " **CNB Compensation and Benefit Plans** "). CNB has no commitment to
create any additional CNB Compensation and Benefit Plan or to materially
modify, change or renew any existing CNB Compensation and Benefit Plan (any
modification or change that increases the cost of such plans would be deemed
material), except as required by applicable law or Governmental Entity or to
maintain the qualified status thereof. CNB has made available to Bridge
Bancorp true and correct copies of the CNB Compensation and Benefit Plans.

 



 

4.12.2. Except as disclosed in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.2,** each CNB
Compensation and Benefit Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects in accordance with its terms and with applicable law,
including, but not limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, the Health Insurance Portability and

 



      
 

 



 

Accountability Act (" **HIPAA** ") and any regulations or rules promulgated
thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and notices required by
ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination
in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and any other applicable law have been
timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions for late
filings have been paid in full, if due. Each CNB Compensation and Benefit Plan
which is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2)
of ERISA (a " **Pension Plan** ") and which is intended to be qualified under
Section 401(a) of the Code is established pursuant to IRS-approved prototype
or volume submitter documents or has received a favorable determination letter
from the IRS, and CNB is not aware of any circumstances which are reasonably
likely to result in revocation of any such favorable determination letter.
There is no material pending or, to the Knowledge of CNB, threatened action,
suit or claim relating to any of the CNB Compensation and Benefit Plans (other
than routine claims for benefits). CNB has not engaged in a transaction, or
omitted to take any action, with respect to any CNB Compensation and Benefit
Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject CNB to a material unpaid tax
or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

 



 

4.12.3. CNB has never maintained or contributed to and has no liability under
a CNB Compensation and Benefit Plan which is subject to Title IV of ERISA.

 



 

4.12.4. All material contributions required to be made under the terms of any
CNB Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made or are accrued on
CNBs Financial Statements to the extent required by GAAP.

 



 

4.12.5. CNB has no obligation to provide post-employment health, life
insurance, or disability insurance, or, except as set forth in **CNB
Disclosure Schedule 4.12.5** , any retiree death benefits under any CNB
Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits mandated by Section 4980B
of the Code. Except as set forth in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.5**, there
has been no communication to employees by CNB that would reasonably be
expected to promise or guarantee such employees retiree health, life
insurance, or disability insurance, or any retiree death benefits.

 



 

4.12.6. CNB does not maintain any CNB Compensation and Benefit Plans covering
employees who are not United States residents.

 



 

4.12.7. With respect to each CNB Compensation and Benefit Plan, if applicable,
CNB has provided or made available to Bridge Bancorp copies of the: (A) trust
instruments and insurance contracts; (B) two most recent Forms 5500 filed with
the IRS; (C) three most recent actuarial reports and financial statements; (D)

issued by the IRS; (F) any Form 5300, 5310 or Form 5330 filed with the IRS
within the last two years; and (G) most recent nondiscrimination tests
performed under ERISA and the Code (including 401(k) and 401(m) tests).

 



 

4.12.8. Except as provided in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.8** , the
consummation of the Merger will not (alone or in combination with any other
event, including, without limitation, any termination of employment or service
at any time prior to or following the Effective Time) (A) entitle any
employee, consultant or director to any payment or benefit (including
severance pay, change in control benefit, or similar compensation) or any
increase in

 



      
 

 



 

compensation, (B) entitle any employee or independent contractor to terminate
any plan, agreement or arrangement without cause and continue to accrue future
benefits thereunder, or result in the vesting or acceleration of any benefits
under any CNB Compensation and Benefit Plan, (C) result in any increase in
benefits payable under any CNB Compensation and Benefit Plan, or (D) entitle
any current or former employee, director or independent contractor of CNB to
any actual or deemed payment (or benefit) which could reasonably be construed
to constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code).

 



 

4.12.9. Except as disclosed in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.9** , CNB does
not maintain any compensation plans, programs or arrangements under which any
payment is reasonably likely to become non-deductible, in whole or in part,
for tax reporting purposes as a result of the limitations under Section 162(m)
of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder, it being understood that
CNB makes no representation or warranty regarding the effect of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any actions taken by Bridge
Bancorp or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates on the deductibility of any
compensation under Section 162(m) of the Code and the regulations issued
thereunder.

 



 

4.12.10. Except as disclosed in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.10** , all
"nonqualified deferred compensation plans" (within the meaning of Section 409A
of the Code) are exempt from, or in material compliance with, both in form and
operation, Section 409A of the Code and the regulations issued thereunder.

 



 

4.12.11. Except as disclosed in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.12.11** , there
are no stock options, warrants, stock appreciation or similar rights, earned
dividends or dividend equivalents, or shares of restricted stock, outstanding
under any of the CNB Compensation and Benefit Plans or otherwise as of the
date hereof and none will be granted, awarded, or credited after the date
hereof.

CNB has not, nor has any of its respective officers, directors, employees or
agents, employed any broker, finder or financial advisor in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or incurred any liability or
commitment for any fees or commissions to any such person in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement except for the retention of
Raymond James and Associates, Inc. (" **Raymond James** ") by CNB and the fees
payable pursuant thereto. A true and correct copy of the engagement agreements
with Raymond James, setting forth the fees payable to Raymond James for
services rendered to CNB in connection with the Merger and transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, is attached to **CNB Disclosure Schedule
4.13**.

 



 

4.14. _Environmental Matters._

 



 

4.14.1. Except as may be set forth in **CNB Disclosure Schedule 4.14** and any
Phase I Environmental Report identified therein, with respect to CNB:

 



      
 

 



 

(A) To the knowledge of CNB, neither the conduct nor operation of its business
nor any condition of any property currently or previously owned or operated by
CNB (including Participation Facilities) (including, without limitation, in a
fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which it holds a lien, results or
resulted in a violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to
impose a material liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon
CNB. To the Knowledge of CNB, no condition has existed or event has occurred
with respect to any such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or
both, is reasonably likely to result in any material liability to CNB by
reason of any Environmental Laws. CNB has not during the past five years
received any written notice from any Person or Governmental Entity that CNB or
the operation or condition of any property ever owned, operated (including
Participation Facilities), or held as collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by
CNB is currently in violation of or otherwise is alleged to have liability
under any Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of Environmental Concern
(including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility)
for the cleanup or other remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern
at, on, beneath, or originating from any such property) for which a material
liability is reasonably likely to be imposed upon CNB;

 



 

(B) There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to CNBs Knowledge,
threatened, before any court, governmental agency or other forum against CNB,
(x) for alleged noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with, or

Bridge Bancorp is not aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely
to result in revocation of any such favorable

Bridge Bancorp, threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the Bridge
Bancorp Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for
benefits). Neither Bridge Bancorp nor any Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary has
engaged in a transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any

unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502 of ERISA.

violation of any Environmental Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a
material liability (including a material remediation obligation) upon Bridge
Bancorp or any of Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of Bridge
Bancorp, no condition has existed or event has occurred with respect to any
such property that, with notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably
likely to result in any material liability to Bridge Bancorp or any Bridge
Bancorp Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental Laws. Neither Bridge Bancorp
nor any Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary during the past five years has received any
written notice from any Person that Bridge Bancorp or any Bridge Bancorp

or held as collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them are currently
in violation of or otherwise are alleged to have financial exposure under any
Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of Environmental Concern
(including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility)
for the cleanup or other remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern

liability is reasonably likely to be imposed upon Bridge Bancorp or any Bridge
Bancorp Subsidiary.

 



 

5.12.2. There is no suit, claim, action, demand, executive or administrative
order, directive, investigation or proceeding pending or, to the Bridge

6.2. _Current Information._

 



 

6.2.1. During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective
Time, CNB will cause one or more of its representatives to confer with
representatives of Bridge Bank and report the general status of its ongoing
operations at such times as Bridge Bank may reasonably request. CNB will
promptly notify Bridge Bank of any material change in the normal course of its
business or in the operation of its properties and, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), or the

other actions as set forth in **Bridge Bancorp Disclosure Schedule 6.2.1**.
Without limiting the foregoing, as requested by Bridge Bank, senior officers
of CNB shall meet with senior officers of Bridge Bank on a monthly basis to
review the financial and operational affairs of CNB.

 



 

6.2.2. CNB and Bridge Bank shall meet on a regular basis to discuss and plan
for the conversion of CNBs data processing and related electronic
informational systems to those used by Bridge Bank, which planning shall
include, but not be limited to, discussion of the

 



      
 

 



 

possible termination by CNB of third-party service provider arrangements
effective at the Effective Time or at a date thereafter, non-renewal of
personal property leases and software licenses used by CNB in connection with
its systems operations, retention of outside consultants and additional

all of its books, papers and records relating to the assets, properties,
operations, obligations and liabilities, including, but not limited to, all
books of account (including the general ledger), tax records, minute books of
directors (other than minutes that discuss any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or any other subject matter CNB reasonably
determines should be treated as confidential) and shareholders meetings,
organizational documents, Bylaws, material contracts and agreements, filings
with any regulatory authority, litigation files, plans affecting employees,
and any other business activities or prospects in which Bridge Bank may have a
reasonable interest; _provided_ , _however_ , that CNB shall not be required
to take any action that would provide access to or to disclose information
where such access or disclosure would violate or prejudice the rights or
business interests or confidences of any customer or other person or would
result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications between
it and any of its counsel or as not permitted by law or regulation. CNB shall
provide and shall request its auditors to provide Bridge Bancorp with such
historical financial information regarding it (and related audit reports and
consents) as Bridge Bancorp may reasonably request for securities disclosure
purposes. Bridge Bancorp and Bridge Bank shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any interference with CNBs regular business operations
during any such access to CNBs property, books and records.

 



 

6.4. _Financial and Other Statements._

 



 

6.4.1. Promptly upon receipt thereof, CNB will furnish to Bridge Bancorp
copies of each annual, interim or special audit of the books of CNB made by

in connection with each annual, interim or special audit of the books of CNB

6.6. _Disclosure Supplements._

 



 

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, CNB will promptly supplement or
amend the **CNB Disclosure Schedules** delivered in connection herewith with
respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or known
at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth or
described in such **CNB Disclosure Schedules** or which is necessary to
correct any information in such **CNB Disclosure Schedules** which has been
rendered materially inaccurate thereby; provided, however, that any failure to
give notice in accordance with the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute
a violation of this Section 6.6 or the failure of any condition set forth in
Article IX to be satisfied, or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement
by CNB, unless the underlying breach would independently result in a failure
to satisfy of the conditions set forth in Article IX. No supplement or
amendment to such **CNB Disclosure Schedules** shall have any effect for the
purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

 



 

6.7. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 



 

CNB shall use its best efforts to obtain as soon as practicable all consents
and approvals necessary or desirable for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

6.8. _Best Efforts._

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, CNB agrees to use its
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or cause to
be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable laws and
regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

6.9. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 



 

In the event that CNB determines that a condition to its obligation to
complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify Bridge Bancorp.

 



 

6.10. _No Solicitation._

 



 

(a) CNB shall not, and shall cause its officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, consultants,
affiliates and other agents (collectively, the " **Representatives** ") not
to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit, induce or knowingly
encourage, or take any action to facilitate the making of, any inquiry, offer
or proposal which constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding any Acquisition Proposal or furnish, or otherwise afford access, to
any Person (other than Bridge Bancorp) any information or data with respect to
CNB or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person
from, waive any provisions of, or fail to enforce any confidentiality
agreement or standstill agreement to which CNB is a party; or (iv) enter into
any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal
or any agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by CNB or
any Representative, whether or not such Representative is so authorized and
whether or not such Representative is purporting to act on behalf of CNB or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by CNB. CNB and
its Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of CNB Representatives to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all existing discussions,
negotiations, and communications with any Persons with respect to any existing
or potential Acquisition Proposal.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " **Acquisition Proposal** " shall mean any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Bridge Bancorp), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to, or
that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction. For
purposes of this Agreement, " **Acquisition Transaction** " shall mean (A) any
transaction or series of transactions involving any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving CNB; (B) any transaction pursuant to which any third
party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through sale, lease or other
disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of CNB representing, in the
aggregate, 25% or more of the assets of CNB and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis; (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition of (including
by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar transaction)
securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or securities
convertible into, such securities) representing 25% or more of the votes
attached to the outstanding securities of CNB; (D) any tender offer or
exchange offer that, if

 



      
 

 



 

consummated, would result in any third party or group beneficially owning 25%
or more of any class of equity securities of CNB; or (E) any transaction which
is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing transactions,
or any combination of the foregoing.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(a), CNB may take any of the actions described
in clause (ii) of Section 6.10(a) if, but only if, (i) prior to the CNB
Shareholders Meeting, CNB has received a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal, that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.10;
(ii) the CNB Board determines in good faith, after consultation with and
having considered the advice of its outside legal counsel and, with respect to
financial matters, its independent financial advisor, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal;
(iii) CNB has provided Bridge Bancorp with at least two Business Days prior
notice of such determination; and (iv) prior to furnishing or affording access
to any information or data with respect to CNB or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, CNB receives from such Person a confidentiality
agreement with terms no less favorable to CNB than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement. CNB shall promptly provide to Bridge Bancorp any
non-public information regarding CNB or its Subsidiaries provided to any other
Person that was not previously provided to Bridge Bancorp, such additional
information to be provided no later than the date of provision of such
information to such other party.

 



 

For purposes of this Agreement, " **Superior Proposal** " shall mean any bona
fide written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if
amended or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition
Transaction on terms that the CNB Board determines in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor (i) would, if consummated, result in the
acquisition of all, but not less than all, of the issued and outstanding
shares of CNB Common Stock or all, or substantially all, of the assets of CNB;
(ii) would result in a transaction that (A) involves consideration to the
holders of the shares of CNB Common Stock that is more favorable, from a
financial point of view, than the consideration to be paid to CNBs
shareholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the
nature of the consideration being offered and any material regulatory
approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed
transaction beyond or in addition to those specifically contemplated hereby,
and (B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to
CNBs shareholders than the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial, regulatory
and other aspects of the proposal.

 



 

(c) CNB shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Bridge
Bancorp in writing if any proposals or offers (or modified offers or
proposals) are received by, any information is requested from, or any
negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with CNB
or any CNB Representatives, in each case in connection with any Acquisition
Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the name of the Person initiating
such discussions or negotiations or making such proposal, offer or information
request and the material terms and conditions of any proposals or offers.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) Subject to Section 6.10(e), neither the CNB Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or propose to withdraw, qualify
or modify, in a manner adverse to Bridge Bancorp in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including the Merger), the CNB
Recommendation (as defined in Section 8.1), or make any statement, filing or
release, in connection with the CNB Shareholders Meeting or otherwise,
inconsistent with the CNB Recommendation (it being understood that taking a
neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall
be considered an adverse modification of the CNB Recommendation); (ii) approve
or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition
Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance
with the provisions of Section 6.10(b)) or (B) requiring CNB to abandon,
terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding Section 6.10(d), prior to the date of the CNB Shareholders
Meeting, the CNB Board may approve or recommend to the shareholders of CNB a
Superior Proposal and withdraw, qualify or modify the CNB Recommendation in
connection therewith (a " **CNB Subsequent Determination** ") after the second
Business Day following Bridge Bancorps receipt of a notice (the " **Notice of
Superior Proposal** ") from CNB advising Bridge Bancorp that the CNB Board has
decided that a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that it
received (that did not result from a breach of this Section 6.10) constitutes
a Superior Proposal (it being understood that CNB shall be required to deliver
a new Notice of Superior Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal
from such third party or its affiliates that CNB proposes to accept and the
subsequent notice period shall also be two Business Days) if, but only if at
the end of such two Business Day period, after taking into account any such
adjusted, modified or amended terms as may have been committed to in writing
by Bridge Bancorp since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal (
_provided_ , _however_ , that Bridge Bancorp shall not have any obligation to
propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement), CNB Board has again in good faith made the
determination that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal.

 



 

6.11. _Board of Directors and Committee Meetings_

 



 

Following the receipt of all Regulatory Approvals (without regard to any
waiting periods associated therewith), CNB shall permit two representatives of
Bridge Bank to attend any meeting of their Board of Directors, executive
committee, loan (or credit) committee and asset liability committee as
observers, _provided that_ CNB shall not be required to permit these
representative to remain present during any confidential discussion of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or any Acquisition Proposal
or during any other matter that the CNB Board of Directors has been advised of
by counsel that such attendance by these representatives may violate or be
inconsistent with a confidentiality obligation or fiduciary duty or any legal,
regulatory or Nasdaq requirement.

COVENANTS OF BRIDGE BANCORP**

 



 

7.1. _Conduct of Business._

 



 

During the period from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time,
except with the written consent of CNB, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, Bridge Bancorp will, and it will cause each Bridge
Bancorp Subsidiary to, use reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business
organization and assets and maintain its rights and franchises, and
voluntarily take no action that would or would be reasonably likely to: (i)
adversely affect the ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals
or other approvals of Governmental Entities required for the transaction
contemplated hereby, or materially increase the period of time necessary to
obtain such approvals; (ii) adversely affect its ability to perform its
covenants and agreements under this Agreement; (iii) result in the
representations and warranties contained in Article V of this Agreement not
being true and correct on the date of this Agreement or at any future date on
or prior to the Closing Date or in any of the conditions set forth in Article
IX hereof not being satisfied; (iv) take any action or knowingly fail to take
any action where such action or failure to act could reasonably be expected to
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code; (vi) issue or grant any Right or agreement of any
character relating to its authorized or issued capital stock or any securities
convertible into shares of such stock other than any grant or award of any
options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, warrants or similar
instruments; or (vii) agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



 

7.2. _Regulatory Filings Relating to Merger._

 



 

In furtherance and not in limitation of Sections 8.2 and 8.3 hereof, Bridge
Bancorp will furnish to CNB copies of all documents, statements and reports
that it or Bridge Bank files with any other Bank Regulator or the SEC with

thereon prior to submitting such materials to the Bank Regulator or the SEC.

 



 

7.3. _Maintenance of Insurance_

 



 

Bridge Bancorp shall maintain, and cause each Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary to
maintain, insurance in such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as

7.4. _Disclosure Supplements._

 



 

From time to time prior to the Effective Time, Bridge Bancorp will promptly
supplement or amend the **Bridge Bancorp Disclosure Schedule** delivered in
connection herewith with respect to any material matter hereafter arising
which, if existing, occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would
have been required to be set forth or described in such **Bridge Bancorp
Disclosure Schedule** or which is necessary to correct any information in such
**Bridge Bancorp Disclosure Schedule** which has been rendered inaccurate
thereby; provided, however, that any failure to give notice in accordance with
the foregoing shall not be deemed to constitute a violation of this Section
7.4 or the failure of any condition set forth in Article IX to be satisfied,

 



      
 

 



 

or otherwise constitute a breach of this Agreement by Bridge Bancorp, unless
the underlying breach would independently result in a failure to satisfy of
the conditions set forth in Article IX. No supplement or amendment to such
**Bridge Bancorp Disclosure Schedule** shall have any effect for the purpose
of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX.

 



 

7.5. _Consents and Approvals of Third Parties._

 



 

Bridge Bancorp shall use its best efforts to obtain as soon as practicable all
consents and approvals, necessary or desirable for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated, and in the manner contemplated, by this Agreement.

 



 

7.6. _Best Efforts._

 



 

Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, Bridge Bancorp agrees to
use its best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

7.7. _Failure to Fulfill Conditions._

 



 

In the event that Bridge Bancorp determines that a condition to its obligation
to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify CNB.

 



 

7.8. _Employee Benefits._

 



 

7.8.1. Bridge Bancorp will review all CNB Compensation and Benefit Plans to
determine, in its sole and absolute discretion, whether to maintain, terminate
or continue such plans. In the event employee compensation and/or benefits as
currently provided by CNB are changed or terminated by Bridge Bancorp, in
whole or in part, Bridge Bancorp shall provide Continuing Employees (as
defined below) with compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially similar to the compensation and benefits provided to similarly
situated employees of Bridge Bancorp or applicable Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary
(as of the date any such compensation or benefit is provided). Employees of
CNB who become participants in a Bridge Bancorp Compensation and Benefit Plan
shall, for purposes of determining eligibility for and for any applicable
vesting periods of such employee benefits (and not for benefit accrual
purposes) be given credit for meeting eligibility and vesting requirements in
such plans for service as an employee of CNB prior to the Effective Time. This
Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of Bridge Bancorp or
Bridge Bank to terminate the employment of any employee or to review employee
benefits programs from time to time and to make such changes (including
terminating any program) as they deem appropriate.

 



 

7.8.2. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each of
Messrs. Lubow, Gunther, Lavelle, McConie and Ms. Frasco shall sign the
agreements included in **Bridge Bancorp Disclosure Schedule 7.8.2** , agreeing
to the payments and benefits that will be made to them in and acknowledging
the satisfaction of all amounts and benefits due under their change in control
agreements . The supplemental executive retirement plan entered into

 



      
 

 



 

between CNB and Stuart Lubow shall not be affected by such agreement, and Mr.
Lubow will receive the benefits under this plan pursuant to its terms.

 



 

7.8.3. Except to the extent of commitments herein or other contractual
commitments, if any, specifically made or assumed by Bridge Bancorp hereunder
or by operation of law, Bridge Bancorp shall have no obligation arising from
and after the Effective Time to continue in its employ or in any specific job
or to provide to any specified level of compensation or any incentive
payments, benefits or perquisites to any individual who is an employee of CNB
as of the Effective Time. Bridge Bancorp agrees that each CNB employee who (i)
is not offered employment with Bridge Bancorp or Bridge Bank as of the
Effective Time or (ii) is involuntarily terminated by Bridge Bancorp or Bridge
Bank (other than for cause) within six months of the Effective Time and who is
not covered by a separate employment agreement, change in control agreement,
severance, consulting, or similar agreement shall receive a severance payment
equal to (A) two weeks of base pay (at the rate in effect on the termination
date) for each full year of service at CNB, with a maximum of 26 weeks and a
minimum of four weeks of base pay, plus (B) amounts payable to such employee
for accrued vacation and personal days; _provided_ , _that_ such individual
executes a release agreement in a form approved by Bridge Bancorp. For
purposes of calculating the number of years of service, fractional years of
service shall be rounded up or down to the nearest full year.

 



 

7.8.4. In the event of any termination or consolidation of any CNB health plan
with any Bridge Bank health plan, Bridge Bank shall make available to
employees of CNB who continue employment with Bridge Bancorp or Bridge Bank ("
**Continuing Employees** ") and their dependents employer-provided health
coverage on the same basis as it provides such coverage to similarly situated
Bridge Bank employees. Unless a Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates
coverage under a CNB health plan prior to the time that such Continuing
Employee becomes eligible to participate in a Bridge Bank health plan, no
coverage of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents shall
terminate under any of the CNB health plans prior to the time such Continuing
Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate in the health
plans, programs and benefits common to all similarly situated employees of
Bridge Bank and their dependents. In the event of a termination or
consolidation of any CNB health plan, terminated CNB employees and qualified
beneficiaries will have the right to continued coverage under group health
plans of Bridge Bank in accordance with COBRA, consistent with the provisions
below. All CNB employees who cease participating in a CNB health plan and
become participants in a comparable Bridge Bank health plan shall receive
credit for any co-payment and deductibles paid under CNB health plan for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket requirements
under the Bridge Bank health plan, upon substantiation, in a form satisfactory
to Bridge Bank that such co-payment and/or deductible has been satisfied.

 



 

7.8.5. If requested by Bridge Bancorp in writing prior to the Effective Time
and after the CNB Shareholders Meeting, and subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Time, CNB shall cause to be adopted prior to the Effective Time
resolutions of the Board of Directors of CNB and any necessary amendments to
terminate any and all 401(k) Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time or
cease all contributions to any and all 401(k) Plan maintained or sponsored by
CNB (collectively, the " **401(k) Plan**"), and to prohibit the entry of new
participants to the 401(k) Plan as of the day preceding the Effective Time. In
the sole discretion of Bridge Bancorp, the 401(k) Plan may be merged into the
Bridge Bancorp 401(k) Plan or terminated immediately

 



      
 

 



 

prior to the Effective Time. The form and substance of such resolutions and
any necessary amendments shall be subject to the review and approval of Bridge
Bancorp, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. CNB shall deliver to Bridge
Bancorp an executed copy of such resolutions and any necessary amendments as
soon as practicable following their adoption by the Board of Directors of CNB
and shall fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments. If,
in accordance with this Section 7.8.5, Bridge Bancorp requests in writing that
CNB freeze entry of new participants into the 401(k) Plan, CNB shall take such
actions as Bridge Bancorp may reasonably require in furtherance of the
assumption of the 401(k) Plan by Bridge Bancorp, including, but not limited
to, adopting such amendments to the 401(k) Plan as may be necessary to effect
such assumption. In the event the 401(k) Plan is terminated, Bridge Bancorp
shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Bridge Bancorp 401(k) Plan to accept a "direct rollover" of such
Continuing Employees account balances (and to use reasonable best efforts to
include the rollover of promissory notes evidencing all outstanding loans)
under the 401(k) Plan, _provided_ _that_ such rollover is elected in
accordance with applicable law and is permitted by the terms and conditions of
the Bridge Bancorp 401(k) Plan.

 



 

7.8.6. If requested by Bridge Bancorp, CNB shall take all such actions as
Bridge Bancorp may request in order to fully and timely comply with any and
all requirements of both the federal Worker Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act of 1988 and any state specific WARN Act statutes
(collectively, the " **WARN Act** "), including providing notices to CNBs
employees.

 



 

7.9. _Directors and Officers Indemnification and Insurance._

 



 

7.9.1. For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Bridge Bancorp
shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has
been at any time before the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective
Time, an officer, director or employee of CNB (the " **Indemnified Parties**
") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses (including attorneys
fees), liabilities or judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement (which
settlement shall require the prior written consent of Bridge Bancorp, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or
administrative (each a " **Claim** "), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of CNB if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact
arising, existing or occurring at or before the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereby), regardless of whether such Claim is asserted or claimed before, or
after, the Effective Time, to the fullest extent as would have been permitted
by CNB under the regulations of the OCC, including as applicable the DCGL, and
under CNBs Articles of Association and Bylaws. Bridge Bancorp shall pay
expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such action or proceeding
to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent as would have been permitted
by CNB under the National Bank Act and the regulations of the OCC, including
as applicable the DCGL, and under CNBs Articles of Association and Bylaws,
upon receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if such officer,
director or employee shall be adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to
indemnification. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this Section 7.9.1 upon learning of any Claim, shall notify Bridge

 



      
 

 



 

Bancorp (but the failure so to notify Bridge Bancorp shall not relieve it from
any liability which it may have under this Section 7.9.1, except to the extent
such failure materially prejudices Bridge Bancorp) and shall deliver to Bridge
Bancorp the undertaking referred to in the previous sentence.

 



 

7.9.2. In the event that either Bridge Bancorp or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be
the continuing or surviving bank or entity of such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any
person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Bridge Bancorp shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 7.9.

 



 

7.9.3. Either Bridge Bank or Bridge Bancorp shall maintain, in effect for six
years following the Effective Time, the current directors and officers
liability insurance policies covering the officers and directors of CNB (
_provided_ , _that_ Bridge Bancorp or Bridge Bank may substitute therefor
policies of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which
are not materially less favorable) with respect to matters occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Bridge Bancorp or Bridge Bank be required to expend in the aggregate pursuant
to this Section 7.9.3 more than 300% of the annual cost currently expended by
CNB with respect to such insurance (the " **Maximum Amount** "); _provided_ ,
_further_ _,_ that if the amount of the annual premium necessary to maintain
or procure such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Bridge Bancorp
or Bridge Bank shall maintain the most advantageous policies of directors and
officers insurance obtainable for a premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In
connection with the foregoing, CNB agrees in order for Bridge Bancorp or
Bridge Bank to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers
liability insurance policies for six years to provide such insurer or
substitute insurer with such reasonable and customary representations as such
insurer may request with respect to the reporting of any prior claims.

 



 

7.9.4. The obligations of Bridge Bank and Bridge Bancorp provided under this
Section 7.9 are intended to be enforceable against Bridge Bank and Bridge
Bancorp directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be binding on all
respective successors and permitted assigns of Bridge Bancorp and Bridge Bank.

 



 

7.10. _Board of Directors_

 



 

Bridge Bancorp and Bridge Bank shall take such corporate actions as necessary
so that effective immediately after the Closing Date, two individuals who are
directors of CNB and who are designated by Bridge Bancorp and Bridge Bank, in
consultation with CNB, shall be appointed and elected to the Bridge Bancorp
and Bridge Bank Boards of Directors.

 



 

7.11. _Stock Listing._

 



 

Bridge Bancorp agrees to list on the Nasdaq (or such other national securities
exchange on which the shares of the Bridge Bancorp Common Stock shall be
listed as of the date of consummation of the Merger), subject to official
notice of issuance, the shares of Bridge Bancorp Common Stock to be issued in
the Merger.

condition, operations and business and matters relating to the completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby, at such times as CNB may reasonably
request. Bridge Bancorp will promptly notify CNB, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, of any governmental complaints, investigations or hearings (or
communications indicating that the same may be contemplated), which might
adversely affect the ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory Approvals
or materially increase the period of time necessary to obtain such approvals;
or the institution of material litigation involving Bridge Bancorp and any
Bridge Bancorp Subsidiary. Bridge Bancorp shall be reasonably responsive to
requests by CNB for access to such information and personnel regarding Bridge
Bancorp and Bridge Bank as may be reasonably necessary for CNB to confirm that
the representations and warranties of Bridge Bancorp and Bridge Bank contained
herein are true and correct and that the covenants of Bridge Bancorp and
Bridge Bank contained herein have been performed in all material respects;
provided, however, that neither Bridge Bancorp nor Bridge Bank shall be
required to take any action that would provide access to or to disclose
information where such access or disclosure, in Bridge Bancorps or Bridge
Banks reasonable judgment, would interfere with the normal conduct of Bridge
Bancorps or Bridge Banks business or would violate or prejudice the rights
or business interests or confidences of any customer or other person or would
result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting communications between
it and any of its counsel.

Agreement. References to Sections include subsections, which are part of the
related Section (e.g., a section numbered "Section 5.5.1" would be part of
"Section 5.5" and references to "Section 5.5" would also refer to material
contained in the subsection described as "Section 5.5.1"). The table of

and its representatives prior to the date hereof, or (b) included in the
virtual data room of a party prior to the date hereof. Any reference to the
other party vis-a-vis CNB, shall mean both Bridge Bancorp and Bridge Bank. The
parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation
arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

 



 

12.11. _Specific Performance; Jurisdiction._

 



 

The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
the provisions contained in this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed

equity. In addition, each of the parties hereto (a) consents to submit itself
