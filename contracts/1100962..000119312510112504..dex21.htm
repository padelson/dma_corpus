vii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

THIS AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ "), dated as of May 5,
2010, is by and among Endo Pharmaceuticals Holdings Inc., a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), HT Acquisition Corp., a Georgia corporation and a
direct, wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and
HealthTronics, Inc., a Georgia corporation (the " _Company_ ").

W I T N E S S E T H:

 

WHEREAS, Parent desires to acquire the Company on the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS in furtherance of the acquisition of the Company by Parent, Parent
proposes to cause Merger Sub to commence an offer (as it may be amended from
time to time as permitted under this Agreement, the " _Offer_ ") to purchase
all of the outstanding shares of common stock, without par value, of the
Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") at a price per share of Company Common
Stock of $4.85 net to the seller in cash, without interest (such consideration
or any other consideration per share paid pursuant to the Offer, the " _Offer
Price_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement;

WHEREAS it is proposed that, on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger
Sub shall, in accordance with the Georgia Business Corporation Code (the "
_GBCC_ "), merge with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), pursuant to
which each share of Company Common Stock, other than (i) shares of Company
Common Stock directly or indirectly owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company
and (ii) Dissenting Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration;

WHEREAS the board of directors of the Company (the " _Company Board_ ") has
unanimously (i) determined that the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Top-Up Option (the "
_Transactions_ "), are advisable, fair to and in the best interests of the
shareholders of the Company, (ii) adopted and approved this Agreement and
declared it advisable that the Company enter into this Agreement and (iii)
resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and, if required, adoption and
approval of this Agreement and approval of the Merger by its shareholders;

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Merger Sub has adopted, approved and
declared it advisable for Merger Sub to enter into this Agreement and to
consummate the Transactions upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein;

 

WHEREAS, the board of directors of Parent has approved this Agreement and the
Transactions, and Parent, in its capacity as the sole shareholder of Merger
Sub, has adopted and approved this Agreement and the Transactions upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein; and

 

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub have entered into (i) a Shareholder Tender Agreement in
the form attached as _Exhibit B_ hereto with each of James S.B. Whittenburg,
Richard A. Rusk, Clint B. Davis, Scott A. Herz and Laura A. Miller
(collectively, the " _Shareholder Tender Agreements_ "),   pursuant to which each of them has irrevocably agreed to tender the shares
of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them in the Offer (constituting,
in the aggregate, approximately 3.99% of the outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock) and (ii) an Employment Agreement with each of James S.B.
Whittenburg, Richard A. Rusk, Clint B. Davis and Scott A. Herz, in the forms
set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto (collectively, the " _Employment Agreements_
", and together with this Agreement and the Shareholder Tender Agreements, the
" _Transaction Agreements_ "), in order to provide for the continued service
and employment of such persons.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

 

THE OFFER

 

Section 1.1 _The Offer_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including ARTICLE
VIII), within ten (10) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, Merger
Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, commence, within the meaning
of Rule 14d-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together
with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_
"), the Offer; provided, that the Company agrees that no shares of Company
Common Stock owned by the Company or any Company Subsidiary will be tendered
pursuant to the Offer. The obligations of Merger Sub to, and of Parent to
cause Merger Sub to, accept for payment, and pay for, any shares of Company
Common Stock tendered pursuant to the Offer are subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted under this Agreement) of the
conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ (as they may be amended in accordance
with this Agreement, the " _Offer Conditions_ ").

 

(i) The initial expiration date of the Offer shall be 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on July 1, 2010. Merger Sub expressly reserves the right, at any time,
to, in its sole discretion, waive, in whole or in part, any Offer Condition or
modify the terms of the Offer; provided, however, that, without the prior
written consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall not (i) reduce the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer, (ii) reduce the Offer
Price or change the form of consideration payable in the Offer, (iii) change,
modify or waive the Minimum Tender Condition (as defined in _Exhibit A_ ),
(iv) impose conditions to the Offer that are different than or in addition to
the Offer Conditions, or (v) otherwise amend the Offer in any manner
materially adverse to the holders of Company Common Stock.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Merger Sub
(A) may, in its sole discretion (subject to the obligations of Parent and
Merger Sub under Section 1.1(a)(ii)(B) and Section 1.1(a)(iii)), without
consent of the Company, extend the Offer on one or more occasions in
increments of no more than five (5) Business Days, if on any then-scheduled
expiration date of the Offer, any of the Offer Conditions shall not be
satisfied or, in Merger Subs sole discretion, waived (if permitted under this
Agreement), until such time as 



 

2  such condition or conditions are satisfied or waived and (B) shall extend
the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation, interpretation or
position of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_
"), the staff thereof or the Nasdaq Stock Market (the " _Nasdaq_ ") applicable
to the Offer, and until any waiting period (and any extension thereof)
applicable to the consummation of the Offer under the Hart-Scott-Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_ ") and any
other applicable foreign antitrust, competition or similar Law shall have
expired or been terminated; provided, however, that in no event shall Merger
Sub be required to extend the Offer (1) beyond the Outside Date or (2) at any
time that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and does so terminate this Agreement.

(iii) In addition to the extension obligation set forth in Section
1.1(a)(ii)(B), Parent and Merger Sub agree that if on any scheduled
expiration date of the Offer, (A) the Minimum Tender Condition is not
satisfied, (B) the condition set forth in subsection (v) of _Exhibit A_ is not
satisfied, and prior to such expiration the Company did not have at least
five (5) days written notice from Parent of the facts or circumstances
underlying the failure of such condition, or (C) the condition set forth in
subsection (vii) of _Exhibit A_  is not satisfied, but in each case all of
the Offer Conditions set forth in _Exhibit A_ other than those described above
are satisfied or, in Merger Subs sole discretion, waived, then Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to (x) in the case of clause (A) or
clause (C) above, on the first such scheduled expiration date, extend the
Offer for ten (10) Business Days (the " _Initial Extension_ _")_ , and if on
the scheduled expiration date of the Initial Extension the requirements for
extension pursuant to clause (A) or clause (C) (as the case may be) continue
to be satisfied, further extend the Offer for five (5) Business Days (the "
_Second Extension_ _")_ , or (y) in the case of clause (B) above, on the
first such scheduled expiration date, extend the Offer for five (5) Business
Days; provided, however, that this provision shall not require Merger Sub
to extend the expiration of the Offer more than two times in the case of
clause (A) or clause (C) (for a period of ten (10) Business Days for the
Initial Extension and five (5) Business Days for the Second Extension), or
more than one time, for five (5) Business Days, in the case of clause (B),
and in no event shall Merger Sub be required to extend the Offer (1) beyond
the Outside Date or (2) at any time that Parent or Merger Sub is permitted to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VIII and does so terminate this
Agreement.

(iv) On the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept and pay for (subject to
any applicable Tax withholding pursuant to Section 1.1(d)) all shares of
Company Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to
the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration date of the Offer (as it
may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(a)). The
Offer Price payable in respect of each share of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the preceding sentence shall be paid net to the seller in cash, without
interest, on the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement.
Acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to and
subject to the conditions of the Offer upon the expiration of the Offer is
referred to in this Agreement as the " _Offer Closing_ ," and the date on
which the Offer Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "
_Offer Closing Date_." Merger Sub expressly reserves the right to, in its
sole discretion, following the Offer Closing, extend the Offer for a
"subsequent offering period" in accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange
Act;  _provided_ , _however_ such period (including any extensions thereof)
shall not



 

3  exceed twenty (20) Business Days. The Offer Documents (as defined below)
may, in Merger Subs sole discretion, provide for such a reservation of right.

 

(v) Nothing contained in this Section 1.1(a) shall affect any termination
rights in ARTICLE VIII.

 

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer (together with all amendments and supplements thereto and including
exhibits thereto, the " _Schedule TO_ "), which shall contain an offer to
purchase and a related letter of transmittal and summary advertisement and
other appropriate ancillary offer documents (such Schedule TO and the
documents included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together
with any supplements or amendments thereto, the " _Offer Documents_ "), and
cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the shareholders of the
Company as and to the extent required by United States Federal securities
Laws. Parent shall cause the Schedule TO and other Offer Documents to comply
in all material respects with the provisions of applicable Law. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall promptly correct any information
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Offer
Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have become false
or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as soon
as reasonably practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable
United States Federal securities Laws. Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly
notify the Company upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any
request from the SEC for amendments or supplements, to the Offer Documents,
and shall promptly provide the Company with copies of all correspondence
and summaries of all material oral communications between them and their
Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the
filing of the Offer Documents (including any amendment or supplement thereto)
with the SEC or dissemination thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or
responding to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Offer Documents,
Parent and Merger Sub shall provide the Company and its counsel a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on such Offer Documents or response, and
Parent and Merger Sub shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to
any such comments. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub receives any
comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents, each
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond promptly to such comments
and (ii) take all other actions necessary to resolve the issues raised
therein.

 

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the consideration necessary to pay for any shares of Company Common
Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment, and pay for,
pursuant to the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger
Subs obligations under this Agreement.

 

(d) Parent, Merger Sub, and the paying agent for the Offer (the " _Paying
Agent_ ") shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to the Offer to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock such amounts as Parent, Merger Sub, or the Paying Agent, as
applicable, is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended



 

4  (the " _Code_ "), and Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any
other provision of tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and
paid over by Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as applicable, to the
appropriate taxing authority, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock to whom such withheld amounts would otherwise have been paid.

mail the Schedule 14D-9 to the shareholders of the Company as required by Rule

comply in all material respects with the provisions of applicable Law. Each of
the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall promptly correct any information
supplied by it for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company shall take all
steps necessary to amend or supplement the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the
Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the SEC and
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company, in each case as soon as
reasonably practicable and as and to the extent required by applicable United
States Federal securities Laws. The Company shall promptly notify Parent upon
the receipt of any comments from the SEC, or any request from the SEC for
amendments or supplements, to the Schedule 14D-9, and shall promptly provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence and summaries of all material oral
communications between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC, on the other hand. Prior to the filing of the Schedule 14D-9
(including any amendment or supplement thereto) with the SEC or mailing
thereof to the shareholders of the Company, or responding to any comments of
the SEC with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, the Company shall provide Parent
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such
Schedule 14D-9 or response, and the 



 

5  Company shall give reasonable and good faith consideration to any comments
made by Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel. The Company hereby consents to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of the recommendation of the Company
Board contained in the Schedule 14D-9. In the event that the Company receives
any comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9, it
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond promptly to such
comments and (ii) take all other actions necessary to resolve the issues
raised therein.

(c) In connection with the Offer and the Merger, the Company shall cause its
transfer agent to furnish Parent and Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels
containing the names and addresses of the record holders of Company Common
Stock as of the latest practicable date and of those persons becoming record
holders subsequent to such date, together with copies of all lists of
shareholders, security position listings and computer files and all other
information in the Companys possession or control regarding the beneficial
owners of Company Common Stock, in each case as of the latest date
practicable, and shall furnish to Parent and Merger Sub such information and
assistance (including periodically updated lists of shareholders, security
position listings and computer files) as Parent may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to holders of Company Common Stock. Except for such
steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the Offer or the Merger, Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective affiliates, associates and Representatives shall use the
information contained in any such labels, listings and files only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger, shall treat such information and
materials in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, and, if this Agreement shall be terminated, will deliver to the
Company all copies of such information then in their possession promptly upon
the request of the Company.

Section 1.3 _Directors_.

 

(a) Effective upon the Offer Closing and from time to time thereafter, Parent
shall be entitled to designate the number of directors, rounded up to the
next whole number, on the Company Board that equals the product of (i) the
total number of directors on the Company Board (giving effect to the election
of any additional directors pursuant to this Section 1.3) and (ii) the
percentage that the number of shares of Company Common Stock beneficially
owned by Parent and/or Merger Sub (including shares accepted for payment
pursuant to the Offer and any Top-Up Shares) bears to the total number of
shares outstanding, and the Company shall cause Parents designees to be
elected or appointed to the Company Board, including by increasing the number
of directors and seeking and accepting resignations of incumbent directors
(with such method to be by the election of the Parent, including the
selection of the individuals designated for resignation ( _provided_ that
Parent shall give good faith consideration to the recommendation of the
Company with respect thereto)). At each such time, the Company shall also
cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute the proportional number
of members, rounded up to the next whole number, on (A) each committee of the
Company Board, (B) as requested by Parent, the board of directors (or
equivalent governing body) and each committee thereof of each Company
Subsidiary and (C) as requested by Parent, the board of directors (or
equivalent governing body) and each committee thereof of each Company Managed
Service Provider except, in the case of clauses (B) and (C), in proportion to
the number of members that may be designated by the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries to such board of directors (or

 



 

6  equivalent governing body) and each committee thereof, in the case of each
of clauses (A), (B) and (C), to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. 

(b) The Companys obligations to appoint Parents designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
promulgated thereunder. The Company shall promptly take all actions necessary
to effect the appointment of Parents designees, including mailing to its
shareholders such information with respect to the Company and its officers
and directors as Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 require in order to fulfill its
obligations under this Section 1.3(b), which shall be mailed together with the
Schedule 14D-9. Parent shall supply to the Company in writing and be solely
responsible for any information with respect to itself and its nominees,
officers, directors and Affiliates required by Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1
and the Companys obligations under Section 1.3(a) hereof shall be subject to
the receipt of such information. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in
addition to and shall not limit any rights that any of Merger Sub, Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner
of Company Common Stock as a matter of applicable Law with respect to the
election of directors or otherwise.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if Parents
designees constitute a majority of the Company Board after the Offer Closing
and prior to the Effective Time, then the affirmative vote of a majority of
the directors of the Company then in office who were not so designated by
Parent shall be required to authorize (and such authorization
shall constitute the authorization of the Company Board and no other action
on the part of the Company, including any action by any other director of the
Company, shall be required to authorize) any termination of this Agreement by
the Company, any amendment of this Agreement requiring action by the Company
Board, any extension of time for performance of any obligation or action
hereunder by Parent or Merger Sub and any waiver of compliance with any of the
agreements or conditions contained herein for the benefit of the Company.

Section 1.4 _Top-Up Option_.

 

(a) The Company grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option, exercisable once
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, for so long as
this Agreement has not been terminated pursuant to ARTICLE VIII (the " _Top-Up
Option_ "), to purchase from the Company up to the number of authorized and
unissued shares of Company Common Stock (including as authorized and unissued
shares, for purposes of this Section 1.4, any shares of Company Common Stock
held in the treasury of the Company) equal to the number of shares that, when
added to the number of shares owned by Merger Sub at the time of exercise of
the Top-Up Option, constitutes one share more than the number of shares (the "
_Requisite Short-Form Merger Shares_ ") entitled to cast 90% of all the votes
entitled to be cast by the holders of the Company Common Stock on the Merger
after the issuance of all shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, calculated on a fully-diluted basis or, as may be elected by Parent,
on a primary basis as of immediately prior to the issuance of such
shares (such shares to be issued upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, the "
_Top-Up Shares_ ").

(b) The Top-Up Option may be exercised by Merger Sub, in whole or in part at
any time following the Offer Closing and prior to the earlier to occur of (i)
the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms,  _provided_ that Merger Sub



 

7  shall own as of such time less than the Requisite Short-Form Merger Shares.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Top-Up Option
shall not be exercisable to the extent (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of the Top-Up Option would exceed the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock that are not
already reserved for issuance or (y) any other provision of applicable Law or
Order shall prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or the delivery of the
Top-Up Shares. The aggregate purchase price payable for the Top-Up Shares
being purchased by Merger Sub pursuant to the Top-Up Option shall be
determined by multiplying the number of such shares by the Offer Price,
without interest. Such aggregate purchase price may be paid by Merger Sub, at
its election, either in the same form of consideration as the Offer Price or
by executing and delivering to the Company a promissory note having a
principal amount equal to such purchase price and having full recourse to
Parent.

 

(c) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance and delivery of
the Top-Up Shares comply with all applicable Laws, including compliance with
an applicable exemption from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "). In the event Merger Sub
wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall give the Company at
least three (3) Business Days prior written notice, specifying (i) the number
of shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent and Merger Sub; (ii) the
number of Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub intends to purchase pursuant to the
Top-Up Option; (iii) the manner in which Merger Sub intends to pay the
applicable purchase price; and (iv) the place and time for the closing of
such purchase. At the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, Parent
and Merger Sub shall cause to be delivered to the Company the consideration
required to be delivered in exchange for the Top-Up Shares, and the Company
shall cause to be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up
Shares.

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub
may acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under
the Securities Act, and will be issued in reliance upon an exemption
thereunder for transactions not involving a public offering. Merger Sub agrees
that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of the Securities Act. Parent and Merger
Sub represent and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, and will be upon
purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501
of Regulation D under the Securities Act. Any certificates evidencing the
Top-Up Shares shall include any legends required by applicable securities
Laws.

ARTICLE III

 

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

 

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the
conditions of this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the
holders of any shares of Company Common Stock:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including
without limitation all vested and unvested shares of restricted stock issued
in connection with restricted stock awards granted to the executive officers
of the Company (the transfer restrictions on which shares shall terminate
immediately prior to the Effective Time) but not including shares to be
canceled pursuant to Section 3.1(c) hereof and Dissenting Shares) shall be
converted into the right to receive cash in an amount equal to the Offer Price
paid in the Offer (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of
any Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration, to be issued or paid in
consideration therefor in accordance with Section 3.2, without interest.

 

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Common Stock_. Each share of common stock,
without par value, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") that is
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of
common stock, without par value, of the Surviving Corporation, and the shares
of the Surviving Corporation into which the shares of Merger Sub Common Stock
are so converted shall be the only shares of the Surviving Corporation that
are issued and outstanding immediately after the Effective Time. Following
the Effective Time, each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger
Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of the Surviving
Corporation.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Certain Shares_. Each share, if any, of Company Common
Stock that is held by the Company as a treasury share and each share of
Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company or Parent or by any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent shall be canceled
without any conversion, and no consideration shall be delivered in
respect thereof.

(d) _Company Options_. Effective as of the Closing, the Company Stock Plans
and all Company Options outstanding immediately before the Closing shall be
cancelled and of no further force or effect, and in consideration for such
cancellation of Company Options

 



 

10  outstanding under the Company Stock Plans immediately before the Closing,
the holders thereof (whether or not such Company Options shall otherwise be
exercisable at the Effective Time) shall automatically (and without any
further action being required on the part of the holders thereof) receive, at
the Effective Time, an amount of cash equal to (i) the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to each such Company Option held by such holder
multiplied by (ii) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger Consideration over
(B) the per-share exercise price under such Company Option (with such payments
to be subject to any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with Section
3.1(f)).

(e) _Other Equity Awards_. Each award outstanding immediately before the
Effective Time (whether or not such award is vested at the Effective Time)
under the Company Stock Plans other than the Company Options (the " _Company
Stock Awards_ ") shall be cancelled and of no further force or effect as of
the Effective Time. In exchange for the cancellation of each such award, the
holder of such awards shall receive the per share Merger Consideration for
each share of Company Common Stock underlying such award (with such payment to
be subject to any applicable Tax withholding in accordance with Section
3.1(f)). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary such that no Person has any rights to acquire Company Common Stock
or common stock of the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (including the
Surviving Corporation) pursuant to any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement following the Effective Time.

 

(f) _Withholding_. Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the
Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Options or Company
Stock Awards such amounts as Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, is or may be required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other provision of tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes as having been paid to the holder of the Company
Common Stock or Company Options to whom such withheld amounts would otherwise
have been paid.

Section 3.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall engage a
nationally-recognized financial institution reasonably satisfactory to the
Company to act as exchange agent in connection with the Merger (the "
_Exchange Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the
Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the holders of shares of Company
Common Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
to be paid in respect of the Company Common Stock. All cash deposited with the
Exchange Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent
shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Certificates_
") or (ii) uncertificated shares of Company Common Stock



 

11  represented by book-entry (the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "), in each case,
which at the Effective Time were converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof, (a) a letter of
transmittal (which, in the case of Certificates, shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall be in
such form and have such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and
(b) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon (i)
surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or receipt of
an "agents message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of Uncertificated Shares, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and (ii) such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange the portion of
the Merger Consideration to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section
3.1, and any Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled. If any
portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the
Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the transferred
Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment
that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise
be in proper form for transfer or such Uncertificated Share shall be properly
transferred and (ii) the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax
has been paid or is not payable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.2(b), each Certificate or Uncertificated Share shall be deemed at
any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive the
Merger Consideration upon such surrender.

(c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All Merger
Consideration issued and paid upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms of this Article III
shall be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously
represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates or Uncertificated Shares are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this Article III.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock six (6) months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any
holders of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for the Merger Consideration.

(e) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the Exchange
Agent or any of their respective directors, officers, employees and agents
shall be liable to any Person in respect of Merger Consideration delivered to
a public official pursuant to any

 



 

12  applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate or
Uncertificated Share shall not have been surrendered prior to six (6) years
after the Effective Time, any cash remaining in the Exchange Fund at that
time shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of
the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any
Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
provided that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to former shareholders of the Company after the Effective Time
pursuant to this Article III. If at any time the funds held in the Exchange
Fund are insufficient to satisfy the obligations of Parent and/or Merger Sub
under this Agreement, Parent shall or shall cause Merger Sub to promptly
deposit additional funds held in the Exchange Fund such that the funds held in
the Exchange Fund are thereafter sufficient to satisfy the obligations of
Parent and Merger Sub hereunder. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article III shall promptly be
paid to Parent.

(g) _Withholding Rights_. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement
to any Person that was a holder of Company Common Stock immediately prior to
the Effective Time such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent, as
applicable, is or may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code and Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder, or any other provision of tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by Parent or
the Exchange Agent, as applicable, such withheld amounts shall be treated for
all purposes as having been paid to the Person to whom such withheld amounts
would otherwise have been paid.

 

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making and
delivery of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof and delivery of a
properly completed letter of transmittal to the Exchange Agent, such portion
of the Merger Consideration as may be required pursuant to Section 3.1(a);
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

Section 3.3 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by a
shareholder of the Company who has properly asserted such holders
dissenters rights under Article 13 of the GBCC (the " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect, or shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost, such holders right to payment of the "fair
value" for such shares under Article 13 of the GBCC. If any such holder shall
have so failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
right at or following the Effective Time of the Merger, each share of such
holders



 

13  Company Common Stock shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into
and to have become, as of the Effective Time of the Merger, the right to
receive, without any interest thereon, the Merger Consideration. Company
shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any notice or demands for appraisal or
payment for shares of Company Common Stock received by Company and (ii) the
opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any
such demands or notices. The Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle, offer to
settle or otherwise negotiate, any such demands. Each holder of Dissenting
Shares who becomes entitled under Article 13 of the GBCC to receive payment
of the "fair value" for such holders shares shall receive such payment
therefor from the Surviving Corporation (but only after the amount thereof
shall have been finally determined pursuant to the GBCC), and such shares
shall be retired and cancelled.

issued and are fully paid and nonassessable. All such shares of capital stock
or other equity interests directly or indirectly owned by the Company are free

Section 4.3 _Authority_.

 

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to
obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval if required in connection with this
Agreement and the Merger, to consummate the Merger and the other Transactions.
The execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this Agreement and
the consummation by the Company of the Transactions, have been duly authorized
by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
this Agreement or to consummate the Transactions (other than obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, if required for consummation of the Merger, and
the filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the
GBCC). This Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by the other
parties hereto, constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms subject,
as to enforcement of remedies, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium or similar Laws affecting the rights and remedies of creditors
generally and to the effect of general principles of equity. If approval of
the Companys shareholders is required pursuant to the GBCC, the affirmative
vote of a majority of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock entitled to
vote in accordance with the GBCC and the Company Organizational Documents
(the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ ") is the only vote of the holders of
capital stock of the Company necessary to approve this Agreement and the
Transactions.

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, duly and unanimously
adopted resolutions (i) approving and adopting this Agreement and the
Transactions, (ii) determining that the Transactions are advisable, fair to
and in the best interests of the shareholders of the Company, and (iii)
recommending that the Companys shareholders accept the Offer and, to the
extent required by Law, adopt and approve this Agreement. Such resolutions are
sufficient to render the Takeover Statutes inapplicable to this Agreement and
the Transactions, and no Takeover Statute or similar Law applies or purports
to apply to the Company with respect to this Agreement or the Transactions.

(c) Lazard Middle Market LLC has delivered to the Company Board its opinion
to the effect that, as of the date of such opinion and based on the
assumptions, qualifications and limitations contained therein, the
consideration to be received by the holders of Company Common Stock pursuant
to the Offer and the Merger, taken together, is fair, from a financial point
of view, to such holders. The Company will make available to Parent a correct
and complete copy of the form of such opinion solely for informational
purposes after receipt thereof by the Company.



 

18 Section 4.4 _No Conflict_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company nor the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions, nor performance of this Agreement by the Company will (a)
assuming the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, if required for
consummation of the Merger, conflict with or violate the Company
Organizational Documents or the equivalent organizational documents (including
any partnership, limited liability company or similar agreements) of any of
the Company Entities, (b) assuming compliance with Section 4.5 hereof and
assuming the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, if required for
consummation of the Merger, conflict with or violate any United States
Federal, state or local or any foreign statute, law, rule, regulation,
ordinance, code or any other requirement or rule of law (a " _Law_ ") or any
charge, temporary restraining order or other order, writ, injunction (whether
preliminary, permanent or otherwise), judgment, guideline, doctrine, guidance,
decree, ruling, determination, directive, award or settlement, whether civil,
criminal or administrative (an " _Order_ "), or any rule or regulation of any
securities exchange on which the Company Common Stock is listed for trading,
in each case applicable to the Company or any of the Company Entities or by
which any property or asset of the Company or any of the Company Entities is
bound or affected, (c) result in a breach of or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, give to others any right of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, result in the triggering of any payment or other obligation
or any right of consent, or result in the creation of a Lien on any property
or asset of the Company or any Company Entity pursuant to, any note, bond,
mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement, lease, sublease, license, permit,
franchise or other instrument or obligation to which the Company or
any Company Entity is a party or by which the Company or any Company Entity
or any property or asset of any of them is bound or affected (including any
Company Material Contract and any Company Permit), or (d) result in the loss
or impairment of or payment of any additional amounts with respect to, or
require the consent of any other Person in respect of, the Companys or any
Company Entitys right to own, use, or hold for use any of the Intellectual
Property as owned, used, or held for use in the conduct of business of the
Company or any Company Entity, except, in the case of clauses (b) and (c)
above, for any such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults or other
occurrences which have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 4.5 _Required Filings and Consents_. The execution and delivery by
the Company of this Agreement does not, and the performance by the Company of
this Agreement will not, require any consent, approval, order, authorization
or permit of, or declaration, registration, filing with, or notification to,
any United States federal, state or local or any foreign government or any
court, administrative or regulatory authority or commission or other
governmental or government-authorized authority or agency, domestic or
foreign (a " _Governmental Entity_ "), except for (i) applicable requirements,
if any, of (A) the Exchange Act, including, the filing with the SEC of the
Schedule 14D-9 and the Proxy Statement, (B) state securities or "blue sky"
Laws, (C) the GBCC to file the Articles of Merger or other appropriate
documentation and (D) Nasdaq, (ii) those required by the HSR Act, (iii) such
filings and approvals as are required to be made or obtained under any
foreign antitrust, competition or similar Laws in connection with the
consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (iv) the filing of customary applications and notices, as

19  or any other Regulatory Authority and (v) such consents, approvals, orders,
authorizations, permits, declarations, filings or notifications the failure of
which to obtain or make would not reasonably be expected to be, individually
or in the aggregate, material to the Company and the Company Entities, taken
as a whole.

written notice that the Company or such Company Entity is currently the
subject of any investigation, inquiry or proceeding by any Governmental Entity
(or any Governmental Entitys designated agent or agents), nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, is there any reasonable grounds to anticipate the
commencement of any investigation, inquiry or proceeding by any Governmental

other than payment or reimbursement withholds, or payment recoupments that
are ordinary course adjustments to correct non-continuing, non-systemic errors
and which, when taken together, are immaterial.

which (whether with notice or lapse of time or both) would reasonably be
expected to result in a suspension, revocation, restriction, amendment or
nonrenewal of any Company or Company Entity Health Care License has occurred.
The Company and each Company Entity is in compliance with the terms of
each Company Health Care License. No Governmental Entity is required to give
approval of a change of ownership or be notified of a change of ownership of

other documents required to be filed or furnished by it with or to the SEC
since January 1, 2007 (together with all exhibits, financial statements and

filed with or furnished to the SEC on a voluntary basis, the " _Company SEC
Reports_ "). As of its respective date, or, if amended, as of the date of the

disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the Companys management as

purpose entity or Person, on the other hand), or any "off-balance sheet
arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where

notification of any (x) "significant deficiency" or (y) "material weakness"
in the Companys internal control over financial reporting. For purposes of

shall have the meanings assigned to them by the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board Interim Standard AU 325 parts 2 and 3, as in effect on the

Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code or is otherwise a defined
benefit pension plan or is a plan described in Section 3(40) of ERISA or
Section 413 of the Code. With respect to any Company Welfare Plan or any
Company Benefit Agreement that is an employee welfare benefit plan, (A) no
such Company Welfare Plan or Company Benefit Agreement is funded through a
"welfare benefits fund" (as such term is defined in Section 419(e) of the
Code), (B) each such Company Welfare Plan and Company Benefit Agreement that
is a "group health plan" (as such term is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the
Code) materially complies with the applicable requirements of Section 4980B(f)

welfare benefit plan as defined under ERISA Section 3(1) provides benefits
to, or on behalf of, any former employee after the termination of employment

benefit is required by Section 4980B of the Code.

(c) (i) Each Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreement has
been administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and
with all applicable Laws, including ERISA and the Code.

Disclosure Letter.

 

(iv) Each Company Pension Plan that is intended to comply with the provisions
of Section 401(a) of the Code has been the subject of a determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service or an application therefor with respect to
all material and applicable tax Law changes to the effect that such Company
Pension Plan currently is qualified and exempt from income Taxes
under Section 401(a) of the Code and the trust relating to such plan is
exempt from income Taxes under Section 501(a) of the Code, and no such
determination letter has been revoked or threatened, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, no event has occurred since the date of the most recent
determination letter or application therefor relating to any such Company
Pension Plan that is reasonably expected to affect the qualification of such
Company Pension Plan adversely or materially increase the costs relating
thereto or require security under Section 307 of ERISA.

(v) The Company has made available to Parent a copy of the most recent
determination letter received with respect to each Company Pension Plan for
which such a letter has been issued, as well as a copy of any pending
application for a determination letter and a complete and accurate list of
all amendments to any Company Pension Plan in effect as of the date hereof as
to which a favorable determination letter has not yet been received.

 

(vi) There are no understandings, agreements or undertakings, written or oral,
with any Person (other than pursuant to the express terms of the applicable
Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement) that are (pursuant to any
such understandings, agreements or undertakings) reasonably expected to result
in any material liabilities if such Company Benefit Plan or Company
Benefit Agreement were amended or terminated upon or at any time after the
Effective Time or that would prevent any unilateral action by the Company (or,
after the Effective Time, Parent) to effect such amendment or termination.

 

(vii) Prior to the date hereof, the Compensation Committee of the Company
Board (each member of which was an "independent director" in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of
such action) took the 14d-10 Safe Harbor Steps in connection with approving
the Employment Agreements, and none of such 14d-10 Safe Harbor Steps has been
rescinded or modified.

(viii) Only officers, directors, employees and former employees of the Company
or any Company Entities who are required to be covered under Section 4980B of
the Code are eligible for compensation or benefits under the terms of each
Company Benefit Plan and Company Benefit Agreements, and, to the knowledge of
the Company, each individual who is classified by the Company or any Company
Entity as an "employee" or as an "independent contractor" is properly so
classified.

 

(d) Each Company Benefit Plan and each Company Benefit Agreement that is a
"nonqualified deferred compensation plan" within the meaning of Section
409A(d)(1) of the Code subject to Section 409A of the Code is, and has been
operated in such manner as to be, in material compliance with Section 409A of

of the Transactions (either alone or in conjunction with any other event)
will, except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.17(e) of the Company

increase the amount payable or trigger any other material obligation pursuant
to, or increase the cost of, any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit
Agreement or (iv) result in any breach or violation of, or a default under,
any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement. Except as set forth in
Section 4.17(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter, notwithstanding any oral or
written representation to the contrary, no Company Participant is entitled to
any gross-up, make-whole or other additional payment from the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in respect of any Tax (including Federal, state, local or

409A of the Code)) or interest or penalty related thereto.

 

(f) Except as otherwise set forth in Section 4.17(f)(i) of the Company
Disclosure Letter, no amount or other entitlement that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of any of
the Transactions (alone or in combination with any other event) by any Company
Participant who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in
Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any Company Benefit Plan, Company
Benefit Agreement or other compensation arrangement would be characterized as
an "excess parachute payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1)
of the Code). With respect to each Person set forth in Section 4.17(f)(ii) of
the Company Disclosure Letter (each a " _Primary Company Executive_ ") of the

event) under all Company Benefit Agreements and Company Benefit Plans and (ii)

Section 6.2 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Subject to the confidentiality agreement between Parent and the Company,
dated March 2, 2010 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and applicable Law,
the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Entities to, afford to
Parent and its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors
and other Representatives, full access at all reasonable times on reasonable
notice during the period between the date of this Agreement and the earlier of
the Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 8.1 to all their properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel
and records, including for the purpose of conducting Phase I environmental
site assessments ( _provided_ , that such access shall not unreasonably
interfere with the business or operations of the Company) and, during
such period, the Company shall, and shall cause each of the Company Entities
to, furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
registration statement and other document filed by it during such period
pursuant to the requirements of federal or state securities Laws, (ii) a copy
of all Owned Real Property Materials and (iii) all other information
concerning its business, properties, litigation matters, personnel and
environmental compliance and property condition as Parent may reasonably
request, including bi-weekly sales reports, bi-weekly headcount reports, bi-
weekly cash reports, bi-weekly accounts receivable reports and bi-weekly
reports on the average selling price of all services and products of
the Company and the Company Entities; _provided_ , that nothing in this
Section 6.2 shall require the Company to provide any access, or to disclose
any information, if permitting such access or disclosing such information
would (x) violate applicable Law, (y) violate any of its obligations with
respect to confidentiality ( _provided_ , that the Company shall, upon the
request of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
consent of any third party to such access or disclosure), or (z) result in
the loss of attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ , that the Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure in a
manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client privilege). In
addition, the Company and its officers and employees shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent in Parents efforts to comply with the rules and
regulations affecting public companies, including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. No
review pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty contained herein, the covenants or agreements of
the parties hereto or the conditions to the obligations of the parties hereto
under 



 

55  this Agreement. All information provided pursuant to this Section 6.2 shall
be subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(b) As soon as practicable after the date hereof, the parties shall create a
joint transition management committee (the " _Transition Committee_ ")
consisting of two Representatives from each of the parties hereto designated
from time to time as agreed by the Chief Executive Officers of each of Parent
and the Company. The Transition Committee shall be responsible for
organizing, developing, managing and implementing a transition plan for the
prompt and efficient integration of the business organizations of Parent and
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries subject to the requirement that
control of the management, properties and assets of Parent and the Company, as
set forth in this Agreement, shall at all times prior to the Effective Time
remain under the control of their respective boards of directors.

 

Section 6.3 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent shall give prompt notice
to the Company and the Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, as the
case may be, of the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which
occurrence or failure to occur is reasonably likely to cause (a)(i) any
representation or warranty of such party contained in this Agreement that
is qualified as to "materiality," or "Company Material Adverse Effect" to be
untrue or inaccurate in any respect or (ii) any other representation or
warranty of such party contained in this Agreement to be untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect, in each case at any time from and after
the date of this Agreement until the Offer Closing or (b) any material failure
of Parent or Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
by it under this Agreement. In addition, (i) the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent of any change or event having, or which would be reasonably
likely to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) Parent shall give
prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt notice to
Parent, as the case may be, of any change or event which would be reasonably
likely to result in the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Exhibit A_ to be satisfied, and (iii) each of Parent and the Company shall
give prompt notice to the other after receiving or becoming aware of any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the Transactions.
Notwithstanding the above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section
6.3 will not limit or otherwise affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties, the remedies available hereunder to
the party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation
to consummate the Transactions.

 

Section 6.4 _Antitrust Filings; Reasonable Best Efforts_.

 

(a) Each party shall make or cause to be made, in cooperation with the other
parties and to the extent applicable and as promptly as practicable, (i) an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the Transactions and (ii) all other necessary filings, forms,
declarations, notifications, registrations and notices with other
Governmental Entities under Competition Laws relating to the Transactions. "
_Competition Laws_ " mean the HSR Act, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, as
amended, the Clayton Act of 1914, as amended, the Federal Trade Commission
Act, as amended, and any other Laws or Orders that are designed to prohibit,
restrict or regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or
restraint of trade. Each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to
respond at the earliest practicable date to any requests for additional
information made by the United States



 

56  Department of Justice or any other Governmental Entities, and act in good
faith and reasonably cooperate with the other party in connection with any
investigation of any Governmental Entity. Each party shall use its reasonable
best efforts to furnish to each other party all information required for any
filing, form, declaration, notification, registration and notice with respect
to Competition Laws and the Transactions. Each party shall give the other
parties reasonable prior notice of any communication with, and any proposed
understanding or agreement with, any Governmental Entity regarding any
filings, forms, declarations, notifications, registrations or notices with
respect to Competition Laws and the Transactions, and permit the other
parties to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views
of the other parties in connection with, any proposed communication,
understanding or agreement with any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Transactions. None of the parties shall independently participate in any
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings or inquiry with respect to Competition Laws
and the Transactions without giving the other parties prior notice of the
meeting and, unless prohibited by such Governmental Entity, the opportunity to
attend and/or participate. The parties will consult and cooperate with
one another in connection with any information or proposals submitted in
connection with proceedings under or relating to any Competition Law. Without
limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable
best efforts: (i) to avoid the entry of any judgment that would restrain,
prevent or delay the Closing; (ii) to eliminate every impediment under any
Competition Law that may be asserted by any Governmental Entity so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event
no later than the Outside Date (as defined herein)); and (iii) vigorously to
contest and resist any such action or proceeding, including any administrative
or judicial action.

 

(b) Subject to Section 6.4(c), each of the parties to this Agreement agrees to
use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
parties to this Agreement in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable,
the Transactions, including (i) the obtaining of all other necessary actions
or nonactions, waivers, consents, licenses, permits, authorizations, orders
and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all other
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Entities, if any), (ii) the obtaining of all consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties necessary to consummate the Transactions, (iii) the
preparation of the Proxy Statement and any other documents that may be
required to be filed with the SEC, (iv) the execution and delivery of any
additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate any of the
Transactions, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement, and (v)
the providing of all such information concerning such party, its Subsidiaries,
its Affiliates and, in the case of the Company, the Company Managed Service
Providers as well as the officers, directors, employees and partners of its
Subsidiaries, Affiliates and, in the case of the Company, the Company Managed
Service Providers, in each case, as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any of the matters set forth in Section 6.4(a) or this Section 6.4(b).
Each of Parent and the Company agrees that it will use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain prior to the Offer Closing each of the consents that are
listed in Section 6.4(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter. Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub shall take any action not required by Law or this Agreement if such
action (x) (1) would reasonably be expected to (A) impose any material delay
in the obtaining of, or significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any
consent, approval, order, authorization or permit of, or declaration,
registration, filing with, or notification to, any Governmental Entity

 



 

57  necessary to consummate the Transactions or the expiration or termination of
any applicable waiting period, or (B) significantly increase the risk of any
Governmental Entity entering an Order prohibiting or impeding the
consummation of the Transactions or (2) otherwise would reasonably be expected
to materially delay or impair the consummation of the Transactions, and (y)
was taken by Parent or Merger Sub with the primary purpose of causing one or
more of the effects set forth in clause (x)(1) or (x)(2).

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 6.4, neither
Parent nor the Company shall be required in order to resolve any objections
asserted under Competition Laws by any Governmental Entity with respect to any
of the Transactions to divest any of its businesses, product lines or assets,
or take or agree to take any other action or agree to any limitation or
restriction if such action (i) would, or would reasonably be expected to,
materially and adversely affect the Company and the Company Entities, taken
as a whole, (ii) would, or would reasonably be expected to, materially impair
the benefits sought to be derived by Parent from the Transactions (taking into
account, among other things, effects on the assets, business and operations
and relationships of both Parent and its Subsidiaries and of the Company and
the Company Entities), or (iii) causes Parent to sell, divest, hold separate,
license, cause a third party to acquire, or otherwise dispose of any
material operations, divisions, businesses, product lines, customers or
assets of Parent or its Subsidiaries, or any other actions that may materially
limit Parents freedom of action with respect to, or its ability to retain,
any of its Subsidiaries, material operations, divisions, businesses, product
lines, customers or assets.

Section 6.5 _No Solicitation; Company Board Recommendation_.

(a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of the Company
Entities or its or their Representatives to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or encourage, or take any other action designed to, or which
would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any Company Takeover Proposal, or
(ii) enter into, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any Person any information with respect
to, or access to the properties, books or records of the Company or any
Company Entity in connection with, or otherwise cooperate with, any proposal
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Takeover Proposal. The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Entities and
its and their Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to
be terminated all existing discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any proposal that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal and request
the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information previously
furnished. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer
Closing, in response to a bona fide written Company Takeover Proposal that the
Company Board in good faith determines (after consultation with outside
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation)
constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Superior Proposal,
and which Company Takeover Proposal was not solicited after the date hereof,
was made after the date hereof and did not otherwise result from a breach of
this Section 6.5(a), the Company may, if a majority of the Company Board
determines (after consultation with outside counsel) that it is necessary to
take such actions in order to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law, and subject to compliance
with this Section 6.5(a) and Section 6.5(c) and after giving Parent written
notice of such determination, (x) furnish information with respect to the
Company and the Company Entities to the Person



 

58  making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) pursuant to
a customary confidentiality agreement (which agreement shall include a
customary "standstill" or similar covenant) not less restrictive of such
Person than the Confidentiality Agreement and containing provisions allowing
necessary disclosures to Parent pursuant to Section 6.5(c) hereof; _provided_
that (1) all such information has previously been provided to Parent or is
provided to Parent prior to the time it is provided to such Person and (2)
such customary confidentiality agreement expressly provides the right for the
Company to comply with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 6.5(b)
and Section 6.5(c), and (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Company Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives)
regarding such Company Takeover Proposal. Without limiting the foregoing, it
is agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
6.5(a) by any Representative or Affiliate of the Company or any Company Entity
shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 6.5(a) by the Company.

The term " _Company Takeover Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer
(whether in writing or otherwise) from any Person (other than Parent or Merger
Sub) relating to, or that is reasonably expected to lead to, any direct or
indirect acquisition or purchase, in one transaction or a series of
transactions, of any assets or businesses that constitute 15% or more of the
revenues, net income, EBITDA (earnings before interest expense, taxes,
depreciation and amortization) or assets of the Company and the Company
Entities, taken as a whole, or 15% or more of any class of equity securities
of the Company or any material Company Entity, any tender offer or exchange
offer that if consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 15%
or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any material
Company Entity, or any merger, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, joint venture, binding share
exchange or similar transaction involving the Company or any material Company
Entity pursuant to which any Person or the shareholders of any Person would
own 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any
material Company Entity or of any resulting parent company of the Company,
other than any of the Transactions. 

The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide proposal or offer
constituting a Company Takeover Proposal that, if consummated, would result
in the Person making such proposal or offer acquiring, directly or indirectly,
all of the Companys outstanding equity securities (or all of the outstanding
equity securities of the surviving entity in a merger of the Company or the
direct or indirect parent of the surviving entity in such a merger), or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and the Company Entities, taken
as a whole, which the Company Board determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel and a financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation) to be (i) more favorable to the shareholders of the
Company from a financial point of view than the Offer and the Merger, taking
into account all relevant factors (including all the terms and conditions of
such proposal and the Offer and this Agreement (including any changes to the
terms of the Offer and this Agreement proposed by Parent in response to such
offer or otherwise)) and (ii) reasonably capable of being completed, taking
into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other aspects of such
proposal.

 

(b) Neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, (i)(A) withdraw
(or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub), or
publicly propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Sub), the

 



 

59  adoption, approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Company Board or any such committee thereof of this Agreement or the
Transactions or (B) recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, or
propose publicly to recommend, adopt, approve or declare advisable, any
Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") or (ii) adopt,
approve, recommend or declare advisable, or propose to adopt, approve,
recommend or declare advisable, or allow the Company or any Company Entity to
execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding,
agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other similar
agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or is reasonably
expected to lead to, any Company Takeover Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.5(a) pursuant to and in
accordance with the limitations set forth therein). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, at any time prior to the Offer Closing Date, the Company Board may
make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change if and only if the Company has
received a Company Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal and
a majority of the Company Board determines (after consultation with outside
counsel) that it is necessary to take such action in order to comply with its
fiduciary duties to the shareholders of the Company under applicable Law;
_provided_ , _however_ , that prior to making any Company Adverse
Recommendation Change, the Company shall (X) deliver written notice to Parent
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change (a " _Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation_ "),
including the terms and conditions of the Superior Proposal that is the basis
of the proposed action by the Company Board, (Y) during the five (5) calendar
day period following delivery of the Company Notice of Adverse Recommendation
to Parent (the " _Notice Period_ "), direct its outside counsel and financial
advisor to negotiate with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent elects to
negotiate) to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior
Proposal and (Z) determine after expiration of the Notice Period, upon
consideration of the results of such negotiations and giving effect to the
proposals made by Parent, if any, that such Superior Proposal continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that, (1) if during
the Notice Period any amendments or modifications are made to the
Superior Proposal and the Company Board in its good faith judgment determines
(after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that such
revisions are material (it being understood that any change in the purchase
price or form of consideration in such Superior Proposal shall be deemed a
material revision), the Company shall deliver a new Company Notice of Adverse
Recommendation to Parent and shall comply with the requirements of this
Section 6.5(b) with respect to such new Company Notice of Adverse
Recommendation.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Section 6.5(a)
and Section 6.5(b), (i) the Company shall promptly advise Parent orally and in
writing (and in any case within 24 hours) of any Company Takeover Proposal or
any inquiry that would reasonably be expected to lead to any Company Takeover
Proposal, the material terms and conditions of any such Company Takeover
Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto) and the identity of the
Person making any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (ii)
the Company shall (A) keep Parent fully and promptly informed of the status
and material details (including any change to any material term thereof) of
any such Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry and (B) provide to Parent
promptly after receipt or delivery thereof copies of all correspondence and
other written material sent or provided to the Company or any Company

 



 

60  Entity from any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of any
Company Takeover Proposal or inquiry. In addition, during the period from the
date of this Agreement through the Offer Closing, the Company shall not
terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality
agreement to which it or any Company Entity is a party. During such period,
the Company shall enforce, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law, the provisions of any such agreement, including by obtaining injunctions
to prevent any breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the
terms and provisions thereof in any court of the United States of America or
of any state having jurisdiction.

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from taking
and disclosing to its shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
or Rule 14d-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any disclosure
to the Companys shareholders (including, without limitation, any amendments
to its Schedule 14D-9 relating to a Company Adverse Recommendation Change)
if, in the good faith judgment of the Company Board, after consultation with
outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be inconsistent with applicable
Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that all actions taken or agreed to be taken by
the Company or the Company Board or any committee thereof shall comply with
the provisions of this Section 6.5.

 

Section 6.6 _Shareholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate (at Parents expense) in the defense or settlement
of any shareholder Litigation against the Company and its directors relating
to the any of the Transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
settlement shall be agreed to without Parents prior written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except that Parent
shall not be obligated to consent to any settlement which does not include
full release of Parent and its Affiliates or which imposes an injunction or
other equitable relief upon Parent or any of its Affiliates (including, after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation).

 

Section 6.7 _Indemnification; Director and Officer Insurance_. For not less
than six (6) years from and after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to, and
to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless all past
and present directors, officers and employees of the Company to the same
extent such Persons are indemnified as of the date of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to the Company Articles of Incorporation and Company By-Laws
and indemnification agreements, if any, in existence on the date of this
Agreement with any directors, officers or employees of the Company for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_
, that Parent agrees to, and to cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify
and hold harmless such Persons to the fullest extent permitted by Law for acts
or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of this Agreement and
the consummation of any of the Transactions. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to provide, for an aggregate period of not less than six (6) years
from the Effective Time, the Companys current directors and officers an
insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events
occurring prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no
less favorable than the Companys existing policy or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be required
to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% (three
hundred percent) of the last annual premium paid prior to the date of this
Agreement; _provided_ that (i) Parent may substitute therefor a single premium
tail coverage with respect to DandO 



 

61  Insurance at a level at least as favorable as in the DandO Insurance, or (ii)
if Parent does not make the substitution provided for in clause (i) above,
then the Company may substitute therefor a single premium tail coverage with
respect to DandO Insurance at a level at least as favorable as in the DandO
Insurance for a premium not to exceed 300% (three hundred percent) of the last
annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement. If the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, or any of their successors or assigns, shall (a) be
liquidated and dissolved, (b) consolidates with or merges into any other
Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (c) shall sell or otherwise transfer all or a
majority of its assets to any other Person, proper provisions shall be made so
that the continuing or surviving entity or Parent, as applicable, and its
successors and assigns shall assume the obligations set forth in this Section
6.7. The provisions of this Section 6.7 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each indemnified party described in this Section 6.7 and his or her heirs and
representatives.

Section 6.8 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release shall be a
joint press release and thereafter, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the earlier of the Offer Closing and the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.1, the Company and Parent each shall
obtain the prior consent of the other party prior to issuing any press
releases or making other public statements and communications with respect to
any of the Transactions, except (i) as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of Nasdaq, (ii) in
connection with any dispute between the parties regarding this Agreement or
the Transactions, or (iii) with respect to or in connection with a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.5(b). In addition,

and communications (including any communications that would require a
filing under Rules 14d-2 or 14d-9 of the Exchange Act), with analysts,
members of the financial community or otherwise, with respect to any of the
Transactions shall be consistent in all material respects with such joint
communications strategy, except in connection with any dispute between the
parties regarding this Agreement or the Transactions.

Section 6.9 _Preparation of SEC Documents; Shareholders  Meeting_.

(a) If the adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company
is required by the GBCC, as soon as practicable following the Offer Closing,
the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC, subject to the prior review,
comment and approval of Parent (which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), a proxy statement relating to the Company Shareholder
Approval (such proxy statement, as amended or supplemented from time to time,
the " _Proxy Statement_ "). The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
to cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys shareholders as
promptly as practicable after clearing comments received from the SEC. No
filing of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement will be made by
the Company without Parents prior consent (which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) and without providing Parent the reasonable opportunity
to review and comment thereon. The Company will advise Parent promptly of any
request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy Statement or comments thereon
and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at
any time prior to the Effective Time any

 



 

62  information relating to Parent or the Company or any Company Entity, or any
of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should become known to
Parent or the Company or any Company Entity which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that any of such documents
would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall
be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

(b) Each of the Company and Parent shall supply such information specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy Statement necessary
so that, at the date it is first mailed to the Companys shareholders or at
the time of the Company Shareholders Meeting, the Proxy Statement shall not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made,
not misleading. Each of the parties hereto shall use their reasonable best
efforts so that the Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder.

(c) If the adoption of this Agreement by the shareholders of the Company is
required by the GBCC, the Company shall take all action necessary to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders as
promptly as practicable for the purpose of obtaining the approval by the
Companys shareholders in accordance with the GBCC (the " _Company
Shareholders  Meeting_"). The Company shall ensure that the Company
Shareholders Meeting is called, noticed, convened, held and conducted, and
that all proxies solicited in connection with the Company Shareholders
Meeting are solicited in compliance with applicable Law, the rules of Nasdaq
and the Company Organizational Documents.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if following the Offer and any subsequent
offering period and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, Parent and
its Subsidiaries shall own at least 90% of the outstanding shares of the
Company Common Stock, the parties hereto shall take all necessary and
appropriate action, including with respect to the transfer to Merger Sub of
any shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent or any Subsidiary of
Parent, to cause the Merger to become effective as soon as practicable after
the Offer Closing without the Company Shareholders Meeting in accordance with
Section 14-2-1104 of the GBCC.

Section 6.10 _Employees_.

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to either (i) provide the employees of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries who are employed immediately prior to
the Effective Time (the " _Covered Employees_ ") who remain employed during
such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits (excluding equity based
compensation) which, taken as a whole, have a value substantially comparable,
in the aggregate, to the compensation and benefits provided by the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries as of the date hereof or (ii) provide or cause
the Surviving Corporation (or, in such

 



 

63  case, its successors or assigns) to provide Covered Employees who remain
employed during such period by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or their
respective Subsidiaries with compensation and benefits (excluding equity
based compensation) which, taken as a whole, have a value substantially
comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to similarly situated
employees of Parent and its Subsidiaries. In addition, for a period of
one (1) year following the Offer Closing, Parent shall or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide Covered Employees whose employment is
terminated by Parent or the Surviving Corporation with severance benefits in
accordance with such employees individual employment agreement or, in the
absence of any such agreement, in accordance with either (i) the severance
policy of the Company in effect immediately prior to Closing, or (ii) the
severance policy of Parent in effect from time to time. Parent shall have no
obligation and the Company shall take no action that would have the effect of
requiring Parent or the Surviving Corporation to continue any specific plans
(except with respect to existing employment agreements) or to continue the
employment of any specific Person.

(b) For purposes of determining eligibility to participate in, and non-
forfeitable rights under any employee benefit plan or arrangement of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including
for purposes of vacation eligibility), but not for purposes of benefit
accrual under any defined benefit pension plan of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries, Covered Employees shall receive service credit for service with
the Company (and with any predecessor or acquired entities or any other
entities for which the Company granted service credit) as if such service had
been completed with Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need
not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any
duplication of benefits for the same period of service.

(c) To the extent applicable, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any of their respective Subsidiaries to waive, or use
reasonable best efforts to cause its insurance carriers to waive, any pre-
existing condition limitation on participation and coverage applicable to any
Covered Employee or any of his or her covered dependents under any health or
welfare plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries (a " _New Plan_ ") in which such Covered Employee or covered
dependent shall become eligible to participate after the Effective Time to
the extent such Covered Employee or covered dependent was no longer subject to
such pre-existing condition limitation under the corresponding Company Benefit
Plan in which such Covered Employee or such covered dependent was
participating immediately before he or she became eligible to participate in
the New Plan. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation or the
relevant Subsidiary of either to provide each Covered Employee with credit for
any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Effective Time and during
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs under any Company Benefit
Plan in satisfying any applicable co-payment and deductible requirements for
such calendar year under any New Plan in which such Covered Employee
participates after the Effective Time.

(d) Nothing in this Section 6.10 shall (i) confer any rights or remedies of
any kind or description upon any Covered Employee or any other Person other
than the Company and Parent and their respective successors and assigns, (ii)
be construed as an amendment, waiver or creation of or limitation on the
ability to terminate any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or
benefit plan or agreement of Parent or (iii) limit the ability of

 



 

64  the Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to terminate the employment of any Covered Employee at
any time.

 

(e) _Rule 14d-10 Matters_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Company will not, on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Offer Closing, enter into, establish, amend or modify any plan, program,
agreement or arrangement pursuant to which compensation is paid or payable, or
pursuant to which benefits are provided, in each case to any former, current
or future director, officer, employee, consultant, advisor or independent
contractor of the Company or any Company Entity (or any person who would have
assumed such role or performed such duties but for a requirement to refrain
from assuming such role or performing such duties in such plan, program,
agreement or arrangement) unless, prior to such entry into, establishment,
amendment or modification, the Compensation Committee of the Company Board
(each member of which shall be an "independent director" in accordance with
the requirements of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act at the time of
any such action) shall have taken all such steps as may be necessary to (i)
approve as an employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit
arrangement each such plan, program, agreement or arrangement and (ii) satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor under Rule 14d-10(d)(2)
under the Exchange Act with respect to such plan, program, agreement or
arrangement (such steps, the " _14d-10 Safe Harbor Steps_ "). The Company
shall, prior to the Offer Closing, take such actions necessary and appropriate
to ratify, confirm and approve, in accordance with and for the purpose of
Rule 14d-10 under the Exchange Act, compensation paid or payable to Covered
Employees under any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or
otherwise in connection with the Transactions.

 

(f) The Company and the Company Entities shall refrain from causing any
employees of the Company or the Company Entities to suffer an "employment
loss" or "layoff" as defined in the WARN Act, in the ninety-one (91) days
prior to the Offer Closing, without the prior consent of Parent.
Notwithstanding Section 6.8 of this Agreement, the Company and the Company
Entities, as applicable, shall reasonably cooperate with and provide
reasonable assistance to Parent or its agents in preparing and delivering any
notices required or potentially required pursuant to the WARN Act (as
determined by Parent in its sole discretion) to effectuate the termination of
the employment of any employees of the Company or the Company Entities as of
or following the Effective Time in compliance with the WARN Act; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that all such notices shall indicate that the terminations of
employment are contingent upon the consummation of the Merger.

Section 6.11  _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause any dispositions of Company Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Company Common Stock)
resulting from the Transactions by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act,
such efforts to include all steps required be taken in accordance with the
No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps,
Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.



 

65 Section 6.12 _Payoff Letter_.

 

(a) At least three (3) Business Days prior to the Offer Closing, the Company
shall deliver a notice of termination in accordance with Section 2.07 of the
Credit Agreement, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit D_ hereto, to
JPMorgan Chase Bank, National Associate, as Administrative Agent under the
Credit Agreement.

 

(b) Prior to the Offer Closing, the Company shall use commercially reasonable
best efforts to obtain (i) a customary payoff letter from the lenders under
the Credit Agreement (and other outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money,
if any) which (a) confirms the full outstanding amount of the Loans (as
defined in the Credit Agreement) then outstanding, along with
accrued interest thereon and all fees and other obligations of the Company
accrued under the Credit Agreement (or such other indebtedness) (the " _Payoff
Amount_ "), (b) contains payment instructions, and (c) evidences
the agreement by such lenders to release all Liens upon the payment of such
amount in accordance with the payment instructions, and (ii) documents,
including an authorization to file UCC termination statements, executed
terminations and releases of outstanding mortgages, as are reasonably
necessary to release such Liens.

(c) At the Offer Closing, Parent shall make available to, and pay to, the
Company for payment to the lenders under the Credit Agreement the Payoff
Amount. Subject to Parents compliance with the previous sentence, the Company
shall repay the Payoff Amount to the lenders under the Credit Agreement and
terminate such agreement concurrent with the Offer Closing.

Section 6.13 _Takeover Statutes_. The Company and the Company Board shall
take all actions necessary so that the restrictions of the Takeover Statutes
shall remain inapplicable to any and all of the Transactions. If any Takeover
Statute becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, the Company and the
Company Board shall grant such approvals and take such actions as are
necessary so that any such Transactions may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise act to
eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or regulation on such
Transactions.

Section 6.14 _Voting of Shares_. Parent shall vote (or cause to be voted) all
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by it or Merger Sub in favor
of approval of the Merger at the Company Shareholders Meeting, unless the
GBCC does not require a vote of the shareholders of the Company for
consummation of the Merger.

Section 6.15 _No Control of Other Party s Business_. Nothing contained
in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or indirectly, the right to
control or direct the Companys or its Subsidiaries operations prior to the
Offer Closing Date, and nothing contained in this Agreement shall give the
Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct Parents or
its Subsidiaries operations prior to the Offer Closing Date. Prior to the
Offer Closing Date, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over its and its Subsidiaries respective operations.

terminated and have no further effect, the obligations of the parties
hereunder shall terminate, and there shall be no liability on the part of any
party hereto with respect thereto, except that (i) the provisions of Section

pursuant to this Section 8.2(c), the Company shall pay to Parent its out-of-

any approval of the Transactions by the shareholders of the Company, there may
not be, without further approval of the shareholders of the Company, any
amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law otherwise expressly requires
the further approval of such shareholders. No amendment shall be made to this
Agreement after the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except

covenants, obligations or other acts of any other party hereto or (ii) waive
any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or compliance with any of

conditions to its own obligations. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto
to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly
authorized officer. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any
of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver
of such rights. The waiver of any such right with respect to particular facts
and other circumstances shall not be deemed a waiver with respect to any other
facts and circumstances and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right
that may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
