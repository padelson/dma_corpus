Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective, the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the applicable

 _EFFECT ON THE CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

Section 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock of the Company and Merger Sub_. At the
Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
any holder of any Securities of the Company or Merger Sub I:

(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent, the Company (including shares held as treasury stock or
otherwise) or either Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(a), (ii) shares relating to Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs and Company PSUs, which are to be treated in accordance with
Section 2.7 and (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 2.4, Appraisal
Shares) shall at the Effective Time be converted into the right to receive (x)
$28.25 in cash, without interest (such amount of cash, as may be adjusted
pursuant to Section 2.2, the " _Per Share Cash Amount_ "), and (y) 0.622
(such ratio, as may be adjusted pursuant to Section 2.2, the " _Exchange
Ratio_ ") of a validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of Parent
Common Stock (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock payable in accordance with Section 2.3) (the consideration
payable in accordance with this Section 2.1(b), collectively, the "
_Merger Consideration_ ").

(c) As of the Effective Time, all shares of Company Common Stock converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section
2.1 shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of (1) a certificate
that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of
Company Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") or (2) shares of Company Common
Stock held in book entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have
any rights with respect thereto, except (subject to Section 2.4) the right to
receive (A) the Merger Consideration and (B) any other amounts expressly
provided herein, without interest, subject to compliance with the procedures
set forth in Section 2.5.

 

(d) Each share of capital stock of Merger Sub I issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $0.001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

 

Section 2.2 _Certain Adjustments_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, from the date of this Agreement until the earlier of (a)
the Effective Time or (b) any termination of this Agreement in accordance with
Article VII, the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common
Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a
different class by reason of any reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of
shares, readjustment, or other similar transaction (including any exercise of
Company Rights), or a stock dividend thereon shall be declared with a record
date within said period, then the Exchange Ratio (and the

 



4  Per Share Cash Amount in the case of any such action in respect of Company
Common Stock) and any other similarly dependent items, as the case may be,
shall be appropriately adjusted to provide Parent and the holders of Company
Common Stock (including Company Stock Options exercisable for Company Common
Stock, Company RSUs and Company PSUs) the same economic effect as contemplated
by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this Section 2.2 shall be
construed to permit any Party to take any action that is otherwise prohibited
or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.3 _Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the conversion
of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to any Parent Common Stock or to
vote or to any other rights of a holder of Parent Common Stock.
All fractional shares to which a single holder of Company Common Stock would
be otherwise entitled to receive shall be aggregated and calculations shall be
rounded to three decimal places. In lieu of any such fractional shares, each
holder of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to such
fractional shares shall be entitled to an amount in cash, without interest,
rounded down to the nearest cent, equal to the product of (A) the amount of
the fractional share interest in a share of Parent Common Stock to which such
holder would, but for this Section 2.3, be entitled under Section 2.1(b) and
(B) an amount equal to the Parent Stock Value. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
Company Common Stock in lieu of any fractional share interests in Parent
Common Stock, the Exchange Agent shall make available such amounts, without
interest, to the holders of Company Common Stock entitled to receive such
cash. The payment of cash in lieu of fractional share interests pursuant to
this Section 2.3 is not a separately bargained-for consideration.

 

Section 2.4 _Appraisal Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, shares (" _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock that
are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
any Person who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such
Appraisal Shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, Section
262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") shall not be converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.1, but rather the
holders of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled to payment by the Surviving
Entity of the "fair value" of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with Section
262; _provided_ , _however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 with respect to such Appraisal Shares, then the right of such holder to be
paid the fair value of such Appraisal Shares shall cease and such Appraisal
Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into,
and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, the Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.1. The Company shall provide prompt
notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other
instruments served pursuant to Section 262 received by the Company. Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations
and Proceedings with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, waive
any failure to timely deliver a written demand for appraisal in accordance
with the DGCL, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 



5 Section 2.5 _Exchange of Company Common Stock_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall enter into a customary exchange
agreement with a nationally recognized financial institution designated by
Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Exchange Agent_ "),
and shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock (other than (i) shares to be cancelled in
accordance with Section 2.1(a), (ii) shares relating to Company Stock Options,
Company RSUs and Company PSUs, which are to be treated in accordance with
Section 2.7, and (iii) subject to the provisions of Section 2.4, Appraisal
Shares), the full number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable
pursuant to Section 2.1. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide or shall cause to be provided to the Exchange Agent cash in
an aggregate amount necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration in respect of all shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and Parent shall, after the Effective
Time on the appropriate payment date, if applicable, provide or cause to be
provided to the Exchange Agent any dividends or other distributions payable on
such shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5(c) (such shares of
Parent Common Stock and cash provided to the Exchange Agent, together with
any dividends or other distributions with respect thereto and any amounts to
be paid in cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.3,
are hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). For the purposes of
such initial deposit, Parent shall assume that there will not be any
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock. Parent shall provide to the Exchange
Agent, for addition to the Exchange Fund, from time to time as needed, cash
sufficient to pay cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section
2.3. If any Appraisal Shares cease to be Appraisal Shares, Parent shall
promptly make available to the Exchange Agent, for addition to the Exchange
Fund, the full number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant
to Section 2.1 with respect to such former Appraisal Shares, cash in an
aggregate amount necessary to pay the cash portion of the Merger
Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
Section 2.3 with respect to such Appraisal Shares and, if applicable, any
dividends or other distributions payable in connection with the Parent Common
Stock into which such Appraisal Shares have converted into the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.5(c), and such amounts shall become part of the
Exchange Fund. The Exchange Agent shall deliver the Merger Consideration to be
issued pursuant to Section 2.1 out of the Exchange Fund in accordance with
the exchange agreement contemplated by this Section 2.5(a). Except as provided
in Section 2.5(h), the Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose.
Nothing contained in this Section 2.5(a) and no investment losses resulting
from investment of the funds deposited with the Exchange Agent shall diminish
the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

 

(i) _Certificates_. Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, to each holder of record of
a Certificate whose shares of Company Common Stock were converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1, (i) a
letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof pursuant to

 



6  Section 2.5(g)) and shall be in customary form and have such other
provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger
Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to Section
2.5(g)), together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor,
and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and deliver in
exchange thereof as promptly as practicable, (A) cash in an amount equal to
the Per Share Cash Amount multiplied by the number of shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by such Certificate, (B) the number of shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book entry form unless a certificate
is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares that
such holder has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant
to Section 2.1(b) (after taking into account all other Certificates
surrendered by such holder pursuant to this Section 2.5(b)(i)), (C) any
dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(i) and (D)
cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock payable pursuant to
Section 2.3, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made and
shares may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by
reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been
paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or accrue on any cash
payable upon surrender of any Certificate pursuant to, and in accordance with,
this Agreement.

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, any holder of Book-Entry Shares shall not be required to
deliver a Certificate or an executed letter of transmittal to the Exchange
Agent to receive the Merger Consideration and other amounts that such holder
is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares whose shares of Company
Common Stock were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 2.1 shall automatically upon the Effective Time
be entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to pay and
deliver as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, (A) cash in an
amount equal to the Per Share Cash Amount multiplied by the number of shares
of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Book-Entry Shares, (B)
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock (which shall be in book-entry form
unless a certificate is requested) representing, in the aggregate, the whole
number of shares that such holder has the right to receive in respect of such
Book-Entry Shares pursuant to Section 2.1(b) (after taking into account all
other Book-Entry Shares held by such holder and converted pursuant to this
Section 2.5(b)(ii)), (C) any dividends or

 



7  distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.5(c)(ii) and (D) cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to Section 2.3, and the Book-Entry
Shares of such holder shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest shall be paid
or accrue on any cash payable upon conversion of any Book-Entry Shares.

(c)  _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

(i) _Certificates_. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid
to the holder of any Certificate formerly representing Company Common Stock,
and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to Section 2.3, until the surrender of such Certificate
(or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) in accordance with this Article II.
Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any such Certificate, there
shall be paid to the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange therefor, without interest, (A) by the Exchange Agent at the time of
delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
2.5(b)(i), the aggregate amount of dividends or other distributions payable
on such shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with a dividend or other
distribution with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore paid by
Parent and (B) by Parent at the appropriate payment date, the aggregate
amount of dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent
Common Stock in connection with a dividend or other distribution with a record
date after the Effective Time but prior to such delivery of such Parent
Common Stock by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(i), and a
payment date subsequent to such delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(i).

 

(ii) _Book-Entry Shares_. Subject to applicable Law, there shall be paid to
the holder of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with this Article II, without interest, (A) by the
Exchange Agent at the time of delivery of such Parent Common Stock by the
Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii), the aggregate amount of
dividends or other distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock
in connection with a dividend or other distribution with a record date after
the Effective Time theretofore paid by Parent and (B) by Parent at the
appropriate payment date, the aggregate amount of dividends or other
distributions payable on such shares of Parent Common Stock in connection with
a dividend or other distribution with a record date after the Effective Time
but prior to the time of such delivery by the Exchange Agent pursuant to
Section 2.5(b)(ii), and a payment date subsequent to the time of such delivery
by the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.5(b)(ii).

 

(d) The Merger Consideration issued and paid in accordance with the terms of
this Article II upon the surrender of the Certificates (or, immediately, in
the case of the Book-Entry Shares) shall be deemed to have been issued and
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock (other than the right to receive dividends or other
distributions, if any, in accordance with Section 2.5(c)). After the
Effective Time, there

 



8  shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of
the Surviving Entity of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificates formerly representing shares of Company Common Stock are
presented to the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they
shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

(e) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the former
holders of Company Common Stock for six (6) months after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the Surviving Entity, upon demand, and any former holder
of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II
shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Entity for payment of its claim
for the Merger Consideration and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock as contemplated by Section 2.5(c). Any portion of the
Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section
2.5(a) to pay for shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights
have been perfected shall be delivered to Parent promptly (and in any event
within two (2) Business Days) of Parents demand to the Exchange
Agent therefore; _provided_ , that in such case, until six (6) months after
the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent, as
needed, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of such shares Company
Common Stock to any holder thereof that withdraws or otherwise loses
appraisal rights as set forth in this Agreement.

(f) None of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II, the Surviving Entity or the
Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any shares of
Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or
cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. Any Merger
Consideration remaining unclaimed by former holders of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Entity shall, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Entity free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

 

(g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit, in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to Parent, of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost,
stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Exchange Agent, the
posting by such Person of a bond in reasonable amount as Parent or the
Exchange Agent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it or the Surviving Entity with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant
to Section 2.5(c) had such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate been
surrendered as provided in this Article II.

 

(h) The Exchange Agent shall invest the cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) any such investments
shall be in securities issued or directly and fully guaranteed or insured as
to principal and interest by the United States government or any agency or
instrumentality thereof and having maturities of not more than one month from
the date of investment and (ii) no such investment income or gain or loss
thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Company Common Stock.
Any

 



9  interest, gains and other income resulting from such investments shall be
the sole and exclusive property of Parent payable to Parent upon its request,
and no part of such interest, gains and other income shall accrue to the
benefit of holders of Company Common Stock.

(i) Parent, the Surviving Entity or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any Person
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or under
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. Any amount deducted or
withheld pursuant to this Section 2.5(i) shall be treated as having been paid
to the Person in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. In
the case of any amounts withheld from any payments not consisting entirely of
cash, Parent shall be treated as though it withheld an appropriate amount of
Parent Common Stock otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement, sold such
Parent Common Stock for an amount of cash equal to its fair market value at
the time of such deemed sale and paid such cash proceeds to the holder of
Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction or withholding was
made. Parent shall pay, or shall cause to be paid, all amounts so deducted or
withheld to the appropriate taxing authority within the period required under
applicable Law. With respect to any withholding obligation arising by reason
of consideration payable pursuant to Section 2.7, such obligation shall first
be satisfied from the cash consideration otherwise payable, and if such amount
of cash is not sufficient to cover the withholding obligation, then by
reducing the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that would otherwise be
delivered by a number of shares with a fair market value as of the Effective
Time equal to such shortfall.

Section 2.6 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall determine that any actions are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Entity its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of either of the Company or (if applicable) Merger Sub I
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry out this Agreement, then
the officers and directors of the Surviving Entity shall be authorized to take
all such actions as may be necessary or desirable to vest all right, title or
interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Entity or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

Section 2.7 _Company Stock Options and Other Stock-Based Awards_.

 

(a) As of the Effective Time, each option to purchase shares of Company Common
Stock granted under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company Stock Option_ ")
that is outstanding and unexercised as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether or not then vested or exercisable, shall be cancelled and
automatically converted into the right to promptly receive the Company Stock
Option Consideration. For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Company Stock
Option Consideration_ " means (i) an amount of cash equal to the product of
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Company Stock
Option and the Per Share Cash Amount, and (ii) a number of shares of Parent
Common Stock equal to (x) the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to the Company Stock Option and the Exchange Ratio, less
(y) a number of shares of Parent Common Stock with a Parent Stock Value that
is equal to the aggregate exercise price of the Company Stock Option (the "
_Option Exercise Price_ "); _provided_ that any resulting fractional shares
of

 



10  Parent Common Stock will be treated in accordance with Section 2.3; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
to be provided to a holder of Company Stock Options under this Section 2.7(a)
is not sufficient to cover the Option Exercise Price, then the cash payable
pursuant to clause (i) shall be reduced by a number of shares of Parent Common
Stock with a Parent Stock Value equal to such shortfall.

(b) As of the Effective Time, each time-based restricted stock unit granted
under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company RSU_ ") and each performance
share award granted under a Company Stock Plan (each, a " _Company PSU_ "), in
each case that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
either (1) is vested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time in
accordance with the vesting schedule contained therein as in effect on the
date hereof or (2) becomes vested solely as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby as a result of a non-discretionary
vesting acceleration provision contained therein as of the date hereof (each,
a " _Vested Award_ ") shall be cancelled and automatically converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration;  _provided_ that any resulting
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be treated in accordance with
Section 2.3. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will a Company RSU or
Company PSU be deemed to be a Vested Award if the vesting of such award
results from the Companys exercise of discretion to accelerate the vesting
thereof that is not expressly required by the applicable Company Stock Plan or
another Company Benefit Plan.

 

(c) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU and Company PSU that does not
qualify as a Vested Award (each, a " _Rollover Award_ ") shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions (including the vesting
schedule) as were applicable to the corresponding Rollover Award immediately
prior to the Effective Time, except that (i) each Rollover Award will relate
to that number of shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest
whole share) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock that were issuable upon the vesting of such Rollover Award
immediately prior to the Effective Time, multiplied by (y) the Rollover Award
Exchange Ratio, and (ii) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to any grant of Rollover Awards that are Company PSUs for which
the achievement of the applicable performance criteria has not occurred in
accordance with the terms thereof prior to the Closing Date shall be equal to
the number of such shares that would be issued upon achievement of the
applicable performance metrics at the target level (and such Rollover Award
shall not, for the avoidance of doubt, be subject to any performance metrics).
For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Rollover Award Exchange Ratio_ " means
the sum of (1) the Exchange Ratio and (2) the quotient of (x) the Per Share
Cash Amount, divided by (y) the Parent Stock Value. As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall file one or more
appropriate registration statements (on Form S-3 or Form S-8, or any
successor or other appropriate forms) with respect to Parent Common Stock
underlying the Rollover Awards.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board and/or any committee
thereof shall adopt such resolutions as may be necessary or desirable to
provide for or give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Section
2.7. The Company shall provide Parent with drafts of, and a reasonable
opportunity to comment upon, all such resolutions as may be required to give
effect to the provisions of this Section 2.7.

deliver this Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and,
subject to the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholder
Approval_ "), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, including
the Merger. The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement, the
performance and compliance by the Company with each of its obligations herein
and, assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and
each Merger Sub in the last sentence of Section 4.4(a), the consummation by

authorization, execution and delivery by Parent and each Merger Sub of this
Agreement, this Agreement constitutes the Companys legal, valid and binding
obligation, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except as
limited by Laws affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, by
general equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity

Company nor any of its "affiliates" or "associates" (as defined in Section 203

including the date of this Agreement has been, an "interested stockholder" (as
defined in Section 203 of the DGCL) of Parent.

 

(b) The Company Board, at a meeting duly called and held, unanimously adopted
resolutions (i) approving this Agreement and the consummation of the Mergers
upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, (ii)
determining that the terms of this Agreement, the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby are fair to, and in the best interests of,
the Company and its stockholders, (iii) directing that this Agreement be
submitted to the stockholders of the Company for adoption, (iv) to the extent
necessary, having the effect of causing the execution, delivery

adopt this Agreement (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and (vi) declaring
that this Agreement is advisable. Subject to Section 5.4, the Company Board
has not rescinded, modified or withdrawn such resolutions in any way. Assuming
the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and each Merger
Sub in the last sentence of Section 4.4(a), such resolutions are sufficient to
render inapplicable to this Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions
contemplated hereby, (x) the restrictions of Section 203 of the DGCL, to the
extent such restrictions would otherwise be applicable to this Agreement, the
Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, and (y) the
restrictions of Article VIII of the Companys Seventh Amended and Restated

(collectively, " _Takeover Laws_ ") are applicable the Mergers or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(c) Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Parent and
each Merger Sub in the last sentence of Section 4.4(a), the Company
Stockholder Approval is the only vote of holders of any class or series of
Company Capital Stock necessary to adopt this Agreement and to approve the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby.

(d) The Company has taken all necessary action so that (i) under the Company
Rights Agreement, neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement, the
performance by the parties of their respective obligations hereunder or the
consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby,
give rise to or will give rise to a "Distribution Date," "Stock Acquisition
Date," or "Triggering Event", or result in Parent or any of its affiliates
becoming an "Acquiring Person" (each as defined in the Company Rights
Agreement), under the Company Rights Agreement and (ii) the Company Rights
shall expire, and shall no longer be exercisable, immediately prior to the
Effective Time without any payment being made in respect thereof.

conditions or provisions of any Contract to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party, or by which they or any of their respective properties

and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules

summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and
forms of the SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and

applicable Company SEC Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or
any amendment thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the
disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such
report or amendment based on such evaluation. Based on the Companys
managements most recently completed evaluation of the Companys internal
controls over financial reporting, the Company has no Knowledge of (i) any

whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls over financial

aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, (ii) as reflected or reserved against in the

and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of
the most recent audited balance sheet included in the Company SEC Financial
Statements and (iv) for liabilities and obligations arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement or the Mergers. Neither the Company nor any
Company Subsidiary is a party to, or has any commitment to become a party to,
any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract or
arrangement (including any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction
or relationship between or among the Company and any of the Company
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person,
on the other hand, or any material "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act)), where the purpose or
intended effect of such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in the Company SEC Financial Statements or other Company
SEC Documents.

(h) With respect to Company Regulated Subsidiaries that produce
statutory financial statements, the Company has previously delivered or made

it is acknowledged and agreed by Parent and Merger Subs that the Company is
not making any representation or warranty in this Agreement that the reserves

the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries is in breach or default, and
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries have taken any action
or failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would
constitute such a breach or default, or permit termination or modification of
any material Policies. With respect to each of the legal proceedings set
forth in

 



34  the Company SEC Documents, no such insurer has informed the Company or any
of the Company Subsidiaries in writing of any denial of coverage, except for
such denials that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The
Company and the Company Subsidiaries have not received any written notice of

individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

all related compilations, reviews and other reports issued by Parents
accountants with respect thereto (the " _Parent SEC Financial Statements_ "),
have been derived from the accounting books and records of Parent and the
Parent Subsidiaries and (i) were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in

as may be permitted by Form 10-Q and Regulation S-X of the SEC) and (ii)
fairly present, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries, as at the respective dates thereof, and
the consolidated results of their operations, and, where included, their
consolidated stockholders equity and their consolidated cash flows for
the respective periods indicated (subject, in the case of the unaudited
statements, to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of notes or
with respect to pro forma information, subject to the qualifications stated

41  the date of this Agreement, Parent has not made or adopted any material
change in its accounting methods, practices or policies.

internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are defined in Rule
13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that all information (both financial and non-financial)
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such information is accumulated and communicated to Parents management as
appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to
make the certifications required pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has completed an assessment of
the effectiveness of Parents disclosure controls and procedures and, to the
extent required by applicable Law, presented in any applicable Parent SEC
Document that is a report on Form 10-K or Form 10-Q, or any amendment
thereto, its conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls
and procedures as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment
based on such evaluation. Based on Parents managements most recently
completed evaluation of Parents internal controls over financial reporting,
Parent has no Knowledge of (i) any significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of its internal controls over financial
reporting that are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect Parents ability to record, process, summarize and report financial
information and (ii) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in Parents internal
controls over financial reporting. Since January 1, 2014, to the Knowledge of
Parent as of the date hereof, Parent has not received any material complaints
from any source regarding accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing
matters.

(g) Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries do not have any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether absolute or contingent, asserted or
unasserted, known or unknown, primary or secondary, direct or indirect, and
whether or not accrued), except (i) those that, individually or in the
aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect, (ii) as reflected or reserved against in the most
recent audited balance sheet included in the Parent SEC Financial Statements
or included in or reasonably apparent from the notes or managements
discussion and analysis related thereto, (iii) for liabilities and obligations
incurred in the ordinary course of business since the date of the most 

 



42  recent audited balance sheet included in the Parent SEC Financial Statements
and (iv) for liabilities and obligations arising out of or in connection with
this Agreement or the Mergers. Neither Parent nor any Parent Subsidiary is a
party to, or has any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-
balance sheet partnership or any similar Contract or arrangement (including
any Contract or arrangement relating to any transaction or relationship
between or among Parent and any of the Parent Subsidiaries, on the one hand,
and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance, special
purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
material "off balance sheet arrangement" (as defined in Item 303(a) of
Regulation S-K of the Exchange Act)), where the purpose or intended effect of
such Contract or arrangement is to avoid disclosure of any material
transaction involving, or material liabilities of, Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary in the Parent SEC Financial Statements or other Parent SEC
Documents.

prevent or to materially delay the consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Except as has not, and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries have implemented compliance programs, including

or in the aggregate, result in a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each of

claims submission and payment of the Programs and other third party payment
programs. Except where it has not had and would not reasonably be expected to

submission of a corrective action plan to the appropriate Governmental Entity
or by other means permitted under applicable Law.

 

(g) Other than the Parent Regulated Subsidiaries, neither Parent nor any
Parent Subsidiary is a Regulated Business. Section 4.19(g) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter sets forth each Parent Subsidiary that is a Regulated
Business (each, a " _Parent Regulated Subsidiary_ ") and the state where each
Parent Regulated Subsidiary is domiciled or commercially domiciled
for Regulated Business purposes.

(h) All policy forms and certificates used by Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries, the forms of all policies and certificates on which the Parent
Subsidiary Insurance Agreements were written and all amendments, endorsements
and riders thereto, and all applications, brochures and marketing materials
pertaining thereto have been approved by all applicable Governmental Entities
or filed with and not objected to by such Governmental Entities within the
period provided by applicable Law for objection, to the extent required by

 



55  Law, and comply with all requirements of Law, except where the failure to
obtain such approval or the failure to comply has not had and would not

provide coverage for the business and assets of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries are in full force and effect, except for such failures to be in
full force and effect that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect,
neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries is in breach or default,
and neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries have taken any action or
failed to take any action which, with notice or the lapse of time, would
constitute such a breach or default, or permit termination or modification of
any material Parent Policies. With respect to each of the legal proceedings
set forth in the Parent SEC Documents, no such insurer has informed Parent or
any of the Parent Subsidiaries in writing of any denial of coverage, except
for such denials that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and
would not reasonably be expected to have, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.
Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries have not received any written notice of
cancellation of any of the Parent Policies, except for such cancellations
that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably

WF Investment Holdings, LLC (" _WFIH_ ") and Wells Fargo Securities, LLC ("
_WF Securities_ ", together with WF Bank and WFIH, " _Wells Fargo_ "),
including all exhibits, schedules, annexes and amendments to such letter in
effect as of the date of this Agreement (the " _Commitment Letter_ "),
pursuant to which and subject to the terms and conditions thereof the lender

Letter. Parent has also delivered to the Company a correct and complete fully
executed copy of (i) the Initial Lenders Fee Letter and the Structuring and
Administrative Fee Letter, each dated as of July 2, 2015, between Parent and

56  between Parent and WF Securities; provided that the fee amounts, pricing
caps and other economic terms, and the rates and amounts included in the
"market flex" provisions (but not covenants) have been redacted. The
Commitment Letter has not been amended, restated or otherwise modified or
waived prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and the
respective commitments contained in the Commitment Letter have not been
withdrawn, rescinded, amended, restated or otherwise modified in any respect
prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement. As of the date of this
Agreement, there are no other Contracts, side letters or other arrangements to
which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is bound relating to the availability, amount or
conditionality of the Financing. As of the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and constitutes
the legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and, to the

affecting the enforcement of creditors rights generally, by general
equitable principles or by the discretion of any Governmental Entity before
which any Proceeding seeking enforcement may be brought. Parent has fully paid
(or caused to be fully paid) any and all commitment fees or other fees
required by the Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date of this
Agreement. There are no conditions precedent (including pursuant to any "flex"
provisions) related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
pursuant to the Commitment Letter, other than as expressly set forth in the
Commitment Letter. Subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment
Letter, assuming the accuracy of the Companys representations and warranties
contained in Article III and assuming no breach or default by the Company of
its covenants contained in Section 5.1, the net proceeds contemplated from the
Financing, together with cash on hand and marketable securities of Parent and
of the Company and its Subsidiaries on the Closing Date, will, in the
aggregate, be sufficient for the payment of the aggregate cash portion of the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts required to be paid pursuant to
Article II hereof, the funding of any required refinancings or repayments of
any existing Indebtedness of the Company or Parent in connection with the
Merger and the payment of all fees and expenses reasonably expected to be
incurred by Parent, the Merger Subs and the Surviving Corporation in
connection with the Merger and the Financing (collectively, such amount, the
" _Required Funding Amount_ "). As of the date of this Agreement, no event has
occurred which would result in any breach or violation of or constitute a
default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become
a default) by Parent or either of the Merger Subs under the Commitment Letter,
and Parent does not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to
the Financing will not be satisfied or that Financing will not be available
to Parent on the Closing Date. Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or
other fees required to be paid on or prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with the Financing.

Advisors).

_Parent Financial_

 



57   _Advisors_ "), to the effect that, subject to the assumptions,
qualifications and other matters set forth therein, as of the date thereof,

Section 5.3 _Preparation of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement;
Stockholders Meetings_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement (but in
any event, no more than sixty (60) days following the date hereof, unless the
Parties otherwise agree to another time period), (i) Parent and the Company
shall jointly prepare and Parent and the Company, as applicable, shall file
with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement to be sent to the stockholders
of Parent relating to the Parent Stockholders Meeting and to the stockholders
of the Company relating to the Company Stockholders Meeting and (ii) Parent
shall prepare (with the Companys reasonable cooperation) and consider
the Companys comments in good faith, and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in
which the Joint Proxy Statement will be included as a prospectus, in
connection with the registration under the Securities Act of the 

 



63  Parent Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. Parent shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing (including by
responding to comments of the SEC), and, prior to the effective date of the
Form S-4, Parent shall take all action reasonably required (other than
qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so
qualified or filing a general consent to service of process in any such
jurisdiction) to be taken under any applicable state securities Laws in
connection with the Parent Stock Issuance. Each of the Company and Parent
shall furnish all information as may be reasonably requested by the other in
connection with any such action and the preparation, filing and distribution
of the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement. As promptly as practicable
after the Form S-4 shall have become effective, each of Parent and the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its respective stockholders. No filing of, or
amendment or supplement to, the Form S-4 will be made by Parent, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Joint Proxy Statement will be made by
Parent or the Company, in each case without providing the other Party with a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. If at any time prior to
the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company or any
of their respective Affiliates, directors or officers, should be discovered by
Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement
to either the Form S-4 or the Joint Proxy Statement, so that either such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the Party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties hereto and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of Parent and the Company. Each Party shall notify the
other promptly of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, of the
issuance of any stop order or suspension of the qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff
of the SEC and of any request by the SEC or the staff of the SEC for
amendments or supplements to the Joint Proxy Statement or the Form S-4 or for
additional information and shall supply each other with copies of all
correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC or its staff, on the other hand, with respect to the Joint Proxy
Statement, the Form S-4 or the Mergers and shall consider each other Partys
comments in good faith.

(b) The Company shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the
Form S-4, duly set a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of seeking the Company Stockholder Approval. If the Company Board has
not made a Company Adverse Recommendation Change, the Company shall, through
the Company Board, make the Company Recommendation, and shall include such
Company Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable
best efforts to (x) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
adoption of this Agreement, and (y) take all other action necessary or
advisable to secure the Company Stockholder Approval. Except as expressly
permitted in Section 5.4(b), neither the Company Board nor any committee
thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, or propose publicly
to withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify the Company Recommendation, (ii)
take any other action or make any other statement in connection with the
Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or
(iii) approve, determine to be

 



64  advisable, or recommend, or propose publicly to approve, determine to be
advisable, or recommend, any Takeover Proposal ((i), (ii) and (iii) being
referred to as a " _Company Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Notwithstanding any Company Adverse Recommendation Change, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms, the obligations of the
Parties hereunder shall continue in full force and effect and such
obligations shall not be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public
disclosure or communication to the Company of any Takeover Proposal (whether
or not a Superior Proposal).

 

(c) Parent shall, as soon as practicable following effectiveness of the Form
S-4, duly set a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its stockholders (the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ ") solely for
the purpose of seeking the Parent Stockholder Approval. If the Parent Board
has not made a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change, Parent shall, through
the Parent Board, make the Parent Recommendation, and shall include such
Parent Recommendation in the Joint Proxy Statement, and use its reasonable
best efforts to (i) solicit from its stockholders proxies in favor of the
approval of the Parent Stock Issuance and (ii) take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the Parent Stockholder Approval. Except as
expressly permitted in Section 5.4(b), neither the Parent Board nor any
committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify, or
propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify or qualify the Parent
Recommendation, (ii) take any other action or make any other statement in
connection with the Parent Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with the Parent
Recommendation or (iii) approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, or
propose publicly to approve, determine to be advisable, or recommend, any
Takeover Proposal ((i), (ii) and (iii) being referred to as a " _Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding any Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
its terms, the obligations of the Parties hereunder shall continue in full
force and effect and such obligations shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Parent of
any Takeover Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).

 

(d) The Company and Parent will use their respective reasonable best efforts
to hold the Company Stockholders Meeting and the Parent Stockholders Meeting
on the same date and as soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement.

Section 5.4 _No Solicitation_.

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall immediately cease any discussions or
negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing with respect to a Takeover
Proposal and, if applicable, shall seek to have returned to the Company or
Parent as applicable any information and materials that have been provided in
any such discussions or negotiations and shall immediately terminate all
physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such Person
or its Representatives. From and after the date hereof until the earlier to
occur of the Effective Time or the date of termination of this Agreement
in accordance with Article VII, each of the Company and Parent shall not, nor
shall it permit any of its Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit
any of its officers, directors or employees or any Affiliate, investment
banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other Representative
retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage (including by way of furnishing
information) or take any other action to facilitate, any inquiry or

 



65  the making of any proposal which constitutes, or may reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, (ii) enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement
or understanding relating to any Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into pursuant to subsection (A) of the
proviso of this sentence) or (iii) enter into, continue or otherwise
participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Takeover
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, prior to obtaining the Company
Stockholder Approval (in the case of the Company) or the Parent Stockholder
Approval (in the case of Parent), following the receipt of a Superior Proposal
or a Takeover Proposal that the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable,
determines in good faith is reasonably expected to lead to a Superior
Proposal and that in either case was unsolicited and made after the date of
this Agreement in circumstances not otherwise involving a breach of this
Agreement, the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that a failure to
take such action with respect to such Takeover Proposal would be inconsistent
with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders or
Parents stockholders, as applicable, under applicable Law, the Company or
Parent, as applicable, may, in response to such Takeover Proposal, and subject
to compliance with Section 5.4(c), (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company or Parent, as applicable, to the party making such Takeover Proposal
pursuant to a confidentiality agreement (an " _Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement_ ") that contains confidentiality and standstill provisions not less
favorable to the Company or Parent, as the case may be, than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreements; _provided_ that (x) such confidentiality
agreement shall permit the provision of all information to Parent and the
Company, as applicable, that is contemplated or required by this Section 5.4
to be provided to Parent or the Company, as applicable, and (y) such
confidentiality agreement shall include a standstill, except that, (i) such
standstill need not prohibit the Person making such Takeover Proposal from
making a Takeover Proposal to the Company Board or Parent Board, as
applicable, in a confidential manner and (ii) such confidentiality agreement
need not include a standstill to the extent that the Person making such
Alternative Acquisition Proposal has commenced a tender offer or exchange
offer incorporating an Takeover Proposal, and (B) engage in discussions or
negotiations with such party regarding such Takeover Proposal. In addition,
notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, following the
receipt of a Takeover Proposal, the Company Board or Parent Board, as
applicable, may contact the Person or group of Persons who has made such
Takeover Proposal solely for the purpose of seeking clarification of the
terms and conditions thereof and the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall
promptly provide a summary of such clarifications to the other Party. It is
agreed that any violation of the restrictions set forth in the
preceding sentence by any Representative of each of the Company or Parent, as
applicable, or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Section 5.4(a) by the Company or Parent, as applicable. Prior
to the termination of this Agreement, except in connection with a concurrent
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(c)(iv) or Section
7.1(d)(iv), but subject to the concurrent payment of the applicable Company
Termination Fee or Parent Termination Fee, as the case may be, (1) neither
the Company nor Parent shall take any action to exempt any Person from the
restrictions on "business combinations" or any similar provision contained in
any applicable Takeover Law or the Constituent Documents of the Company or
Parent, as applicable, otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, and (2)
the Company shall not (x) terminate (or permit the termination of (except in
accordance with its terms and not related to a Takeover Proposal)), waive or
amend the Company Rights Agreement,

 



66  (y) redeem any Company Rights under the Company Rights Agreement or (z) take
any action with respect to, or make any determination under, the Company
Rights Agreement that would interfere with Parent consummating the Mergers
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, in each case
without the prior written consent of Parent.

 

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, the Company Board, may, or prior to receipt of Parent Stockholder
Approval, the Parent Board, may (in each case, subject to compliance with this
Section 5.4(b) and to compliance with Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(c)) (1) effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable (each an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") and (2)
terminate this Agreement to enter into a definitive agreement regarding a
Superior Proposal, in each case if (and only if): (i) a written Takeover
Proposal that was not solicited in violation of this Agreement is made to the
Company or Parent, as applicable, by a third Person and such Takeover Proposal
is not withdrawn or a Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event,
as applicable, has occurred; (ii) in the case of a Takeover Proposal, the
Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys or Parents, as applicable,
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Takeover
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal; (iii) the Company Board or the
Parent Board, as applicable, determines in good faith, after consultation with
the Companys or Parents, as applicable, outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such Superior Proposal, Company
Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event, as applicable, would be
inconsistent with the exercise of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, under applicable Law; (iv) the board
considering the Adverse Recommendation Change or termination provides the
other Party at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its
intention to take such action, which notice shall include (A) in the case of
an Adverse Recommendation Change or termination in response to a Takeover
Proposal, the information with respect to such Superior Proposal that is
specified in Section 5.4(c), as well as a copy of such Takeover Proposal, and
(B) in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Company Intervening Event or a Parent Intervening Event, as applicable, a
summary of the material facts, circumstances and other information with
respect thereto, together with reasonable documentary support and/or written
analysis conducted by or on behalf of the board considering the Adverse
Recommendation Change; (v) during the five (5) Business Days following such
written notice (or such shorter period as is specified below), if requested by
the other Party, the board considering the Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination and its Representatives have negotiated in good faith with the
other Party (to the extent the other Party has requested to negotiate)
regarding any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby
proposed by the other Party in response to such Superior Proposal, Company
Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event, as applicable; and (vi) at the
end of the five (5) Business Day period described in the foregoing clause
(v), the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, determines in good
faith, after consultation with the Companys and Parents, as applicable, (x)
outside legal counsel and financial advisors (and taking into account any
adjustment or modification of the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing
by the other Party), that in the case of an Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination in response to a Takeover Proposal, the Takeover Proposal
continues to be a Superior Proposal and (y) outside legal counsel, that the
failure to make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to such

 



67  Superior Proposal, Company Intervening Event or Parent Intervening Event, as
applicable, would be inconsistent with the exercise by the Company Board or
Parent Board, as applicable, of its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of
the Company or Parent, as applicable, under applicable Law. Any material
amendment or modification to any Superior Proposal will be deemed to be a new
Takeover Proposal for purposes of this Section 5.4;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the notice period and the period during which the Company Board or Parent
Board (as applicable) considering the Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination and its Representatives are required to negotiate in good faith
with the other Party regarding any revisions to the terms of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby proposed by the other Party in
response to such new Takeover Proposal pursuant to clause (v) above shall
expire on the later to occur of (x) two (2) Business Days after the board
considering the applicable Adverse Recommendation Change provides written
notice of such new Takeover Proposal to the other Party and (y) the end of the
original five (5) Business Day period described in clause (v) above;
_provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that in the case of a termination of this
Agreement pursuant to clause (2) above, in addition to the requirements set
forth above, the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall have paid the
applicable termination fee in accordance with Section 7.3. Unless this
Agreement has been terminated in accordance with Section 7.1, nothing in this
Section 5.4(b) shall permit any Party or its board to enter into any letter
of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other agreement,
arrangement or understanding relating to any Takeover Proposal or Superior
Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into
pursuant to Section 5.4(a)). Unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with Section 7.1, the Company Board and/or Parent Board shall
submit this Agreement (or, in the case of the Parent Board, the Parent Stock
Issuance) to its stockholders even if the Company Board or Parent Board shall
have effected an Adverse Recommendation Change, and the Company Board or
Parent Board may not submit to the vote of their stockholders any
Takeover Proposal other than this Agreement.

(c) In addition to the obligations of the Company and Parent set forth in
Sections 5.4(a) and 5.4(b), the Company or Parent shall promptly, and in any
event no later than 24-hours after it receives any Takeover Proposal, advise
the other Party orally and in writing of any request for information in
connection with a Takeover Proposal or of any Takeover Proposal, the material
terms and conditions of such request or Takeover Proposal, and the identity of
the Person making such request or Takeover Proposal and provide copies of any
materials, documents or agreements provided to Parent or the Company in
connection with the Takeover Proposal (including the most current drafts of
any acquisition agreements and financing commitments related thereto). The
Party receiving a Takeover Proposal shall keep the other Party promptly
advised of all changes to the material terms of any Takeover Proposal. Each
of the Company and Parent, shall, within 48-hours of the time it is provided
to any third Persons, provide to the other Party any non-public information
concerning the Company or Parent and their Subsidiaries that the Company or
Parent provides (including through its Representatives) to any third Person in
connection with any Takeover Proposal that was not previously provided to the
other Party.

 

(d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 or Section 5.5, but in all cases
subject to Section 5.3(b) or Section 5.3(c), as applicable, shall prohibit
the Company Board or the Parent Board, as applicable, from (i) taking and
disclosing to their stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a)
promulgated under the Exchange Act or making a statement 

 



68  contemplated by Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A or Rule 14d-9 promulgated
under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to their stockholders if
the Company Board or Parent Board, as applicable, determines in good faith,
after consultation with the Companys or Parents, as applicable, outside
counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would be inconsistent with
applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that neither the Parent Board, the
Company Board nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted
by Section 5.4(b), effect an Adverse Recommendation Change.

involving the Company or Parent or any of their Subsidiaries pursuant to which

operations of, or the market price of the securities (including the Parent

statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Mergers, and shall not issue any such press release or make any
such public statement prior to such consultation, except as such Party may
reasonably conclude may be required by applicable Law or the rules of the NYSE
(or any other securities market). Parent and the Company agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the Parties.
The restrictions set forth in this Section

 



70  5.5 shall not apply to any release or public statement issued or made in
connection with any dispute between the Parties regarding the Agreement, the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 5.6 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Parent and the Company shall
each give prompt notice to the other Party if any of the following occur
after the date of this Agreement: (i) receipt of any written notice to the
receiving Party from any third Person alleging that the consent or approval of
such third Person is or may be required in connection with the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and such consent could
(in the good faith determination of such Party) reasonably be expected to (A)
prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Mergers or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) be material to Parent or
the Company; (ii) receipt of any notice or other communication from any
Governmental Entity or the NYSE (or any other securities market)
in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by

reasonably likely to (A) prevent or materially delay the consummation of the
Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby or (B) result in the
failure of any condition to the Mergers set forth in Article VI to be
satisfied; _provided_ , _however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this Section 5.6 shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies of the
Company or Parent available hereunder and no information delivered pursuant to
this Section 5.6 shall update any section of the Company Disclosure Letter or
the Parent Disclosure Letter or shall affect the representations or
warranties of the Parties hereunder.

Section 5.7 _Access to Information_.

planning with employees) to all the Companys and the Companys Subsidiaries
properties, books, contracts, commitments and records, and to the Companys
and the Companys Subsidiaries officers, employees, accountants, counsel and

(c) This Section 5.7 shall not require the Company to permit any access, or
to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment of
the Company is

 



71  competitively sensitive, would reasonably be expected to result in any
violation of any material Contract or Law to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiaries is a party or is subject or cause any privilege (including
attorney-client privilege) which the Company or any Company Subsidiaries would
be entitled to assert to be undermined with respect to such information and
such undermining of such privilege could in the Companys good faith judgment
adversely affect in any material respect the Companys or any Company
Subsidiarys position in any pending or reasonably probable future litigation;
_provided_ , that the Parties shall cooperate in seeking to find a way to
allow disclosure of such information to the extent doing so (1) would not (in
the good faith belief of the Company) reasonably be likely to result in the
violation of any such material Contract or Law or reasonably be likely to
cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to such information or (2)
could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the Company) be managed through
the use of any "clean-room" arrangements agreed between the Parties pursuant
to which non-employee Representatives of the Parent shall be provided access
to such information; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Company shall (x)
notify Parent that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate the
Companys or the Company Subsidiaries obligations under any such material
Contract or Law or are reasonably likely to cause such privilege to be
undermined and (y) in the case where such disclosures are reasonably likely to
violate the Companys or the Company Subsidiaries obligations under any
material Contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek consent from the
applicable third Person to any such material Contract with respect to the
disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such Contract).

(d) Unless and until the Closing occurs, the information provided pursuant to
this Section 5.7 shall be kept confidential by the recipient thereof in
accordance with, and shall otherwise be subject to the terms and conditions

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of Parent and
the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use
reasonable best efforts to: (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions

Entity, including the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice or any other Governmental Entity, including those federal and state
departments of health, state insurance

 



72  departments and other Governmental Entities with jurisdiction under
applicable Health Care Laws or insurance laws, and any other third Person that
is required to be obtained by Parent or the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and to comply with the terms and
conditions of any such consent, authorization, order or approval;
provided, however, that neither Parent nor the Company, in each case, on
behalf of itself or any of its Subsidiaries, shall be required to propose,
commit to, agree to or effect any action (or refrain from taking any action)
or be subject to any term, limitation, condition, restriction or requirement
that, individually or in the aggregate, (A) would have or would reasonably be
expected to have a material and adverse effect on the financial condition,
business, revenue or EBITDA of Parent and its Subsidiaries or of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries, in each case, as currently conducted, (B) would
or would reasonably be expected to restrict or prohibit any lines or types of
business in which Parent and its Subsidiaries or the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall be permitted to engage and would have or would reasonably
be expected to have a material and adverse effect on Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or on the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided that, for purposes of determining
whether any action, term, limitation, condition, restriction or requirement
would have or would reasonably be expected to, in the case of clause (A), have
a material adverse effect on Parent and its Subsidiaries, or, in the case of
clause (B), restrict or prohibit any lines or types of business in which
Parent and its Subsidiaries shall be permitted to engage and would have or
would reasonably be expected to have a material and adverse effect on Parent
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, Parent and its Subsidiaries will, in
each case, collectively be deemed to be a company the size of (and with
revenue and EBITDA equal to those of) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (C) would or would be reasonably expected to materially impair
the benefits reasonably expected to be derived by Parent from the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated hereby; provided, that, for purposes of
this clause (C), such reasonably expected benefits shall be deemed to be the
size of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (each of
(A), (B) and (C), individually or in the aggregate, a " _Burdensome Condition_
").

 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each Party hereto
shall make all Filings with all Governmental Entities that may be or may
become reasonably necessary, proper or advisable under this Agreement and
applicable Law to consummate and make effective the Mergers and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) not later than forty-
five (45) calendar days following the date of this Agreement, Parent filing,
or causing to be filed, "Form A Statements" or similar change of control

other Governmental Entities in each jurisdiction where required by applicable
Law seeking approval of Parents acquisition of control of each of the
applicable Company Regulated Subsidiaries which results from the Mergers; (ii)
not later than forty-five (45) calendar days following the date of this

in compliance with the timeframe prescribed by applicable Laws making any

the foregoing Filings and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all other actions consistent with this Section 5.8 necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting periods,
including under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof), as soon as
practicable. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all
action reasonably necessary to ensure that no state corporate takeover statute
or similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (y) if any state corporate takeover statute
or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, take all reasonable action to enable the Mergers and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 

(c) Each of the Parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i)
cooperate with each other in connection with any Filing with a Governmental
Entity or with respect to any Filings made pursuant to Section 5.8(b),
including pursuant to any Health Care Laws, insurance Laws or other applicable
Laws in connection with the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and in connection with any Filing with or any response to
questions from a Governmental Entity with respect thereto or investigation or
other inquiry by or before a Governmental Entity relating to the Mergers and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding initiated by a private
party, and (ii) keep the other Party informed in all material respects and on
a reasonably timely basis of any communication received by such Party from,
or given by such Party to, any Governmental Entity in connection therewith,
including the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any

health, state insurance departments and other Governmental Entities with
jurisdiction under applicable Health Care Laws or insurance laws, and of any
communication received or given by a private Person in connection with
any governmental inquiry, investigation or proceeding, in each case regarding

In furtherance and not in limitation of this Section 5.8(c), subject to
applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information, each Party shall
consult and cooperate with the other Party in connection with any Filing,
analysis, appearance, presentation, memorandum, brief, argument, responses to
questions from a Governmental Entity, opinion or proposal made or submitted
in connection with any such Filing, request, inquiry, investigation, responses
to questions from a Governmental Entity, action or other legal proceeding
relating to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In addition, except as may be prohibited by any Governmental Entity
or by Law, in connection with any such request, inquiry, investigation, action
or other legal proceeding, each

request, inquiry, investigation, response, action or other legal proceeding,
(y) have reasonable access to and be consulted in connection with any material

pleadings and responses to inquiries from Governmental Entities submitted as
required by Section 5.8(b). Each of Parent and the Company shall reasonably
cooperate with each other for devising and implementing the strategy for
obtaining any necessary clearances or approvals of any Governmental Entity,
including the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or any
other Governmental Entity, including those federal and state departments of
health, state insurance departments and other Governmental Entities with
jurisdiction under applicable Health Care Laws or insurance laws; provided,
that, in the event of a disagreement between the Parties with respect to such
strategy, Parent shall have the right to direct such matters with any
Governmental Entity consistent with its obligations hereunder, subject to
compliance with those strategies that have been agreed between the Parties.

(d) Notwithstanding Sections 5.8(a), 5.8(b) or 5.8(c) or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event shall Parent or its
Subsidiaries be required to agree to, nor shall the Company take or permit any
Company Subsidiary to take (unless in each case Parent directs the Company to
do so; provided, that, any action or agreement of the Company shall be
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger), any action that would result in
a Burdensome Condition.

 

Section 5.9 _Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification or
advancement of expenses arising from, relating to, or otherwise in respect
of, acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time now existing
in favor of the current or former directors or officers of the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") as provided in their
respective Constituent Documents or any indemnification or similar agreements
shall survive the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to
comply therewith. For a period of no less than six (6) years from the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to maintain in effect
the exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions of the
Companys and its Subsidiaries Constituent Documents or any indemnification
or similar agreements, in the form that is in effect as of the date of this
Agreement, and shall not, and shall cause the Surviving Entity not to, amend,
repeal or otherwise modify any such provisions in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company; provided, however, that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses in respect of any Proceeding
pending or asserted or any claim made within such period shall continue until
the final disposition of such Proceeding. Section 5.9(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and correct list of all
indemnification or similar arrangements in favor of the Indemnified Parties
that have been entered into within the 30 days preceding the date of this
Agreement.

 



75 (b) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Entity to, indemnify and hold harmless, and advance expenses to,
the Indemnified Parties against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities in
connection with any actual or threatened Proceeding arising out of, relating
to or in connection with (i) the fact that such Indemnified Party is or was a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any acts
or omissions occurring or alleged to occur prior to or at the Effective Time
in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (iii) the Mergers, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that if,
at any time prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of the Effective Time, any
such Indemnified Party delivers to Parent or the Surviving Entity a written
notice asserting a claim for indemnification or advancement under this Section
5.9(b), then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall obtain and fully pay
for "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of no more than six (6)
years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier
with respect to directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary
liability insurance with benefits and levels of coverage not materially more
favorable than the Companys existing policies (the " _Existing Policies_ ")
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including with respect to acts and omissions occurring in connection
with this Agreement, the Mergers or the other transactions or
actions contemplated hereby) and, if such policies have been obtained, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain such policies in full
force and effect after the Effective Time; provided, however, that in no event
shall the Company pay, or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, be
required to pay, for such "tail" policies a one-time premium in excess of 250%
of the Companys current aggregate annual premium amount under its Existing
Policies. If the Company for any reason fails to obtain such tail policy, the
Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to,
maintain in effect for not less than six (6) years from the Effective Time the
Existing Policies for the Indemnified Parties otherwise covered by such
Existing Policies; provided that (i) the Surviving Entity may substitute
therefor policies of substantially the same coverage containing terms and
conditions that are no less advantageous to such Indemnified Parties and are
from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating as the
Companys current insurance carrier; and (ii) the Surviving Entity shall not
be required to pay annual premiums for the Existing Policies (or for
any substitute policies) in excess of 250% of the annual premiums paid for
the Existing Policies prior to the date of this Agreement (the " _Maximum
Premium_ "). In the event any future annual premiums for the Existing Policies
(or any substitute policies) exceed such amount, the Surviving Entity shall
be entitled to reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing Policies (or any
substitute policies) to the maximum amount of coverage that can be obtained
for a premium equal to such amount.

(d) The provisions of this Section 5.9 shall survive consummation of the
Mergers, are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties, his or her heirs and his or her
representatives and are in addition to, and not

 



76  in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution
that any such Person may have by Contract or otherwise.

 

(e) In the event that the Surviving Entity or any of its successors or assigns
(i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving Person of such consolidation or merger or (ii)
transfers or conveys, directly or indirectly, all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors, assigns and
transferees of the Surviving Entity or its respective successors or assigns,
as the case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.9.

 

Section 5.10 _Financing_.

 

(a) Unless, and to the extent, Parent shall have demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company (as confirmed in writing by
the Company) that Parent shall have sufficient cash from other sources
(including by reason of a capital market or other financing transaction)
available to satisfy its cash payment obligations under this Agreement, from
and after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall: (i) use its
reasonable best efforts to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letter; (ii) shall not permit any amendment or
modification to be made to the Commitment Letter, if such amendment or
modification (A) reduces the aggregate amount of the Financing or (B) imposes
additional conditions or otherwise amends any of the conditions to the receipt
of the Financing in a manner that could reasonably be expected to (I) prevent
the Closing from occurring prior to the Outside Date, (II) make the funding of
the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the Financing)
materially less likely to occur or (III) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or the Merger Subs, as applicable, to enforce their respective rights
against other parties to the Commitment Letter or the definitive agreements
with respect thereto; and (iii) use its reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letter. For the avoidance of doubt, but
subject to the foregoing, Parent may amend, supplement, modify or replace the
Commitment Letter as in effect at the date hereof (x) to add or replace
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of the date of this Agreement,
(y) to increase the amount of indebtedness or (z) to replace all or a portion
of the facility committed under the Commitment Letter as in effect as of the
date hereof with one or more new facilities under such Commitment Letter or
under any new commitment letter or facility (any such new commitment or
facility, a " _Replacement Facility_ "); _provided_ , that the terms of such
Replacement Facility shall comply with clauses (i) and (ii) above. Promptly
following the execution of a Replacement Facility by Parent, Parent shall
notify the Company to such effect and shall promptly provide a fully executed
copy of such Replacement Facility and any related agreements. For purposes of
this Agreement, (1) the term " _Financing_ " shall be deemed to include the
financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter as amended, modified or
replaced pursuant to this Section 5.10 (including any Replacement Facility,
any Alternative Financing and, in the case of Section 5.10(d), any offering of
debt or equity securities the proceeds of which are intended to be used to
satisfy the obligations under this Agreement), and (2) the term "Commitment
Letter" shall be deemed to include the Commitment Letter as may be amended,
modified or replaced

 



77  pursuant to this Section 5.10, any commitment letters with respect to any
Replacement Facility, and any commitment letters with respect to the
Alternative Financing.

 

(b) Unless, and to the extent, Parent shall have demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company (as confirmed in writing by
the Company) that Parent shall have sufficient cash from other sources
(including by reason of a capital market or other financing transaction)
available to satisfy its cash payment obligations under this Agreement, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the
Commitment Letter pursuant to its terms (except for amendments not prohibited
by Section 5.10(a)) until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated or this Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms,
(ii) negotiate and enter into definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing on the terms and conditions contained in the Commitment Letter or on
other terms not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent (as
determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent) than the terms and conditions
contained in the Commitment Letter (such definitive agreements, the "
_Definitive Agreements_ "), and (iii) satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by
Parent, seek a waiver on a timely basis of) all conditions to funding in the
Commitment Letter that are within its control and, in the event that all
conditions to funding in the Commitment Letter are satisfied at or prior to
Closing, consummate the Financing at the Closing in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the Commitment Letter as in effect at or prior to the
Closing.

 

(c) Unless, and to the extent, Parent shall have demonstrated to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Company (as confirmed in writing by
the Company) that Parent shall have sufficient cash from other sources
(including by reason of a capital market or other financing transaction)
available to satisfy its cash payment obligations under this Agreement, in the
event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter, Parent shall promptly notify
the Company in writing and use its reasonable best efforts to arrange
alternative financing from the same or alternative sources in an amount not
less than the Required Funding Amount under this Agreement (the " _Alternative
Financing_ "); provided, however, that Parent shall not be required to obtain
financing which includes terms and conditions materially less favorable
(taken as whole and taking into account any "market flex" provision) to Parent
(as determined in the reasonable judgment of Parent), in each case relative to
those in the Financing being replaced.

 

(d) The Company shall, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and shall use
reasonable best efforts to cause its and their respective Representatives,
including legal, Tax, regulatory and accounting Representatives, to provide,
on a timely basis, all reasonable cooperation requested by Parent and/or the
Financing Sources in connection with the Financing. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, such cooperation shall in any event include:
(i) promptly providing Parent and the Financing Sources and their respective
agents with (A) the financial information regarding the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries required to be delivered pursuant to Section 6(a) and
(b) of Annex D of the Commitment Letter (as in effect on the date hereof, or
any similar provisions pursuant to any permitted amendments to the Commitment
Letter or pursuant to any Alternative Financing or Replacement Facility) and
(B) other information, including projections, as may be reasonably requested
by Parent, the Financing Sources or their respective agents to prepare
customary bank information memoranda, lender presentations, offering
memoranda, private placement memoranda (including under Rule 144A under the
Securities Act), registration statements and prospectuses under the Securities
Act

debt offering in connection with such Financing (all information required to
be delivered pursuant to this clause (i) being referred to as the " _Required
Information_ "); (ii) participating (including by making members of senior
management, certain representatives and certain non-legal advisors, in each
case with appropriate seniority and expertise, available to participate) in a
reasonable number of meetings (including customary one-on-one meetings with
the parties acting as lead arrangers or agent for, and prospective lenders and
purchasers of, the Financing and senior management and Representatives, in
each case with appropriate seniority and expertise, of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries), due diligence sessions, presentations, "road shows",
drafting sessions and sessions with the rating agencies in connection with
the Financing; (iii) reasonably cooperating with the Financing Sources and
their respective agents due diligence, including providing access to
documentation reasonably requested by such Persons in connection with lending
or capital markets transactions; (iv) reasonably cooperating with the
marketing efforts for any portion of the Financing, including using its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that any syndication effort
benefits materially from any existing lending and investment banking
relationship; (v) aiding in the preparation of documentation, including bank
information memoranda, prospectuses and similar documents (which may
incorporate, by reference, periodic and current reports filed by the Company
with the SEC), rating agency presentations, road show presentations, private
placement memoranda and written offering materials and similar documents used
to complete such Financing (including delivery of one or more customary
representation letters), in each case, to the extent information contained
therein relates to the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries;
(vi) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its certified independent
auditors to provide (A) (x) consent to use of their reports in any materials
relating to the Financing, including SEC filings and offering memoranda that
include or incorporate the Companys consolidated financial information and
their reports thereon and (y) auditors reports and comfort letters (including
"negative assurances" comfort) with respect to financial information relating
to the Company and the Company Subsidiaries in customary form and (B) other
documentation and assistance (including reasonable assistance in the
preparation of pro forma financial statements by Parent); (vii) providing
(including using reasonable efforts to obtain such documents from its
advisors) customary certificates, legal opinions or other customary closing
documents as may be reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing Sources
(including a certificate of the chief financial officer of the Company with
respect to solvency matters as of the Closing on a pro forma basis and
consents and officers and public officials certifications); (viii) entering
into one or more credit or other agreements on terms satisfactory to Parent in
connection with the Financing; (ix) taking all actions reasonably necessary
in connection with the payoff of existing indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries on the Closing Date and the release of related Liens on the
Closing Date (including obtaining customary payoff letters, lien terminations
and other instruments of discharge); (x) causing the taking of corporate
actions reasonably necessary to permit the completion of the Financing, (xi)
executing and delivering any pledge and security documents (and any other
documents or instruments required for the creation and perfection of security
interests in the collateral securing the Financing) or other definitive
financing documents reasonably requested by Parent or the Financing Sources
(including guarantees and other deliverables), _provided_ , _however_ , that
no obligation of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under any such
agreement or instrument under this clause (xi) shall be effective until the
Effective Time; (xii) providing, at least five (5) Business Days prior to the
Closing Date, to the Financing Sources all

cooperating in procuring corporate and facilities ratings for the Financing in
each case, from each of Standard and Poors Ratings Services and Moodys

information about the Company, the Company Subsidiaries or their respective
Affiliates or securities; (xvi) (A) informing Parent if the chief
executive officer, chief financial officer, treasurer or controller of the
Company or any member of the Company Board shall have knowledge of any facts
as a result of which a restatement of any of the Companys financial
statements, in order for such financial statements to comply with GAAP, is
probable and (B) providing appropriate representations in connection with the
preparation of financial statements and other financial data of the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries; (xvii) assisting Parent to obtain waivers,
consents, estoppels and approvals from other parties to material leases,
encumbrances and contracts relating to the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries (including by arranging discussions among Parent, the Company
and the Financing Sources and their respective Representatives with other
parties to such material leases, encumbrances and contracts as of the
Closing); and (xviii) updating any Required Information provided to Parent
as may be necessary so that such Required Information qualifies as a
Compliant Document. For the avoidance of any doubt, nothing herein shall
require such cooperation to the extent it would interfere unreasonably with
the business or operations of the Company or the Company Subsidiaries, and
neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries shall be required to
(i) enter into or perform under any agreement with respect to the Financing
that is not contingent upon the Closing or that would be effective prior to
or simultaneous with the Effective Time or (ii) pay any commitment or other
similar fee or make any other payment (other than its own reasonable out-of-
pocket costs) or incur any other liability or provide or agree to provide any
indemnity in connection with the Financing or any of the foregoing prior to
the Effective Time; provided however that the foregoing clause (i) of this
sentence shall not apply to customary resolutions, representation
letters, officers certificates, supplemental indentures (which do not result
in the creation or assumption of any additional obligations by the Company or
any Company Subsidiary prior to the Effective Time) and solicitation agreement
and similar documents required to be executed in connection with the closing
of a debt offering into escrow on customary terms or in connection with the
consent solicitation referred to in Section 5.10(e) below. Parent shall
promptly indemnify and hold harmless the Company, the Company Subsidiaries
and their respective Representatives from and against any and all liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties (collectively, the " _Liabilities_ ") suffered or incurred by any
of them in connection with any claims asserted by Financing Sources in
connection with the arrangement of the Financing including, for the avoidance
of doubt, any Liabilities incurred in connection with the Companys
cooperation in accordance with Section 5.10(e) (other than to the extent such
Liabilities arise from the misconduct of or breach of this Agreement by the
Company, any of Company Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives) and
any information used in

 



80  connection therewith (other than information relating to the Company or the
Company Subsidiaries provided to Parent by or on behalf of the Company, the
Company Subsidiaries or their Representatives expressly for use in connection
with the Financing). The Company hereby consents to the reasonable use of the
Companys and the Company Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing.

 

(e) Subject to the second to last sentence of Section 5.10(d), the Company
shall cause its Representatives to, use its and their reasonable best efforts
to cooperate with the Parent and the Merger Subs to conduct a consent
solicitation with respect to the Companys 6.375% Senior Notes due 2017 and
the related indenture (as amended prior to the date hereof) to obtain
from the requisite holders thereof an agreement that the change of control
repurchase rights shall not apply with respect to the Merger and further
agrees that Wells Fargo Securities, LLC or one of its affiliates may serve as
sole lead solicitation agent for such consent solicitation; provided, that,
Parent shall be responsible for any Liabilities incurred by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with such consent solicitation, including any
consent fee payable to such holders in connection therewith.

(f) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, each of Parent and the Merger
Subs acknowledges and agrees that the obtaining of the Financing is not a
condition to Closing.

Section 5.11 _NYSE Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in
connection with the Merger to be listed on the NYSE, subject to official
notice of issuance, prior to the Effective Time.

dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of

reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 5.13 _Employee Benefit Matters._

 

(a) For a period of one (1) year immediately following the Effective Time (or
if shorter, during the period of employment), Parent shall, or it shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, provide each employee of
the Company and of each of the Company Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time
(each, an " _Employee_ ") with (i) at least the same level of base salary or
regular hourly wages, as applicable, as was provided to each such Employee
immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) a target incentive opportunity
and/or target sales and service incentive award opportunity, in each case, at
least equal to that provided to each such Employee immediately prior to the

81  award opportunities at levels that are substantially similar to those
provided to similarly situated employees of Parent, and (iv) employee benefits
that are substantially similar to those provided to each such Employee
(including any applicable dependents) immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(b) Employees shall receive credit for all purposes (including, for purposes
of eligibility to participate, vesting, benefit accrual and eligibility to
receive benefits, but excluding benefit accruals under any defined benefit
pension plan or retiree medical or welfare arrangement) under any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement established or maintained by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries under which each
Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time to the
same extent recognized by the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries under
comparable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time. Such
plan, program or arrangement shall credit each such Employee for service
accrued or deemed accrued on or prior to the Effective Time with the Company,
any predecessor of the Company, any current or former Company Subsidiary and
all current and former Affiliates of the Company or any predecessor of the
Company where service with such predecessor, Subsidiary, or Affiliate was
credited under a comparable Company Benefit Plan prior to the Effective Time.

commercially reasonable efforts to cause the applicable insurance carrier to
waive, all limitations as to eligibility waiting periods and preexisting and
at-work conditions, if any, with respect to participation and coverage
requirements applicable to each Employee under any Purchaser Welfare Company
Benefit Plan to the same extent waived or otherwise satisfied under a
comparable Company Benefit Plan, and (ii) provide, or use commercially

Employee for any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by
such Employee under the Company Benefit Plans during the relevant plan year,
up to and including the Effective Time.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 5.13_ shall be treated as an amendment of, or
undertaking to amend, any benefit plan. The provisions of this _Section
5.13_ are solely for the benefit of the respective parties to this Agreement
and nothing in this _Section 5.13_, express or implied, shall confer upon any
Employee, or legal representative or beneficiary thereof or any other Person,
any rights or remedies, including any right to employment or continued
employment for any specified period, or compensation or benefits of any nature
or kind whatsoever under this Agreement or a right in any employee or
beneficiary of such employee or other Person under a Company Benefit Plan that
such employee or beneficiary or other Person would not otherwise have under
the terms of that Company Benefit Plan.

 

(e) If requested by Parent no later than ten days prior to the Closing Date,
and to the extent permitted by applicable Law, the Company shall take all
actions necessary to terminate the Health Net, Inc. 401(k) Savings Plan (the "
_Company 401(k) Plan_ ") effective no later than the day before the Closing
Date. In the event of the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan following
such a request by Parent, a 401(k) plan sponsored by Parent or

 



82  one of its Affiliates (a " _Parent 401(k) Plan_ ") shall accept a direct
rollover of distributions from such Company 401(k) Plan of the account
balances (including in-kind distributions of promissory notes evidencing all
outstanding loans) of each Employee if such rollover is elected in accordance
with applicable Law by such Employee. Parent and the Company shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to permit each participant in the
Company 401(k) Plan who has an outstanding loan balance under the Company
401(k) Plan on the date such Company 401(k) Plan is terminated to continue to
make loan payments to the Company 401(k) Plan pending the distribution and
rollover of the Employees account, as described in the previous sentence.
Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Parent 401(k) Plan as soon
as practicable following the Closing Date.

by this Agreement is brought against the Company and/or its directors by
security holders of the Company, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of
such litigation and shall keep Parent informed on a current basis
with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement,
in, but not control, the defense and settlement of any such litigation against
the Company and/or its directors by security holders of the Company and no
such settlement shall be agreed to by the Company or any Company Subsidiary
without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In the event that any

contemplated by this Agreement is brought against Parent and/or its directors
by security holders of Parent, Parent shall (a) promptly notify the Company
of such litigation, (b) keep the Company informed on a current basis with

reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _Intended Tax
Treatment_ "), and (B) neither take any action nor fail to take any action if
such action or such failure could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede
the Mergers, taken together, from qualifying as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub
II and the Company shall execute and deliver officers certificates
containing appropriate representations that are customary for the transactions

Code.

 



83 (c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent if, at any time before the
Effective Time, the Company becomes aware of any fact or circumstance that
could reasonably be expected to prevent or impede the Mergers, taken together,

the Code.

 

(d) If the Company receives from Morgan, Lewis and Bockius LLP, counsel to the
Company, a written opinion on or prior to the Closing Date to the effect that
for U.S. Federal income tax purposes the Mergers will constitute a
"reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code (the " _368
Opinion_ ") and such opinion is delivered to Parent, then Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and Merger Sub II to effect the Second Merger
immediately after the consummation of the Merger. In rendering the 368
Opinion, counsel to the Company shall be entitled to rely upon
customary assumptions and representations reasonably satisfactory to such
counsel, including representations set forth in certificates of officers of
Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company. Provided the Company has
received the 368 Opinion and the Second Merger has been effected, each of
Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II and the Company shall report the Mergers
in a manner consistent with the Intended Tax Treatment.

 

Section 5.16 _Designation of Director_. The Parties shall take all actions
necessary to provide that as of immediately following the Closing, the Parent

Parties need not sign the same counterpart.

Section 8.6 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement
(including the Exhibits hereto and the documents and the instruments referred

94 Section 8.7 _Severability_. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction or other
authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable or against its regulatory policy,
the remainder of the terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect and shall in no way be
affected, impaired or invalidated. Upon such a determination, the Parties
shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the

this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any
particular provision of this Agreement. References to "this Agreement" shall
include the Parent Disclosure Letter and the Company Disclosure Letter. The

interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
hereto in whole or in part (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without
the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any such assignment
without such consent shall be null and void, except that (x) either Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder to any entity that is wholly owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent and (y) Parent and either Merger Sub may assign its
rights, but not its obligations, under this Agreement to any Financing
Source. This Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (b) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal
jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such court, and
agrees not to plead or claim any objection to the laying of venue in any such
court or that any judicial proceeding in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum, (c) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in

Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Commitment Letter or
the performance thereof, in any forum other than the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, County of New York, or, if under applicable Law exclusive
jurisdiction is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof). The
Parties hereto further agree that all of the provisions of Section 8.13
relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third party-claim referenced in this Section 8.12(b).

Company agrees that neither it nor any of its Representatives or Affiliates

transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. In addition, no Financing Source
shall have any liability or obligation to the Company or any of the Companys
Representatives in connection with or related to this Agreement, the
Financing, the Mergers or the other transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, including for any consequential, special, exemplary, punitive or
indirect damages (including any loss of profits, business or anticipated
savings) or damages of a tortious nature. For avoidance of doubt, (i) in no
event shall this Section 8.12(c) apply to Parent, whether before or after the
Closing, and (ii) from and after the Closing, the foregoing shall not modify
or alter in any respect any provision of any definitive loan documentation
between or among Parent, the Company (or the Surviving Entity), and any of
their Subsidiaries and any Financing Source entered into in connection with or
as contemplated by this Agreement, and in the event of a conflict between the
foregoing and any provision in any such definitive loan documentation, the
provisions of such definitive loan documentation shall govern and control.

Section 8.13  _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY
KNOWINGLY, INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHTS
TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
