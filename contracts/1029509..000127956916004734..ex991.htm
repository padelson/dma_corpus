   | (b)| Concurrently with execution of this Agreement, Purchaser shall

(the "Deposit"). Concurrently with payment of the Deposit, the Parties shall

shall be held by the Escrow Agent in an interest bearing account pursuant to
the provisions hereof and the Deposit Escrow Agreement. If the Purchaser, in
breach of this Agreement, does not close the purchase of the Assets, or if

satisfied, and such unsatisfied conditions have not been waived by Vendor, the
Deposit and interest earned thereon shall be forfeited to Vendor for
Vendor\'s own account absolutely as liquidated damages and not as a penalty as
a result of Closing not occurring, which forfeiture of the Deposit shall
constitute Vendor\'s sole remedy in such instance, with no right to claim
further damages or other remedies from Purchaser. If Closing does not occur
for any reason other than as aforesaid, the Deposit and interest earned
thereon shall be returned forthwith to the Purchaser. If Closing occurs, the
Deposit shall be released and paid over to the Vendor as partial satisfaction
of the Closing Purchase Price and the payment obligation of the Purchaser
hereunder and, in addition, interest earned on the Deposit shall be paid to
Vendor. 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| At the Closing Time Purchaser shall pay to Vendor an amount equal
to the Base Purchase Price, less the Deposit, plus or minus, as the case may

Base Purchase Price pursuant to Clause 2.4(e) (collectively, the "Closing
Purchase Price"). 
---|---|--- 
   | (d)| The Closing Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Assets as

---|---|--- 
   | (i)| to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rights, 80%; 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| to the Tangibles, 20% less One Dollar ($1.00); and

past, present and future environmental, abandonment or reclamation
liabilities related to the Assets is unknown as of the Closing Date, and the
Vendor and Purchaser have not attributed a specific or agreed to value with

plus (ii) the interest that would have accrued at the Prime Rate on the Base
Purchase Price, adjusted in accordance with Clause 2.6(a), less the Deposit,
calculated daily and not compounded, from and including the day of payment of
the Deposit to and including the day prior to the Closing Date, which amount
shall constitute an increase to the Closing Purchase Price and shall be
allocated to the Petroleum and Natural Gas Rights.

---|---|--- 
   | (a)| The Closing Purchase Price does not include an amount on account
of GST or any Other Sales Taxes payable in respect of the Transaction. 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| At the Closing Time, Vendor and Purchaser shall jointly execute
an election, in prescribed form, under section 167 of the GST Legislation to
have the sale of the Assets take place on a GST-free basis under Part IX of
the GST Legislation and Purchaser shall file such election with its GST
return for the reporting period in which the sale of the Assets takes place.
If the election is not available to the parties for any reason, Vendor shall
invoice Purchaser for the GST associated with the transfer of the Assets and
Purchaser will pay the GST to Vendor, as well as any interest or penalties for
which Vendor is liable as a result of having made the election hereunder. 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| At the Closing Time, Purchaser shall pay to Vendor any Other
Sales Taxes that are payable in respect of the Transaction. However, if,
after Closing, it is determined that additional Other Sales Taxes are, in
fact, payable in respect of the Transaction, then, as provided in Clause
2.5(d), Purchaser shall pay such Other Sales Taxes promptly after
receiving notice or otherwise becoming aware that such Other Sales Taxes are
payable in respect of the Transaction and Purchaser shall indemnify, defend
and save harmless Vendor and all Vendor Related Persons in respect of all such
Other Sales Taxes payable in respect of the Transaction and any interest and
penalties levied or imposed in connection therewith, except to the extent that
such penalty, interest or other amounts payable by Vendor is the result of
any act or omission by Vendor (other than the failure of Vendor to
collect such Other Sales Taxes at Closing). 
---|---|--- 
   | (d)| The Parties agree that, as between Vendor and Purchaser,
Purchaser shall be solely liable for and Purchaser shall indemnify, defend
and keep harmless Vendor from any GST, penalty, interest or other amounts
which may be payable by or assessed against Vendor under the GST Legislation
or any Losses and Liabilities suffered, sustained, paid or incurred by Vendor
or any of its Related Persons or any Claims made against Vendor or any of its
Related Persons as a result of or in connection with the failure by Purchaser
to pay or Vendor to collect or remit any GST at Closing, and without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, if subsequent to Closing, the section 167
election is rejected or overturned by the Minister of National Revenue,
then Purchaser shall pay the GST that is determined to be payable in respect
of the transfer of the Assets, including any interest and penalties payable
in respect thereof. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
this indemnity shall survive indefinitely.

thirty (30) days from the date that the auditing Party becomes aware of said
discrepancy, or shall be deemed to have waived its right to any Claim for the

respect to any such Environmental Liabilities that Purchaser may otherwise

Liabilities or any such Claims to the extent arising from matters or things
for which Purchaser is entitled to indemnification pursuant to Clause 6.1.

Liabilities or any Claims to the extent arising as a consequence of the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of Purchaser or any of the
Purchaser\'s Related Persons. 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| Nothing in Clause 6.2 shall be construed so as to require
Purchaser to be liable for or to indemnify Vendor or any of the Vendor\'s
Related Persons in connection with any Consequential Losses or any Losses and
Liabilities or any Claims to the extent arising as a consequence of the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of Vendor or any of the Vendor\'s Related
Persons. 
---|---|--- 
   | (d)| Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, in no
event shall the liability of Vendor under or in respect of this Agreement,
including all Claims by Purchaser arising out of or in connection with this
Agreement, exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to _[Redaction -
limitation of liability]_. This Clause 6.6(d) shall survive Closing and any
termination of this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
   | 6.7| Procedures - General Indemnities 
---|---|--- 
  

If a Party (the "Claiming Party") wishes to claim indemnification from the
other Party (the "Indemnifying Party") pursuant to Clause 6.1, 6.2, 6.3 or
6.4, the following shall apply:

   | (a)| Promptly after acquiring knowledge of the subject matter of the
Claim or the Losses and Liabilities in respect of which the claim for
indemnification is to be made (an "Indemnified Matter"), the Claiming
Party shall provide notice thereof to the Indemnifying Party, provided that,
failure to give such notice will not limit or lessen the right of the
Claiming Party to indemnity under this Agreement except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is prejudiced in its contest or defence of the Indemnified
Matter as a result of such failure. Such notice shall describe the nature of
the Indemnified Matter in reasonable detail and indicate, if reasonably
ascertainable, the Claiming Party\'s good faith estimate of the amount
for which the Indemnifying Party may be liable under this Agreement in
respect of such Indemnified Matter. 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| If the Indemnified Matter relates to a Claim made or brought by a
Third Party: 
---|---|--- 
    


--- 

 

 | 35| 
---|---|--- 

    



   | (i)| The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in or
to elect to assume control of the defence or dispute of any such Claim. Any
such participation in or assumption of control of the defence or dispute of
the Claim shall be at the Indemnifying Party\'s own expense and use counsel
chosen by the Indemnifying Party. The Claiming Party shall provide all
reasonable assistance that the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request in
connection with such defence or dispute. 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| The Claiming Party shall have the right to participate in the
defence or dispute of any such Indemnified Matter using counsel of its own
choice if representation of both the Claiming Party and the Indemnifying Party
by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to conflicting interests of
the two Parties, including Claims that would be partially excluded
from indemnification by the Indemnifying Party by virtue of another provision
of this Agreement. The Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the costs of
such additional counsel retained by the Claiming Party, but only to the extent
that such costs pertain to the defence or dispute of the Indemnified Matter. 
---|---|--- 
   | (iii)| The Claiming Party shall not settle or compromise, or propose
to settle or compromise, any such Indemnified Matter without first obtaining
the consent of the Indemnifying Party, provided that, such consent shall not
be required if: (A) the Indemnifying Party denies or disputes that the
particular Claim constitutes an Indemnified Matter and refuses to take
responsibility for the defence or dispute thereof as provided above; (B) the
Indemnifying Party fails to respond to any notice of the Indemnified Matter
given by the Claiming Party in accordance with Clause 6.7(a) within fifteen
(15) days of receipt thereof by the Indemnifying Party; or (C) the
Indemnifying Party either refuses or fails to defend or dispute
such Indemnified Matter after assuming responsibility for the defence or
dispute thereof as provided above. In each such a case, the Claiming Party
shall be entitled to defend, dispute, settle or compromise such a Claim by a
Third Party in any manner it determines to be appropriate, acting reasonably
and in good faith, subject to any limitations set forth in this Agreement. 
---|---|--- 
   | (c)| If the Indemnified Matter relates to Losses and Liabilities
directly suffered, sustained, paid or incurred by the Claiming Party or any
of the Claiming Party\'s Related Persons, the Indemnifying Party shall respond
to the Claiming Party as to whether the Indemnifying Party accepts liability
for such Indemnified Matter within thirty (30) days of receipt of the
Claiming Party\'s notice given in accordance with Clause 6.7(a) and: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| if the Indemnifying Party does not respond within such thirty
(30) day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have accepted its
liability for such Indemnified Matter; 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| if the Indemnifying Party accepts its liability for such
Indemnified Matter, the Indemnifying Party shall discharge its liability to
indemnify the Claiming Party within ten (10) days after the end of the initial
thirty (30) day notice period; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (iii)| if the Indemnifying Party disputes whether the particular
Losses and Liabilities constitute an Indemnified Matter or the amount of such
Losses or Liabilities for which the Indemnifying Party is liable within such
thirty (30) day period, or if the Indemnifying Party accepts or is deemed to
have accepted liability for such Indemnified Matter, but fails to discharge
such liability within the specified period, the Claiming Party shall be free
to seek to enforce its right to indemnification in respect of such
Indemnified Matter under this Agreement in any manner that it deems
appropriate. 
---|---|--- 
    


--- 

 

 | 36| 
---|---|--- 

    



   | (d)| If the Indemnifying Party has paid an amount in respect of an
Indemnified Matter pursuant to this Agreement, then: (i) the Indemnifying
Party will be subrogated to all and any Claims that the Claiming Party may
have relating thereto without any further action; (ii) the Claiming Party,

---|---|--- 
   | (a)| Forthwith upon execution of the Agreement by the Parties,
Purchaser shall advise in writing of its bona fide allocations of value for
the Assets to which the Identified ROFRs relate (the "ROFR Allocations"). 
---|---|--- 
   | (b)| Vendor shall issue notices to the Third Parties holding
Identified ROFRs (the "ROFR Holders") in accordance with the applicable
provisions of such rights no later than five (5) Business Days after it

---|---|--- 
   | (c)| Vendor shall notify Purchaser in writing forthwith upon receipt
of notice from any Third Party exercising or waiving any Identified ROFRs for

ROFRs exercised by the holders thereof by selling and conveying to such
holders the portion of the Assets which are subject to such exercised
Identified ROFR. If any Identified ROFRs are exercised by the holders thereof
this Agreement shall be deemed to have been amended, effective as of the date
of this Agreement, to exclude the applicable Assets from the definitions of
"Assets", "Major Facilities and Pipelines", "Miscellaneous Interests",
"Petroleum and Natural Gas Rights", "Tangibles" and "Wells", as may be
applicable, and to reduce the Purchase Price by the aggregate of the values
allocated to such Assets as provided in Clause 7.1(a). 
---|---|--- 
   | (e)| From and after Closing the Parties shall cooperate and shall take
all steps required to comply with any ROFRs identified after Closing in
accordance with the terms thereof. Purchaser shall be entitled to receive all
proceeds payable by the holders of any such ROFRs exercised after Closing and
there will be no adjustment to the Closing Purchase Price as a consequence of
the identification of any such ROFRs or the exercise thereof after Closing. 
---|---|--- 
   | (f)| Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement, Purchaser
shall be liable for all Losses and Liabilities suffered, sustained, paid or
incurred by Vendor or any of the Vendor\'s Related Persons, and, in addition
and as an independent covenant, shall indemnify Vendor and each of the
Vendor\'s Related Persons from and against, all Losses and
Liabilities suffered, sustained, paid or incurred by it and all Claims made
against it, in either case, as a consequence of any allocation of value
provided by Purchaser and used by Vendor in the issuance of a notice in
respect of a Identified ROFR pursuant to Clause 7.1(a), any failure by
Purchaser to comply with the terms of any ROFR identified after Closing and
any allocation of value used by Purchaser in the issuance of a notice in
respect of a ROFR identified after Closing. 
---|---|--- 
    


--- 

 

 | 37| 
---|---|--- 

    



   | (g)| If, at Closing, any Identified ROFR has not been waived and the
time to elect has not elapsed (the "Unexpired ROFRs"), Closing shall proceed
in respect of the remaining Assets, and the Parties will deposit with the
Escrow Agent under the terms of the ROFR Escrow Agreement, that portion of
the Purchase Price allocated to the Assets subject to the Unexpired ROFRs
(the "Escrow Assets") and all closing documentation required for the sale of
all Escrow Assets by Vendor to Purchaser. In such case, the following
procedures shall apply: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| if an Unexpired ROFR is exercised by a Third Party, the Parties
will promptly notify the Escrow Agent thereof in writing and: 
---|---|--- 
   | (A)| the funds deposited with the Escrow Agent in respect of such
Escrow Assets will be refunded by the Escrow Agent to Purchaser together with
the interest earned thereon while held by the Escrow Agent; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (B)| the closing documentation related to such Escrow Assets deposited
with the Escrow Agent will be of no force or effect; 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| if after Closing an Unexpired ROFR is extinguished by lapse of
time, waiver or otherwise (other than as a result of being exercised), the
Parties will promptly notify the Escrow Agent thereof in writing and: 
---|---|--- 
   | (A)| the Escrow Agent will promptly pay the funds deposited with the
Escrow Agent in respect of such Escrow Assets to Vendor together with the
interest earned thereon while held by the Escrow Agent; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (B)| the Escrow Agent will promptly deliver copies of the closing
documentation deposited with the Escrow Agent in relation to such Escrow
Assets to each Party, such documentation shall be effective and the sale of
such Escrow Assets to Purchaser pursuant hereto shall have closed. 
---|---|--- 
   | (h)| If, prior to Closing, a ROFR Holder challenges a ROFR Allocation
and the challenge has not been resolved prior to Closing, then: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| if such ROFR Holder has not commenced an action with respect to
the ROFR Allocation prior to the Closing Date, the Parties shall proceed to
Closing with the applicable Assets included in the Assets conveyed at Closing; 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| if such ROFR Holder has commenced any litigation, legal
proceedings or arbitration with respect to the ROFR Allocation (a "ROFR
Action") prior to the Closing Date, then Closing shall occur on the Closing
Date with respect to only those Assets not subject to the ROFR Action and
conveyance of those Assets subject to the ROFR Action and payment for same
shall be governed by the ROFR Escrow Agreement; 
---|---|--- 
   | (iii)| Vendor shall diligently proceed with the defence, compromise or
settlement of the ROFR Action and shall advise Purchaser with respect to the
ROFR Action; 
---|---|--- 
   | (iv)| the Parties shall cooperate with each other in the defence of
the ROFR Action; and 
---|---|--- 
    


--- 

 

 | 38| 
---|---|--- 

    



   | (v)| Vendor shall not enter into any settlement, consent order or
other compromise with respect to the ROFR Action without Purchaser's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| If, after the amount finally attributed to those Assets subject
to the ROFR Action has been decided by way of judicial resolution or
settlement, the applicable ROFR Holders do not exercise their Identified ROFR
on such Assets, then: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| the Parties shall proceed to close on the sale of such Assets to
Purchaser, to the fullest extent possible, under the same terms and
conditions as contained within this Agreement; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| at the closing of such sale, Vendor shall be paid the entire
amount originally allocated by Purchaser to such Assets, provided that the
Parties shall be required to close on such Assets no later than thirty (30)
days following the ROFR Holder's election to not exercise its Identified
ROFR. 
---|---|--- 
   | (j)| If, within one hundred fifty (150) days from Closing: 
---|---|--- 
   | (i)| Vendor provides to Purchaser written confirmation to Purchaser's
reasonable satisfaction, that a ROFR Holder which had previously exercised an
Identified ROFR has subsequently elected to not proceed with, or is
otherwise unable to consummate, the acquisition of those Assets which were
the subject of such exercised Identified ROFR; 
---|---|--- 
   | (ii)| all rights of ROFR Holders in respect of such Identified ROFR
have otherwise expired or been waived in accordance with its terms; and 
---|---|--- 
   | (iii)| Vendor's subsequent sale and conveyance of such Assets to
Purchaser would not give rise to or make operative any further or additional
ROFR, whether triggered by this Agreement or otherwise, 
---|---|--- 
  

Vendor shall sell and convey such Assets to Purchaser and Purchaser shall
purchase and accept such Assets from Vendor, pursuant to an agreement on the
same terms as this Agreement, and for an amount equal to the ROFR Allocation.

written consent of the other Party. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent a Party from disclosing such information: (i) to any

Assets are subject; or (iii) if required to obtain the consent to the
Transaction by Vendor\'s lenders or other security holders and, if applicable,
to obtain their release of security interests in, or their acknowledgement of
"no interest" in, the Assets; provided that, in each such instance, the Party
that proposes to make such a disclosure shall advise the other Party of such
proposed disclosure and shall use its reasonable efforts to prevent the
disclosure of any such information that is not required to be disclosed for

provided that in no circumstances shall either Party disclose the name of the
other Party on any such press release or otherwise. Each Party consents to
the inclusion of a generic description of its businesses by the other Party in
such other Party\'s press release(s) in this regard. The Parties agree that a
press release issued by either Party may contain some or all of the financial
terms of the Transaction. Without derogating from the Parties\' rights to
make public disclosures under Clause 13.12(a), each of Vendor and Purchaser
shall use their reasonable efforts to furnish to the other Party with the
proposed content of all press releases concerning this Agreement and the
Transaction at least twenty-four (24) hours prior to the release or
publication thereof, but in any event prior to the release or publication
with reasonably sufficient time for the other Party to review and comment.

For the period commencing on the execution and delivery hereof and ending
three (3) years after the Closing Date the Vendor shall:

   | (a)| use commercially reasonable efforts to provide the Purchaser or
its auditors, counsel or engineers with financial, operating and other
information for the Assets that is available and as may be reasonably required
by Purchaser in order for the Purchaser to comply with Applicable Laws in
respect of any prospectus, business acquisition report, press release or
other disclosure document filed or to be filed in connection with the
Transaction, the form and content of which are subject to or prescribed by
Applicable Laws (collectively, the "Disclosure Documents");

applicable Regulations in connection with the Transaction, including with
Canadian securities regulatory authorities under the System for Electronic

Purchaser\'s sole cost and expense to personnel of the Vendor, its Related
Persons or their auditors, counsel or engineers who are responsible for such

as an independent covenant, shall defend, indemnify and save harmless Vendor
and each of the Vendor\'s Related Persons from and against, all Third Party
costs incurred by Vendor in connection with Vendor\'s compliance with its
obligations under this Clause 13.13.

   | 13.15| Counterpart Execution 
---|---|--- 
  

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts with the same
effect as if all signatories to the counterparts had signed one document. All

instrument. For avoidance of doubt, a signed counterpart provided by way of
