The directors of CVC MergerCo immediately prior to the Effective Time shall from and after the Effective Time be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office, subject to the applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors shall be duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal, or as otherwise provided by Law.

ARTICLE II 

   

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES  

  

 Section 2.01 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Class A Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by stockholders ( _i_ ) who shall have neither voted for adoption of this Agreement and the Merger nor consented thereto in writing and ( _ii_ ) who shall be entitled to and shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time unless and until the holder of such shares of Class A Stock fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses such holders right to appraisal. If a holder of Dissenting Shares shall withdraw (in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL) the demand for such appraisal or shall become ineligible for such appraisal, then, at the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted or deemed to have been converted, as the case may be, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Section 1.07. The Company shall give Family LLC ( _i_ ) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals (or attempted withdrawals) of demands for appraisal and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and ( _ii_ ) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Family LLC, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 Section 2.02 _Payment Fund_. 

  

 (a) _Payment Fund_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, Family LLC and the Company shall enter into an agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ "), subject to the Special Committees approval (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) with a bank or trust company selected by the Company and reasonably satisfactory to Family LLC to act as paying agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates for the Merger Consideration (the " _Paying Agent_ "). As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Class A Stock (other than Excluded Shares, Restricted Shares and any Dissenting Shares), an amount of cash representing the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.07. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." 

  

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time 

   ##### 

  

 

evidenced outstanding shares of Class A Stock (other than Excluded Shares and
Restricted Shares), ( _i_ ) a form letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the
Surviving Corporation may reasonably specify) and ( _ii_ ) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of such Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07. Upon surrender of such a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation, together with a
letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other customary documents as
may be required pursuant to such instructions (collectively, the "
_Transmittal Documents_ "), the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled
to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of
Class A Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, without any interest
thereon, less any required withholding of taxes, and the Certificate so
surrendered shall thereupon be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Class A Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of
the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued and paid in accordance
with this Article II to the transferee of such shares if the Certificate
evidencing such shares is presented to the Paying Agent and is properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer. In such event,
the signature on the Certificate or any related stock power must be properly
guaranteed and the Person requesting payment of the Merger Consideration must
either pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a
Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate so surrendered or
establish to the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is
not applicable. The Merger Consideration will be delivered by the Paying
Agent as promptly as practicable following surrender of such a Certificate
and the related Transmittal Documents. Cash payments may be made by check
unless otherwise required by a depositary institution in connection with the
book-entry delivery of securities. No interest will be payable on any
Merger Consideration. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.02,
each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
evidence only the right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger
Consideration for each share of Class A Stock (other than Excluded
Shares, Restricted Shares and any Dissenting Shares) formerly represented by
such Certificate. The Payment Fund shall not be used for any purpose other
than as set forth in this Article II. Any interest, dividends or other income
earned on the investment of cash held in the Payment Fund shall be for the
account of the Surviving Corporation. The Merger Consideration delivered upon
surrender of the Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
shares represented by such Certificates. 

   

 (c) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including, without limitation, the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the Public Stockholders for six months following the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation. Any Public 

   ##### 

  

 

Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger
Consideration. 

   

 (d) _No Liability_. None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Family LLC or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (e) _Investment of the Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation on a daily basis and in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement; _provided_ that any gain or loss thereon shall not affect the amounts payable to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to Article I or this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to the Surviving Corporation. If for any reason (including as a result of losses) the cash in the Payment Fund shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash payment obligations. 

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Family LLC and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Class A Stock, Options or Restricted Shares such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Class A Stock, Options or Restricted Shares in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall execute an affidavit of that fact upon request. The holder of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall also deliver a reasonable indemnity against any claim that may be made against Family LLC, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. The affidavit and any indemnity which may be required hereunder shall be delivered to the Paying Agent (or, after the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), which shall be responsible for making payment for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates pursuant to the terms hereof. 

  

 Section 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates representing shares of Company Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. Any Certificate presented to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any 

   ##### 

  

 

reason at or after the Effective Time shall be canceled and, in the case of
any Certificates representing Class A Stock (other than Class A Stock held by
Family LLC, the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company (or
held in the Companys treasury) and Restricted Shares), exchanged for the
Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Article II. 

   

 Section 2.04 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company and Family LLC shall take such steps, to the extent required and permitted, to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the Company by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 2.05 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that prior to the Effective Time, solely as a result of a reclassification, combination, stock split (including, without limitation, a reverse stock split), stock dividend or stock distribution which in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all holders of Company Stock, there is a change in the number of shares of Company Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of securities or rights convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Company Stock, then the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the effects of such event.

For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Marketing Period_ " shall mean a period of 30 days beginning after the date on which on all of the closing conditions contained in Article VI have been satisfied or waived (other than Section 6.01(g) and any conditions that by their nature will not be satisfied until the Closing) throughout which ( _x_ ) Family LLC has all of the Required Information and Cooperation and ( _y_ ) the conditions contained in Article VI continue to be satisfied or waived (other than Section 6.01(g) and any conditions that by their nature will not be satisfied until the Closing); _provided_ that ( _A_ ) the Marketing Period shall not be deemed to have commenced or occurred if, prior to the completion of the Marketing Period, any applicable auditor shall have withdrawn its audit opinion with respect to any financial statements contained in the Required Information and Cooperation or the SEC Reports, and ( _B_ ) if the Marketing Period would end during the period from August 20, 2007 through September 3, 2007, or the period from December 17, 2007 through January 1, 2008, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than September 3, 2007 or January 2, 2008, respectively.

Letter (including, without limitation, as a result of the insufficiency of the
CVC Restricted Payment Capacity, the CSC Restricted Payment Capacity or the
RNS Restricted Payment Capacity), Family LLC shall use its reasonable best
efforts to arrange for alternative financing in an amount sufficient to
replace such portion of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter
and the Company shall provide all reasonable assistance to Family LLC in
connection therewith;  _provided_ that Family LLC shall be under no
obligation to arrange for such alternative financing if ( _i_ ) the terms and
conditions thereof are materially less favorable to Family LLC or the Company
than the terms and conditions contemplated by the Commitment Letter or ( _ii_
) such portion of the financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter has
become unavailable as a result of the failure of the Company or any of is
Subsidiaries to comply in any material respect with its obligations under
this Agreement. Family LLC shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably
current basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to
arrange the Financing Transactions and, upon the Companys request, provide

 Section 5.07 _No Solicitation_. 

  

 (a) The Company shall not, nor shall it authorize or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its or their respective Representatives to (and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such Persons not to), directly or indirectly ( _i_ ) initiate, induce, solicit, facilitate or encourage any inquiry or the making, submission or announcement of any proposal that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to a Takeover Proposal, ( _ii_ ) enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, or ( _iii_ ) continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding, furnish to any Person any information or data with respect to the Company in connection with or in response to, or otherwise cooperate with or take any other action to facilitate any proposal that ( _A_ ) constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal or ( _B_ ) requires the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and Minority Approval, the Company may, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.07(a), and subject to compliance with Section 5.07(c): 

   

 (x) furnish information or data with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with a confidentiality agreement containing terms and conditions not materially less restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, _provided_  that ( _I_ ) such confidentiality agreement shall not contain any provisions that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligation to provide the required disclosure to Family LLC 

   ##### 

  

   

pursuant to Section 5.07(b), and ( _II_ ) that all such information provided
to such Person has previously been provided to Family LLC or is provided to
Family LLC prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such
Person; and 

   

 (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal; 

 

 _provided_ , in each case, that the Special Committee determines in good
faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that (
_i_ ) the failure to furnish such information or participate in such
discussions or negotiations would reasonably be expected to constitute a
breach of its fiduciary duties to the Public Stockholders under applicable
Law and ( _ii_ ) such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Superior Proposal. The Company shall promptly inform
its Representatives of the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.07.
Without limiting the foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 5.07 by any Representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries whether or not such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this
Section 5.07 by the Company; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in this Agreement, in no event shall any action taken
by, or at the express direction of, Charles F. Dolan or James L. Dolan
constitute a violation by the Company of this Section 5.07. Nothing contained
in this Section 5.07 shall prohibit the Company from responding to any
unsolicited proposal or inquiry solely by advising the Person making
such proposal or inquiry of the terms of this Section 5.07. 

   

 (b) As promptly as practicable after the receipt by the Company of any Takeover Proposal or any inquiry with respect to, or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal, and in any case within 24 hours after the receipt thereof, the Company shall provide notice to Family LLC of ( _i_ ) such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, ( _ii_ ) the identity of the Person making any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry, and ( _iii_ ) the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal or inquiry (including, without limitation, any amendments or modifications thereto). The Company shall keep Family LLC informed on a current basis of the status of any such Takeover Proposal, including, without limitation, any changes to the price or other material terms and conditions thereof, and promptly provide Family LLC with copies of all written or e-mail correspondence or other communications and other written materials, and summaries of all oral correspondence or other communications, sent or provided to or by the Company and its Representatives in connection with any Takeover Proposal that relate to the price or other material terms and conditions of such Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Takeover Proposal or inquiry is made, or any other information with respect to such Takeover Proposal or inquiry is provided, solely to Charles F. Dolan or James L. Dolan, the Company shall have no obligations to Family LLC under this Section 5.07(b) with respect to such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or other 

     ##### 

 

  

information until such time as any member of the Special Committee is made
aware of such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or other information. 

   

 (c) Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof (including, without limitation, the Special Committee) shall, directly or indirectly, ( _i_ ) effect a Change in the Company Recommendation or ( _ii_ ) approve any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to, or that may reasonably be expected to lead to, any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval or Minority Approval, the Special Committee may, subject to Section 5.7(d), in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, effect a Change in the Company Recommendation, _provided_ that the Special Committee determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, that such action is required to comply with its fiduciary duties to the stockholders of the Company under applicable Law. Notwithstanding any Change in the Company Recommendation, this Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of the Company at the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of adopting this Agreement and approving the Merger (it being understood and agreed that the condition contained in Section 6.01(b), as well as all of the other provisions of Article VI, shall continue to be conditions to the Parties obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent set forth in Article VI). 

  

 (d) No Change in the Company Recommendation shall change the approval of the Board of Directors for purposes of causing any state takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Special Committee shall not effect a Change in the Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.07(c) unless the Company has ( _x_ ) provided written notice to Family LLC (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal or Intervening Event_ ") advising Family LLC that the Special Committee has received a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event has occurred, which notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identify the Person making such Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, describe such event and its effect on the Company in reasonable detail, ( _y_ ) negotiated during the four Business Day period following Family LLCs receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal or Intervening Event in good faith with Family LLC (to the extent Family LLC wishes to negotiate) to enable Family LLC to make a proposal that renders the Superior Proposal no longer a Superior Proposal or obviates the need for a Change in the Company Recommendation as a result of the Intervening Event, as the case may be, and ( _z_ ) determined in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, that any such proposal from Family LLC is not as favorable to the Public Stockholders as such Superior Proposal and does not obviate the need for a Change in the Company Recommendation as a result of the Intervening Event, as the case may be. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.07 shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of any Takeover Proposal or making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Special Committee determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ that neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by Section 5.07(c), effect a Change in the Company Recommendation.

 " _Superior Proposal_ " means any _bona fide_ written proposal or offer made by a Third Party in respect of a Business Combination Transaction involving, or any purchase or acquisition of, ( _i_ ) all or substantially all of the outstanding shares of Class A Stock or ( _ii_ ) at least 66% of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which Business Combination Transaction or other purchase or acquisition contains terms and conditions that the Special Committee determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, would result in a transaction that ( _A_ ) if consummated, would be more favorable to the Public Stockholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including, without limitation, any proposal by Family LLC to amend the terms of this Agreement), and ( _B_ ) is reasonably capable of being consummated on the 

   ##### 

  

    

terms so proposed, without significant incremental delay or cost, taking
into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other aspects of such
proposal. 

  

 Section 5.08 _Stockholder Litigation_.

 Section 5.09 _Solvency Opinion_. The Company and Family LLC shall use their reasonable best efforts to retain an appraisal or valuation firm for purposes of obtaining from such firm its opinion as to whether each of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries that is contemplated to make a distribution in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter will ( _i_ ) in the case of any such Person that is a corporation, have at the Closing sufficient surplus under Delaware law out of which to make such distribution, ( _ii_ ) in the case any such Person that is a limited liability company, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter, have at the Closing assets the fair market value of which exceeds its liabilities and ( _iii_ ) in the case of all such Persons, after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter, ( _x_ ) be able to pay its debts as they come due, ( _y_ ) have assets the fair value and present fair salable value of which exceed its stated liabilities and identified contingent liabilities and ( _z_ ) have remaining capital that is not unreasonably small for the business in which such Person is engaged and proposed to be engaged (a favorable opinion from such firm with respect to each of the foregoing, the " _Solvency Opinion_ ").

 Section 8.03 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of laws thereof, except to the extent that mandatory provisions of federal law apply. Each of the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Delaware and any appellate court thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the agreements delivered in connection herewith or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment relating thereto, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally ( _a_ ) agrees not to commence any such action except in such court, ( _b_ ) agrees that any claim in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such Delaware state court, ( _c_ ) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so any objection which it may now or hereafter have to venue of any such action or proceeding in any such Delaware state court, and ( _d_ ) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of any inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such Delaware state court. Each of the Parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the Parties to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of process in any such action or proceeding in 

   ##### 

  

    

the manner provided for notices in Section 8.02 of this Agreement; _provided_
, _however_ , that nothing in this Agreement shall affect the right of any
Party to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted
by Law. 

  

 Section 8.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits hereto and the Disclosure Letters), the Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreement among the Parties with respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to these matters. Each Party has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive negotiations between the Parties. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that Family LLC may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Family LLC without the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Family LLC of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. 

  

 Section 8.05 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement which is invalid or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to that jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity or unenforceability without rendering invalid or unenforceable the remaining terms and provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of any terms or provisions of this Agreement in any other jurisdiction so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest extent possible. 

  

 Section 8.06 _Headings_. Headings are used for reference purposes only and do not affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.07 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely to the benefit of each Party hereto and their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, and, except for the provisions of Section 5.03 

   ##### 

  

    

hereof, which shall be enforceable by the beneficiaries contemplated thereby,
nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer
upon any other Person any rights, benefits or remedies of any nature
whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement; _provided_ that after
the Effective Time the Public Stockholders shall be express third-party
beneficiaries of the provisions of Section 1.07 and 2.02 to the extent such
provisions obligate the Company to make payments to the Public Stockholders
of the Merger Consideration and for no other purpose. 

  

 Section 8.08 _Remedies_. 

  

 (a) The Parties hereto agree that irreparable harm would occur in the event any of the provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedies to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

Neither Family LLC nor CVC MergerCo shall have any liability to the Company in respect of any claims for monetary damages that the Company may bring against Family LLC and/or CVC MergerCo pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement that are in an aggregate amount, including all other such claims that have been brought by the Company against Family LLC or CVC MergerCo, in excess of $300,000,000 (the " _Family Liability Cap_ "). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if the payment to the Company of any judgment for monetary damages would cause the Family Liability Cap to be exceeded, such judgment shall be paid only in such portion as would not cause the Family Liability Cap to be exceeded. No Party shall be liable to any other Party hereunder for monetary damages except for a material breach of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 8.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, but all of which shall constitute one and the same agreement.
