transactions contemplated hereby and thereby and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings,
both written and oral, among the Parties, or any of them, with respect to these matters. Each
Party has participated in the drafting of this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the
result of extensive negotiations between the Parties. In the event an ambiguity or question of
intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the
Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any Party by
virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement. Neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties, in
whole or in part (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of
the other Parties, and any attempt to make any such assignment without such consent shall be null

interests and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Family LLC without
the consent of the Company, but no such assignment shall relieve Family LLC of any of its
