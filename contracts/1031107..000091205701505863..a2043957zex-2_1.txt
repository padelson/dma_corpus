AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF REORGANIZATION   This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF
REORGANIZATION (the "AGREEMENT") is made and entered into as of March 11,
2001 by and among Peregrine Systems, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("PARENT");
Utility Acquisition Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("MERGER SUB"); Extricity, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "COMPANY"); and with respect to certain provisions of Article VII of
this Agreement, Barry M. Ariko, as Securityholder Agent (as defined in
Article VII of this Agreement), and U.S. Bank Trust National Association, as
Escrow Agent (as defined in Article VII of this Agreement).   RECITALS  
A. The Boards of Directors of each of the Company, Parent, and Merger Sub
believe it to be in the best interests of each such company and each
such company\'s respective stockholders that the Company and Merger Sub
combine into a single company through the merger of Merger Sub with and into
the Company (the "MERGER") and, in furtherance thereof, have approved the
Merger.   B. Pursuant to the Merger, among other things, all the
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company ("COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK"),
consisting of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Company ("COMPANY
COMMON") and the outstanding shares of Preferred Stock of the Company
("COMPANY PREFERRED"), will be converted into shares of Common Stock of
Parent, par value $0.001 per share ("PARENT COMMON"), at the rate determined
herein.   C. A portion of the shares of Parent Common otherwise issuable
by Parent in connection with the Merger shall be placed in escrow by Parent,
the release of which amount shall be contingent upon certain events and
conditions, all as set forth in Article VII hereof.   D. The Company,
Parent, and Merger Sub desire to make certain representations and other
agreements in connection with the Merger.   E. The parties intend, by
executing this Agreement, to adopt a plan of reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"CODE").   NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the covenants, promises,
and representations set forth herein, and for other good and valuable
consideration, intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties agree as
follows:     ARTICLE I   THE MERGER   1.1. THE MERGER. At the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.2) and subject to and upon the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, the Certificate of Merger attached hereto
as Exhibit A (the "Merger Certificate"), and the applicable provisions of the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("Delaware Law") and, to the
extent applicable pursuant to Section 2115 thereof, the General Corporation
Law of the State of California ("California Law"), Merger Sub shall be merged
with and into the Company, the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub
shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation and
as a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Company as the surviving
corporation after the Merger is hereinafter sometimes referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation."   1.2. EFFECTIVE TIME. Unless this Agreement is
earlier terminated pursuant to Article IX hereof, the closing of the Merger
(the "Closing") shall occur as promptly as practicable following the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI. The Closing
shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati,
Professional Corporation, 650 Page Mill Road, Palo Alto, California
94304-1050, unless another place or time is agreed to by Parent and the
Company. The date upon which the Closing actually occurs is referred
to herein as the "Closing Date." On the Closing Date, the parties hereto
shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing the Merger Certificate or
like instrument with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in
accordance with the relevant provisions of Delaware Law (the time of
acceptance by the Secretary of State of Delaware of such filing, or such
later time and date as may be mutually agreed and set forth in the Merger
Certificate, being referred to herein as the "Effective Time").   1.3.
EFFECT OF THE MERGER. At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall
be as provided in the applicable provisions of Delaware Law. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all the property, rights, privileges, powers, and franchises of the Company
and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities, and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts,
liabilities, and duties of the Surviving Corporation.   1.4. CERTIFICATE OF
INCORPORATION; BYLAWS.   (a) Unless otherwise determined by Parent prior to
the Effective Time, at the Effective Time, the Certificate of Incorporation
of Merger Sub shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation until thereafter amended as provided by law and such Certificate
of Incorporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that Article I of the Certificate of
Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended to read as
follows: "The name of the corporation is Peregrine Force, Inc."   (b) The
Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time,
shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter
amended.    -2-    1.5. DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. The director(s) of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the initial
director(s) of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold office in accordance
with the Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office in accordance with the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.   1.6.
EFFECT ON COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, as of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger, and without any
action on the part of the holder of any of the issued and outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock:   (a) AGGREGATE SHARES OF PARENT COMMON. The
aggregate maximum number of shares of Parent Common to be issued (including
Parent Common to be reserved for issuance upon exercise of Company Options
(as defined in Section 1.6(d)) to be assumed by Parent) in exchange for the
acquisition by Parent of all outstanding Company Capital Stock and all
unexpired and unexercised options, warrants, and any similar rights to
acquire Company Capital Stock shall be 9,200,000 shares (the "AGGREGATE
SHARES OF PARENT COMMON").   (b) CANCELLATION OF PARENT-OWNED AND COMPANY-
OWNED STOCK. All shares of Company Capital Stock that are owned directly or
indirectly by the Company or any subsidiary of the Company, or by Parent or
any subsidiary of Parent, shall be cancelled and extinguished, and no stock
of Parent or other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.  
(c) CONVERSION OF COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK. Other than shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 1.6(b) above, Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section
1.7(a) below), and fractional shares, if any, as provided in Section 1.6(h)
below, and subject to the limitation that Parent shall in no event
be required to issue more than the Aggregate Shares of Parent Common,
each outstanding share of Company Capital Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished
and shall be converted automatically, without any action on the part of the
holder thereof and upon surrender in the manner provided in Section 1.8
hereof of the certificate(s) representing such shares of Company Capital
Stock, into that number of shares of Parent Common determined as follows:  
(i) Each outstanding share of Series F Preferred Stock of the Company (the
"SERIES F PREFERRED") shall be converted into the right to receive that
number of shares of Parent Common determined by dividing (A) $6.45 by (B) the
Parent Common Price (such ratio being referred to herein as the "SERIES F
EXCHANGE RATIO"). The "AGGREGATE SERIES F PARENT COMMON" shall mean the
number of whole shares of Parent Common determined by multiplying (A)
the Series F Exchange Ratio by (B) the number of shares of Series F
Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "SERIES F
SHARE AMOUNT").   (ii) Each outstanding share of Series E Preferred
Stock of the Company (the "SERIES E PREFERRED") shall be converted into the
right to receive that number of shares of Parent Common determined by
dividing (A) $4.91 by (B) the Parent Common Price (such ratio being referred
to herein as the "SERIES E EXCHANGE RATIO"). The "AGGREGATE SERIES E PARENT
COMMON"    -3-   shall mean the number of whole shares of Parent Common
determined by multiplying (A) the Series E Exchange Ratio by (B) the number
of shares of Series E Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (the "SERIES E SHARE AMOUNT").   (iii) Each outstanding
share of Series D Preferred Stock of the Company (the "SERIES D PREFERRED")
shall be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of Parent
Common determined by dividing (A) $5.91 by (B) the Parent Common Price (such
ratio being referred to herein as the "SERIES D EXCHANGE RATIO"). The
"AGGREGATE SERIES D PARENT COMMON" shall mean the number of whole shares of
Parent Common determined by multiplying (A) the Series D Exchange Ratio by
(B) the number of shares of Series D Preferred outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time (the "SERIES D SHARE AMOUNT").   (iv) Each
outstanding share of Series C Preferred Stock of the Company (the "SERIES C
PREFERRED") shall be converted into the right to receive that number of
shares of Parent Common determined by dividing (A) $5.10 by (B) the Parent
Common Price (such ratio being referred to herein as the "SERIES C EXCHANGE
RATIO"). The "AGGREGATE SERIES C PARENT COMMON" shall mean the number of
whole shares of Parent Common determined by multiplying (A) the Series C
Exchange Ratio by (B) the number of shares of Series C Preferred outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "SERIES C SHARE AMOUNT").  
(v) Each outstanding share of Series B Preferred Stock of the Company (the
"SERIES B PREFERRED") shall be converted into the right to receive that
number of shares of Parent Common determined by dividing (A) $2.75 by (B) the
Parent Common Price (such ratio being referred to herein as the "SERIES B
EXCHANGE RATIO"). The "AGGREGATE SERIES B PARENT COMMON" shall mean the
number of whole shares of Parent Common determined by multiplying (A)
the Series B Exchange Ratio by (B) the number of shares of Series B
Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "SERIES B
SHARE AMOUNT").   (vi) Each outstanding share of Series A Preferred
Stock of the Company (the "SERIES A PREFERRED") shall be converted into the
right to receive that number of shares of Parent Common determined by
dividing (A) $1.00 by (B) the Parent Common Price (such ratio being referred
to herein as the "SERIES A EXCHANGE RATIO"). The "AGGREGATE SERIES A PARENT
COMMON" shall mean the number of whole shares of Parent Common determined by
multiplying (A) the Series A Exchange Ratio by (B) the number of shares of
Series A Preferred outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (the
"SERIES A SHARE AMOUNT").   (vii) Each outstanding share of Company Common
shall be converted into the right to receive that number of shares of Parent
Common determined by dividing (A) the Available Parent Common (as defined
below) by (B) the Aggregate Company Common (as defined below) (such ratio
being referred to herein as the "COMMON EXCHANGE RATIO").   The "AVAILABLE
PARENT COMMON" shall equal the number of shares of Parent Common determined
by subtracting (i) the sum of the Aggregate Series F Parent Common, the
Aggregate Series E Parent Common, the Aggregate Series D Parent Common, the
Aggregate Series C Parent Common, the Aggregate Series B Parent Common, and
the Aggregate Series A Parent Common    -4-   from (ii) the Aggregate
Shares of Parent Common. The "AGGREGATE COMPANY COMMON" shall equal the
number determined by subtracting (i) the sum of (A) the Series F Share
Amount, (B) the Series E Share Amount, (C) the product of two times
the Series D Share Amount, (D) the product of two times the Series C Share
Amount, (E) the product of two times the Series B Share Amount, and (F) the
product of two times the Series A Share Amount from (ii) the Fully Diluted
Company Capital Stock. The "FULLY DILUTED COMPANY CAPITAL STOCK" shall mean
the aggregate number of shares of Company Common outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (assuming exercise or conversion of all
outstanding securities or similar rights that are exercisable for or
convertible into shares of Company Common, whether vested or unvested and
whether or not currently exercisable).   The "PARENT COMMON PRICE" shall
mean the average, rounded to the nearest whole cent, of the closing prices of
the Parent Common in trading on the Nasdaq National Market over the 30
calendar day period ending on the day three days prior to the Effective
Time.   The "EXCHANGE RATIO" or "EXCHANGE RATIOS" refer, as the case may
require, to the Series F Exchange Ratio, the Series E Exchange Ratio, the
Series D Exchange Ratio, the Series C Exchange Ratio, the Series B Exchange
Ratio, the Series A Exchange Ratio, and the Common Exchange Ratio. Each of
the Exchange Ratios shall be rounded to the nearest fourth decimal place.  
Of the total number of shares of Parent Common to be issued pursuant to this
Section 1.6(c), ten percent (10%) shall be subject to the Escrow
Fund established pursuant to Article VII below (with fractional shares as to
any holder of Company Capital Stock to be rounded down to a whole share)
(the "ESCROW AMOUNT").   (d) STOCK OPTIONS. At the Effective Time, all
options to purchase Company Common (each, a "COMPANY OPTION") then
outstanding under the Company\'s 1996 Stock Option Plan (the "OPTION PLAN")
or otherwise (whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested), shall
remain outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be assumed by
Parent in accordance with the provisions described below:   (i) Each
Company Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement shall continue to
have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the
Option Plan and/or as provided in the respective option agreements, governing
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including,
without limitation, any vesting or repurchase rights relating thereto),
except that (A) such Company Option shall be exercisable for that number of
whole shares of Parent Common equal to the product of the number of shares of
Company Common that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Common
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common and (B) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common
issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Option shall be equal to the
quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company
Common at which such Company Option was exercisable immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Common Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole
cent.    -5-    (ii) It is the intention of the parties that the
Company Options assumed by Parent qualify following the Effective Time as
incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code to the extent
the Company Options qualified as incentive stock options immediately prior to
the Effective Time.   (e) STOCK SUBJECT TO REPURCHASE. All shares of Parent
Common which are issued in the Merger in exchange for shares of Company
Common which, under applicable stock purchase, stock restriction, or similar
agreements with the Company, are unvested or subject to a repurchase option
or other condition of forfeiture that by its terms does not terminate due to
the Merger ("COMPANY RESTRICTED STOCK"), will also be unvested or subject to
the same repurchase option or other condition, as the case may be, and the
certificates evidencing such shares will be marked with an appropriate
legend.   (f) CAPITAL STOCK OF MERGER SUB. Each share of common stock
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and exchanged for one validly issued, fully paid,
and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of the
Surviving Corporation. Each stock certificate of Merger Sub evidencing
ownership of any such shares shall continue to evidence ownership of such
shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.   (g) ADJUSTMENTS TO
EXCHANGE RATIOS. The Exchange Ratios shall be adjusted, as appropriate, to
reflect fully the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock
dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible
into Parent Common or Company Capital Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, or other like change with respect to Parent Common or
Company Capital Stock occurring after the date hereof and prior to
the Effective Time. Subject to the requirements of the first sentence of
this Section 1.6(g), no change in the outstanding shares of Company Common or
Company Preferred or option or similar right to acquire shares of Company
Capital Stock shall result in any increase in the Exchange Ratio.   (h)
FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Parent Common shall be issued, but
in lieu thereof, each holder of shares of Company Capital Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common
(after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common to be received by
such holder) shall be entitled to receive from Parent an amount of cash
equal to the product of (i) such fraction and (ii) the Parent Common
Price.   1.7 APPRAISAL RIGHTS.   (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, any shares of Company Capital Stock held by a
holder who has demanded and perfected appraisal rights for such shares in
accordance with Section 262 of Delaware Law or, to the extent applicable,
dissenters\' rights in accordance with Chapter 13 of California Law and who,
as of the Effective Time, has not effectively withdrawn or lost such
appraisal or dissenters\' rights ("DISSENTING SHARES"), shall not be
converted into or represent a right to receive Parent Common pursuant to
Section 1.6, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as
are granted by Delaware Law or California Law, as the case may require. From
and after the Effective Time, a holder of Dissenting Shares shall not
be    -6-   entitled to exercise any of the voting rights or other
rights of a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation.   (b) Notwithstanding
the provisions of subsection (a), if any holder of shares of Company Capital
Stock who either demands appraisal of such shares under Delaware Law or
exercises dissenters\' rights in accordance with Chapter 13 of California
Law, shall effectively withdraw or lose (through failure to perfect or
otherwise) the right to appraisal or dissent, as the case may require, then,
as of the later of the Effective Time and the occurrence of such event, such
holder\'s shares shall automatically be converted into and represent only the
right to receive Parent Common and cash in lieu of fractional shares as
provided in Section 1.6, as the case may be, without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the certificate representing such shares of Company
Capital Stock.   (c) The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Capital Stock or
exercise of dissenters\' rights with respect to such shares, withdrawals of
such demands or exercises, and any other instruments served pursuant to
Delaware Law or California Law and received by the Company and (ii) the
opportunity to manage and direct in all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to demands for appraisal under Delaware Law or the exercise of
dissenters\' rights under California Law. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, (i) voluntarily make any payment with
respect to any demands for appraisal of or the exercise of dissenters\'
rights with respect to capital stock of the Company or (ii) offer to settle
or settle any such demands or exercises.   1.8 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.  
(a) EXCHANGE AGENT. Mellon Investor Services LLC shall act as exchange agent
(the "EXCHANGE AGENT") in the Merger.   (b) PARENT TO PROVIDE COMMON STOCK.
As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available
to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, through
such reasonable procedures as Parent may adopt, the aggregate number of
shares of Parent Common issuable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) and the aggregate
cash payment owing pursuant to Section 1.6(h) in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, on behalf of the
holders of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time, and
pursuant to Article VII hereof, Parent shall deposit into an escrow account a
number of shares of Parent Common equal to the Escrow Amount out of the
aggregate number of shares of Parent Common otherwise issuable pursuant to
Section 1.6. The portion of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each
holder of Company Capital Stock shall be in proportion to the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common which such holder would otherwise be
entitled to receive under Section 1.6 by virtue of ownership of outstanding
shares of Company Capital Stock immediately prior to the Effective Time.  
(c) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock (the   
-7-   "CERTIFICATES") whose shares were converted into the right to receive
shares of Parent Common pursuant to Section 1.6, (i) a letter of transmittal
(which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates
to the Exchange Agent, and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as necessary to effect the intent of this Agreement as Parent may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of
Parent Common. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by
Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto and subject to the
requirements and restrictions of any other agreement between Parent and any
holder of Company Capital Stock on or before the Effective Time, the holder
of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a
certificate representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common (less
the number of shares of Parent Common to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on
such holder\'s behalf pursuant to Article VII hereof), plus cash in lieu of
fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(h), to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to Section 1.6, and the Certificate so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, and
subject to and in accordance with the provisions of Article VII hereof,
Parent shall cause to be distributed to the Escrow Agent (as defined in
Article VII) a certificate or certificates representing that number of shares
of Parent Common equal to the Escrow Amount, which shares shall be registered
in the name of the Escrow Agent. Such shares shall be beneficially owned by
the holders on whose behalf such shares were deposited in the Escrow Fund and
shall be available to compensate Parent as provided in Article VII. Until so
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 1.8, each outstanding Certificate
that, immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented shares of Company
Capital Stock will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all
corporate purposes, to evidence the ownership of the number of full shares of
Parent Common into which such shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been
so converted pursuant to this Agreement and Delaware Law and the right to
receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.6(h).   (d) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO
UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends or other distributions declared or made
after the Effective Time with respect to Parent Common with a record date
after the Effective Time will be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered
Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common represented thereby
until the holder of record of such Certificate shall surrender such
Certificate. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such
Certificate, there shall be paid to the record holder of the certificates
representing whole shares of Parent Common issued in exchange therefor,
without interest, at the time of such surrender, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common.   (e) TRANSFERS OF
OWNERSHIP. If any certificate for shares of Parent Common is to be issued in
a name other than that in which the certificate surrendered in exchange
therefor is registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that
the certificate so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise in
proper form for transfer and that the person requesting such exchange (i)
will demonstrate to Parent\'s reasonable satisfaction that such transfer was
made in compliance with applicable securities laws and (ii) will have paid to
Parent or any agent designated    -8-    by it any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for shares of
Parent Common in any name other than that of the registered holder of the
certificate surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any
agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is not payable.   (f)
NO LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.8,
none of the Exchange Agent, the Surviving Corporation, or any party hereto
shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common or Company

the holder thereof, such shares of Parent Common and cash for
fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that either of Parent or the Exchange Agent may, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance thereof, require the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed certificates to deliver a bond in

be made against Parent or the Exchange Agent with respect to the certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen, or destroyed.   1.11 TAX AND ACCOUNTING
CONSEQUENCES. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall (i)

treatment as a purchase transaction.   1.12 TAKING OF NECESSARY ACTION;
FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any such further
action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement
and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession

Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of the Company and Merger
Sub shall be fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action.   
-9-     ARTICLE II   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY  
The Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject
to such exceptions as are specifically disclosed in the disclosure letter and
schedules delivered thereto, each such disclosure referencing the appropriate
section number(s) of this Agreement as to which an exception exists, supplied
by the Company to Parent and dated as of the date hereof (the
"COMPANY SCHEDULES"), as follows:   2.1 ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY. The
Company is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware, and each Subsidiary (as
defined in Section 2.3) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing,
and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation. The
Company and each Subsidiary has all requisite corporate power to own, lease,
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted and as currently proposed to be conducted. The Company and each
Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which the failure
to be so qualified could have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined
in Section 9.3 below) on the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be.
The Company has delivered to counsel for Parent a true and correct copy of
its Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation (the "RESTATED
CERTIFICATE") and its Bylaws, each as amended to date.   2.2 COMPANY
CAPITAL STRUCTURE.   (a) The authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 50,000,000 shares of Company Common and 18,126,650 shares of
Company Preferred, of which 3,055,000 shares have been designated Series A
Preferred Stock; of which 1,976,469 shares have been designated Series B
Preferred Stock; of which 2,055,760 shares have been designated Series C
Preferred Stock; of which 1,187,575 shares have been designated Series D
Preferred Stock; of which 2,051,846 shares have been designated Series E
Preferred Stock; and of which 7,800,000 shares have been designated Series F
Preferred Stock. As of the date of this Agreement, the Company has issued and
outstanding 10,536,685 shares of Company Common, 3,055,000 shares of Series A
Preferred, 1,976,469 shares of Series B Preferred, 1,954,937 shares of Series
C Preferred, 1,187,575 shares of Series D Preferred, 2,031,846 shares of
Series E Preferred, and 7,751,937 shares of Series F Preferred. In addition,
71,666 shares of the Company Common are reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding warrants to purchase Company Common; 100,823 shares
of Series C Preferred are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of
outstanding warrants to purchase Series C Preferred; 20,000 shares of Series
E Preferred are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding
warrants to purchase Series E Preferred; and 47,000 shares of Series F
Preferred are reserved for issuance upon the exercise of outstanding
warrants to purchase Series F Preferred (each individually, a "WARRANT" and
collectively, the "WARRANTS"). All outstanding shares of Company Capital
Stock are, and any shares of Company Capital Stock issuable upon exercise of
any outstanding options, warrants, conversion rights, or other rights, will
be, duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid, and non-assessable and not
subject to any preemptive rights created by statute, the Restated
Certificate,    -10-   or any agreement to which the Company is a party
or by which the Company is bound. All outstanding Company Capital Stock and
all other outstanding securities of the Company have been issued in
compliance with all applicable federal and state securities laws. Each
outstanding share of Company Preferred is currently convertible into the
number of shares of Company Common set forth in Schedule 2.2. Schedule 2.2(a)
sets forth a complete and accurate list of all issued and outstanding shares
of Company Capital Stock and each outstanding Warrant, identifying the name
and last known address of the registered holder thereof and the acquisition
date. Of the outstanding shares of Company Common, 3,408,765 shares
constitute Company Restricted Stock that are subject to a right of repurchase
or other risk of forfeiture. Schedule 2.2(a) separately identifies all
outstanding Company Common that is Company Restricted Stock, describes
the applicable vesting terms, specifies the number of shares vested as of the
date of this Agreement, and indicates the extent, if any, to which the
repurchase option or similar vesting term will be accelerated by the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (b) The Company has reserved
11,840,000 shares of Company Common for issuance to employees, directors and
consultants pursuant to the Option Plan, of which 7,361,685 shares have been
issued upon exercise of Company Options and are reflected as outstanding
Company Common in Section 2.2(a) above; of which Company Options to acquire
3,542,240 shares of Company Common are outstanding and unexercised; and of
which 3,646,939 shares remain available for future grants under the Option
Plan. Schedule 2.2(b) sets forth in chronological order for each outstanding
Company Option the name of the holder of such option or right, the last known
address of such holder, an indication of whether such holder is an employee
of or consultant to the Company, the status of the option as either an
incentive stock option under Section 422 of the Code or a nonstatutory stock
option, the date of grant or issuance of such option or right, the number or
amount of securities as to which such option or right is exercisable, the
exercise price of such option or right and the vesting schedule for such
option or right, including the extent vested to the date of this Agreement
and an indication of the extent, if any, to which the exercisability of such
option or right will be accelerated and become exercisable by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.   (c) Except as set forth
in Schedules 2.2(a) and 2.2(b) and except for conversion rights of the
Company Preferred, the Company has no commitment or obligation of any
character, either firm or conditional, written or oral, to issue, deliver or
sell, or repurchase or redeem, or cause to be issued, delivered, sold,
repurchased or redeemed, under offers, stock option agreements, stock bonus
agreements, stock purchase plans, incentive compensation plans, warrants,
calls, conversion rights, or otherwise, any shares of the capital stock or
other securities of the Company. There are no voting trusts or
other agreements or understandings to which the Company is a party with
respect to the shares of capital stock of the Company. Except as set forth in
Schedules 2.2(a) and 2.2(b), there are no securities of the Company issued,
reserved for issuance, or outstanding. Other than the Option Plan, the
Company has never adopted or maintained any stock option plan, stock purchase
plan, or similar plan providing for the equity compensation of any person.
There are no (and have never been any) outstanding or authorized stock
appreciation, phantom stock, profit participation, or other similar rights
with respect to the Company. No repricing of options or stock purchase rights
or similar program to effectively reduce the exercise price of an option or
purchase price of a stock    -11-   purchase right has occurred since
the date of the Company\'s incorporation, nor does there exist any stock
option, stock grant or other equity incentive arrangement with any employee,
officer or consultant of the Company which is required to be accounted for
under variable plan accounting.   (d) As a result of the Merger, Parent will
be the record and sole beneficial owner of all outstanding shares of the
Company\'s capital stock and indirectly (through the Surviving Corporation as
the record holder) all the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Subsidiaries and all rights to acquire or receive such capital stock of the
Company and the Subsidiaries. At or before the Effective Time, any rights of
any holder or prospective holder of the Company\'s securities to cause such
securities to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"SECURITIES ACT"), and any information rights, voting rights, rights of co-
sale, rights to maintain equity percentage, rights of first refusal and the
like that may exist for the benefit of any such holder or prospective holder
shall have been terminated.   2.3 SUBSIDIARIES. Other than the Subsidiaries
(as defined herein), neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has, and neither
the Company nor any Subsidiary has ever had, any subsidiaries or affiliated
companies and does not otherwise own, and has never otherwise owned, any
equity, debt, or other ownership interest in, and does not control and has
never controlled, directly or indirectly, any other corporation, partnership,
limited liability company, joint venture business trust or association, or
other entity. Schedule 2.3 sets forth a complete and accurate list of each
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, business
trust or association, or other entity in which the Company, directly or
indirectly, holds an equity or similar ownership interest (each, a
"SUBSIDIARY" and collectively, the "SUBSIDIARIES"). Schedule 2.3 identifies,
for each Subsidiary, the issued and outstanding capital stock, the identity
and address of each holder of the issued and outstanding capital stock of
such Subsidiary, and the number of shares of capital stock of such Subsidiary
held by such holder. Except as set forth in Schedule 2.3, all of the
outstanding shares of the capital stock of each Subsidiary have been
duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable, and are
wholly owned by the Company, free and clear of any Lien (as defined in
Section 2.11). There are no options, warrants, calls, rights, commitments or
agreements of any character, written or oral, to which any Subsidiary is a
party or by which any Subsidiary is bound, obligating such Subsidiary to
issue, deliver, sell, repurchase, or redeem, or cause to be issued,
delivered, sold, repurchased or redeemed, any shares of such Subsidiary\'s
capital stock.   2.4 AUTHORITY. The Company has all requisite corporate
power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the
Company, subject only to the approval of the Merger and this Agreement by the
Company\'s stockholders as contemplated by Section 5.2. The vote required of
the Company\'s stockholders to duly approve the Merger and this Agreement is
that number of shares as would constitute a majority of the outstanding
shares of (a) the Company Common and the Company Preferred, voting together
as a single class, and (b) the Company Preferred voting separately as a
single class (in each case with each share of Company Preferred being
entitled to a number of votes equal to the number of whole shares of Company
Common into which such share of Company Preferred could be converted on the
record date for the    -12-   vote). Holders of the requisite number of
shares of Company Capital Stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the
Merger have executed and delivered Voting Agreements in the form attached
hereto as EXHIBIT B. The Company\'s Board of Directors has unanimously
approved the Merger and this Agreement. This Agreement has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and constitutes the valid and binding obligation
of the Company, enforceable in accordance with its terms.   2.5 NO
CONFLICT. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not,
and as of the Effective Time, the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of,
or default under (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both), or give
rise to a right of termination, cancellation, or acceleration of any
obligation or loss of any benefit under (any such event, a "CONFLICT")
(i) any provision of the Restated Certificate or the Company\'s Bylaws or the
similar constituent documents of any Subsidiary or (ii) any mortgage,
indenture, lease, contract or other agreement or instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, decree, statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to the Company or any Subsidiary or
their respective properties or assets.   2.6 CONSENTS. No consent, waiver,
approval, order or authorization of, or registration, declaration or filing
with, any court, administrative agency or commission or other federal, state,
county, local or foreign governmental authority, instrumentality, agency or
commission ("GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY") is required by or with respect to the
Company or any Subsidiary in connection with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
except for (i) the filing of the Merger Certificate with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware; (ii) the pre-merger notification and waiting
period requirements (the "HSR APPROVAL") of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust
Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR ACT"); (iii) such consents,
waivers, filings, approvals, and registrations as may be required under
applicable federal and state securities laws (including the filing with the
California Department of Corporations seeking the 3(a)(10) Permit as
contemplated by Section 5.1(b)); and (iv) such other consents, waivers,
authorizations, filings, approvals and registrations as are set forth on
Schedule 2.6.   2.7 COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Schedule 2.7 sets forth
true and correct copies of (i) the Company\'s audited, consolidated balance
sheets as of March 31, 2000 and March 31, 1999 and the related audited,
consolidated statements of income and cash-flows for the respective twelve-
month periods then ended (the "COMPANY YEAR-END FINANCIALS") and (ii) the
Company\'s unaudited, consolidated balance sheet as of February 15, 2001 and
the related unaudited, consolidated statements of income and cash-flows for
the period beginning April 1, 2000 and ending February 15, 2001 (the "COMPANY
INTERIM FINANCIALS"). The Company Year-End Financials and the Company Interim
Financials are collectively referred to herein as the "COMPANY FINANCIALS."
The Company Financials are complete and correct in all material respects and
have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles in the United States ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods indicated, and consistent with each other, except for
the absence of footnotes in the case of the Company Interim Financials. The
Company Financials present fairly the consolidated financial condition and
consolidated operating results of the Company    -13-   and the
Subsidiaries as of the respective dates and for the periods
indicated therein, subject in the case of the unaudited financial statements
to normal year-end adjustments, which will not in any event be material. The
Company\'s unaudited, consolidated Balance Sheet as of February 15, 2001 is
referred to herein as the "COMPANY BALANCE SHEET."   2.8 NO UNDISCLOSED
LIABILITIES. Neither of the Company nor any Subsidiary has any liabilities
(absolute, accrued, contingent or otherwise), except (i) liabilities provided
for in Company Balance Sheet and (ii) liabilities incurred since February 15,
2001 in the ordinary and usual course of business, consistent with past
practice. None of the liabilities described in the foregoing sections (i) or
(ii) could reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and the Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.   2.9 ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE. All accounts receivable shown on the
Company Balance Sheet (net of reserves and deferred revenue balances
indicated on the Company Balance Sheet) or thereafter acquired until the
Effective Time (net of reserves and deferred revenue balances accrued in the

collectible in the ordinary course of business, except that the value of any
account receivable, the collection of which is doubtful or which is subject
to a defense or set-off, has been written down to an amount not in excess of
net realizable value or adequate reserves or allowances therefor have been
provided. None of the receivables of the Company or any Subsidiary is subject
to any claim of offset, recoupment, set-off, or counterclaim, and, to the
knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or circumstances (whether
asserted or unasserted) that would give rise to any such claim. No person or
entity has any lien, charge, pledge, security interest, or other encumbrance
on any such receivables, and no agreement for deduction or discount has been
made with respect to any of such receivables.   2.10 BUSINESS CHANGES.

RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. There is no agreement (noncompetition,

practice of the Company or any Subsidiary, any acquisition of property
(tangible or intangible) by the    -19-   Company or any Subsidiary or
the conduct of business by the Company or any Subsidiary. Without limiting
the foregoing, neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has entered into any
agreement under which the Company or any Subsidiary (i) is restricted from
selling, licensing or otherwise distributing any of its products or services
to any class of customers, in any geographic area, during any period of time

effective in accordance with their respective terms, and there is not, under
any of such leases, any existing default or event of default (or event which
with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default by (i) the
Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may require, or (ii) to the knowledge
of the Company, any other party to such leases). Neither the operations of
the Company or any Subsidiary on such real property, nor such real property,
including improvements thereon, violate any applicable building code, zoning
requirement, or classification, or pollution control ordinance or statute
relating to the particular property or such operations, where such violation
could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company
or such Subsidiary, and such non-violation is not dependent, in any instance,
on so-called non-conforming use exceptions.   (b) The Company and each
Subsidiary holds good and valid title to, or, in the case of leased
properties and assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its tangible
properties and assets, real, personal and mixed, used or held for use in its
business, free and clear of any Liens, except as reflected in the Company
Financials and except for Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable and such
imperfections of title and encumbrances, if any, which are not material in
character, amount or extent, and which do not materially detract from
the value, or materially interfere with the present use, of the property
subject thereto or affected thereby.   (c) Schedule 2.13(c) lists all items
of equipment (the "EQUIPMENT") owned or leased by the Company and the
Subsidiaries, except individual pieces of equipment with an individual value

normal wear and tear, and reasonably fit and usable for the purposes for
which they are being used.   (d) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has

or equivalent authority anywhere in the world) related to any of the Company
Registered Intellectual Property Rights or Company Intellectual Property.  
(c) Each item of Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights is valid and
subsisting, and all necessary registration, maintenance and renewal fees in
connection with such Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights have
been paid and all necessary documents and certificates in connection
with such Company Registered Intellectual Property Rights have been filed

Date, including the payment of any registration, maintenance or renewal fees
or the filing of any responses to PTO office actions, documents, applications
or certificates for the purposes of obtaining, maintaining, perfecting or
preserving or renewing any Registered Intellectual Property Rights. In each

such Subsidiary has obtained a valid and enforceable assignment sufficient to
irrevocably transfer all rights in such Technology and the associated
Intellectual Property Rights (including the right to seek past and future
damages with respect thereto) to the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case
may require. To the maximum extent provided for by, and in accordance with,
applicable laws and regulations, the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable,
has recorded each such assignment of a Registered Intellectual Property Right
assigned to the Company or a Subsidiary, as applicable, with the relevant
Governmental Entity, including the PTO, the U.S. Copyright Office, or their
respective equivalents in any relevant foreign jurisdiction, as the case may
be. Except as set forth on Schedule 2.14(c), neither the Company nor any
Subsidiary has claimed a particular status, including "Small Business
Status," in the application for any Intellectual Property Rights, which claim
of status was not at the time made, or which has since become, inaccurate or
false or that will no longer be true and accurate as a result of the
Closing.    -22-    (d) The Company has no knowledge of any facts or
circumstances that would render any Company Intellectual Property invalid or
unenforceable. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company knows of no
information, materials, facts or circumstances, including any information or
fact that would constitute prior art, that would render any of the Company
Registered Intellectual Property Rights invalid or unenforceable, or would
adversely affect any pending application for any Company Registered
Intellectual Property Right, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has
misrepresented, or failed to disclose, and has no knowledge of any
misrepresentation or failure to disclose, any fact or circumstances in any
application for any Company Registered Intellectual Property Right that would
constitute fraud or a misrepresentation with respect to such application or
that would otherwise affect the validity or enforceability of any Company
Registered Intellectual Property Right.   (e) Each item of Company
Intellectual Property is free and clear of any Liens except for non-exclusive
licenses granted to end-user customers in the ordinary course of business.
The Company or a Subsidiary is the exclusive owner or exclusive licensee of
all Company Intellectual Property.   (f) All Company Intellectual Property
will be fully transferable, alienable or licensable by Surviving Corporation
and/or Parent without restriction and without payment of any kind to any
third party.   (g) To the extent that any Company Technology has been
developed or created by a third party for the Company or a Subsidiary, the
Company or such Subsidiary has a written agreement with such third party with
respect thereto, and the Company or such Subsidiary thereby either (i) has
obtained ownership of, and is the exclusive owner of, or (ii) has obtained a
license (sufficient for the conduct of its business as currently conducted
and as proposed to be conducted) to, all such third party\'s Intellectual
Property Rights in such Technology by operation of law or by valid
assignment, to the fullest extent it is legally possible to do so.   (h)
Except for "shrink-wrap" or similar Commercial Software Rights, all
Technology used in or necessary to the conduct of the business of the Company
or any Subsidiary as presently conducted or currently contemplated to be
conducted by the Company or such Subsidiary was written and created solely by
either (i) employees of the Company or such Subsidiary acting within
the scope of their employment or (ii) by third parties who have validly
and irrevocably assigned all of their rights, including Intellectual Property
Rights therein, to the Company or such Subsidiary, and no third party owns or
has any rights to any of the Company Intellectual Property.   (i) All
employees of the Company and each Subsidiary have entered into a valid and
binding written agreement with the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case
may be, sufficient to vest title in the Company or such Subsidiary of all
Technology, including all accompanying Intellectual Property Rights, created
by such employee in the scope of his or her employment with the Company or
such Subsidiary.   (j) The Company and each Subsidiary have taken all steps
that are reasonably required to protect their respective rights in
confidential information and trade secrets of the    -23-   Company or
such Subsidiary or provided by any other person to the Company or such
Subsidiary. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and each
Subsidiary has, and enforces, a policy requiring each employee, consultant
and contractor to execute a proprietary information, confidentiality and
assignment agreement, substantially in the form(s) attached hereto as
Schedule 2.14(j), and all current and former employees, consultants and
contractors of the Company and each Subsidiary have executed such an
agreement.   (k) No person who has licensed Technology or Intellectual
Property Rights to the Company or a Subsidiary has ownership rights or
license rights to improvements made by the Company or such Subsidiary in such
Technology or Intellectual Property Rights.   (l) Neither the Company nor
any Subsidiary has transferred ownership of, or granted any exclusive license
of or right to use, or authorized the retention of any exclusive rights to
use or joint ownership of, any Technology or Intellectual Property Right that
is or was Company Intellectual Property, to any other person.   (m) Other

(the "FORM LICENSE"), the contracts, licenses and agreements listed on
Schedule 2.14(m) list all contracts, licenses and agreements to which the
Company or any Subsidiary is a party with respect to any Technology
or Intellectual Property Rights. Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary is
in breach of or has failed to perform under, any of the foregoing
contracts, licenses or agreements and, to the Company\'s knowledge, no other
party to any such contract, license or agreement is in breach thereof or has
failed to perform thereunder.   (n) Other than the standard indemnities and
warranties set forth in the Form License, and subject to such reasonable
variations therein that are not individually materially adverse to the
Company, Schedule 2.14(n) lists all contracts, licenses and agreements
between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other person wherein or whereby
the Company or any Subsidiary has agreed to, or assumed, any obligation or
duty to warrant, indemnify, reimburse, hold harmless, guaranty or otherwise
assume or incur any obligation or liability or provide a right of rescission
with respect to the infringement or misappropriation by the Company or such
Subsidiary or such other person of the Intellectual Property Rights of any
person other than the Company or a Subsidiary.   (o) There are no contracts,
licenses or agreements between the Company or any Subsidiary and any other
person with respect to Company Intellectual Property under which there is, to
the Company\'s knowledge, any dispute regarding the scope of such agreement,
or performance under such agreement, including with respect to any payments
to be made or received by the Company or any Subsidiary thereunder.   (p)

currently conducted or as contemplated to be conducted by the Company or such
Subsidiary, including but not limited to the design, development, use,
import, branding, advertising, promotion, marketing, manufacture and sale of
the products, technology or services (including products,

or such Subsidiary, does not, will not, and will not when conducted by Parent
and/or Surviving Corporation in substantially the same manner following the
Closing, infringe or misappropriate any Intellectual Property Right of any
person, violate any right of any person (including any right to privacy or
publicity) or constitute unfair competition or trade practices under the laws
of any jurisdiction, and neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has received
notice from any person claiming that such operation or any act, product,
technology or service (including products, technology or services currently
under development) of the Company or such Subsidiary infringes or
misappropriates any Intellectual Property Right of any person or constitutes
unfair competition or trade practices under the laws of any jurisdiction (nor
does the Company or such Subsidiary have knowledge of any basis
therefor).   (q) To the Company\'s knowledge, no person is infringing
or misappropriating any Company Intellectual Property Right.   (r) No
Company Intellectual Property or service of the Company or any Subsidiary is
subject to any proceeding or outstanding decree, order, judgment or
settlement agreement or stipulation that restricts in any manner the use,
transfer or licensing thereof by the Company or any Subsidiary or may affect
the validity, use or enforceability of such Company
Intellectual Property.   (s) No (i) product, technology, service, or
publication of the Company or any Subsidiary, (ii) material published or
distributed by the Company or any Subsidiary, or (iii) conduct or statement
of the Company or any Subsidiary constitutes a defamatory statement or
material or false advertising or otherwise violates in any material respect
any law or regulation.   (t) The Company Intellectual Property constitutes
all the Technology and Intellectual Property Rights used in and/or necessary
to the conduct of the businesses of the Company and the Subsidiaries as they
currently are conducted, and as they are currently planned or contemplated to
be conducted by the Company and the Subsidiaries, including, without
limitation, the design, development, manufacture, use, import and sale of
products, technology and performance of services (including products,
technology or services currently under development).   (u) Neither this
Agreement nor the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the
assignment to Parent, the Surviving Corporation, or any Subsidiary, by
operation of law or otherwise, of any contracts or agreements to which the
Company or a Subsidiary is a party, will result in (i) either Parent\'s, the
Surviving Corporation\'s, or any Subsidiary\'s granting to any third party
any right to or with respect to any Technology or Intellectual Property Right
owned by, or licensed to, either of them, (ii) either Parent\'s, the
Surviving Corporation\'s, or any Subsidiary\'s being bound by, or subject
to, any non-compete or other restriction on the operation or scope of
their respective businesses, or (iii) either Parent\'s, the Surviving
Corporation\'s, or any Subsidiary\'s being obligated to pay any royalties or
other amounts to any third party in excess of those payable by Parent, the
Company, or a Subsidiary, respectively, prior to the Closing.   
-25-    (v) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has breached
or violated the terms of any license, sublicense, or other agreement relating
to any Commercial Software Rights, and the Company or a Subsidiary, as the
case may require, has a valid right to use such Commercial Software Rights
under such licenses and agreements. The Company and each Subsidiary are not
and will not be as a result of the execution and delivery of this Agreement
or the performance of the Company\'s obligations hereunder, in violation of
any license, sublicense, or agreement relating to Commercial Software Rights.
No claims with respect to Commercial Software Rights have been asserted or,
to the knowledge of the Company, are threatened by any person against the
Company or a Subsidiary in connection with any Commercial Software Right. To
the knowledge of the Company, there is no material unauthorized use,
infringement, or misappropriation of any Commercial Software Right by the

agreement restricting in any matter the use thereof by the Company or any
Subsidiary.   2.15 PRODUCT WARRANTIES; DEFECTS; LIABILITIES. Each product

claim or demand against the Company or any Subsidiary giving rise to any
liability or obligation) for replacement or repair thereof or other damages
in connection therewith. No Company Product is subject to any guaranty,

governmental consent, license, permit, grant, or other authorization issued
to the Company or any Subsidiary (i) pursuant to which the Company or any
Subsidiary currently operates or holds any interest in any of its properties
or (ii) which is required for the operation of its business or the holding of
any such interest (collectively, the "COMPANY AUTHORIZATIONS"), which Company
Authorizations are in full force and effect. The Company or such Subsidiary,
as the case may require, is in material compliance with the terms of each of
the Company Authorizations.   2.20 LITIGATION. There is no claim, dispute,
action, suit or appeal, or proceeding of any nature pending or, to the

capacities as such), nor, to the knowledge of the Company, is there any
reasonable basis therefor or threat thereof. To the knowledge of the Company,
there is no investigation pending or threatened against the Company or any
Subsidiary, their properties or any of their officers, directors or employees
(in their capacities as such) by or before any Governmental Entity. Neither

PREPARATION OF INFORMATION STATEMENT AND SECTION 3(A)(10) PERMIT.   (a)
PREPARATION OF INFORMATION STATEMENT. As promptly as practicable after the
date of this Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare an Information
Statement (the "INFORMATION STATEMENT") to be distributed to stockholders of
the Company in connection with the solicitation of their consent to the
adoption and approval of this Agreement, the Merger, and the transactions
contemplated hereby. In addition, the Information Statement may be filed with
the Commissioner (as defined below) in connection with the 3(a)(10) Permit
or, alternatively, with the SEC as part of the S-4 Registration Statement (as
defined below). Parent and the Company shall each use its
commercially reasonable best efforts to cause the Information Statement to
comply with the applicable requirements of federal and state securities law
(including, without limitation, all applicable requirements under the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC
thereunder in the event Parent elects to file the S-4 Registration
Statement). Each of Parent and the Company agrees to provide promptly to the
other such information concerning its business and financial statements and
affairs as, in the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel,
may be required or appropriate for inclusion in the Information Statement or
the S-4 Registration Statement, as the case may require, or in any amendments
or supplements thereto, and to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate
with the other\'s counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Information
Statement or the S-4 Registration Statement, as the case may require. The
Company will promptly advise Parent, and Parent will promptly advise the
Company, in writing if at any time prior to the Effective Time either the
Company or Parent shall obtain knowledge of any facts that might make it
necessary or appropriate to amend or supplement the Information Statement or
the S-4 Registration Statement, as the case may require, in order to make the
statements contained or incorporated by reference therein not misleading or
to comply with applicable law. The Information Statement or the S-4
Registration Statement, as the case may require, shall contain (i)
the unanimous recommendation of the Board of Directors of the Company that
the Company\'s stockholders adopt and approve this Agreement, the Merger, and
the other transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) the written opinion of
Deutsche Banc Alex. Brown, Inc., dated as of the date of this Agreement, to
the effect that, as of such date, the Merger Consideration was fair to the
stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Agreement, the    -42-   Company shall not
include in the Information Statement any information with respect to Parent
or its affiliates or associates, the form and content of which information
shall not have been approved by Parent prior to such inclusion.   (b)
SECTION 3(a)(10) PERMIT: As soon as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement, Parent, with the cooperation of the Company,
shall prepare the necessary documentation to seek a permit (a
"3(a)(10) PERMIT") from the Commissioner (the "COMMISSIONER") of the
Department of Corporations of the State of California (after a hearing before
such Department) pursuant to Section 25121 of the California Corporate
Securities Law of 1968, as amended, such that the issuance of Parent Common
in the Merger shall be exempt from registration under Section 3(a)(10) of the
Securities Act. After filing with the Commission as part of the application
(the "PERMIT APPLICATION") seeking the 3(a)(10) Permit, no amendment or
supplement to the Information Statement shall be made without the approval of
Parent and Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.   (c) S-4 REGISTRATION STATEMENT. Notwithstanding Section
5.1(b) above, in the event the 3(a)(10) Permit is not or cannot be obtained,
or Parent believes the 3(a)(10) Permit is not likely to be obtained, Parent
may elect to register the shares of Parent Common to be issued in connection
with the Merger under the Securities Act. In such event, Parent shall file
with the SEC, with the Company\'s cooperation and assistance, a document or
documents that will constitute (i) a Registration Statement on Form S-4 under
the Securities Act, (ii) such information similar to that set forth in the
Information Statement as may be required to comply with the Securities Act
and the rules and regulations thereunder, and (iii) a prospectus relating to
the shares of Parent Common (collectively, the "S-4 REGISTRATION STATEMENT").
Parent or Company, as the case may require, shall furnish all information
concerning Parent or Company as the other party may reasonably request in
connection with such actions and the preparation of the S-4 Registration
Statement. In the event the S-4 Registration Statement is filed, each of
Parent and Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the
S-4 Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable
after filing. Each of Parent and the Company shall cause the S-4 Registration
Statement to comply as to form and substance with respect to such party in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of (i) the Exchange
Act, (ii) the Securities Act, (iii) the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq
National Market.   (d) SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE; STOCKHOLDER SOLICITATION.
The parties hereto shall take all action required under any applicable laws
in connection with the issuance of shares of Parent Common pursuant to the
Merger and shall refrain from taking any action which would prevent, delay,
or hinder the issuance of the 3(a)(10) Permit or the effectiveness of the S-4
Registration Statement. Not later than one business day after the issuance of
the 3(a)(10) Permit, or the effective date of the S-4 Registration Statement,
as applicable, the Company shall cause the Information Statement and any
related consents and other materials to be mailed in compliance with
applicable laws to the stockholders of the Company in connection with the
solicitation of their consent in favor of this Agreement, the Merger, and the
transactions contemplated hereby.    -43-    5.2 STOCKHOLDER APPROVAL.
The Company shall promptly after the date hereof take all action reasonably
necessary in accordance with Delaware Law, California Law, and the Company\'s
Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws to obtain the approval by the

personnel (subject to restrictions imposed by applicable law) of the Company
as Parent may reasonably request. The Company agrees to provide Parent and
its accountants, legal counsel, and other representatives copies of internal
financial statements promptly upon request. No information or knowledge
obtained in any investigation pursuant to this Section 5.3 shall affect or be
deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein or the
conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the Merger.

previously executed a Mutual Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of
January 16, 2001 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), which Confidentiality
Agreement will continue in full force and effect in accordance with its
terms.   5.5 PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. Unless otherwise required by law
(including, without limitation, applicable securities laws) or, as to Parent,
by the rules and regulations of the Nasdaq National Market, prior to the
Effective Time, no disclosure (whether or not in response to an inquiry) of
the subject matter of this Agreement shall be made by any party hereto unless
approved by Parent and the Company prior to release, provided that such
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.   5.6 CONSENTS. The Company
shall promptly apply for or otherwise seek and use its best efforts to
obtain, all consents and approvals required to be obtained by it for the
consummation of the Merger, including all consents, waivers, or approvals
under any of the agreements, contracts, licenses, or leases of the Company in
order to preserve the benefits thereunder for the Surviving Corporation and
otherwise in connection with the Merger. Such consents, waivers, and
approvals are set forth in Schedule 5.6 (the "CONTRACT CONSENTS"); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, Parent shall review such consents, waivers, and approvals promptly
after the execution of this Agreement. Following such review, Parent shall
determine those consents, waivers or approvals, if any, that are not, in
Parent\'s reasonable judgment, material to the Company or its business and
such consents, waivers or approvals shall no longer be deemed
"Contract Consents" for purposes of this Agreement.   5.7 AFFILIATE
AGREEMENTS. Schedule 5.7 sets forth those persons who are, in the Company\'s
reasonable judgment, "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule
145 (each such person a "Company Affiliate") promulgated under the Securities
Act ("Rule 145"). The Company shall provide Parent such information and
documents as Parent shall reasonably request    -44-   for purposes of
reviewing such list. The Company shall use its best efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to Parent, concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement (and in any case prior to the Effective Time) from each of
the Affiliates of the Company, an executed Affiliate Agreement in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit C. Parent shall be entitled to place appropriate
legends on the certificates evidencing any Parent Common to be received by
such Affiliates pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, and to issue
appropriate stop transfer instructions to the transfer agent for Parent
Common, consistent with the terms of such Affiliate Agreements.   5.8 LEGAL
CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER. Each of Parent, Merger Sub, and the Company will
take all reasonable actions necessary to comply promptly with all legal
requirements which may be imposed on such party with respect to the
Merger and will promptly cooperate with and furnish information to any other
party hereto in connection with any such requirements imposed upon such other
party in connection with the Merger. Each party will take all reasonable
actions to obtain (and will cooperate with the other parties in obtaining)
any consent, authorization, order or approval of, or any registration,

contemplated thereby or by this Agreement.   5.9 BEST EFFORTS; ADDITIONAL

notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event
which is likely to cause any representation or warranty of the Company and
Parent or Merger Sub, respectively, contained in this Agreement to be untrue

treatment.   5.12 FORM S-8. Parent shall file a Registration Statement on

the representations and warranties, and covenants and agreements of the

pursuant to Section 6.3(a), in each case as modified by the Company
Schedules, shall survive the Merger and shall continue for the period
following the Closing Date set forth in Section 7.2(a).   7.2 ESCROW
ARRANGEMENTS.   (a) ESCROW FUND. At the Effective Time, each holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock (each, a "COMPANY STOCKHOLDER" and
collectively, the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS") will be deemed to have received and
deposited with the Escrow Agent (as defined below) the Escrow Amount (plus
any additional shares as may be issued upon any stock split, stock dividend
or    -51-   recapitalization effected by Parent after the Effective
Time with respect to shares constituting the Escrow Amount), without any act
of any Company Stockholder. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
the Escrow Amount, without any act of any Company Stockholder, will be
deposited with U.S. Bank Trust National Association (or other institution
acceptable to Parent and the Securityholder Agent (as defined in Section
7.2(g) below)) as Escrow Agent (the "ESCROW AGENT"), such deposit to
constitute an escrow fund (the "ESCROW FUND") to be governed by the terms set
forth herein and to be maintained at Parent\'s cost and expense. The portion
of the Escrow Amount contributed on behalf of each Company Stockholder shall
be in proportion to the aggregate Parent Common to which such holder would
otherwise be entitled under Section 1.6(a) and shall be in the respective
amounts listed opposite each Company Stockholder\'s name listed in a schedule
to be executed by the Company and delivered to Parent at Closing (the "ESCROW
SCHEDULE"). No shares of Parent Common contributed to the Escrow Fund may be
unvested or subject to any right of repurchase, risk of forfeiture, or other
condition in favor of Parent or the Surviving Corporation; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that to the extent a Company Stockholder does not hold shares that are vested
or free of a right of repurchase, risk of forfeiture, or other condition, the
shares of Parent Common to be deposited in the Escrow Fund on behalf of
such Company Stockholder shall be the first shares of Parent Common scheduled
to vest or to be released from such rights, risks, or conditions. The Escrow
Fund shall be available to compensate Parent and its affiliates (including
the Surviving Corporation) for any claims, losses, liabilities, damages,
deficiencies, costs and expenses, including reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses, and expenses of investigation and defense (hereinafter individually
a "LOSS" and collectively "LOSSES") incurred by Parent, its officers,
directors, or affiliates (including the Surviving Corporation) directly or
indirectly as a result of (i) any inaccuracy or breach of a representation or
warranty of the Company contained herein (or in any certificate, instrument,
schedule or document delivered by the Company in connection with this
Agreement or the Merger) or (ii) any failure by the Company to perform or
comply with any covenant or agreement contained herein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that claims arising out of an inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty or any covenant or agreement of the Company contained in this
Agreement or in any certificate, instrument, schedule or document delivered
by the Company at the Closing in connection with this Agreement or the Merger
must be asserted on or before 5:00 p.m. (California Time) on the date that is
one year following the Closing Date (the "EXPIRATION DATE"). No portion of
the Escrow Amount shall be contributed in respect of any Company Options.
Except for Excess Third Party Expenses (as defined in Section 9.2), Parent
may not receive any shares from the Escrow Fund unless and until Officer\'s
Certificates (as defined in paragraph (d) below) identifying Losses, the
aggregate amount of which exceed $150,000, have been delivered to the
Escrow Agent as provided in paragraph (d), and either there is no objection
thereto or any objection has been resolved in accordance with the provisions
of this Article VII; in such case, Parent may recover from the Escrow Fund
all Losses, without regard to the $150,000 threshold, for which there is no
objection or any objection has been resolved in accordance with the
provisions of this Article VII.   (b) ESCROW PERIOD; DISTRIBUTION UPON
TERMINATION OF ESCROW Periods. Subject to the following requirements, the
Escrow Fund shall be in existence immediately following the Effective Time
and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m. (California Time) on the Expiration Date
(the "ESCROW PERIOD"). The date of commencement of the Escrow Period and the
Expiration Date shall    -52-   be certified to the Escrow Agent in a
certificate signed by Parent and the Securityholder Agent. Such amount (or
some portion thereof) that is necessary in the reasonable judgement of
Parent, subject to the objection of the Securityholder Agent and the
subsequent arbitration of the matter in the manner provided in Section 7.2(f)
hereof, to satisfy any unsatisfied claims concerning facts and circumstances
existing prior to the termination of the Escrow Period and as are specified
in an Officer\'s Certificate delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the
termination of such Escrow Period, may be retained in the Escrow Fund after
termination of the Escrow Period. As soon as any or all such claims have been
resolved as evidenced by the written memorandum of the Securityholder Agent
and Parent, the Escrow Agent shall deliver to the Company Stockholders
the remaining portion of the Escrow Fund that is not required to satisfy
such claims. If no Officer\'s Certificate pertaining to unsatisfied claims
is delivered to the Escrow Agent at or prior to the termination of the
Escrow Period, upon termination of the Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent,
without further authorization or instruction, shall promptly distribute the
remainder of the Escrow Fund to the Company Stockholders in accordance with
the provisions of this Section 7.2(b). Deliveries of Escrow Amounts to the
Company Stockholders pursuant to this Section 7.2(b) shall be made in
proportion to their respective original contributions to the Escrow Fund (as
set forth on the Escrow Schedule).   (c) PROTECTION OF ESCROW FUND.   (i)
The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Escrow Fund during the Escrow
Period, shall treat such fund as a trust fund in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement and not as the property of Parent or any Company Stockholder,
and shall hold and dispose of the Escrow Fund only in accordance with the
terms hereof.   (ii) Any shares of Parent Common or other equity securities
issued or distributed by Parent (including shares issued upon a stock split
or stock dividend) ("NEW SHARES") in respect of Parent Common in the Escrow
Fund which have not been released from the Escrow Fund shall be
deposited with the Escrow Agent and added to the Escrow Fund and become a
part thereof. New Shares issued in respect of shares of Parent Common which
have been released from the Escrow Fund shall not be added to the Escrow Fund
but shall be distributed to the record holders thereof. Cash dividends on
Parent Common shall not be added to the Escrow Fund but shall be distributed
to the record holders thereof.   (iii) Each Company Stockholder shall have
voting rights with respect to the shares of Parent Common contributed to the
Escrow Fund by such Company Stockholder (and on any voting securities and
other equity securities added to the Escrow Fund in respect of such shares of
Parent Common).   (d) CLAIMS UPON ESCROW FUND.   (i) Upon receipt by the
Escrow Agent at any time on or before 5:00 p.m. (California time) on the
Expiration Date of a certificate signed by any officer of Parent (an
"OFFICER\'S CERTIFICATE"): (A) stating that Parent has paid or properly
accrued or reasonably anticipates that it will have to pay or accrue Losses
and (B) specifying in reasonable detail the    -53-   individual items
of Losses included in the amount so stated, the date each such item was paid
or properly accrued, or the basis for such anticipated liability, and the
nature of the misrepresentation, breach of warranty or covenant to which such
item is related, the Escrow Agent shall, subject to the provisions of Section
7.2(e) hereof, deliver to Parent out of the Escrow Fund, as promptly
as practicable, shares of Parent Common held in the Escrow Fund in an amount
equal to such Losses.   (ii) For the purposes of determining the number
of shares of Parent Common to be delivered to Parent out of the Escrow
Fund pursuant to Section 7.2(d)(i) hereof, each share of Parent Common shall
be valued at the Parent Common Price.   (e) OBJECTIONS TO CLAIMS. At the
time of delivery of any Officer\'s Certificate to the Escrow Agent, a
duplicate copy of such certificate shall be delivered to the Securityholder
Agent and for a period of thirty (30) days after delivery of such Officer\'s
Certificate, the Escrow Agent shall make no delivery to Parent of any Escrow
Amounts pursuant to Section 7.2(d) hereof unless the Escrow Agent shall have
received written authorization from the Securityholder Agent to make such
delivery. After the expiration of such thirty (30) day period, the Escrow
Agent shall make delivery of shares of Parent Common from the Escrow Fund in
accordance with Section 7.2(d) hereof, provided that no such payment or
delivery may be made if the Securityholder Agent shall object in a written
statement to the claim made in the Officer\'s Certificate, and such statement
shall have been delivered to the Escrow Agent (with a copy to Parent) prior
to the expiration of such thirty (30) day period.   (f) RESOLUTION OF
CONFLICTS; ARBITRATION.   (i) In case the Securityholder Agent shall so
object in writing to any claim or claims made in any Officer\'s Certificate,
the Securityholder Agent and Parent shall attempt in good faith to agree upon
the rights of the respective parties with respect to each of such claims. If
the Securityholder Agent and Parent should so agree, a memorandum setting
forth such agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties and shall
be furnished to the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely
on any such memorandum and distribute shares of Parent Common from the Escrow
Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.   (ii) If no such agreement can
be reached after good faith negotiation, either Parent or the Securityholder
Agent may demand arbitration of the matter unless the amount of the damage or
loss is at issue in pending litigation with a third party, in which event
arbitration shall not be commenced until such amount is ascertained or both
parties agree to arbitration; and in either such event the matter shall be
settled by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Parent and the
Securityholder Agent shall each select one arbitrator, and the two
arbitrators so selected shall select a third arbitrator, each of which
arbitrators shall be independent and have at least ten years relevant
experience. The arbitrators shall set a limited time period and establish
procedures designed to reduce the cost and time for discovery while allowing
the parties an opportunity, adequate in the sole judgment of the arbitrators,
to discover relevant information from the opposing parties about the subject
matter of the dispute. The arbitrators shall rule upon motions to compel or
limit discovery and shall have the authority to impose sanctions, including
attorneys fees and costs, to the extent as a court of competent law
or equity, should the arbitrators determine that discovery was sought
without    -54-   substantial justification or that discovery was
refused or objected to without substantial justification. The decision of a
majority of the three arbitrators as to the validity and amount of any claim
in such Officer\'s Certificate shall be binding and conclusive upon the
parties to this Agreement, and notwithstanding anything in Section 7.2(e)
hereof, the Escrow Agent shall be entitled to act in accordance with such
decision and make or withhold payments out of the Escrow Fund in accordance
therewith. Such decision shall be written and shall be supported by written
findings of fact and conclusions which shall set forth the award, judgment,
decree or order awarded by the arbitrators.   (iii) Any such arbitration
shall be held in San Diego County, California and shall be conducted by, and
under the rules then in effect, of the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation
Services, Inc. For purposes of this Section 7.2(f), in any arbitration
hereunder in which any claim or the amount is at issue, Parent shall be
deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party in the event that the arbitrators award
Parent less than the sum of one-half (1/2) of the disputed amount plus any
amounts not in dispute; otherwise, the Company Stockholders as represented by
the Securityholder Agent shall be deemed to be the Non-Prevailing Party. The
Non-Prevailing Party to an arbitration shall pay its own expenses, the fees
of each arbitrator, the administrative costs of the arbitration, and the
expenses, including without limitation, reasonable attorneys\' fees and
costs, incurred by the other party to the arbitration. Judgment upon any
award rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having
jurisdiction. The Securityholder Agent may pay such amounts
contemplated under this Section 7.2(f)(iii) and Section 7.2(i)(ii) or other
amounts contemplated in this Section 7.2 (including without limitation
unreimbursed expenses of counsel for the Company Stockholders and Parent,
arbitrator fees and administrative costs) by distributing shares of Parent
Common from the Escrow Fund with respect to which Parent has not made a
claim; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no shares of Parent Common may be distributed
from the Escrow Fund prior to the termination of the Escrow Period and such
shares may be distributed only to the extent that such shares are not
required to satisfy any claim for Losses.   (g) SECURITYHOLDER AGENT OF THE
COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS; POWER OF ATTORNEY.   (i) In the event that the Merger
is approved, effective upon such vote, and without further act of any Company
Stockholder, Barry M. Ariko shall be appointed as agent and attorney-in-fact
(the "SECURITYHOLDER AGENT") for each Company Stockholder (except such
Company Stockholders, if any, as shall have perfected their appraisal rights
under Delaware Law or dissenters\' rights under California Law), for and on
behalf of the Company Stockholders, to give and receive notices and
communications, to authorize delivery to Parent of shares of Parent Common
from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by Parent, to object to such
deliveries, to agree to, negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises
of, and demand arbitration and comply with orders of courts and awards of
arbitrators with respect to such claims, and to take all actions necessary or
appropriate in the judgment of Securityholder Agent for the accomplishment of
the foregoing. Such agency may be changed by the Company Stockholders from
time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Parent and Escrow Agent; provided that the Securityholder Agent may not be
removed unless holders of a majority-in-interest of the Escrow Fund agree to
such removal and to the identity of the substituted agent. Any vacancy in the
position of Securityholder Agent may be    -55-   filled by approval of
the holders of a majority-in-interest of the Escrow Fund. No bond shall be
required of the Securityholder Agent, and the Securityholder Agent shall not
receive compensation for his or her services. Notices or communications to or
from the Securityholder Agent shall constitute notice to or from each of the
Company Stockholders.   (ii) The Securityholder Agent shall not be liable
for any act done or omitted hereunder as Securityholder Agent while acting in
good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment.   (h) ACTIONS OF THE
SECURITYHOLDER AGENT. A decision, act, consent, or instruction of the
Securityholder Agent shall constitute a decision of all the Company
Stockholders for whom a portion of the Escrow Amount otherwise issuable to
them is deposited in the Escrow Fund and shall be final, binding
and conclusive upon each of such Company Stockholders, and the Escrow Agent
and Parent may rely upon any such decision, act, consent or instruction of
the Securityholder Agent as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of each every such Company Stockholder. The Escrow Agent and Parent are
hereby relieved from any liability to any person for any acts done by them in
accordance with such decision, act, consent, or instruction of the
Securityholder Agent.   (i) THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS.   (i) If any third party
shall notify Parent or its affiliates hereto with respect to any matter
(hereinafter referred to as a "THIRD PARTY CLAIM"), which may give rise to a
claim by Parent against the Escrow Fund, then Parent shall give notice to the
Securityholder Agent within 30 days of Parent\'s becoming aware of any such
Third Party Claim or of facts upon which any such Third Party Claim will be
based setting forth such material information with respect to the Third Party
Claim as is reasonably available to Parent; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no delay
or failure on the part of Parent in notifying the Securityholder Agent shall
relieve the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders from any
obligation hereunder unless the Securityholder Agent and the Company
Stockholders are thereby materially prejudiced (and then solely to the extent
of such prejudice).   (ii) In case any Third Party Claim is asserted
against Parent or its affiliates, and Parent notifies the Securityholder
Agent thereof pursuant to Section 7.2(i)(i) herein, the Securityholder Agent
and the Company Stockholders will be entitled, if the Securityholder Agent so
elects by written notice delivered to Parent within 30 days after receiving
Parent\'s notice, to assume the defense thereof, at the expense of the
Company Stockholders independent of the Escrow Fund if:   a) Parent has
reasonably determined that Losses which may be incurred as a result of the
Third Party Claim do not exceed either individually, or when aggregated with
all other Third Party Claims, the total dollar value of the Escrow Fund
determined in accordance with Section 7.2(d)(ii) hereof;   b) the Third
Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or
other equitable relief;    -56-    c) settlement of, or an adverse
judgment with respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith
judgment of Parent, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice
adverse to the continuing business interests of Parent; and   d) counsel
selected by the Securityholder Agent is reasonably acceptable to Parent.  
If the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders so assume any such
defense, the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders shall conduct
the defense of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently.
The Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders shall not compromise or
settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any judgment in respect
thereof without the prior written consent of Parent and/or its affiliates,
as applicable.   (iii) In the event that the Securityholder Agent
assumes the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance with Section
7.2(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates may retain separate counsel and
participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, but the fees and
expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of Parent unless Parent or
its affiliates shall reasonably determine that there is a material conflict
of interest between or among Parent or its affiliates and the Securityholder
Agent and the Company Stockholders with respect to such Third Party Claim, in
which case the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel will be borne by
the Securityholder Agent and the Company Stockholders out of the Escrow Fund.
Parent or its affiliates will not consent to the entry of any judgment or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the
prior written consent of the Securityholder Agent. Parent will cooperate in
the defense of the Third Party Claim and will provide full access to
documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by
Securityholder Agent and material to the claim and will make available all
officers, directors, and employees reasonably requested by Securityholder
Agent for investigation, depositions, and trial.   (iv) In the event that
the Securityholder Agent fails or elects not to assume the defense of Parent
or its affiliates against such Third Party Claim, which Securityholder Agent
had the right to assume under Section 7.2(i)(ii) above, Parent or its
affiliates shall have the right to undertake the defense, and Parent shall
not compromise or settle such Third Party Claim or consent to entry of any
judgment in respect thereof without the prior written consent of
Securityholder Agent. In the event that the Securityholder Agent is not
entitled to assume the defense of Parent or its affiliates against such Third
Party Claim pursuant to Section 7.2(i)(ii) above, Parent or its affiliates
shall have the right to undertake the defense, consent to the entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim
in any manner it may deem appropriate (and Parent or its affiliates need not
consult with, or obtain any consent from, the Securityholder Agent in
connection therewith); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that except with the
written consent of the Securityholder Agent, no settlement of any such claim
or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to such Third Party
Claim shall alone be determinative of the validity of the claim against the
Escrow Fund. In each case, Parent or its affiliates shall conduct the defense
of the Third Party Claim actively and diligently, and the Securityholder
Agent and the Company Stockholders will cooperate    -57-   with Parent
or its affiliates in the defense of that claim and will provide full access
to documents, assets, properties, books and records reasonably requested by
Parent and material to the claim and will make available all
individuals reasonably requested by Parent for investigation, depositions,
and trial.   (j) ESCROW AGENT\'S DUTIES.   (i) The Escrow Agent shall be
obligated only for the performance of such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Article VII, and as set forth in any additional written escrow
instructions which the Escrow Agent may receive after the date of this
Agreement which are signed by an officer of Parent and the Securityholder
Agent, and may rely and shall be protected in relying or refraining from
acting on any instrument reasonably believed to be genuine and to have been
signed or presented by the proper party or parties. The Escrow Agent shall
not be liable for any act done or omitted hereunder as Escrow Agent while
acting in good faith and in the exercise of reasonable judgment, and any act
done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive
evidence of such good faith.   (ii) The Escrow Agent is hereby expressly
authorized to disregard any and all warnings given by any of the parties
hereto or by any other person, excepting only orders or process of courts of
law, and is hereby expressly authorized to comply with and obey orders,
judgments or decrees of any court. In case the Escrow Agent obeys or complies
with any such order, judgment or decree of any court, the Escrow Agent shall
not be liable to any of the parties hereto or to any other person by reason
of such compliance, notwithstanding any such order, judgment or decree being
subsequently reversed, modified, annulled, set aside, vacated or found to
have been entered without jurisdiction.   (iii) The Escrow Agent shall not
be liable in any respect on account of the identity, authority or rights of
the parties executing or delivering or purporting to execute or deliver this
Agreement or any documents or papers deposited or called for hereunder.  
(iv) The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for the expiration of any rights
under any statute of limitations with respect to this Agreement or any
documents deposited with the Escrow Agent.   (v) In performing any duties
under the Agreement, the Escrow Agent shall not be liable to any party for
damages, losses, or expenses, except for gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent. The Escrow Agent shall not incur
any such liability for (A) any act or failure to act made or omitted in good
faith, or (B) any action taken or omitted in reliance upon any instrument,
including any written statement of affidavit provided for in this Agreement
that the Escrow Agent shall in good faith believe to be genuine, nor will the
Escrow Agent be liable or responsible for forgeries, fraud, impersonations,
or determining the scope of any representative authority. In addition, the
Escrow Agent may consult with legal counsel in connection with Escrow
Agent\'s duties under this Agreement and shall be fully protected in any act
taken, suffered, or permitted by it in good faith in accordance with
the advice of counsel. The    -58-   Escrow Agent is not responsible
for determining and verifying the authority of any person acting or
purporting to act on behalf of any party to this Agreement.   (vi) If any
controversy arises between the parties to this Agreement, or with any other
party, concerning the subject matter of this Agreement, its terms or
conditions, the Escrow Agent will not be required to determine the
controversy or to take any action regarding it. The Escrow Agent may hold all
documents and shares of Parent Common and may wait for settlement of any such
controversy by final appropriate legal proceedings or other means as, in the
Escrow Agent\'s discretion, the Escrow Agent may be required, despite what
may be set forth elsewhere in this Agreement. In such event, the Escrow Agent
will not be liable for damage. Furthermore, the Escrow Agent may at
its option, file an action of interpleader requiring the parties to answer
and litigate any claims and rights among themselves. The Escrow Agent is
authorized to deposit with the clerk of the court all documents and shares of
Parent Common held in escrow, except all cost, expenses, charges and
reasonable attorney fees incurred by the Escrow Agent due to the interpleader
action and which the parties jointly and severally agree to pay. Upon
initiating such action, the Escrow Agent shall be fully released and
discharged of and from all obligations and liability imposed by the terms of
this Agreement.   (vii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation agree
jointly and severally to indemnify and hold Escrow Agent harmless against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, and expenses, including
reasonable costs of investigation, counsel fees, and disbursements that may
be imposed on Escrow Agent or incurred by Escrow Agent in connection with the
performance of his/her duties under this Agreement, including but not limited
to any litigation arising from this Agreement or involving its subject
matter; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in the event the Escrow Agent shall be the
Non-Prevailing Party in connection with any claim or action initiated by a
Company Stockholder or Company Stockholders, then such Company Stockholder or
Company Stockholders shall be responsible for the indemnification of the
Escrow Agent to the full extent provided by this paragraph.   (viii) The
Escrow Agent may resign at any time upon giving at least thirty (30) days
written notice to the parties; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such resignation
shall become effective until the appointment of a successor escrow agent
which shall be accomplished as follows: Parent and the Securityholder Agent
shall use their best efforts to mutually agree on a successor escrow agent
within thirty (30) days after receiving such notice. If Parent and the
Securityholder Agent fail to agree upon a successor escrow agent within such
time, the Escrow Agent shall have the right to appoint a successor escrow
agent authorized to do business in the State of California. The
successor escrow agent shall execute and deliver an instrument accepting such
appointment and it shall, without further acts, be vested with all the
estates, properties, rights, powers, and duties of the predecessor escrow
agent as if originally named as escrow agent. The Escrow Agent shall be
discharged from any further duties and liability under this Agreement.  
(k) FEES. All fees of the Escrow Agent for performance of its duties
hereunder shall be paid by Parent. It is understood that the fees and usual
charges agreed upon for services of the Escrow Agent shall be
considered compensation for ordinary services as contemplated by this   
-59-   Agreement. In the event that the conditions of this Agreement are
not promptly fulfilled, or if the Escrow Agent renders any service not
provided for in this Agreement, or if the parties request a substantial
modification of its terms, or if any controversy arises, or if the Escrow
Agent is made a party to, or intervenes in, any litigation pertaining to this
escrow or its subject matter, the Escrow Agent shall be reasonably
compensated for such extraordinary services and reimbursed for all costs,
attorneys\' fees, and expenses occasioned by such default, delay, controversy
or litigation. Parent promises to pay these sums upon demand.   (l)
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for
special, indirect or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever
(including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Escrow Agent has
been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage and regardless of
the form of action.   7.3 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. The maximum liability of
the Company Stockholders for Losses incurred by Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation shall be limited to the Escrow Fund (the "MAXIMUM LIABILITY FOR
LOSSES") and resort to the Escrow Fund shall be the sole and exclusive right
and remedy of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation for Losses. The maximum
liability of each Company Stockholder for any Losses incurred by Parent
and/or the Surviving Corporation shall be an amount equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (x) the lesser of the Maximum Liability for Losses or
the amount of such Losses actually incurred by Parent or the Surviving
Corporation by (y) the ratio of (A) the total number of shares of Parent
Common Stock received by such person at the Closing to (B) the aggregate
number of shares of Parent Common Stock issued at the Effective Time and
shall only be payable out of the Escrow Fund in shares. Parent agrees to
present any claims for Losses solely against the Escrow Fund established
under this Article VII.   ARTICLE VIII   TERMINATION, AMENDMENT AND
WAIVER   8.1 TERMINATION. Except as provided in Section 8.2 below, this
Agreement may be terminated and the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the
Effective Time:   (a) by mutual written consent of the Company and
Parent;   (b) by either Parent or the Company if: (i) the Effective Time
has not occurred by May 31, 2001 or, in the event Parent elects to file the
S-4 Registration Statement, July 31, 2001 (provided that the right to
terminate this Agreement under this clause 8.1(b)(i) shall not be available
to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation hereunder has been the
cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time to occur on or
before such date); (ii) there shall be a final nonappealable order of a
federal or state court in effect preventing consummation of the Merger; or
(iii) there shall be any statute, rule, regulation or order enacted,
promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Merger by any Governmental
Entity that would make consummation of the Merger illegal;    -60-   
(c) by Parent if there shall be any action taken, or any statute, rule,
regulation or order enacted, promulgated or issued or deemed applicable
to the Merger, by any Governmental Entity, which would: (i) prohibit
Parent\'s or the Company\'s ownership or operation of any portion of the
business of the Company or (ii) compel Parent or the Company to dispose of or
hold separate, as a result of the Merger, any portion of the business or
assets of the Company or Parent;   (d) by Parent if there has been a breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this
Agreement on the part of the Company and as a result of such breach the
conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) would not then be satisfied; PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that if such breach is curable by the Company within thirty (30)
days through the exercise of its reasonable best efforts, then for so long as
the Company continues to exercise such reasonable best efforts Parent may not
terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(d) unless such breach is not
cured within such thirty (30) day period (but no cure period shall be
required for a breach which by its nature cannot be cured);   (e) by the
Company if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement contained in this Agreement on the part of Parent or Merger Sub
and as a result of such breach the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a), as
the case may be, would not then be satisfied; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if such
breach is curable by Parent or Merger Sub within thirty (30) days through the
