to the holders of Merger Shares for six months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of
Merger Shares who have not theretofore complied with this ARTICLE III shall
thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the
Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claim for the
Merger Consideration (and Parent shall take all actions necessary to ensure
that the Surviving Corporation has or has access to sufficient funds to make
such payments). Any portion of the Surviving Corporation Fund remaining
unclaimed by holders of Merger Shares as of a date which is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Authority shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of the Surviving Corporation free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto. None of Parent, the
Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder of
Merger Shares for any such shares (or dividends or distributions with respect
thereto) or cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

 

Section 3.04 _Dissenting Shares_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company Shares
that are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held
by any Company Stockholder who shall have neither voted in favor of the
Merger nor consented thereto in writing and who shall have demanded properly
in writing appraisal for such Company Shares in accordance with Section 262 of
the DGCL (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section
3.01(b), but rather, the holders of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled only
to payment of the appraised value of such Dissenting Shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (and, at the Effective Time,
such Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and such holders shall cease to have
any right

 



\- 16 -   with respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262 of the
DGCL); _provided, however_ , that if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under the
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, then the right of such holder to be
paid the appraised value of such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease and
such Dissenting Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the
Effective Time into, and to have become exchangeable solely for, the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without interest, as provided in Section
3.01(b).

(b) The Company shall notify Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable of
any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any Company Shares,
withdrawals thereof and any other instruments delivered to the Company
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands.
Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or
offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing. Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Paying Agent
pursuant to Section 3.03(a) to pay for Dissenting Shares shall be returned to
Parent upon demand.

 

Section 3.05 _Withholding Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub
and the Paying Agent, as applicable, shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration and any other payment otherwise payable pursuant
to this Agreement to any holder of Company Shares or Company Stock Options,
as applicable, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
paid over to or deposited with the relevant Governmental Authority, including
any Tax authority, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Company Shares in respect
of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Company, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, Merger Sub or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

 

Section 3.06 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of Company
Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization, subdivision, reclassification,
combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction with respect to the
outstanding Company Shares, at any time during the period from the date hereof
to the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to
reflect such transaction; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this Section
3.06 shall be construed as permitting the Company to take any action or enter
into any transaction otherwise prohibited by this Agreement.

from the IRS or is entitled to rely on a favorable opinion issued by the IRS,
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no fact or event has occurred since the
date of such determination letter which could reasonably be expected to result
in the revocation of such letter. There are no investigations by any
Governmental Authority, termination proceedings or other claims or litigation,
pending or to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or for which there are
facts that could form a reasonable basis, against or relating to any Plan or
asserting any rights to or claims for benefits under any Plan, the assets or
any of the trusts under such Plan or the plan administrator, or against any
fiduciary of any Plan with respect to the operation of the Plan (except
routine claims for benefits payable under the Plans) other than any such
investigations, proceedings or claims that would not reasonably be expected
to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. All contributions, premiums and benefit
payments under or in connection with the Plans that are required to have
been made as the date hereof in accordance with the terms of the Plans or
applicable Law have been timely made in all material respects. Except as would

benefit plan, or incurred any outstanding liability under Section 4062 of
ERISA to the Pension Benefits Guaranty Corporation or to a trustee appointed
under Section 4042 of ERISA. No event has occurred and no condition
exists that would subject the Company or its Subsidiaries, by reason of its
affiliation with any ERISA Affiliate, to any liability imposed under Title IV
of ERISA or Code Section 412\.

to the requirements of applicable Law, no provision of any Foreign Plan or of

grantor trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits under or any payment,
contribution or funding obligation pursuant to any of the Plans or other
arrangement, (ii) limit the right to merge, amend or terminate any Plan or

"plant closing" (as defined by WARN) with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(c) There are no material complaints, charges, claims, litigations or actions

the Company such information concerning Parent and Merger Sub as may
be reasonably requested by the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement.
At the earliest practicable time (and in any event within five Business Days)
following the later of (i) receipt and resolution of the SEC comments on the

period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, the

filing with the SEC in connection with the Transactions, the Company shall
provide Parent and its counsel with reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on each such filing in advance, and the Company shall in good faith
consider including in such filings all comments reasonably proposed by Parent.
All documents that the Company files with the SEC in connection with the
Merger or the other Transactions, including the Proxy Statement, will comply
as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable

\- 47 -  (b) The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any oral or
written comments from the SEC or its staff (or of notice of the SECs intent
to review the preliminary Proxy Statement) and of any request by the SEC or
its staff for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any other

provide Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in any
discussions or meetings with the SEC or its staff with respect to

comments by the SEC and if, at any time prior to the Effective Time, any event
or information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or any of their
Affiliates should be discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such
document would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein not false or
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other parties and the Company shall cause an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information to be filed with the SEC as promptly
as practicable thereafter and, to the extent required by applicable Law or
Order, disseminated to the Company Stockholders.

(c) The Company shall take all actions necessary in accordance with applicable
Law, Orders and the Company Certificate and the Company Bylaws (i) to duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold a special meeting of its stockholders
as promptly as practicable, and in any event (to the extent permissible under
applicable Law and Orders) as soon as practicable following the mailing of the
definitive Proxy Statement to the stockholders of the Company (but in no
event later than 30 calendar days following the date of such mailing), for the
purpose of considering the adoption of this Agreement (the " _Company
Stockholders  Meeting_") and (ii) unless the Company Board shall have
effected an Adverse Recommendation Change in accordance with Section 6.05(d),
(A) include in the Proxy Statement the Company Boards recommendation that the
holders of the Company Shares vote in favor of the adoption of this Agreement
(which recommendation shall be deemed a part of the Company Board
Recommendation) and (B) use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the
Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of this Agreement and
secure the vote or consent of the Company Stockholders as required by the
rules of NASDAQ, the DGCL or other applicable Law to effect the Merger. The
Company shall give Parent no less than 10 Business Days advance notice (or
such shorter period of time as notice is provided to NASDAQ) of the date
which shall be set as the "record date" for the Company Stockholders eligible
to vote on this Agreement and the Transactions. The Company shall consult with
Parent regarding the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting and shall not
postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders Meeting without the prior
written consent of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall
prevent the Company from postponing or adjourning the Company Stockholders
Meeting if and to the extent that: (i) there are holders of an insufficient
number of

 



\- 48 -   Company Shares present or represented by a proxy at the Company
Stockholders Meeting to constitute a quorum at the Company Stockholders
Meeting and the Company uses its reasonable best efforts during any such
postponement or adjournment to obtain such a quorum as soon as practicable,
(ii) the Company is required to postpone or adjourn the Company Stockholders
Meeting by applicable Law or Order or a request from the SEC or its staff and
the Company uses its reasonable best efforts to hold or resume the Company
Stockholders Meeting as soon as practicable, or (iii) the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel
and Parent) that it is required by Law to postpone or adjourn the Company
Stockholders Meeting, including in order to give Company Stockholders
sufficient time to evaluate any information or disclosure that the Company has
sent to the Company Stockholders or otherwise made available to the Company
Stockholders by issuing a press release or filing materials with the SEC;
_provided_ that (A) the preceding clause (iii) shall not apply to allow a
postponement or adjournment for any information or disclosure related to an
Acquisition Proposal (including any Superior Proposal) and (B) no postponement
or adjournment may be to a date on or after five Business Days prior to the
Outside Date.

 

(d) The Company shall ensure that the Company Stockholders Meeting is called,
noticed, convened, held and conducted, and that all Persons solicited in
connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting are solicited, in compliance
with all applicable Law and Orders. The adoption of this Agreement and
adjournment of the Company Stockholders Meeting, as necessary, to solicit
additional proxies if there are insufficient votes in favor of adoption of
this Agreement shall be the only matters which the Company shall propose to be
acted on by the Company Stockholders at the Company Stockholders Meeting
unless otherwise approved in writing by Parent.

(e) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company agrees
that (i) its obligation to duly call, give notice of, convene and hold the
Company Stockholders Meeting shall not be affected by the withdrawal,
amendment or modification of the Company Board Recommendation and (ii) its
obligations pursuant to this Section 6.03 shall not be affected by the
commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal).
Unless this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Section 8.01, the
Company agrees that it shall not submit to the vote of the stockholders of the
Company any Acquisition Proposal (whether or not a Superior Proposal) prior to
the vote of the Company Stockholders with respect to the Merger at the
Company Stockholders Meeting.

assets, properties, offices, plants and other facilities, books and records
of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries and shall timely furnish Parent,
Merger Sub and Parents financing sources with such financial, operating,
business, financial condition, projections and other data and 

 



\- 49 -   information as Parent, Merger Sub or Parents financing sources, through
their Representatives, may reasonably request, including furnishing all
historical financial statements and historical financial and other data of
the type and form customarily included in offering documents used in private
placements under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent and its financing sources information which
is complete and correct in all material respects and does not and will not,
when taken as a whole, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which such statements are
made, not misleading. The Company hereby consents to the use of all of its and
its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Offering and the Bridge
Financing. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, from the date
hereof until the earlier to occur of the Effective Time and the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with its terms, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and its
Subsidiaries to, provide to Parent all cooperation reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable in connection with Parents financing of
the Transactions, including using commercially reasonable efforts with
respect to (i) executing and delivering at Closing any pledge and security

of an appropriate officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with
respect to solvency matters and consents of accountants for use of their
reports in any materials relating to Parents financing of the Transactions),
(ii) obtaining accountants comfort letters (including comfort letters

and related adjustments), legal opinions, and, at Parents expense, surveys
and title insurance as reasonably requested by Parent, (iii) taking all
actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit Parents financing sources to
evaluate the Companys and its Subsidiaries current assets, cash management

Company, its Subsidiaries, or their respective Affiliates or their respective
securities, (v) if requested by any of Parents financing
sources, designating whether any information provided to Parents financing
sources is suitable to be made available to lenders who wish not to receive
material non-public information and (vi) taking all corporate actions
necessary to permit the consummation of Parents financing of the
Transactions and to permit the proceeds thereof to be made available as of the
Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, under no circumstance shall the
Company or its Subsidiaries be required to authorize the pre-filing of any
UCC-1s or other documents which create Liens.

(b) Any investigation conducted pursuant to the access contemplated by this
Section 6.04 shall be conducted in a manner that does not unreasonably
interfere with the conduct of the business of the Company and its Subsidiaries
or damage or destroy any property or assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. All information obtained by Parent or Merger Sub pursuant to
this Section 6.04 shall be held confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated September 9, 2010, as amended by the
letter agreement dated as of March 12, 2012 (the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company; _provided_ , that nothing
herein or in the Confidentiality Agreement shall prevent Parent or its
financing sources from using all information obtained pursuant to this
Section 6.04 as necessary and appropriate to consummate a Debt Offering and
Bridge Financing.

 



\- 50 -  (c) After the date hereof, Parent and the Company shall cooperate to establish
a mechanism acceptable to both parties by which Parent will be permitted,
prior to the Effective Time or the Termination Date, as the case may be, and
subject to applicable Law, to communicate directly with the Company employees
regarding employee related matters.

Section 6.05 _No Solicitation_.

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives
to, immediately cease and terminate, or cause to be terminated, any and all
discussions, solicitations, encouragements or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal and shall
promptly request (or, to the extent the Company is contractually permitted to
do so, require) the return or destruction of all copies of
confidential information previously provided to such parties by or on behalf
of the Company, its Subsidiaries or Representatives. From the date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with Section 8.01, subject to Section 6.05(b), the

propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal (any action
described in clause (A) or (B) being referred to as an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.05(a), if
at any time following the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective
Time, (i) the Company has received from a third party a written, bona fide
Acquisition Proposal, (ii) a breach by the Company of this Section 6.05 has
not contributed to the making of such Acquisition Proposal, (iii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its financial advisors
and outside counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is
reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal and (iv) after consultation
with its outside counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that
failure to take such action would constitute a breach by the Company Board of
its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under applicable Law, then
the Company may, subject to clauses (x), (y) and (z) below, (A) furnish
confidential information

 



\- 51 -   with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Acquisition Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations with
the Person making such Acquisition Proposal regarding such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided, however_ , that the Company (x) will not, and will not
allow its Representatives to, disclose any non-public information to such
Person unless the Company first enters into an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement with such Person, (y) will promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) provide to Parent notice of its intention to enter into such Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement and (z) will promptly (and in any event within 24
hours) provide to Parent any and all non-public information delivered to such
Person which was not previously provided to Parent.

(c) From and after the date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time,
the Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent,
orally and in writing, in the event that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or Representatives receives (i) any Acquisition Proposal or
indication by any Person that it is considering making an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) any request for non-public information in contemplation of an
Acquisition Proposal relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
(iii) any inquiry or request for discussions or negotiations regarding any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company shall provide Parent promptly (and in any
event within 24 hours) with the identity of such Person and a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (or, where such
Acquisition Proposal is not in writing, a written description of the Companys
understanding of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition
Proposal, indication, inquiry or request), including any modifications
thereto. The Company shall keep Parent informed (orally and in writing) on a
current basis (and in any event no later than 24 hours after the occurrence
of any material changes, developments, discussions or negotiations) of the
status of any Acquisition Proposal, indication, inquiry or request (including
the material terms and conditions thereof and of any material modification
thereto), and any developments, discussions and negotiations, including
furnishing copies of any written inquiries, correspondence and draft
documentation, and written summaries of any material oral inquiries or
discussions. Without limiting the foregoing, the Company shall promptly (and
in any event within 24 hours) notify Parent orally and in writing if it
determines to begin providing information or to engage in discussions or
negotiations concerning an Acquisition Proposal in accordance with Section
6.05(b) and shall in no event begin providing such information or engaging in
such discussions or negotiations prior to providing such notice. The Company
shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives not to,
enter into any Contract with any Person subsequent to the date of this
Agreement that would restrict the Companys ability to provide such
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to Parent, and
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently party to any
Contract that prohibits the Company from providing the information relating to
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries described in this Section 6.05(c) to
Parent. The Company (i) shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to,
terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission or
request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any
of its Subsidiaries is or becomes a party and (ii) shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to enforce the provisions of any
such agreement.

(d) Notwithstanding anything in Section 6.05(a) to the contrary, if (i) the
Company receives from a third party a written, bona fide Acquisition Proposal,
(ii) a breach by the Company of this Section 6.05 has not contributed to the
making of such Acquisition Proposal

 



\- 52 -   and (iii) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation
with its financial advisors and outside counsel, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal after giving effect to all of the
adjustments to the terms of this Agreement which may be offered by Parent,
including pursuant to clause (III) below, the Company Board may at any time
prior to the Effective Time, if it determines in good faith,
after consultation with its outside counsel, that failure to take such action
would constitute a breach by the Company Board of its fiduciary duties to the
Company Stockholders under applicable Law, (x) effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change and/or (y) terminate this Agreement to enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided,
however_ , that the Company shall not terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing clause (y), and any purported termination pursuant to the foregoing
clause (y) shall be void and of no force or effect, unless in advance of or
concurrently with such termination the Company (A) pays the Termination Fee to
Parent in immediately available funds and (B) concurrently with such
termination enters into the Alternative Acquisition Agreement; _provided,
further, however_ , that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to the foregoing clause (x) or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to the foregoing clause (y) unless (I) the Company shall
not have breached this Section 6.05, (II) the Company shall have provided
prior written notice to Parent, at least five Business Days in advance (the "
_Notice Period_ "), of its intention to take such action with respect to such
Superior Proposal, which notice shall specify the material terms and
conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal), and shall have contemporaneously provided to
Parent a copy of any proposed definitive agreement(s) with respect to such
Superior Proposal (the " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ "), (III) prior
to effecting such Adverse Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial advisors
and outside counsel to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal and (IV)
following any negotiation described in the immediately preceding clause (III),
such Acquisition Proposal ( _provided_ that the Company shall have complied
with the provisions of the immediately following sentence) continues to
constitute a Superior Proposal. In the event of any material revisions to the
terms of an Acquisition Proposal after the start of the Notice Period, the
Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to Parent and to
comply with the requirements of this Section 6.05(d) with respect to such new
written notice, and the Notice Period shall be deemed to have re-commenced on
the date of such new notice.

 

(e) The Company agrees that any violations of the restrictions set forth in
this Section 6.05 by any of its Representatives shall be deemed to be a
material breach of this Agreement (including this Section 6.05) by the
Company.

(f) Nothing contained in this Section 6.05 shall prohibit the Company Board
from taking and disclosing to the Company Stockholders a position contemplated
by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated
under the Exchange Act;  _provided, however_ , that any disclosure other than
(i) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type
contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, (ii) an express
rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or (iii) an express
reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation together with a factual
description of events or actions

 



\- 53 -   leading up to such disclosure that have been taken by the Company and that
are permitted under Section 6.05 or actions taken or notices delivered to
Parent by the Company that are required by Section 6.05, shall, in each case,
be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change (including for purposes of
Section 8.01(f)).

(g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates) from the provisions of
"control share acquisitions" contained in any Anti-Takeover Law or otherwise
cause such restrictions not to apply, in each case unless such actions are
taken simultaneously with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
8.01(h).

 

Section 6.06 _Employee Matters_.

(a) From the Effective Time until the 12 month anniversary of the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the compensation and benefits package provided to the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time under
the Plans listed on Section 4.12(a) of the Disclosure Schedule (the " _Company
Employees_ ") to be substantially comparable to the compensation and benefits
package, in the aggregate, provided to (i) the Company Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) similarly situated Parent employees, in
each case excluding for purposes of this comparison any equity-based
compensation; _provided, however,_ that during such 12-month period, Parent
or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, may reduce the compensation
or benefits of such Company Employees if such reductions in compensation or
benefits are made equitably and as part of an across-the-board reduction
applicable to all employees within the United States.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to comply in all material respects with its obligations under all
employment and severance agreements listed on Section 4.12(a) of the
Disclosure Schedule that are in effect as of the Effective Time, in each case,
subject to the terms and conditions of each such agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall
take such actions as are necessary, including making any determinations or
adopting resolutions of the Company Board or the compensation committee of
the Company Board, as applicable, to amend the 2012 Senior Management Bonus
Program in accordance with the provisions set forth in Section 6.06(b) of the
Disclosure Schedule.

 

(c) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and, solely with respect to severance
and vacation, level of benefit entitlement (but in no event for purposes of
benefit accrual or eligibility for retiree medical or other retiree welfare
benefits) under the Parent Plans, each Company Employee shall, subject to
applicable Law and applicable Tax qualification requirements, be
credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its
Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective Time, to
the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before the Effective
Time, to credit for such service under any similar Plans in which such
Company Employee participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior
to the Effective Time; _provided, however_ , that the foregoing shall not
apply to the extent that its application would result in a duplication of
benefits.

 



\- 54 -  (d) For purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical
or vision benefits to any Company Employee, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such Parent Plan to be waived for such
Company Employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions
would not have been waived under a similar Plan in which such Company Employee
participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents under the Plans during the
portion of the plan year of the Parent Plan ending on the date such employees
participation in the corresponding Parent Plan begins to be taken into
account under such Parent Plan for purposes of satisfying all deductible and
maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such employee and his or her
covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been
paid in accordance with such Parent Plan.

(e) At Parents election, the Company shall terminate, effective as of the
day immediately preceding the Effective Time, any and all 401(k) Plans
sponsored or maintained by the Company. In such event, Parent shall receive
from the Company evidence that the Companys Plan(s) and/or program(s) have
been terminated pursuant to resolutions of the Company Board or a committee
thereof (the form and substance of which shall be subject to review and
approval of Parent), effective as of the day immediately preceding the
Effective Time.

 

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 6.06
shall (i) be treated as an amendment of any particular Plan, (ii) give any
third party any right to enforce the provisions of this Section 6.06 or (iii)
require Parent or any of its Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular Plan or
(B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

(g) The Company will take all actions necessary to effectuate the provisions
of Section 6.06(g) of the Disclosure Schedule.

Section 6.07 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance of
the Surviving Corporation_.

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor all of the Companys obligations to indemnify
and hold harmless each person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the
date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer or director
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ")
as provided in the Company Certificate or Company Bylaws, in each case, as in
effect on the date of this Agreement, or pursuant to any other agreements in
effect on the date hereof, accurate and complete copies of which have been
provided to Parent and are listed in Section 6.07(a) of the Disclosure
Schedule, including provisions relating to the advancement of expenses
incurred in the defense of any Action or as permitted under applicable Law.
Parents obligation under this Section 6.07(a) shall survive the Merger and
shall remain in full force and effect for a period of not less than six years
after the Effective Time. During such period, Parent shall guarantee the
obligations of the Surviving Corporation with respect to any and all amounts
payable under this Section 6.07.

 



\- 55 -  (b) In addition to Parents indemnification obligations pursuant to Section
6.07(a) above, prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, purchase a "tail" officers and directors liability
insurance policy, which by its terms shall survive the Merger and shall
provide each Indemnified Party with coverage for not less than six years
following the Effective Time on terms and conditions no less favorable than
the terms of the directors and officers liability insurance
policy currently maintained by the Company (a correct and complete copy of
which has been delivered to Parent) (the " _D andO Insurance_") in respect of
actions or omissions of such officers and directors prior to the Effective
Time in their capacities as such; _provided, however_ , that in no event
shall Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend more than 200%
of the current annual premium paid by the Company for such policy to purchase
the "tail" policy (the " _Maximum Amount_ "); _provided, further, however_ ,
that if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to procure such insurance
coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent shall spend up to the Maximum
Amount to purchase such lesser coverage as may be obtained with such Maximum
Amount. The Indemnified Parties may be required to make reasonable application
and provide reasonable and customary representations and warranties to
applicable insurance carriers for the purpose of obtaining such insurance.

(c) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.07 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this Section 6.07 applies without the consent of such affected
Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to
whom this Section 6.07 applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
Section 6.07, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this Section 6.07).

 

(d) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or Surviving Corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set
forth in this Section 6.07.

Section 6.08 _Financing Arrangements_.

(a) Except to the extent Parent (or an Affiliate of Parent) has completed a
debt securities financing, bank loan financing or other debt financing in lieu
of, or whose net cash proceeds fully replace amounts that were to be provided
under the Bridge Financing as contemplated by and pursuant to the Commitment
Letter and the other letters related thereto (such an offering, a " _Debt
Offering_ "), subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Parent
shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain and effectuate the Bridge
Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter on the terms set forth therein
(including, without limitation, any impact on such terms of provisions
existing in the Fee Letter (as defined in the Commitment Letter)). Except
to the extent Parent (or an Affiliate of Parent) has completed a Debt
Offering, Parent agrees to notify the Company as soon as reasonably
practicable if, at any time prior to the Closing Date, (i) the Commitment
Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, (ii) any financing
source that is a party to the Commitment Letter notifies Parent that such
source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent or (iii) for any
reason Parent no longer believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain
any of the Bridge Financing

 



\- 56 -   substantially on the terms described in the Commitment Letter. Other than in
connection with a Debt Offering, Parent shall not, nor shall it permit any of
its subsidiaries or Affiliates to, without the prior written consent of the
Company, take any action or enter into any transaction, including, without
limitation, any merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition, lease,
contract or debt or equity financing that would reasonably be expected to
materially impair, delay or prevent the Bridge Financing contemplated by the
Commitment Letter. Other than in connection with a Debt Offering, neither
Parent nor Merger Sub shall amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, the
Commitment Letter in any manner that would materially impair, delay or
prevent the Closing without the prior written consent of the Company.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, in no event
shall Parent or Merger Sub be required to consummate the Closing prior to the
earlier of (i) the third Business Day immediately following consummation of a
Debt Offering and (ii) the Outside Date.

(b) Except to the extent Parent has completed a Debt Offering, if the
Commitment Letter shall expire or terminate for any reason, Parent shall use
its reasonable best efforts to obtain, and will provide the Company with a
copy of, a new financing commitment that provides for a sufficient amount of
financing for Parent to consummate the Transactions on funding conditions not
materially less favorable than those included in the Commitment Letter
as originally issued and other terms and conditions the aggregate effect of
which is not materially adverse to Parent in comparison with those contained
in the Commitment Letter as originally issued, which extension or new
commitment shall include a termination date not earlier than the Outside
Date. Parent shall accept any such commitment letter if the funding conditions
and other terms and conditions contained therein are not materially adverse to
Parent in comparison with those contained in the Commitment Letter as
originally issued.

Section 6.09 _Further Action; Efforts_.

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best

applicable Antitrust Laws, (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
as promptly as practicable the termination of any waiting period under the HSR
Act and any applicable foreign Antitrust Laws, (iii) cooperate and consult

given in connection with any proceeding by a private party, in each case
regarding the Transactions and (iii) permit the other party to review any
communication given by it to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting or conference with, the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Authority or, in connection with any proceeding by a private party, with any
other Person, and to the extent permitted by the FTC, the DOJ or such other
applicable Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and conferences.

contained in Section 6.09(a) and Section 6.09(b), if any objections are
asserted with respect to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law or if any
suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the DOJ or
any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party challenging
any of the Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law or which would
otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Transactions, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to resolve any such objections or suits so as to
permit consummation of the Transactions, including in order to resolve such
objections or suits which, in any case if not resolved, could reasonably be
expected to prevent, materially impede or materially delay the consummation of
the Transactions.

(d) In the event that any administrative or judicial action or proceeding is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by a Governmental Authority or
private party challenging the Merger or any other Transaction, each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall cooperate in all respects with each
other and use its respective commercially reasonable efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other Order, whether temporary,
preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits, prevents or
restricts consummation of the Transactions. Parent shall be entitled to direct
the antitrust defense of the Merger or any other Transactions, or
negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or other Person relating to the
Merger or regulatory filings under applicable Antitrust Law, subject to the
provisions of Section 6.09(a), (b), (c) and (e).

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, (i) nothing in this Section 6.09 shall limit a partys right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01 and (ii) nothing in this

of Parent, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall, in response
to any objections asserted with respect to the Transactions under any
Antitrust Law or any suit instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the

annum equal to the "Prime Rate" as set forth on the date such payment became
past due in _The Wall Street Journal_ "Money Rates" column plus 350 basis
points. In addition, if Parent shall fail to pay such Reverse Breakup Fee when
due, Parent shall also pay to the Company all of the Companys costs and
expenses (including attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect
such Reverse Breakup Fee.

(e) The Company, its Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall not have any rights or claims against any Parent
financing source in connection with the Transactions, including the Bridge
Financing or any Debt Offering, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise.

 

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto
by action taken by their respective boards of directors (or similar governing
bodies or entities) at any time prior to the Effective Time; _provided,
however_ , that, after Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, no
amendment may be made without further stockholder approval which, by Law or
in accordance with the rules of NASDAQ, requires further approval by such
stockholders. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in
writing signed by the parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
provisions of Section 6.04(a), Section 8.03(d), Section 8.04, Section 9.06,
Section 9.07 and Section 9.08, to the extent affecting any of the Parents
financing sources, may not be amended, modified or waived (including
any defined

 



\- 65 -   term used therein) without the prior written consent of each of Parents
financing sources participating in a Debt Offering or, to the extent Parent or
an Affiliate of Parent has not consummated a Debt Offering, the Bridge
Financing, as applicable.

Section 8.05 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the Company,
on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other hand, may (a) extend
the time for the performance of any obligation or other act of the other
party, (b) waive any inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the
other party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and
(c) waive compliance with any agreement of the other party or any condition to
its own obligations contained herein. Any such extension or waiver shall be
valid if set forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Company or Parent
(on behalf of Parent and Merger Sub). The waiver by any party hereto of a
breach of any provision hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a
waiver of any prior or subsequent breach of the same or any other provision
hereunder. The failure of any party to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of those rights.

Section 9.03 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy or the application of this Agreement to any Person or
circumstance is invalid or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or
public policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse
to any party. To such end, the provisions of this Agreement are agreed to
be severable. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable
manner in order that the Transactions be consummated as originally
contemplated to the fullest extent possible.

Section 9.04 _Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement, together with the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Disclosure Schedule, constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and
supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof.
Notwithstanding the forgoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that, upon
execution of this Agreement, each of Parents potential financing sources
shall be considered a Representative (as defined in the Confidentiality
Agreement) of Parent for all purposes under the 

 



\- 67 -   Confidentiality Agreement. This Agreement shall not be assigned, whether
pursuant to a merger, by operation of law or otherwise; _provided_ that Merger
Sub may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations under this Agreement to any wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
without the consent of the Company.

Section 9.05 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable
damage would occur in the event any provision of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with the terms hereof and that money damages would
not be a sufficient remedy for any breach of this Agreement, and accordingly,
the parties hereto shall be entitled to specific performance of the terms
hereof, without any requirement to post bond, in addition to any other remedy
at law or equity. The parties hereto further agree not to assert that a remedy
of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy.

Section 9.06 _Parties in Interest_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and
inure solely to the benefit of each party hereto, and nothing in this
Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other
Person any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement, other than the provisions of Section 6.07 (which
are intended to be for the benefit of the Persons covered thereby or the
Persons entitled to payment thereunder and may be enforced by such Persons).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parents financing sources are intended third
party beneficiaries under Section 6.04(a), Section 6.04(b), Section 8.03(d),
Section 8.04, Section 9.07 and Section 9.08.

 

Section 9.07 _Governing Law; Forum_.

(a) All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or the negotiation, validity or performance of this Agreement, or
the Transactions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of Delaware without regard to its rules of conflict of laws.

(b) All Actions arising out of or relating to this Agreement shall be heard
and determined in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction
over a particular matter, any federal court within the State of Delaware).
The parties hereby (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware (or, only if the Court of Chancery of the
State of Delaware declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter,
any federal court within the State of Delaware) for the purpose of any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement brought by any party and (ii)
irrevocably waive, and agree not to assert by way of motion, defense, or
otherwise, in any such Action, any claim that it is not subject personally to
the jurisdiction of the above-named courts, that its property is exempt or
immune from attachment or execution, that any such Action is brought in an
inconvenient forum, that the venue of such Action is improper, or that this
Agreement or the Transactions may not be enforced in or by any of the above-
named courts. Each of the parties hereto agrees that mailing of process or
other papers in connection with any action or proceeding in the manner
provided in Section 9.02 or such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall
be valid and sufficient service of process.

 



\- 68 -  (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company and its
Subsidiaries agree (i) that any Action involving a Parent financing source in
connection with the Transactions, including Actions involving the Bridge
Financing or any Debt Offering, shall be brought exclusively in any Federal
court of the United States of America sitting in the Borough of Manhattan or,
if that court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, in any state court
located in the City and County of New York and each of the Company, its
Subsidiaries and the Representatives of the Company and its Subsidiaries
submits for itself and its property with respect to any such action to the
exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) not to bring or permit any of its
Affiliates to bring or support anyone else in bringing any such Action in any
other court, (iii) that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at its address provided in Section 9.02 shall
be effective service of process against it for any such action brought in
any such court, (iv) to waive and hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to
the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of, any such Action in any such court, (v) that a final judgment
in any such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other
jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law,
(vi) that any such Action shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of New York and (vii) to irrevocably waive and
hereby waives any right to a trial by jury in any such action to the same
extent such rights are waived pursuant to this Section 9.08.

Section 9.08 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY WAIVES
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A
TRIAL BY JURY WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING
OUT OF, UNDER OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS. Each
of the parties (a) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any
other party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party
would not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce that foregoing waiver
and (b) acknowledges that it and the other hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Transactions, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this Section 9.08.

 

Section 9.09 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered
(including by facsimile or other form of electronic transmission) in two or
more counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate
counterparts, each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original
but all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
