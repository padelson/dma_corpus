in  the  notes  thereto  and  the  Company  Audited  Financial  Statements  (the
"ESTIMATED  CLOSING  DATE  BALANCE  SHEET")  and a  statement  derived  from the
Estimated  Closing Date Balance  Sheet  setting  forth its good faith  estimated
calculation of the Estimated Closing Date Net Working Capital and the components
thereof (the "ESTIMATED  WORKING CAPITAL  STATEMENT").  If the Estimated Working
Capital Statement reflects an Estimated Working Capital Shortfall,  the Purchase
Price paid at Closing shall be reduced by the aggregate amount of such Estimated
Working Capital Shortfall.  If the Estimated Closing Date Balance Sheet reflects
an Estimated  Working Capital Surplus,  the Purchase Price paid at Closing shall
be increased by the aggregate amount of such Estimated  Working Capital Surplus.
During the  preparation  and  calculation of the Estimated  Closing Date Balance
Sheet and the Estimated Working Capital  Statement,  the Seller shall, and shall
cause its  Subsidiaries,  to afford  the  Purchaser  reasonable  opportunity  to
observe,  review and comment upon such  preparation and  calculation,  including
supporting  detail and during and after such preparation and calculation to have
reasonable  access  to any  documents,  schedules  or  work  papers  used in the
preparation  of the Estimated  Closing  Balance Sheet and the Estimated  Working
Capital Statement.

              (b)    POST-CLOSING  ADJUSTMENTS.  Promptly  but in any  event not
later than ninety (90) days  following  the Closing Date,  the  Purchaser  shall
prepare and deliver to the Seller (i) the Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet,  (ii) a
statement   derived  from  the  Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet  setting  forth  a
calculation  of the  Closing  Date  Net  Working  Capital  as of the date of the
Closing Date Balance Sheet (the "WORKING  CAPITAL  STATEMENT"  and together with
the Closing  Date  Balance  Sheet,  the  "CLOSING  FINANCIAL  STATEMENTS").  For
purposes  of  preparing  the Working  Capital  Statement,  (x) the Closing  Date
Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with the same accounting policies,
principles,  practices and methods used in preparing the Unaudited Balance Sheet
as reflected in the notes thereto and the Company Audited Financial  Statements,
and (y) the Working  Capital  Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the
same  calculation  methodology  used in preparing the Estimated  Working Capital
Statement.

              (c)    DISPUTE  RESOLUTION  PROCEDURES.  Within ten (10)  Business
Days following the Seller's  receipt of the Closing  Financial  Statements,  the
Seller and its  independent  auditors  shall be  permitted to review the working
papers of the Purchaser relating to the Working Capital  Statement.  The Working
Capital  Statement  shall  become  final and  binding  upon the  Seller  and the
Purchaser on the eleventh (11th) Business Day following delivery thereof, unless
the Seller gives written  notice of its  disagreement  with the Working  Capital
Statement (a "NOTICE OF  DISAGREEMENT") to the Purchaser prior to such date. Any
Notice of Disagreement  shall (i) specify in reasonable detail the nature of any
disagreement  so  asserted  and  (ii)  only  include   disagreements   based  on
mathematical errors or based on the Working Capital Statement not being prepared
or the Working  Capital or the adjusted  purchase price not being  determined in
accordance  with  Section  2.03(b).  During  the seven (7)  Business  Day period
following the delivery of a Notice of Disagreement, the Seller and the Purchaser
shall seek in good faith to resolve  in writing  any  differences  that they may
have with  respect to the matters  specified in the Notice of  Disagreement  and
agree on a final  determination of the  disagreements set forth in the Notice of
Disagreement.  During such period,  the  Purchaser  and its auditors  shall have
access to the  working  papers of the Seller and, if  applicable,  the  Seller's
auditors' working papers prepared in connection with the Notice of Disagreement.
At the end of such seven (7) Business Day period,  the Seller and the  Purchaser
shall  submit  to a  nationally  recognized  independent  accounting  firm  (the
"INDEPENDENT  ACCOUNTING  FIRM") for  arbitration  of any and all  matters  that
remain in dispute and that were properly included in the Notice of Disagreement.
The  Independent  Accounting  Firm  shall be Ernst & Young,  or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to act,  the first of the Big Four Public  Accounting  Firms
(on an  alphabetical  basis)  that is not  currently  serving as the  auditor of
either the Seller or the Purchaser shall be selected to resolve the dispute. The
Seller and the  Purchaser  shall  instruct the  Independent  Accounting  Firm to
render its reasoned  written decision as promptly as practicable but in no event
later than  fifteen  (15)  Business  Days  after  submission  of all  matters in
dispute.  The cost of any  arbitration  (including  the fees and expenses of the
Independent  Accounting Firm and reasonable  attorney fees and expenses pursuant
to this  Section  2.03(c)  shall be borne by the  Purchaser  and the  Seller  in
inverse  proportion as they may prevail in matters  resolved by the  Independent
Accounting Firm, which proportionate allocations shall also be determined by the
Independent  Accounting  Firm at the time the  determination  of the Independent
Accounting  Firm is rendered on the merits of the matters  submitted.  Except as
otherwise provided herein, the procedures for resolution of disputes  concerning
the Closing Financial  Statements shall (i) be final,  binding and conclusive on
the Seller and the Purchaser for purposes of the purchase price adjustments only
and for no other  purpose in  connection  with this  Agreement  so that when the
Closing Financial Statements are deemed final hereunder,  neither the Seller nor
the Purchaser will be entitled to subject the Closing Financial Statements,  any
resolution  by and  between  the Seller  and the  Purchaser  under this  Section
2.03(c) or the Independent  Accounting Firm's decision to any court or tribunal,
for purposes of the purchase  price  adjustments  and (ii) shall  constitute  an
arbitral  determination  upon  which a  judgment  may be  entered  by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

              (d)    POST-CLOSING SETTLEMENT.

              (i)    If it is  determined  that there is a Closing  Date Working
       Capital Shortfall in excess of the Estimated  Working Capital  Shortfall,
       the excess shall be paid by the Seller to the Purchaser  within three (3)
       Business Days  following the date that the Closing  Financial  Statements
       are final and binding in accordance with Section 2.03(c) (the

                                      -19-
<PAGE>


       "SETTLEMENT DATE") by wire transfer of immediately  available funds to an
       account designated in writing by the Purchaser; or

              (ii)   if it is  determined  that there is a Closing  Date Working
       Capital Shortfall less than the Estimated Working Capital Shortfall,  the
       difference shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller on the Settlement
       Date by wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  funds  to an  account
       designated in writing by Seller; or

              (iii)  if it is  determined  that there is a Closing  Date Working
       Capital Surplus in lieu of an Estimated  Working Capital  Shortfall,  the
       Closing Date  Working  Capital  Surplus plus the amount of any  Estimated
       Working  Capital  Shortfall  deducted from the Purchase Price pursuant to
       Section  2.03(a)  shall be paid by the  Purchaser  to the  Seller  on the
       Settlement  Date by wire transfer of  immediately  available  funds to an
       account designated in writing by the Seller; or

              (iv)   if it is  determined  that there is a Closing  Date Working
       Capital  Shortfall in lieu of an Estimated  Working Capital Surplus,  the
       Closing Date Working  Capital  Shortfall plus the amount of any Estimated
       Working  Capital  Surplus added to the Purchase Price pursuant to Section
       2.03(a)  shall be paid by the Seller to the  Purchaser on the  Settlement
       Date by wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  funds  to an  account
       designated in writing by the Purchaser; or

              (v)    if it is  determined  that there is a Closing  Date Working
       Capital  Surplus less than the Estimated  Working  Capital  Surplus,  the
       difference shall be paid by the Seller to the Purchaser on the Settlement
       Date by wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  funds  to an  account
       designated in writing by the Purchaser; or

              (vi)   if it is  determined  that there is a Closing  Date Working
       Capital Surplus in excess of the Estimated  Working Capital Surplus,  the
       difference shall be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller on the Settlement
       Date by wire  transfer  of  immediately  available  funds  to an  account
       designated in writing by the Seller.

              (e)    CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS.  SCHEDULE 2.03(E) hereto sets forth a
description of (i) certain identified leasing  transactions for which consent to
the Transactions is required  pursuant to its terms and (ii) the manner in which
such transactions  shall be treated pursuant to this Agreement in the event such
consent is not obtained.

ITEM") will differ in a material amount from the same line item in the Unaudited
Financial  Statements  for the  corresponding  periods.  To the knowledge of the

other  than  those  assets  disposed  of in  the  ordinary  course  of  business
consistent with past practice.  This Section 3.07 does not apply to Intellectual
Property (for which Section 3.08 is applicable).  Following the  consummation of
the Transactions, Seller shall remain in the business of the extension of credit

the Company any license,  whether  express or implied,  to use any  Intellectual
Property  owned or controlled by the Seller or conveying any other rights to the
Company and the other members of the Company Group in any Intellectual  Property
owned or controlled by the Seller.

              (c)    Since  January 1, 2005,  to the  knowledge  of the  Seller,
neither  the  Company  nor any of the other  members  of the  Company  Group has
received written notification that the conduct of the Business by the Company or
any of the other members of the Company Group has infringed upon or violated the
Intellectual  Property  rights of others in any  material  respects,  and to the

respect  any  of its  business  practices  to  remain  in  compliance  with  any
Applicable Law or Governmental Order, (iii) any such Person has failed to obtain
any  material  Permit  required for the conduct of its business or (iv) any such
Person is in default under or in violation of any material Permit.

Closing,  there will be no material  Contracts by and between the Company and/or

forth in this Agreement, the Purchaser acknowledges, for itself and on behalf of

any other Person makes any other express or implied  representation  or warranty
with respect to the Company,  the  Business,  the  Transactions,  the  documents
related hereto or otherwise or with respect to any other information provided to
the Purchaser or any of its Representatives, whether on behalf of the Company or
such other

Persons,   including,  as  to  the  operation,   probable  success,   prospects,
projections or profitability of the Company or the Business.

              (b)    During the period  between  the date hereof and the Closing
Date, the Seller shall, from time to time, amend or add Schedules,  to make such
additions to, or modifications  of such Schedules,  as are necessary to make the
information  set forth  therein  true,  accurate  and  complete in all  material
respects on the date of this Agreement and the Closing Date, as applicable. Such
amendments,  additions or  modifications  shall be specified in a written notice
delivered to the  Purchaser  (an "UPDATE  NOTICE") no less than 15 calendar days

affected by such amendments, additions or modifications and enclose such amended
Schedules.

              (c)    The Purchaser  shall,  within fifteen (15) calendar days of

Section  10.03(a)(vii),  as a result of the information disclosed in such Update
Notice.  If the Purchaser  does not exercise such  termination  right within the
fifteen (15)  day-period,  the  Purchaser  shall be deemed to waive its right to
terminate this Agreement and such Schedules shall thereupon be deemed amended to
reflect such amendments,  additions and modifications and the truth and accuracy
of the  representations and warranties of the Seller contained in this Agreement
solely for  determining  whether  any breach  thereof  shall have  occurred  for
purposes of 7.02(a),  shall be determined  by reference to such  Schedules as so
amended; PROVIDED, that such amendments, additions or modifications shall not be
deemed to cure any breach for any other  purpose  of this  Agreement,  including
without limitation Article VIII.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                 REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASER

              The Purchaser hereby  represents and warrants to the Seller on the
date hereof and on the Closing Date, as follows:

              SECTION 4.01.  ORGANIZATION;  AUTHORIZATION;  ENFORCEABILITY.  The
Purchaser  is  duly  organized,  validly existing and in good standing under the
laws  of  the State of Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to own
its  properties  and  assets  and  to  carry  on its business as it is now being
conducted  and  as  currently proposed to be conducted immediately following the

obligations under the Financing Commitment Letter, the Equity Commitment Letter,
the  Employee  Benefits  Agreement  (collectively,  the  "PURCHASER  TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS")  and  this Agreement and has taken all necessary action to authorize
the  execution,  delivery  and  performance  by  it  of  this  Agreement and the
Purchaser  Transaction  Documents  and  to consummate the Transactions. No other
proceedings  on  the part of the Purchaser are necessary for such authorization,
execution,  delivery  and  consummation.  The  Purchaser  has  duly executed and
delivered  this  Agreement,  the  Financing  Commitment  Letter  and  the Equity
Commitment

                                      -34-
<PAGE>


Letter.  Each  of this Agreement, the Employee Benefits Agreement, the Financing
Commitment  Letter  and  the Equity Commitment Letter constitutes a legal, valid
and  binding  obligation  of the Purchaser, enforceable against the Purchaser in
accordance  with  its  terms,  subject  to  bankruptcy,  insolvency,  fraudulent
transfer,  reorganization,  moratorium and similar laws of general applicability
relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to general equity principles.

              SECTION 4.02. PURCHASER AS A CORPORATION AND U.S. CITIZEN. (a) The

with  respect  to the  transactions  included  in the  Financing,  including  as
required under the Federal  Aviation Act of 1958, as amended,  the Jones Act and
other  Applicable  Laws  governing the ownership or use of the assets subject to
such Financings.

              SECTION 4.03. PURCHASE FOR INVESTMENT.  The Purchaser is acquiring
the Shares to be acquired  hereunder  for its own account (or for accounts  over
which it or its Affiliates exercises investment  authority),  for investment and
not with a view to the  resale  or  distribution  thereof  in  violation  of any
securities law.

              SECTION  4.04.  NO  VIOLATION;   CONSENTS.   (a)  Subject  to  the
governmental  filings  and other  matters  referred to in Section  4.04(b),  the
execution,  delivery  and  performance  by the  Purchaser  of each  of the  this
Agreement and the Purchaser  Transaction  Documents and the  consummation by the
Purchaser of the Transactions do not and will not contravene any Applicable Law,
except for any such  contravention  that would not have and would not reasonably
be expected to have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Purchaser to
timely  perform  its   obligations   under  this  Agreement  and  the  Purchaser
Transaction Documents. The execution,  delivery and performance by the Purchaser
of this Agreement and the Purchaser  Transaction  Documents and the consummation
of the  Transactions  (i)  will  not  (A)  violate,  result  in a  breach  of or
constitute  (with or without  due notice or lapse of time or both) a default (or
give rise to any right of termination,  cancellation or acceleration)  under any
Contract to which the  Purchaser is party or by which the  Purchaser is bound or
to  which  any of its  assets  is  subject  or (B)  result  in the  creation  or
imposition of any Lien upon any of the assets of the  Purchaser,  except for any
such  violations,  breaches,  defaults or Liens that would not have or would not
reasonably be expected to have a material  adverse  effect on the ability of the
Purchaser to timely perform its  obligations  under this Agreement and (ii) will
not conflict  with or violate any provision of the  certificate  of formation or
operating  agreement (or similar agreement) or other governing  documents of the
Purchaser.

              (b)    No  consent,  authorization  or  order  of,  or  filing  or
registration with, any Governmental  Authority or other Person is required to be
obtained or made by the Purchaser for the execution, delivery and performance of
any  of  this  Agreement  and  the  Purchaser   Transaction   Documents  or  the
consummation of any of the Transactions, except where the failure to obtain such
consents, authorizations or orders, or make such filings or registrations, would
not have or would not  reasonably be expected to have a material  adverse effect
on the ability of the  Purchaser to timely  perform its  obligations  under this
Agreement and the Purchaser Transaction Documents.

Governmental   Orders   against  or  affecting  the  Purchaser  or  any  of  its
Subsidiaries,  (b)  proceedings  pending or, to the knowledge of the  Purchaser,
threatened  against or affecting the Purchaser or any of its Subsidiaries or (c)
investigations  by any Governmental  Authority that are, to the knowledge of the
Purchaser,  pending or  threatened  against or affecting the Purchaser or any of
its Subsidiaries that, in any case would have or would reasonably be expected to
have a material adverse effect on the ability of the Purchaser to timely perform
its obligations under this Agreement.

              SECTION 4.06. FINANCING.  The Purchaser has obtained the Financing
Commitment  Letter which,  on the terms and subject to the  conditions  thereof,
provides all funds necessary, together with the funds available to the Purchaser
under the Equity Commitment  Letter, to acquire all of the Shares and to pay any
other amount  required to  consummate  the  Transactions.  A true,  complete and
correct copy of the Financing  Commitment  Letter has been  furnished to Seller.
The  financing  required to consummate  the  transactions  contemplated  by this
Agreement  is referred to in this  Agreement  collectively  as the  "TRANSACTION
FINANCING."

              SECTION 4.07.  ANTITRUST.  The  Purchaser  has  determined in good
faith, in accordance with 16 C.F.R. ss. 801.10(c)(3), that the fair market value
of the assets held by the Company (together with all entities  controlled by the
Company) that are not exempt under Section  7a(c)(1) of the HSR Act or 16 C.F.R.
Sections  802.1 or 802.4 at the time of the  Closing  (taking  into  account the
Internal Restructuring, the PBGFS Contribution, the Company Contribution and the
PBGFS  Distribution)  does not exceed  $56.7  million.  For the purposes of this
Section  4.07,  "controlled  by"  shall  have the same  meaning  as in 16 C.F.R.
Section 801.1(b).

              SECTION  4.08.  REPRESENTATIONS  AND  WARRANTIES.  Except  for the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, the Seller
acknowledges, for itself and on behalf of its Representatives,  that neither the
Purchaser  nor any of its  Representatives  or any other  Person makes any other

Transactions,  the documents  related hereto or otherwise or with respect to any
other information provided to the Seller or any of its Representatives,  whether
on behalf of the Purchaser or such other Persons.

to the Purchaser and its  Representatives,  under the supervision of the Seller,

Section 10.03) to (A) the  properties,  books,  Contracts and records related to
the  Business,  (B)  such  employees  of the  members  of the  Company  Group as
reasonably agreed upon by the Seller and the Purchaser and (C) the lessees named
on SCHEDULE 5.02 hereto, and, during such period,  shall, upon request,  furnish
as soon  as  reasonably  practicable  to the  Purchaser  all  other  information
concerning the Business as the Purchaser may reasonably request;  PROVIDED, that
(x) such  access  shall not  interfere  with the  day-to-day  operations  of the
Company Group and (y) no  investigation  or receipt of  information  pursuant to
this Section 5.02 shall affect any  representation or warranty of the Company or
the  conditions  to the  obligations  of the  Purchaser  and (ii) provide to the
Purchaser  copies  of  the  execution  copies  of  the  Distribution  Agreements
concurrently  with the  execution  thereof  and in no event  later than five (5)
Business Days before the Closing Date.

              (b)    All requests pursuant to this Section 5.02 shall be made to
the Persons  designated  from time to time by the Seller for this  purpose,  who
shall initially be the individuals listed on SCHEDULE 5.02.

              SECTION  5.03.  CONSENTS  AND  APPROVALS.  Except  as set forth on
SCHEDULE  5.03,  the Seller  shall,  and shall cause the Company to, (a) use all
commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain  all  necessary  consents,  waivers,
authorizations  and approvals of all  Governmental  Authorities and of all other
Persons  required in connection with the execution,  delivery and performance of
this Agreement or the  consummation  of the  Transactions  by the Seller and (b)
shall diligently assist and cooperate with the Purchaser in preparing and filing
all  documents  required to be  submitted by the  Purchaser to any  Governmental
Authority in connection  with the issuances  pursuant to this  Agreement  (which
assistance and cooperation  shall include timely furnishing to the Purchaser all
information   concerning  the  Company  Group  that  counsel  to  the  Purchaser
reasonably  determines is required to be included in such  documents or would be
helpful  in  obtaining  any such  required  consent,  waiver,  authorization  or
approval).

              SECTION 5.04. INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

              SECTION 5.05. NO SOLICITATION OF OTHER OFFERS.  (a) The Seller and
its Affiliates and their respective  Representatives have ceased any activities,
discussions or negotiations  with any Person or Persons other than the Purchaser
or Persons acting on its behalf that were conducted  prior to March 7, 2006 with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal.

              (b)    The Seller and its  Subsidiaries  shall not take, and shall
use commercially  reasonable  efforts to cause their respective  Representatives
and Affiliates  not to take,  any action to (i) knowingly  solicit the making or
submission of any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) knowingly initiate or participate
in any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than the Purchaser) in
furtherance of any proposal that  constitutes or could reasonably be expected to
lead to any Acquisition  Proposal;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the Seller and the
Representatives,   in  response  to  a  bona  fide  unsolicited   proposal  that
constitutes  an  Acquisition   Proposal,   may  participate  in  discussions  or
negotiations  with, or furnish or disclose any  non-public  information  to, any
Person  which makes such  Acquisition  Proposal if (A) the Board of Directors of
the Seller

                                      -37-
<PAGE>


reasonably  determines in good faith,  after  consultation  with its independent
financial  advisors,  that such  Acquisition  Proposal is, or may  reasonably be
expected to lead to, a Superior  Proposal and (B) the Seller shall have provided
(1) prompt  notice to the  Purchaser of its intent,  intent to take such action,
the  identity of the Person  making the  Acquisition  Proposal  and the material
terms and  conditions  of such  proposal  and (2)  received  from such Person an
executed confidentiality  agreement in reasonably customary form on terms not in
the aggregate  materially more favorable to such Person than the terms contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Section 5.05 or any other provision of this Agreement shall prohibit the Seller,
its  Representatives  or the Board of  Directors  of the Seller  from making any
disclosure to the  stockholders  of the Seller as, in the good faith judgment of
the Board of Directors of the Seller is required  under  Applicable  Law or that
the failure to make such  disclosure is reasonably  likely to cause the Board of
Directors of the Seller to violate its respective fiduciary duties.

              (c)    The Board of  Directors  of the  Seller  (or any  committee
thereof) shall not (i) approve or recommend, or propose to approve or recommend,
any Acquisition  Proposal or (ii) cause the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries to
enter into and approve any letter of intent,  agreement  in principle or similar
agreement  relating to any Acquisition  Proposal;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the
Board of Directors of the Seller may recommend to their respective  stockholders
an  Acquisition  Proposal  if (x) the  Board of  Directors  of the  Seller,  has
received an  Acquisition  Proposal that the Board of Directors of the Seller has
determined  in good faith,  is a Superior  Proposal  and has  complied  with its
obligations  under  this  Section  5.05  and (y) the  Seller  has  notified  the
Purchaser in writing of the terms of the Superior  Proposal and of its intent to
take such action,  and has taken into account any revised  proposal  made by the
Purchaser  to the Company  within five (5) Business  Days after  delivery to the
Purchaser  of such  notice  and again has  determined  in good  faith  that such
Acquisition  Proposal (as if the same may have been modified or amended) remains
a Superior Proposal.

              (d)    In  addition  to  the  obligations  set  forth  in  Section
5.05(c),  the Seller shall as promptly as  practicable  (and in any event within
two (2) Business Days) advise the Purchaser of any request for information  with
respect to any  Acquisition  Proposal  or of any  Acquisition  Proposal,  or any
inquiry  with  respect  to any  Acquisition  Proposal,  including  the terms and
conditions  of such  Acquisition  Proposal (but not  modifications  to terms and
conditions proposed during discussions or negotiations permitted by this Section
5.05). The Seller shall as promptly as practicable  provide to the Purchaser any
non-public  information  concerning the Company  provided to any other Person in
connection  with any  Acquisition  Proposal or any inquiry  with  respect to any
Acquisition Proposal, which was not previously provided or made available to the
Purchaser.

              SECTION  5.06.  CONFIDENTIALITY;  INFORMATION.  (a) The Seller and
each of its Subsidiaries shall and shall cause their respective  Representatives
to  keep  all  information  received  by it  or  them  in  connection  with  the
negotiations  and  execution  of  this  Agreement  and the  consummation  of the
Transactions  from the Purchaser or its  Representatives  confidential,  and the
Seller shall not, without the Purchaser's  prior written consent,  disclose such
information  in any  manner  whatsoever,  in whole or in  part,  except  (i) for
disclosure to the  Representatives of the Seller and its Subsidiaries who have a
need to know such  information for the purpose of assisting in the  consummation
of the Transactions, (ii) to the extent, in the sole judgment of the

                                      -38-
<PAGE>


Seller, disclosure is required by Applicable Law, court process or by applicable
rules or listing agreements with any national  securities  exchange or quotation
system on which the Seller lists  securities and (iii) to the extent  disclosure
is requested by any Governmental  Authority having jurisdiction over the Seller,
any of its Subsidiaries or any Seller  Representative.  The Seller shall use all
commercially   reasonable   efforts  to  cause  its   Representatives   and  its
Subsidiaries' Representatives to comply with the foregoing requirement.

              (b)    Section  5.06(a)  shall not  apply to any such  information
that (i) is or becomes generally  available to the public other than as a result
of any disclosure or other action or inaction by the Seller or its  Subsidiaries
or  any of  their  respective  Representatives,  (ii)  is or  becomes  known  or
available to the Seller or its Subsidiaries on a  non-confidential  basis from a
source (other than the Purchaser or its Representatives)  that, to the knowledge
of the Seller,  is not under a legal  obligation to disclose such information or
(iii) was  independently  developed by the Seller or its  Subsidiaries or any of
their respective  Representatives  without reference to any information provided
by the Purchaser or any of its  Representatives  (except pursuant to clauses (i)
or  (ii))  that  was  known  to the  Seller  or its  Subsidiaries  prior to such
disclosure by the Purchaser or its Representatives.

              (c)    In the event that the Seller or its  Subsidiaries or any of
their respective  Representatives  become legally  compelled (by oral questions,
interrogatories,   requests  for  information  or  documents,  subpoenas,  civil
investigative demands or otherwise),  to disclose any information referred to in
Section 5.06(a), the Seller shall or shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide the
Purchaser with prompt written notice so that the Purchaser may seek a protective
order or other  appropriate  remedy.  Failing the entry of a protective order or
other appropriate  remedy or receipt of a waiver hereunder,  the Seller shall or
shall cause its Subsidiaries, as applicable, to furnish only that portion of the
information  which it is  advised  by its  counsel  is  legally  required  to be
furnished  and shall  exercise  its  commercially  reasonable  efforts to obtain
reliable   assurance  that   confidential   treatment  shall  be  accorded  such
information.

              SECTION  5.07.  THE  DISTRIBUTION  AGREEMENTS.  (a)  Prior  to the
Closing Date, the Seller shall, and the Seller shall cause the Company to, enter
into each of the Distribution Agreements.

              (b)    From  the  date  of  execution  of any of the  Distribution
Agreements  pursuant to Section 5.07(a) until the Closing Date, the Seller shall
not materially alter,  amend or modify such  Distribution  Agreement without the
prior written  consent of the Purchaser;  PROVIDED,  that,  notwithstanding  the
foregoing, nothing in this Section 5.07 or any other provision of this Agreement
shall prohibit the Seller from, at any time prior to the Closing Date,  amending
any  schedules  of the  Separation  and  Distribution  Agreement,  to make  such
additions to or  modifications  of such  Schedules as are  necessary to make the
information  set forth  therein  true,  accurate  and  complete in all  material
respects; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Seller shall not make any such alteration,
amendment or  modification  to the schedules of the Separation and  Distribution
Agreement  that  materially  adversely  affects the  financial  interests of the
Purchaser.

              SECTION 5.08. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. During the period from the date
hereof to the Closing Date (unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section
10.03),  the Seller  shall,  and shall cause each member of the Company Group to
(a) conduct and maintain the Business in

                                      -39-
<PAGE>


the ordinary  course of business  consistent with past practice and (b) take all
reasonable   steps   available  to  maintain  the  goodwill  of  the   Business.
Notwithstanding   the   immediately   preceding   sentence,   unless   otherwise
contemplated by this Agreement, the Distribution Agreements, the Transactions or
the  Internal  Restructuring,  during  the  period  from the date  hereof to the
Closing (unless earlier terminated in accordance with Section 10.03), the Seller
shall  not,  and shall  cause  each of its  Subsidiaries  not to take any of the
following  actions solely with respect to the Company,  the other members of the
Company  Group  and the  Business  without  the  prior  written  consent  of the
Purchaser  (which such consent shall not be  unreasonably  withheld,  delayed or
conditioned):

              (a)    amend the  certificate  of  incorporation,  bylaws or other
similar  corporate  governance  instrument  of the  Company  or any of the other
members of the Company  Group,  or subdivide or reclassify in any way any of the
Company's Capital Stock or change or agree to change in any manner the rights of
the Company's outstanding Capital Stock;

subdivision  thereof,  or otherwise,  including the amount paid in settlement of
any litigation  commenced or threatened,  and shall promptly  reimburse them, as
and  when  incurred,  for  any  legal  or  other  expenses  incurred  by them in
connection with  investigating any claims and defending any actions,  insofar as
any such  Losses  arise out of or are based  upon (i) any  untrue  statement  or
alleged  untrue  statement of a material  fact by any  Participating  Management
Member  at any such  drafting  session  or road  show  presentation  or (ii) the
omission or alleged  omission to state a material  fact required to be stated by
such  Participating  Management  Member in order to make his/her  statements not
misleading  to a  prospective  investor;  PROVIDED  FURTHER  that the  foregoing
indemnity shall not apply to any statements by Participating  Management Members
which (x) are slanderous against the Purchaser or its Affiliates,  (y) are based
on the gross negligence or willful  misconduct of such  Participating  Member or
(z) such  Participating  Member knows to be untrue or misleading.  The Purchaser
shall  promptly,  upon  request  by the  Seller,  reimburse  the  Seller for all
documented  out-of-pocket  expenses  incurred by the Seller or its Affiliates or
representatives  in connection with such cooperation.  Nothing contained in this

Purchaser Indemnified Party under Article VIII hereof.

                                   ARTICLE VI

Purchaser or an Affiliate of the  Purchaser  from making  general  solicitations

Affiliate of the Purchaser from making general  solicitations  of employment (or
engaging  search firms to make such  solicitations)  not  specifically  directed
toward  employees  of the Seller or any of its  Subsidiaries  and/or  hiring any
employee who responds to any such general solicitation or initiates contact with
the portfolio company of the Purchaser or Affiliate without solicitation.

       pertaining to each Financing to be complete in all material respects with
       respect to the Company's interest in such Financing; or

                     (v)    any  claims  of   stockholders   of  the  Seller  in
       connection  with  the   transactions   contemplated   hereby  or  by  the
       Distribution Agreements.

              (b)    Any claims for  indemnification  made  pursuant  to Section

following:

                     (i)    any  breach or  inaccuracy  of a  representation  or

              SECTION 8.03. CLAIMS PROCEDURE.

              (a)    Except with respect to third party claims, actions or suits
covered  by  Section  8.04,  any  Purchaser  Indemnified  Party  or  any  Seller
Indemnified  Party who  wishes to make a claim  for  indemnification  for a Loss
pursuant to this Article VIII (an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY") shall give written notice
to each  Person from whom  indemnification  is being  claimed (an  "INDEMNIFYING
PARTY") with reasonable  promptness after the Indemnified  Party's  discovery of
the  facts and  circumstances  giving  rise to the  indemnification  claim.  The
Indemnified  Party shall  supply the  Indemnifying  Party such  information  and
documents as it has in its possession  regarding  such claim,  together with all
pertinent  information  in its  possession  regarding  the amount of the Loss it
asserts it has sustained or incurred,  and will permit the Indemnifying Party to
inspect such other records and books in the possession of the Indemnified  Party
and  relating to the claim and  asserted  Loss as the  Indemnifying  Party shall
reasonably  request.  The Indemnifying  Party shall have a period of thirty (30)
days after receipt by the Indemnifying Party of such notice and such evidence to
either  (i) agree to the  payment of the Loss to the  Indemnified  Party or (ii)
contest the payment of the Loss. If the Indemnifying  Party does not agree to or
contest  the  payment  of the Loss  within  such  thirty  (30) day  period,  the
Indemnifying  Party  shall be deemed to have  accepted  all of the Loss.  If the
Indemnifying  Party agrees to the payment of the Loss or has been deemed to have
accepted all of the Loss,  then the  Indemnifying  Party shall,  within ten (10)
Business Days after such agreement or acceptance,  pay to the Indemnified  Party
the  amount  of the  Loss  that is  payable  pursuant  to,  and  subject  to the
limitations  set forth in, this  Article  VIII.  The failure of the  Indemnified
Party to give the notice referred to herein with reasonable promptness shall not
relieve the  Indemnifying  Party of its  indemnification  obligations  hereunder
except to the extent that the  Indemnifying  Party is actually  prejudiced  as a
result of the failure to give such notice.

              SECTION 8.04. THIRD PARTY CLAIMS

              (a)    If any claim, action at law or suit in equity is instituted
by a third  party  against  an  Indemnified  Party  with  respect  to  which  an
Indemnified  Party  intends to claim  indemnification  for any Losses under this
Article  VIII,  such  Indemnified   Party  shall  give  written  notice  to  the
Indemnifying Party of such claim, action or suit with reasonable promptness. The
failure to give the notice  required by this  Section  8.04(a)  with  reasonable
promptness  shall not  relieve  the  Indemnifying  Party of its  indemnification
obligations  hereunder  except  to the  extent  that the  Indemnifying  Party is
actually prejudiced as a result of the failure to give such notice.

              (b)    The  Indemnifying  Party  shall have thirty (30) days after
receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control,  at the expense of the
Indemnifying  Party,  of the settlement or defense  thereof and the  Indemnified
Party shall cooperate with it in connection  therewith.  Any  Indemnified  Party
shall have the right to employ separate  counsel in any such action or claim and
to participate in the defense thereof, but the fees and expenses of such counsel
shall not be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party.

              (c)    The  Indemnified  Party and the  Indemnifying  Party  shall
cooperate  with  each  other to the  fullest  extent  possible  in regard to all
matters  relating  to the  third-party  claim,  including,  without  limitation,
corrective  actions  required by  Applicable  Law,  assertion of  defenses,  the
determination,  mitigation,  negotiation  and settlement of all amounts,  costs,
actions,  penalties,  damages and the like related thereto,  access to the books
and records of the parties  hereto and their  Subsidiaries,  and, if  necessary,
providing  the party  controlling  the  defense of the

                                      -52-
<PAGE>


third party claim and its counsel with any powers of attorney or other documents
required  to permit the party  controlling  the defense of the third party claim
and its counsel to act on behalf of the other party.

              (d)    Neither the Indemnified  Party nor the  Indemnifying  Party
shall settle any such third party claim  without the consent of the other party,
which  consent  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld,  conditioned  or  delayed;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that if such settlement  involves the payment of money only
and  the  release  of  all  claims  and  the  Indemnified  Party  is  completely
indemnified therefore and nonetheless refuses to consent to such settlement, the
Indemnifying  Party shall cease to be obligated for such third party claim.  Any
compromise  or  settlement of the claim under this Section 8.04 shall include as
an  unconditional  term  thereof  the giving by the  claimant in question to the
Indemnifying  Party and the Indemnified Party of a release of all liabilities in
respect of such claims.

              SECTION  8.05.  TERMINATION  OF  INDEMNIFICATION  FOR  BREACHES OF
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The obligations to indemnify and hold harmless a
party hereto pursuant to (i) Sections  8.01(a)(i) and 8.02(a)(i) shall terminate
when the applicable  representation or warranty  terminates  pursuant to Section
10.01;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that such obligation to indemnify and hold harmless
shall not terminate with respect to any item as to which the  Indemnified  Party
shall have,  before the expiration of the applicable  period,  previously made a
claim,  with  reasonable  specificity,  in  accordance  with Section 8.03 to the
Indemnifying Party.

              SECTION    8.06.    LIMITATIONS    ON    INDEMNITY    OBLIGATIONS.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement,  the maximum aggregate
liability of any Indemnifying  Party (including any costs and expenses  incurred
by any  Indemnified  Party in connection  with defending any third party claims)
pursuant to Sections 8.01(a)(i),  8.01(a)(iii),  8.01(a)(iv) and 8.02(a)(i),  as
applicable,  shall not exceed Seventy Million Dollars  ($70,000,000);  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that notwithstanding the foregoing,  the maximum aggregate liability of
the  Seller  (including  any  costs  and  expenses  incurred  by  any  Purchaser
Indemnified  Party in  connection  with  defending  any third party  claims) for
breach of any of the  representations  and  warranties  provided in Section 3.09
(Employee Benefit Plans),  Section 3.15  (Environmental  Matters),  Section 3.17
(Taxes)  and  Section  3.18  (Financing)  shall not  exceed  an amount  equal to
twenty-four percent (24%) of the Purchase Price.

              SECTION  8.07.  LOSSES NET OF  INSURANCE,  ETC.  The amount of any
Losses for which  indemnification  is provided  under this Article VIII shall be
net of (a) any amounts actually  received by the Indemnified Party or any of its
Subsidiaries  pursuant to any  indemnification by or  indemnification  agreement
with any third party in relation to such Losses,  (b) any insurance  proceeds or
other cash  receipts or sources of  reimbursement  received  by the  Indemnified
Party or any of its  Subsidiaries  as an offset against such Losses (each Person
named in clauses (a) and (b), a "COLLATERAL SOURCE"), and (c) an amount equal to
the present value of the Tax benefit,  if any,  attributable to such Losses. The
Indemnifying Party may require an Indemnified Party to assign the rights to seek
recovery from Collateral Sources; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Indemnifying Party
will then be  responsible  for pursuing  such claim at its own  expense.  If the
amount to be netted  hereunder in connection  with a Collateral  Source from any
payment  required under Section 8.01 or 8.02 is determined  after payment by the
Indemnifying Party of any amount otherwise required to be paid to an Indemnified
Party under this Article VIII, the Indemnified

                                      -53-
<PAGE>


Party shall repay to the Indemnifying Party,  promptly after such determination,
any amount that the  Indemnifying  Party  would not have had to pay  pursuant to
this Article VIII had such  determination been made at the time of such payment,
and any excess recovery from a Collateral  Source shall be applied to reduce any
future payments to be made by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to Section 8.01 or
8.02.

              SECTION 8.08.  INDIRECT  LOSSES;  MITIGATION.  The parties  hereto
agree  that  Losses   hereunder  shall  not  include  any  incidental   damages,
consequential  damages,   special  damages,  damages  arising  out  of  business
interruption  or lost profits,  damages  arising  through the application of any
statutory multiplier to any Losses or punitive damages. Any party hereto seeking
indemnification  under this Agreement  shall take and shall cause its Affiliates
and their respective directors and officers to take all commercially  reasonable
steps to  mitigate  the amount of any Losses  upon  becoming  aware of any event
which would  reasonably be expected to, or does,  give rise  thereto,  including
incurring  costs only to the minimum  extent  necessary  to remedy the breach or
inaccuracy which gives rise to such Losses.

              SECTION 8.09. OTHER  LIMITATIONS.(a)  Notwithstanding any contrary
provision of this Agreement,  under no circumstances  shall the Seller indemnify
any Purchaser  Indemnified Party for Taxes relating to Post Closing Tax Periods.
To the extent permitted by law, indemnification payments made hereunder shall be
treated as adjustments to purchase price for tax purposes.

              SECTION 8.10. SOLE  REMEDY/WAIVER.  The parties hereto acknowledge
and agree that the  remedies  provided  for in this  Article VIII shall be their
sole and  exclusive  remedy for any  misrepresentations  or breach of warranties
contained in this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing, the parties hereto
hereby  waive to the fullest  extent  permitted by  applicable  Law, any and all
other rights and claims  (including  rights of  contributions,  if any) known or
unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it
may have against the other party hereto or any of its  Representatives,  arising
under or based upon any law  (including  any such law relating to  environmental
matters  or  arising  under or based  upon any  securities  law,  common  law or
otherwise) for any  misrepresentations or breach of warranties contained in this
Agreement, except for rights and claims arising from fraud.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   TAX MATTERS

              SECTION 9.01 TAX RETURNS

              (a)    The Seller  shall have the  exclusive  authority to prepare
and file or cause to be  prepared  and filed (i) all Tax Returns for all members

Closing Date  including any Estimated Tax Returns due on or prior to the Closing

              (b)    The Purchaser  shall prepare (in  accordance  with the past
practices of the Company and its subsidiaries) the initial draft of all Straddle
Period Tax Returns of the Company and its subsidiaries (other than Estimated Tax
Returns due on or prior to the Closing  Date) and shall submit such Tax Returns,
along  with a  calculation  of the  Seller's  portion of any  Pre-Closing  Taxes
(reduced by any Prepaid Taxes) set forth on such Tax Returns,  to the Seller for
approval no later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date thereof.  No later
than fifteen (15) days after the receipt of such Tax Return from the  Purchaser,
the Seller shall notify the Purchaser of any  reasonable  objections  the Seller
may have to items set forth in such draft Tax Returns and/or the  calculation of
such Taxes for which the Seller is  responsible.  The Purchaser and Seller agree
to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection, it being understood and
agreed that in the absence of any such  resolution,  any and all such objections
shall be resolved in a manner consistent with the past practices of with respect
to such items unless otherwise  required by law. If the Seller and the Purchaser
cannot  resolve  such  matter,  the  issue  involved  shall be  submitted  to an
independent  public  accounting  firm  acceptable  to both  the  Seller  and the
Purchaser;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that if the dispute or disagreement  involves a
matter of legal  interpretation,  then upon the written  consent of both parties
such  dispute  shall be resolved by such  independent  public  accounting  firm,
otherwise such independent  accounting firm shall select an outside attorney (1)
experienced in federal income tax law and (2) mutually  acceptable to the Seller
and the  Purchaser  (which  acceptance  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld) to
resolve such dispute or  disagreement.  If the Seller and the  Purchaser  cannot
agree on an  independent  public  accounting  firm,  the first  Big Four  Public
Accounting Firm (on an alphabetical  basis) that is not currently serving as the
auditor of any of the Seller,  Company or Purchaser shall be selected to resolve
the dispute.  The decision of the  independent  public  accounting firm (and any
outside  attorney  selected by such  accounting  firm) in resolving  the dispute
shall be final and binding.  The fees and expenses  incurred with respect to the
independent  public  accounting  firm  resolving  the dispute shall be allocated
fifty percent (50%) to the Seller and fifty percent (50%) to the Purchaser.  All
other fees and expenses  incurred in resolving the dispute shall be borne by the
party hereto that incurs such fees and expenses.  All such Tax Returns shall not
be filed without the prior written consent of the Seller, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

              (c)    For purposes of this Agreement, Taxes related to a Straddle
Period  shall  be  apportioned  between  the  Pre-Closing  Tax  Period  and  the
Post-Closing Tax Period as follows:  (A) in the case of Taxes other than income,
sale and use and  withholding  Taxes, on a per-diem basis and (B) in the case of
income,  sales and use and  withholding  Taxes, as determined from the books and
records of the Seller, the Company and/or the relevant  subsidiary as though the
taxable  year  of  the  Seller,  the  Company  and/or  the  relevant  subsidiary
terminated at the close of business on the Closing Date.

              (d)    The Purchaser shall have the exclusive authority to prepare
and file or cause to be  prepared  and filed all Tax  Returns for all members of
the Company Group for Taxable years or periods beginning after the Closing Date.

              (e)    The  Seller  and the  Purchaser  agree  that  Combined  Tax
Returns  and Income Tax Returns  filed for tax  periods  that begin prior to the
Closing  Date will reflect a short  taxable  year for the Company  ending on the
Closing Date in any state, local or foreign taxing

                                      -55-

jurisdiction  in which  such tax year is  allowed  by  administrative  practice,
whether or not required by law.

              (f)    Each Party  hereto  shall bear all costs  incurred by it in
preparing  and  filing  the Tax  Returns  they are  responsible  for under  this
Agreement.

              SECTION 9.02 PAYMENT OF TAXES. (a) the Seller shall be responsible
and  liable  for the  timely  payment  of any and all Taxes  imposed  on or with
respect  to the  properties,  income  and  operations  of the  Company  and  its
subsidiaries  for all Pre-Closing  Periods,  to the extent such Taxes exceed the
amount of liability accrued for such Taxes on the Estimated Closing Date Balance
Sheet of the Company and its subsidiaries as of the Closing Date.

              (b)    The Seller will pay the Seller's portion of the Pre-Closing
Taxes related to a Straddle Period Tax Return (as determined pursuant to 9.01(b)
above) no later  than the later of: one (1) day prior to the due date of the Tax
Return for which such  Taxes  relate to the extent the Seller and the  Purchaser
have  reached an  agreement on the amount of such Taxes by that date or the only
dispute relates solely to the total amount of Tax shown on the Tax Return and in
the case of a dispute  between the Seller and the Purchaser  that solely relates
to the  percentage  of the total amount of Tax shown on the Straddle  Period Tax
Return allocated to the Seller, the Seller shall pay (i) the amount it believes,
in good faith,  is its allocable  portion of such Taxes within one (1) day prior
to the due date of the Tax  Return  for which  such  Taxes  relate  and (ii) the
remainder,  if  any,  determined  to be owed by the  Seller  by the  independent
accounting  firm described in paragraph (b) above within two (2) days after such
accounting  firm has  determined  the  Seller's  liability  with respect to such
amounts.  In the event a payment is made  pursuant  to this  paragraph  (c) with
respect to amounts that are in dispute,  such payment will be adjusted following
the resolution of the dispute.

              (c)    All  transfer,  sales and use,  value added,  registration,
documentary,  stamp and similar Taxes (the  "Transfer  Taxes")  arising from the
sale of the Shares  under  Section  2.01(a)  hereof or the deemed sale of assets
under Section 338(h)(10) shall be paid by the Purchaser.

              (d)    To the extent the  Prepaid  Taxes  exceed the Taxes owed by
the Seller for such Straddle  Period (as determined  pursuant to Section 9.01(b)
above)), the Purchaser shall pay the Seller such excess.

              (e)    No member of the Company  Group  shall  carry back  losses,
credits or other Tax Attributes  attributable  to a  Post-Closing  Tax Period to
offset Taxes attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

              SECTION 9.03 AUDITS AND CONTESTS. (a) The Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Seller in writing upon receipt by the  Purchaser or any  affiliate of
the Purchaser  (including the Company or any member of the Company Group) of any
communication  with  respect  to any Tax Matter (or  pending or  threatened  Tax
Matter) relating to any Tax period beginning on or before the Closing Date or to
the Specified  Leases.  The Purchaser  shall  include with such  notification  a
complete  copy of any written  communication  received by the  Purchaser  or any
affiliate of the Purchaser  (including  the Company or any member of the Company
Group) in respect of such

                                      -56-
<PAGE>


Tax Matter.  The failure of the Purchaser to promptly forward such  notification
in accordance  with the  immediately  preceding  sentence  shall not relieve the
Seller of any  obligation  under this  Agreement,  except to the extent that the
failure to promptly forward such notification actually prejudices the ability of
the Seller to contest such Tax Matter.

              (b)    The Seller (or such member of the Pitney Bowes Group as the
Seller shall  designate) shall have the sole right to represent the interests of
the members of the Pitney Bowes Group and the members of the Company  Group,  to
employ  counsel of its choice at its expense and to make  decisions with respect
to settlements in any Tax Matter relating to (A) any consolidated federal Income
Tax Returns of the Pitney Bowes Consolidated Group, (B) any Combined Tax Return,
(C) any Tax Return of any member of the Pitney Bowes Group,  (D) any Tax Returns
for all members of the Company Group for all taxable years or periods  ending on
or before the Closing Date and (E) the elections  contemplated by this Agreement
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code or under any analogous  provisions of state
or local law.

              (c)    The  Purchaser  (or such member of the Company Group as the
Purchaser shall  designate) shall have the sole right to represent the interests
of the  members of the  Company  Group,  to employ  counsel of its choice at its
expense and to make  decisions  with  respect to  settlements  in any Tax Matter
relating  to any Tax  Returns of the  Company or its  subsidiaries  relating  to
Post-Closing Taxable Periods (other than Straddle Period Tax Returns); PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that, to the extent that such Tax Matter involves any issue that could
materially  affect the amount of Taxes for which any member of the Pitney  Bowes
Group is liable in a Pre-Closing  Tax Period (or for other Taxes with respect to
which the Seller is  required to  indemnify  the  Purchaser  pursuant to Section
9.07(a)),  the  Purchaser  shall (i) keep the Seller  informed  of all  material
developments relating to such Tax Matter; (ii) act in a reasonable manner and in
good  faith in  discussing  such  issue  with the  relevant  tax  authority  and
contesting  such Tax  Matter;  and  (iii)  contest,  and  shall  not  settle  or
compromise  such Tax Matter unless the Purchaser  reasonably  determines in good
faith  that (x)  based on  discussions  with tax  counsel,  such  settlement  or
compromise is an  appropriate  resolution of such Tax Matter taking into account
only the applicable  facts,  applicable law and hazards and costs of controversy
in respect of such Tax Matter  standing  alone and (y) the Purchaser  would find
such  settlement  acceptable if the Purchaser  (and not any member of the Pitney
Bowes Group) were  required to bear the tax  consequences  of the  settlement of
such Tax Matter for all relevant Tax periods.

              (d)    The Seller (or such member of the Pitney Bowes Group as the
Seller shall  designate) shall have the sole right to represent the interests of
the members of the Pitney  Bowes Group and the members of the Company  Group and
to employ counsel of its choice in any Tax Matter related to any Straddle Period
Tax  Return.  The Seller  shall have  absolute  discretion  with  respect to any
decisions to be made,  or the nature of any action to be taken,  with respect to
any Tax  Matter  related  to a  Straddle  Period  Tax  Return  described  in the
preceding sentence;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, with respect to Tax Matters that affect
the Company's Tax liability, (i) the Seller shall keep the Purchaser informed of
all material developments and events relating to such matters to the extent they
affect  the  Company's  Tax  liability,  (ii) at its own cost and  expense,  the
Purchaser  shall have the right to  participate  in the  defense of any such tax
claim,  and (iii) neither the Seller nor the Purchaser  shall take any action in
respect of such  claim  without  the  consent of the other  party  hereto,  such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

              SECTION  9.04  THIRD  PARTY  INDEMNITIES.  (a) If a member  of the
Company  Group has the right to receive (or actually  receives) a payment from a
Person  that  is not a  member  of the  Company  Group  (whether  by  reason  of
indemnity,  reimbursement  agreement  or  otherwise)  with  respect to (or items
related to) (i) Pre-Closing Taxes of a member of the Company Group or (ii) Taxes
of a member of the Pitney  Bowes  Group in each case,  other than such Taxes for
which the  Purchaser is liable under this  Agreement,  such payment shall be for
the account of the Seller and the  Purchaser  shall pay to the Seller the amount
of any such  payment  within ten (10) days after a member of the  Company  Group
receives such payment.  The Purchaser shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain
any payment described in the preceding  sentence;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the
Seller  shall pay or promptly  reimburse  the  Purchaser  for all  Out-of-Pocket
Expenses  incurred in such attempt.  To the extent it is legally permitted to do
so, the Purchaser  shall cause the Company to assign to the Seller all rights to
receive such  payment,  including  any rights to enforce such payment (and shall
take all actions to facilitate such  assignment,  such as providing any required
notice to any Person and executing any  documents) so long as the Seller pays or
promptly  reimburses  the  Purchaser  for  all  Out-of-Pocket  Expenses  related
thereto.  If the  Purchaser  is unable to cause the Company to assign all of its
rights to such  payment,  the  Purchaser  shall permit the Seller to control all
aspects of the  enforcement  of such rights and shall  cooperate with the Seller
consistent  with the  principles set forth in Section 9.05 hereof so long as the
Seller pays or promptly reimburses the Purchaser for all Out-of-Pocket  Expenses
related thereto.

              (b)    If a member of the Pitney  Bowes  Group has the right to
receive (or  actually  receives) a payment from a Person that is not a member of
the Pitney Bowes Group (whether by reason of indemnity,  reimbursement agreement
or  otherwise)  with  respect to (or items  related to) Taxes of a member of the
Company  Group for any  Post-Closing  Tax Period other than such Taxes for which
the Seller is liable under this Agreement, such payment shall be for the account
of the Company and the Seller shall pay to the  Purchaser the amount of any such
payment  within ten (10) days after a member of the Pitney Bowes Group  receives
such payment.  The Seller shall use all reasonable efforts to obtain any payment
described in the preceding sentence; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Purchaser shall
pay or promptly reimburse the Seller for all Out-of-Pocket  Expenses incurred in
such attempt.  To the extent it is legally  permitted to do so, the Seller shall
assign (or cause to be  assigned)  to the  Company  all  rights to receive  such
payment,  including  any  rights to  enforce  such  payment  (and shall take all
actions to facilitate such assignment,  such as providing any required notice to
any  Person  and  executing  any  documents)  so long as the  Purchaser  pays or
promptly  reimburses the Seller for all Out-of-Pocket  Expenses related thereto.
If the Seller is unable to assign all of its rights to such payment,  the Seller
shall  permit the  Purchaser to control all aspects of the  enforcement  of such
rights and shall cooperate with the Purchaser consistent with the principles set
forth  in  Section  9.05  hereof  so long  as the  Purchaser  pays  or  promptly
reimburses the Seller for all Out-of-Pocket Expenses related thereto.

              SECTION 9.05 COOPERATION.  (a) Beginning on the Closing Date, each
of the Seller  and the  Purchaser,  on behalf of itself  and each  member of the
Pitney Bowes Group and the Company Group, respectively, agrees to use good faith

Purchaser's  expense,  all information  within the Company's  possession and not
otherwise  reasonably  available to the Seller that the Seller shall  reasonably

Seller to prepare any Tax Returns required to be filed by the Seller pursuant to

another party hereto,  and (ii) any Tax Matters relating to such Pre-Closing Tax
Returns, Straddle Period Tax Returns, or to any Pre-Closing Taxes payable by, on
behalf of, or with respect to, another party hereto.

              (b)    The parties hereto shall,  from and after the Closing Date,

destroy  or  dispose  of or allow the  destruction  or  disposition  of such Tax
Materials  without first having offered in writing to deliver such Tax Materials
to the other party hereto at such other party's  hereto  expense.  If such party
fails to request such Tax Materials within ninety (90) days after receipt of the
notice described in the preceding  sentence,  the other party hereto may dispose

              SECTION 9.07  INDEMNIFICATION  FOR TAXES.  (a) The Seller shall be
liable for and shall  indemnify,  defend and hold  harmless the  Purchaser on an
after-tax basis against (i) all Pre-Closing  Taxes of the Company and members of

              (c)    The Purchaser shall have no right to  indemnification  from

              (iii)  by either the Seller or the Purchaser,  if any Governmental

       termination shall become effective only if the breach or violation is not

       representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of the Seller
       set forth in this  Agreement,  which breach or violation  would result in
       the  failure to (A)  satisfy the  conditions  set forth in Sections  7.02
       (except for the conditions in Sections 7.02(d), which are provided for in
       other applicable  provisions of this Section  10.03(a)) or (B) consummate
       the  Transactions  except that, if such breach or violation is curable by
       the Seller through the exercise of its commercially  reasonable  efforts,

       termination  shall not be effective,  and such  termination  shall become
       effective  only if the breach or violation is not cured within the Seller
       Cure Period; or

       simultaneously  with the  termination  of this Agreement by such party as
       contemplated hereby;

              (iii)  by the Purchaser or the Seller in  accordance  with Section

       terminated  in  accordance  with  Section  10.03(a)(ii)  on or after  the
       Termination  Date in the event the Seller's Option is not exercised,  the

       substantially  all  of the  Business  in a  transaction  or a  series  of
       transactions,  the Seller shall pay in cash to the  Purchaser,  not later
       than the date on which such sale is consummated, the Termination Payment;
       or

              (iv)   by the Purchaser or the Seller in  accordance  with Section

       terminated  in  accordance  with  Section  10.03(a)(ii)  on or after  the
       Extended  Termination Date in the event the Seller's Option is exercised,
       the Seller  enters  into an  agreement  with  respect to a sale of all or
       substantially  all  of the  Business  in a  transaction  or a  series  of
       transactions,  the Seller shall pay in cash to the  Purchaser,  not later
       than  the  date on  which  such  agreement  is  executed  by the  Seller,

       As used in this Section 10.03(b),  a "sale of all or substantially all of
       the  Business"  shall  mean a sale of 51% or more  of the  assets  of the

REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,  EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT
SUCH OTHER  PARTY  WOULD NOT,  IN THE EVENT OF  LITIGATION,  SEEK TO ENFORCE THE
FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES  THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE
BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS  AGREEMENT  AND THE OTHER EQUITY  DOCUMENTS  BY,
AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.05.

under this  Agreement.  The payment of such expenses is in addition to any other
relief to which such other party may be entitled.

such Person ever had, now has, or shall or may have in the future.

              SECTION 10.08.  MODIFICATIONS  AND  AMENDMENTS.  (a) No amendment,
modification  or termination  of this Agreement  shall be binding upon any party
unless executed in writing by the parties hereto intending to be bound thereby.

any party to this  Agreement may waive any condition,  right,  breach or default
that such party has the right to waive;  PROVIDED,  that such waiver will not be
effective  against the waiving party unless it is in writing,  is signed by such
party, and specifically refers to this Agreement. Waivers may be made in advance
or after the right  waived  has  arisen or the  breach  or  default  waived  has
occurred. Subject to Section 3.25(c), any waiver may be conditional.  Subject to
Section 3.25(c), no waiver of any breach of any agreement or provision contained
herein shall be deemed a waiver of either of any preceding or succeeding  breach

<PAGE>


Transactions  shall be paid by the party  incurring  such  costs  and  expenses,
whether or not the  Transactions  shall be  consummated,  including all fees and
expenses of its legal counsel, financial advisors and accountants.

              (b)    Other  than  the use of  JPMorgan  Securities  Inc.  by the
Seller and Lehman  Brothers and IXIS Capital  Markets by the Purchaser,  each of
the parties  represents  to the other that neither it nor any of its  Affiliates
has used a broker or other  intermediary in connection with the Transactions for
whose fees or expenses any other party will be liable.

              (c)    The   parties   acknowledge   that  each  of  the   Expense
Reimbursement and the Termination Payment provided for in Section 10.03(b) is an
integral  part of the  Transactions  and not a penalty,  and that,  without  the
Expense  Reimbursement  and  Termination  Payment the  Purchaser  would not have
entered into this Agreement.

liability of any party for any breach in any material  respect of any provisions
of this Agreement that remain in effect after the termination of this Agreement.
The Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser,  and the Purchaser shall indemnify the
Seller,  against,  and each of them  agrees to hold the  other of them  harmless

similar  capacity by reason of services  allegedly  rendered to the indemnifying
party in connection with the Transactions.

              SECTION 10.12. PRESS RELEASES AND PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. All public
announcements or public disclosures relating to the Transactions or the Internal
Restructuring  shall be made only if mutually  agreed upon by the Seller and the
Purchaser,  except to the extent such  disclosure is required by law or by stock
exchange regulation;  PROVIDED, that (a) to the extent reasonably practicable, a
party hereto shall provide the other party hereto with a reasonable  opportunity
to review any public announcement prior to its release, (b) no such announcement
or disclosure (except as required by law or by stock exchange  regulation) shall
identify the Purchaser without the Purchaser's prior consent.

              SECTION 10.13. ASSIGNMENT; NO THIRD PARTY BENEFICIARIES.  (a) This
Agreement and the rights,  duties and obligations  hereunder may not be assigned
or delegated, in whole or in part, by any party hereto without the prior written
consent of the other party hereto; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that, subject to the last
sentence of this Section  10.13(a),  the Purchaser may assign this Agreement and
its rights,  duties and obligations  hereunder to any of its Affiliates  without
the prior written consent of the Seller;  PROVIDED  FURTHER,  that the Purchaser
may, without the prior written consent of the Seller,  grant Liens in respect of
its rights and  interests  hereunder  to its  lenders,  and the  parties  hereto
consent to any  exercise  by such  lenders of their  rights  and  remedies  with
respect to such collateral; PROVIDED FURTHER that any such grant of Liens to the
Purchaser's  lenders  pursuant to the  preceding  proviso  shall not relieve the
Purchaser of its duties or obligations hereunder. Each assignee (pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Section 10.13) must agree in writing to be bound by
the terms of this Agreement and each of the Purchaser Transaction Documents,  if
applicable,  to the same extent, and in the same manner, as the Purchaser or the
transferring  assignee  prior to the  assignment or  delegation,  in whole or in
part, of this Agreement and the rights, duties and obligations hereunder to such
assignee. Any

                                      -66-
<PAGE>


purported  assignment or delegation of rights,  duties or obligations  hereunder
made in violation of this Section 10.13(a) shall be void and of no effect.

              (b)    This Agreement and the  provisions  hereof shall be binding
upon and shall  inure to the  benefit  of each of the  parties  hereto and their
respective  successors.  This  Agreement is not intended to confer any rights or
benefits on any Persons other than as expressly set forth in this Section 10.13,
Article VIII or Article IX hereof.

              SECTION  10.14.  SEVERABILITY.  This  Agreement  shall  be  deemed
severable,  and the  invalidity  or  unenforceability  of any term or  provision
hereof shall not affect the validity or  enforceability  of this Agreement or of
any other term or provision hereof.  Furthermore, in lieu of any such invalid or
unenforceable  term or provision,  the parties hereto intend that there shall be
added  as a part of this  Agreement  a  provision  as  similar  in terms to such
invalid  or  unenforceable  provision  as  may be  possible  and  be  valid  and
enforceable.

              SECTION  10.15.  COUNTERPARTS.  This  Agreement may be executed in
counterparts,  each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

              SECTION 10.16. REMEDIES; SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. Notwithstanding any
other  provision of this  Agreement  that may provide for a remedy,  each of the
Seller  and the  Purchaser  acknowledges  that  money  damages  would  not be an
adequate  remedy under any  Applicable Law if a party hereto fails to perform in
any  material  respect  any of its  obligations  hereunder  (including,  without
limitation,  any and all  obligations  under  Section 5.06 or Section  6.03) and
accordingly  agree that each party  hereto (in  addition to any other  remedy to
which it may be entitled under Applicable Law or in equity) shall be entitled to
seek to compel specific performance of the obligations of the other party hereto
under this  Agreement,  without the posting of any bond, in accordance  with the
terms and conditions of this  Agreement,  and if any action should be brought in
equity to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement, no party hereto shall
raise the defense that there is an adequate remedy under Applicable Law.

              SECTION 10.17. TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT.  For a period of ten
(10) calendar days  following the date hereof (the  "NEGOTIATION  PERIOD"),  the
Purchaser  and the Seller shall jointly (i) review the scope of the Services (as
such term is defined in the Transition Services Agreement)  described and listed
on the  schedules  of the  Transition  Services  Agreement  to  determine  which
Services can be deleted from such schedules and (ii) negotiate in good faith the
term for which such  Services  shall be  provided  by the Seller  following  the
Closing; PROVIDED, that in no event shall the term of any Service to be provided
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement exceed a period of nine (9) months
commencing on the Closing Date.  All other terms and  conditions  for transition
services shall be as set forth in the  Transition  Services  Agreement  attached
hereto as  EXHIBIT  B and are not  subject  to  further  negotiation.  If by the
expiration of the Negotiation Period the Purchaser and the Seller cannot resolve
any  differences  that they may have  with  respect  to the scope of  transition
services  to be  provided  and term  thereof,  the term for all  Services  to be
provided pursuant to the Transition  Services Agreement shall be for a term of 6
months and the Transition  Services Agreement attached hereto as EXHIBIT B shall
be modified  accordingly and thereafter shall be deemed final, and delivery of a
fully  executed  copy of such  agreement to the  Purchaser by the Seller and the
Company at or prior to

                                      -67-
<PAGE>


Closing  shall satisfy in full  Seller's  obligation  to deliver the  Transition
Services Agreement pursuant to Sections 2.02(b) and 7.02 hereof.
