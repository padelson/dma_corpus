(d) If Sellers have any objections to the Closing Statement, Sellers
shall deliver to Purchaser a statement (an "Objections Statement") setting
forth those items to which Sellers object (the "Disputed Items"). Sellers and
Purchaser shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the Disputed Items, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within thirty (30) days after the
delivery of the Objections Statement to Purchaser, Sellers and Purchaser
shall submit any unresolved Disputed Items to Grant Thornton LLP;  _provided_
that, if Grant Thornton LLP is unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity,
Sellers and Purchaser shall submit any unresolved Disputed Items to an
alternative mutually agreed upon independent accounting or valuation firm of
national reputation (such firm or such alternative firm, the "Resolution
Accounting Firm"). The Resolution Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and
not as an arbitrator. Should the Parties be unable to reach agreement on an
alternative Resolution Accounting Firm, if necessary, within thirty (30) days
after the delivery of the Objections Statement, either Party may seek the
appointment of an alternative Resolution Accounting Firm by requesting the
President of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales to
appoint a Resolution Accounting Firm in accordance with its President's
Appointments Scheme. Each Party may furnish to the Resolution Accounting Firm
such information and documents relevant to the Closing Statement or Estimated
Closing Statement (as the case may be), with copies of such submission and
all such documents and information being concurrently given to the
other Party. The Resolution Accounting Firm shall resolve each item of
disagreement based solely on the supporting material provided by Purchaser
and Sellers and in accordance with the Accounting Principles and not pursuant
to any independent review and may not assign a value to any particular item
greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by either Party or less
than the lowest value for such item claimed by either Party, in each case as
presented to the Resolution Accounting Firm. Sellers and Purchaser shall use
their respective Commercially Reasonable Efforts to cause the Resolution
Accounting Firm to resolve such unresolved Disputed Items and notify them in
writing of such resolution as soon as practicable, but in any event within
thirty (30) days after the date on which the Resolution Accounting Firm is
first retained. The decision of the Resolution Accounting Firm regarding each
of the Disputed Items shall be final, binding, and non-appealable by the
Parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that such decision may be corrected
or set aside by arbitrators pursuant to _Section 9.03_, but only if and only
to the extent that such decision is the result of Fraud, bad faith, or
palpable mistake or if the Resolution Accounting Firm has manifestly
violated the express terms of this _Section 2.04_. Each Party shall bear its
own costs and expenses in connection with the resolution of such dispute by
the Resolution Accounting Firm. The fees and expenses of the Resolution
Accounting Firm shall be borne on a proportionate basis by Purchaser and
Sellers based on the inverse proportion of the respective percentages of the
dollar value of Disputed Items determined in favor of Purchaser and Sellers,
respectively. Sellers and Purchaser shall, and Purchaser shall cause the
Acquired Entities to, cooperate fully with the Resolution Accounting Firm and
respond on a timely basis to all requests for information or access to
documents or personnel made by the Resolution Accounting Firm, all with the
intent to fairly and in good faith resolve all Disputed Items as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Once all Disputed Items are resolved, the
calculation of the Purchase Price (and the components thereof) on the Closing
Statement shall be adjusted, as appropriate, to reflect (i) any resolution of
Disputed Items as agreed between Purchaser and Sellers or (ii) any
determination of Disputed Items by the Resolution Accounting Firm, and the
Closing Statement and the final calculation of Purchase Price thereon (in each
case, as so adjusted) shall be final, binding, and non-appealable by the
Parties hereto. From Sellers' delivery of any Objection Statement until
the resolution of any Disputed Items set forth therein, Purchaser and the
Acquired Entities shall grant Sellers and their authorized Representatives
reasonable in-person and remote electronic access to all such workpapers and
other documents (and upon reasonable request such individuals shall be
provided copies of such documents) and all such personnel which their
Representatives may reasonably request which are relevant to such Objection
Statement and any Disputed Items set forth therein.

(c) General.

  



  

(i) Each Party shall cooperate with each other Party to the extent

its outside antitrust counsel with all reasonably available information in its
possession that is reasonably necessary or desirable for the preparation of
any filings or submissions which are required to be given or made to, or
responses to requests for information from, any Governmental Entity and
provide such assistance as the other Party shall reasonably request; (C)
promptly notify the other Party of any material written communication to such
Party or its Affiliates from any Governmental Entity regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and, subject to applicable
Law, permit the other Party to review in advance any proposed material
written communication in response to any of the foregoing; (D) not
participate, or permit any of its Affiliates to participate, in any
substantive meeting or discussion with any Governmental Entity in respect of
any filings, investigations, or inquiries concerning this Agreement unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other Party or its Affiliate the opportunity
to attend and participate in such meeting; and (E) promptly furnish the other
Party with copies of all material correspondence, filings, and communications
between such Party and its Affiliates and its Representatives, on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity or members of their respective staffs, on
the other hand. With respect to its obligations this under Agreement, to the
extent any of the documents or information are commercially or
competitively sensitive, Sellers or Purchaser as the case may be, may satisfy
their obligations by providing a description or summary of such documents or
information to the other Party's outside antitrust counsel, with the
understanding and agreement that such antitrust counsel shall not share such
summary with its client; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party nor their
Affiliates shall be obligated to provide any information that is subject to
the attorney-client privilege. Neither Party nor their Affiliates
shall withdraw or pull and re-file any merger notification or other filing

challenging the contemplated transactions as violating any antitrust or
competition law. If any Action or proceeding is instituted challenging the
contemplated transactions as violating any antitrust or competition Law, or
if any decree is entered, enforced, or attempted to be entered or enforced by
any Governmental Entity that would make completion of the contemplated
transactions unlawful or would delay the Closing, Purchaser shall, at its own
reasonable expense, contest and defend against any such claim or Action in
order to oppose the entry of such a Governmental Order and to secure the
withdrawal or nullification of any such Governmental Order until such
Governmental Order becomes final and non-appealable, except that
Purchaser may, at its own reasonable expense, agree with the applicable
Governmental Entity to accept such conditions or terms as may be demanded by
such Governmental Entity to permit the proposed transactions to be completed
without any expense to Sellers, and without the imposition of any terms or
conditions which would limit Sellers' business operations in any way or have
any adverse effect upon Sellers. However, Purchaser's Commercially Reasonable
Efforts obligation under this section shall not obligate Purchaser or its
Affiliates to propose, negotiate, commit, or effect, by consent decree, hold
separate orders, undertakings, or otherwise, the sale, divesture, license, or
other disposition of its and their assets, voting securities in Affiliates,
non-corporate interests in Affiliates, properties, or businesses, or of the
assets, properties, non-corporate interests, or businesses to be acquired
by it pursuant hereto.

(ii) Purchaser shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to,
take any action or enter into any agreement, transaction, or any agreement
to effect any transaction (including any merger or acquisition) that would
reasonably be expected to make it more materially difficult, or to increase
materially the time required, to (A) obtain the expiration or termination of
the waiting period under the HSR Act, the UK Enterprise Act, or any other
antitrust, competition, or trade regulation Law applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby; (B) avoid the entry of, the commencement of litigation

Entities necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
shall not limit any rights of Purchaser or its Affiliates to enter into any
Permitted Transfer or any other agreements or transactions between or among
Purchaser and one or more of its Affiliates.

Agreement and the Escrow Fee shall be paid by Purchaser; _provided_ ,

becomes due and payable prior to Purchaser's receipt from Sellers or the IRS
of a FIRPTA Certificate described in subsection (b) of the definition
thereof, a portion of any additional amount paid to Sellers pursuant to
_Section 2.04(e)_ shall be timely deposited by Purchaser with the Escrow
Agent in accordance with the Escrow Agreement such that the total amount so
deposited with the Escrow Agent is equal to the amount that Purchaser is
required to withhold under applicable Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that if
any additional costs or fees in excess of the Escrow Fee are due to the Escrow
Agent following the Closing, such costs and fees shall be borne fifty percent
(50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser.

duly qualified to do business and in good standing in all jurisdictions in
which the character of the properties owned or held under lease by it or the

where failure to so qualify does not have, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

may be or become necessary for such Party's execution and delivery of, and
the performance of its obligations under, this Agreement. Without limiting the
obligations of the Parties pursuant to the preceding sentence, (i) each Party
will use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to assist the other Parties in
obtaining all authorizations, consents, orders, and approvals of, and give all
notices and make all filings with, all Governmental Entities and Third
Parties that may be or become necessary for such Party's execution and
delivery of, and the performance of its obligations under, this Agreement and
(ii) Sellers will cause the Acquired Entities to use Commercially
Reasonable Efforts to obtain a Qualifying Estoppel from each landlord,
lessor, grantor, licensor or other applicable counterparty under the Land
Contracts set forth on _Schedule 6.01(a)_. Sellers shall be deemed to have
used Commercially Reasonable Efforts to obtain Qualifying Estoppels so long
as the Acquired Entities deliver a Qualifying Estoppel to all required
counterparties and undertake Commercially Reasonable Efforts thereafter to
make inquiries twice a month with such required counterparties as to
the status of the execution and return of the Qualifying Estoppel. The
delivery of executed and complete Qualifying Estoppels by such counterparties
to Sellers shall not be required to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 6.01_ shall not apply
to any approvals required under the HSR Act or by the CMA (or, in the event
that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement have been referred for
review by the European Commission under Article 22 of the EU Merger
Regulation, the European Commission), which are separately addressed in
_Section 2.08_.

(b) With respect to the Sellers Support Obligations, during the
Interim Period, Purchaser shall use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to (i)
secure the irrevocable and unconditional release of Sellers Indemnified Group
under any Sellers Support Obligations and the return to innogy SE of any
related Sellers Letters of Credit or Sellers Guarantees, (ii) if applicable,
negotiate with the counterparties to those Sellers Support Obligations for
which a replacement guarantee or any replacement letters of credit are
required in order to satisfy the condition to Closing set forth in _Section
2.07(b)(i)_ (with regard to the delivery of those items set forth in _Section
2.06(c)(iv)_), and (iii) enter into and deliver to the beneficiaries of such
Sellers Support Obligations (with prompt written notice to innogy SE) any
such replacement guarantees or replacement letters of credit; _provided_ , 
_however,_ that Purchaser shall not be required to (A) increase the amount of,
extend the term of, or otherwise modify any other term in an adverse manner
to Purchaser or its Affiliates (including the Acquired Entities after
Closing), from the terms set forth in the related Credit Support Agreement,
or (B) offer any other concessions or payments to obtain such release
other than, in each case, delivering to the counterparties thereto of letters
of credit or guarantees otherwise meeting the requirements in subparts (A)
and (B) of _Section 6.01(c)_. Purchaser shall use Commercially Reasonable
Efforts to insure that the beneficiaries of any Sellers Support Obligations
agree in writing to any replacement of security or guarantee with regard to
the Sellers Support Obligations. Sellers shall cooperate with Purchaser in
connection with Purchaser's obligations under  _Section 6.01(b)_ and shall
have the right to participate in substantive discussions or negotiations
related to the matters discussed in this _Section 6.01(b)_; _provided_ ,
that Sellers promptly respond to any scheduling requests by Purchaser and
Sellers use Commercially Reasonable Efforts to make Sellers' representatives
available for such discussions or negotiations. Purchaser shall keep Sellers
reasonably and promptly informed of the status of negotiations and discussions
and any material developments in complying with this _Section 6.01(b)_ and
the Parties shall provide all material information reasonably requested by
the other Parties in connection therewith. During the Interim Period,
Purchaser, or following a Permitted Transfer, Purchaser's transferee, shall
have access to sufficient Cash, available lines of credit or other sources of
immediately available funds, in the aggregate, in an amount sufficient to
support the issuance of Back-to-Back Letters of Credit in the
aggregate amount of all Sellers Support Obligations.

  



  

(c) In the event that (i) Purchaser has complied with its
obligations under _Section 6.01(b)_, and (ii) all conditions to Closing have
been satisfied or waived except for the condition in _Section 2.07(b)(i)_
because of the failure of Purchaser to deliver the items described in
_Section 2.06(c)(iv)(A)_, then the condition to closing in _Section
2.07(b)(i)_ shall be deemed satisfied (with respect to the delivery of the
items described in _Section 2.06(c)(iv)_) if and only if:

  



  

(i) Purchaser delivers to innogy SE one or more irrevocable stand-
by letters of credit in favor of innogy SE with respect to, and in the
aggregate amount of, each such non-replaced Sellers Letter of Credit or
Sellers Guarantee in form and substance, and issued by banks, satisfactory to
innogy SE in its commercially reasonable discretion (each, a "Back-to-Back
Letter of Credit"); _provided_ , that (A) innogy SE agrees that the banks
listed on _Schedule 6.01(c)_ are deemed satisfactory by Sellers to
the extent that they maintain the Required Rating (defined below); (B) the
forms of letter of credit documentation attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ are
in a form reasonably acceptable to Sellers (and deemed acceptable if
substantially similar to existing letters of credit); and (C) innogy SE shall
act in a commercially reasonable manner with respect to the form and
substance of any Back-to-Back Letter of Credit documentation; and

(ii) such Back-to-Back Letters of Credit (A) are issued by either
(x) those banks listed on _Schedule 6.01(c)_ or (y) U.S., United Kingdom,
German or Canadian commercial banks of recognized standing having and
maintaining a credit rating of at least BBB+ by SandP or the equivalent by
Moody's or Fitch (the "Required Rating"); (B) have a maturity occurring at
least thirty (30) days after the related maturity date of the underlying
contract as set forth on _Schedule 2.06(c)(iv)_ ;  _provided_ , _however_ ,
if Back-to-Back Letters of Credit of such tenor are not obtainable by
Purchaser after using its Commercially Reasonable Efforts, innogy SE shall
accept Back-to-Back Letters of Credit with a maturity of no less than one (1)
year from the date of issuance (each, a "Renewable Letter of Credit") if, and
only if, innogy SE shall have the right to draw thereunder if any such
Renewable Letter of Credit is not renewed at least thirty (30) days prior to
expiry, it being understood that Purchaser shall cause any such Renewable
Letter of Credit to be renewed periodically through the related maturity date
of the underlying contract as set forth on _Schedule 2.06(c)(iv)_ as
required by _Section 6.01(d)(vi)_; (C) have a maximum available amount no
less than, and be issued in the currency of, the actual amount of the
underlying contract as set forth on _Schedule 2.06(c)(iv)_; and (D) be
irrevocable and available to innogy SE by drafts at sight with no
other conditions to drawing.

  



  

(d) In the event the condition to closing in _Section 2.07(b)(i)_
is deemed satisfied pursuant to _Section 6.01(c)_ and the Closing occurs:

  



  

(i) subject to Purchaser's compliance with this _Section
6.01(d)_, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to, maintain in
effect all non-released Seller Support Obligations with respect to obligations
arising prior to the Closing in accordance with the terms thereof as in
effect as of the Closing; it being agreed that innogy SE shall have the right,
to the extent not prohibited by the related Seller Support Obligation, to
terminate, repudiate, reject, and disavow any future increased liability under
each such non-replaced Sellers Support Obligation, and it being further
agreed that neither Purchaser nor the Acquired Entities shall enter into any
transaction that would enlarge any obligation under any non-released Seller
Support Obligation;

  



  

(ii) neither Purchaser nor the Acquired Entities shall amend,
modify, or waive the underlying contractual terms for which such Seller
Support Obligation relates in a manner that increases the amount or extends
the term of such Seller Support Obligation;

(iii) Purchaser shall indemnify the Sellers Indemnified Group from
and against any Losses incurred by Sellers or any other member of the
Sellers Indemnified Group in connection with this _Section 6.01(d)_;

  



  

(iv) if any Sellers Letter of Credit is contractually required to
be renewed or extended past its then maturity date, or if any
Sellers Guarantee is extended beyond its then maturity date notwithstanding
the provisions hereof, Purchaser shall renew or extend each related Back-to-
Back Letter of Credit so that the maturity date thereof is at all times at
least thirty (30) days longer than the related Sellers Support Obligation as
extended;

  



  

(v) if any issuer of any Back-to-Back Letter of Credit fails to
maintain the Required Rating, Purchaser shall deliver to Sellers a
replacement Back-to-Back Letter of Credit meeting the requirements of
_Section 6.01(c)_;

  



  

(vi) if any Back-to-Back Letter of Credit (including any Renewable
Letter of Credit) shall have an expiry date prior to the related
maturity date of the underlying Sellers Support Obligation as set forth on
_Schedule 2.06(c)(iv)_ (as such dates may be extended), then Purchaser shall
obtain the renewal thereof or deliver to Sellers a replacement Back-to-Back
Letter of Credit meeting the requirements of _Section 6.01(c)_ no later than
thirty (30) days prior to the expiry of such Back-to-Back Letter of Credit
and, if Purchaser fails to provide such renewal or replacement, Sellers shall
draw the full amount of such expiring Back-to-Back Letter of Credit and hold
such drawn funds as collateral for Purchaser's indemnification obligations
hereunder until either a replacement Back-to-Back Letter of Credit is
delivered to Sellers or the underlying Sellers Support Obligation has been
terminated; and

  



  

(vii) from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall use its
Commercially Reasonable Efforts (and shall cooperate with innogy SE's
efforts) to continue to negotiate and enter into with the counterparties to
such Sellers Support Obligations consistent with the provisions of _Section
6.01(b)_ above, to obtain an irrevocable release of any Sellers Indemnified
Group's obligations under such Sellers Support Obligations and the return and
termination of all Sellers Letters of Credit and Sellers Guarantees.

  



  

(e) Upon any return and termination of a Sellers Support
Obligation, Purchaser promptly shall inform innogy SE of such return and
termination, and within thirty (30) Business Days thereafter, innogy SE shall
return any related Back-to-Back Letter of Credit to Purchaser or cause the
amount available under any related Back-to-Back Letter of Credit to be reduced
by the amount of such terminated Sellers Support Obligation, as applicable.

  



  

(f) innogy SE shall promptly return to Purchaser within thirty
(30) days: (i) any drawn funds that were held as collateral pursuant to 
_Section 6.01(d)(vi)_ after delivery of the replacement Back-to-Back Letter
of Credit and (ii) any drawn funds that were used by innogy SE to satisfy a
Sellers Support Obligation that is finally determined not to be owed pursuant
to such Sellers Support Obligation (but only to the extent innogy SE receives
such funds from the counterparty to such Sellers Support Obligation and
Purchaser has provided a replacement Back-to-Back Letter of Credit with
respect to such Sellers Support Obligation if it remains in effect). innogy
SE shall only draw on any Back-to-Back Letter of Credit to satisfy a Sellers
Support Obligation, to reimburse itself for payments made by it under a
Sellers Support Obligation for the purposes of collecting collateral
pursuant to _Section 6.01(d)(vi)_.

Section 6.02 _Further Assurances_.

  



  

(a) Following the Closing, each Party agrees to furnish or cause
to be furnished to the other Parties, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance (including access to Books and
Records and any additional documents) relating to the Plant, Facility Assets,
or the Acquired Entities as is reasonably necessary for: (i) the preparation
of any Tax Return or the prosecution or defense against any Action with
respect to Taxes; or (ii) the defense of any Action to which the requesting
Party is a party or is subject; _provided_ that no such obligation shall
exist with respect to any Action in which the Parties (or their Affiliates)
are adverse to one another. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 6.02(a)_, no Party shall have any obligations under this _Section
6.02(a)_ unless such obligations, (i) do not unreasonably interfere with the
normal, safe commercial operations of the business of such Party (or, as
appropriate, its Affiliates) and (ii) do not require such Party or any of its
Affiliates to disclose any (A) trade secrets or other competitively sensitive
information, (B) information that is subject to any applicable attorney-
client, work product or other legal privilege and the disclosure of which
would, based on the advice of outside counsel, waive such privilege or (C)
information or access that relates to any dispute between the parties hereto
or any of their respective Representatives.

  



  

(b) In addition, if after the Closing any further action is
reasonably necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Parties will take such
further reasonable actions (including the execution and delivery of such
further instruments and documents) as the other Parties may reasonably request
in writing; _provided_ that the requesting Party shall be required to pay any
out-of-pocket, third-party expenses incurred by the other Parties in complying
with such request;  _provided_ _further_ that no Party will be required to
take any action that, in the opinion of its legal counsel, would constitute a
violation of any applicable Law.

  



  

Section 6.03 _Insurance_. Purchaser acknowledges that effective on the
Closing Date, the insurance policies of the Acquired Entities and their
Affiliates related to the Plant will exclude coverage of the Plant and the
Acquired Entities, and Purchaser will be required to provide or arrange for
replacement or substitute insurance coverage from and after the Closing Date
that satisfies all insurance requirements set forth in the Contracts. For any
claim asserted against the Acquired Entities after the Closing arising out of
an occurrence taking place prior to the Closing, the Acquired Entities may
access coverage under the occurrence-based insurance policies issued or in
place prior to the Closing of the Acquired Entities to the extent such
insurance coverage exists and Sellers will cooperate with Purchaser in
connection therewith.

Section 6.04 _Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) Preparation and Filing of Pre-Closing and Post-Closing Period
Tax Returns. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 6.04_:

  



  

(i) _Pre-Closing Tax Returns_. Sellers shall prepare, or cause to
be prepared, all Tax Returns required to be filed by the Acquired
Entities after the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing Period that
ends before the Closing (each such Tax Return, a "Pre-Closing Tax Return").
The Pre-Closing Tax Returns are listed on _Schedule 6.04(a)(i)_. The Pre-
Closing Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past
practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and such Tax Returns (other than
Tax Returns relating to sales, use, payroll, or other Taxes that are required
to be filed contemporaneously with, or promptly after, the close of a taxable
period, which shall be provided promptly after filing) shall be submitted by
Sellers to Purchaser (together with schedules, statements and, to the extent
requested by Purchaser, supporting documentation) no later than twenty (20)
Business Days prior to the due date (without extensions) of such Pre-Closing
Tax Return. Purchaser shall provide any comments to such Pre-Closing
Tax Returns and notify Sellers of any disagreements no later than ten (10)
Business Days after delivery of such Pre-Closing Tax Return. Purchaser shall
cause such Pre-Closing Tax Returns (including Purchaser's reasonable comments
thereto) to be timely filed and will provide a copy thereof to the Sellers;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the U.S. federal income tax return for the
Acquired Entities for their taxable year ending December 31, 2019 shall be
either filed prior to the Closing Date or submitted to Purchaser for review
twenty (20) Business Days prior to the Closing Date. In the event that Sellers
and Purchaser disagree regarding any revision by Purchaser, Sellers shall
engage a Resolution Accounting Firm to render an opinion
regarding Purchaser's revision and the relevant Pre-Closing Tax Return shall
be filed in accordance with such opinion; _provided_ ,  _however_ , such
opinion will not deviate from past practice respecting prior Pre-Closing Tax
Returns unless otherwise required by Law. Sellers shall bear the reasonable
cost of any such engagement. Sellers shall pay (1) to the applicable
Governmental Entity, the Tax shown as due with respect to each Pre-Closing
Tax Return, to the extent (a) such Tax was not included as a Current
Liability in the final calculation of Net Working Capital used in the
determination of Net Working Capital Adjustment, and (b) there was no
corresponding Tax asset in the Company's reserves actually utilizable in such
Tax period (other than any amount included in Current Assets in the final
calculation of Net Working Capital used in the determination of Net
Working Capital Adjustment), and (2) the costs for which Sellers are liable
pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence.

(ii) _Straddle Period Tax Returns_. Purchaser shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and timely file, or cause to be timely filed, all
Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities for taxable periods which begin on or
before, and end after, the Closing Date (each such period, a "Straddle
Period", and each such Tax Return a "Straddle Period Tax Return"). The
Straddle Period Tax Returns are set forth on _Schedule 6.04(a)(ii)_. Any such
Straddle Period Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with
past practice (unless otherwise required by Law) and such Tax Returns (other
than Tax Returns relating to sales, use, payroll, or other Taxes that are
required to be filed contemporaneously with, or promptly after, the close of a
taxable period, which shall be provided promptly after filing) shall be
submitted by Purchaser to Sellers (together with schedules, statements and,
to the extent reasonably requested by Sellers, supporting documentation) no
later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of
such Straddle Period Tax Returns. Sellers shall provide any comments no later
than five (5) days after delivery of such Straddle Period Tax Return, and
Purchaser shall consider such comments in good faith. In the event
that Sellers and Purchaser disagree regarding any revision requested by
Sellers, Purchaser shall engage a Resolution Accounting Firm to render an
opinion regarding Sellers' requested revision and the relevant Straddle Period
Tax Return shall be filed in accordance with such opinion. Purchaser and
Sellers shall equally share the cost of any such engagement. Purchaser shall
timely remit, or cause to be timely remitted, all Taxes due in respect of
such Straddle Period Tax Returns. Sellers shall pay to Purchaser, within ten
(10) days following any written demand by Purchaser (which demand shall
include a computation of the amount owed by Sellers), with respect to each
such Straddle Period Tax Returns, an amount equal to the sum of (1) the
portion of the Taxes due in respect of the Pre-Closing Period (as determined
pursuant to _Section 6.04(a)(iv)_), to the extent (a) such Tax was not
included as a Current Liability in the final calculation of Net Working
Capital used in the determination of Net Working Capital Adjustment, and (b)
there was no corresponding Tax asset in the Company's reserves actually
utilizable in such Tax period (other than any amount included in Current
Assets in the final calculation of Net Working Capital used in the
determination of Net Working Capital Adjustment), and (2) fifty (50) percent
of any reasonable, documented third party costs (if any) incurred by
Purchaser in the preparation of such Straddle Period Tax Returns.

  



  

(iii) _Cooperation_. Purchaser and Sellers shall, and shall each
cause their Affiliates to, timely provide to the other Party such cooperation
and information, as and to the extent reasonably requested, in connection
with (A) preparing, reviewing, or filing any Tax Return, amended Tax Return,
or claim for refund, (B) determining Liabilities for Taxes or a right to
refund of Taxes, or (C) conducting any audit or other Action with respect to
Taxes, in the case of clauses (A) through (C), with respect to the Acquired
Entities.

  



  

(iv) _Allocation of Certain Taxes_. For all purposes of this
Agreement:

  



  

(A) If the Acquired Entities, as applicable, are permitted but not
required under applicable U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign income Tax
Laws to treat the Closing Date as the last day of a taxable period, then the
Parties shall treat that day as the last day of a taxable period.

  



  

(B) Except as provided in _Section 6.04(a)(iv)(C)_, in the case
of Taxes for any Straddle Period of the Acquired Entities, as applicable, the
allocation of such Taxes between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-Closing
Period shall be made on the basis of an interim closing of the books as of
the end of the Closing Date.

(Project Dome II)

  



  

   

-59-

 



    



  

(C) In the case of any Taxes of the Acquired Entities that are
imposed on a periodic basis (such as real property or personal
property Taxes), the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing
Period shall be deemed to be only the amount of such Tax for the entire
taxable period _multiplied by_ a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days in the Pre-Closing Period and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the entire taxable period. However, in the event such Taxes
are attributable to any property which is revaluated or reassessed on or
after the Closing Date as a direct result of Purchaser or its Affiliates (a)
making capital expenditures that enhance the value of such property, or (b)
changing the use of such property after the Closing Date, then the portion of
such Taxes allocated to the Pre-Closing Period pursuant to the prior sentence
shall be made without taking into account such valuation or reassessment.
Furthermore, any such Taxes attributable to any property that was owned by
the Acquired Entities at some point in the Pre-Closing Period, but is not
owned as of or after the Closing Date shall be allocated entirely to the Pre-
Closing Period, and any such Taxes attributable to any property that was not
owned by the Acquired Entities at any point in the Pre-Closing Period shall
be allocated entirely to the Post-Closing Period.

  



  

(v) _Payment of Transfer Taxes_. The responsibility for paying
any Transfer Taxes imposed by applicable Law by reason of the transfer of the
Membership Interests to Purchaser as provided herein shall be borne fifty
percent (50%) by Sellers and fifty percent (50%) by Purchaser. The Parties
shall cooperate in obtaining all applicable exemptions from Transfer Taxes
that are allowable under applicable Law. Sellers shall file all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes and
Purchaser shall provide such cooperation in connection with the preparation
and filing of such documentation and Tax Returns as may be reasonably
requested by Sellers.

  



  

(vi) _Carryovers, Refunds, and Related Matters_.

  



  

(A) With respect to the Acquired Entities, any refund, rebate,
abatement, reduction, or other recovery (whether direct or indirect through a
right of set-off or credit) of Taxes (including any interest thereon) (a "Tax
Refund") that relates to the Acquired Entities that is attributable to a
Post-Closing Period shall be the property of the Acquired Entities, as
applicable, and shall be retained by the Acquired Entities, as applicable (or
promptly paid by Sellers to the Acquired Entities, as applicable, if any such
Tax Refund is received by Sellers or any Affiliate of Sellers).

  



  

Membership Interest Purchase and Sale Agreement

  

(Project Dome II)

  



  

   

-60-

 



    



  

(B) With respect to the Acquired Entities, any Tax Refund (limited
in all cases to the amount of the actual reduction of cash Tax paid by the
Acquired Entities in such taxable period) that relates to the Acquired
Entities and that is attributable to a Pre-Closing Period shall be the
property of Sellers ( _less_ any out-of-pocket costs of obtaining such Tax
Refund) and shall be retained by Sellers (or promptly paid by one of the
Acquired Entities or Purchaser to Sellers in the proportion in which the
Estimated Purchase Price is paid to Sellers if any such Tax Refund is
received by the Acquired Entities or Purchaser or any of their Subsidiaries or
Affiliates);  _provided_ , that Sellers shall not be entitled to any such Tax
Refund to the extent (1) taken into account in calculating the Final Purchase
Price, or (2) it results from a loss carry-back from a Post-Closing Period.

  



  

(C) In applying the foregoing, any Tax Refund for a Straddle
Period shall be allocated between the Pre-Closing Period and the Post-
Closing Period in accordance with the principles of _Section 6.04(a)(iv)_.

  



  

(D) If any Tax Refund in respect of which a Party made a payment
to another Party pursuant to this _Section 6.04(a)(vi)_ is subsequently
disallowed or reduced, such other Party shall promptly repay the amount of
such Tax Refund, to the extent disallowed or reduced, to the Party that made
such payment, together with any interest, penalties, or other charges imposed
thereon attributable to such disallowance or reduction (as determined in good
faith by the Party that made such payment) by the applicable
Governmental Entity.

  



  

(b) Audits. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, following the Closing Date, Purchaser will have the right, in
Purchaser's sole and absolute discretion, to conduct and control the defense
of any Action relating to Taxes of the Acquired Entities (a
"Tax Proceeding"); _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that any Tax
Proceeding could reasonably give rise to an Indemnification Claim by
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates pursuant to _Article VII_, Purchaser will
(i) provide notice of such Tax Proceeding to Sellers within thirty (30) days
after receiving written notice of the commencement of such Tax Proceeding
from the relevant Governmental Entity, (ii) provide to Sellers all information
reasonably requested by Sellers regarding such Tax Proceeding, (iii) permit
Sellers to evaluate and comment on such Tax Proceeding at Sellers'
expense, and (iv) reasonably and in good faith consider any such comments of
Sellers. Purchaser may not settle, adjust, or compromise any Tax Proceeding,
without the written consent of Sellers, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(c) Tax Sharing Agreement. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Acquired Entities (other than any
such agreement entered into in the ordinary course of business in a contract
the primary subject of which is not Taxes) shall be terminated as of the
Closing Date such that, after the Closing Date, no Acquired Entity shall be
bound thereby or have any Liability thereunder with respect to a Post-Closing
Period.

Section 6.05 _Innogy Marks_. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that as
a result of the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, it will not obtain any right, title, interest, license, or other
right hereunder to use Innogy Marks. Following the Closing, neither Purchaser
nor any of its Affiliates shall have any right to use Innogy Marks or hold
itself out as having any affiliations with Sellers or any Affiliates of
Sellers; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing in this  _Section 6.05_ shall
require the Acquired Entities to remove any Innogy Marks from signage located
at the Facilities until the date that is ninety (90) days after the Closing.

  



  

Section 6.06 _Conduct of the Acquired Entities ' Business_.

  



  

(a) Commencing on the date hereof and continuing until the earlier

Agreement (including _Section 6.06(c)_), (x) as required by applicable Law,
(y) as may be required to comply with any COVID-19 Measures, or (z) with the
prior written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld, or delayed), or as set forth in _Schedule 6.06(b)_,
Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Acquired Entities not to do any of the

and the Auditors with sufficient access to support an unqualified audit
opinion under generally accepted audit standards to (A) the books, records,
information and documents relating to the Acquired Entities that are in

auditing standards to Sellers' or their Affiliates' officers, managers,
employees, agents, and representatives who were responsible for preparing or
maintaining the financial records and work papers and other supporting
documents used in the preparation of such financial statements and, if those
records, workpapers or documents are insufficient to support an unqualified
audit opinion to Sellers' or their Affiliates' internal and external auditors
and other counterparties who could help to provide the required support, (iv)
as may be requested by Purchaser from time to time, consent to the inclusion
or incorporation by reference of the Requisite Financial Statement Information
in Purchaser's or its Affiliates' existing registration statements and any

obligations under the Securities Act, or the Exchange Act, and (v)
reasonably cooperate with Purchaser and its Affiliates in seeking to obtain
the consent of the Auditors to the inclusion or incorporation by reference in
any such registration statement, report or other document of its audit
opinion(s) with respect to the financial statements that it has audited and
to obtain from the Auditors unqualified opinions, consents or customary
comfort letters with respect to such Requisite Financial Statement
Information in connection with any offering pursuant to a registration
statement that includes or incorporates by reference such financial
statements. Purchaser acknowledges that Sellers are not responsible
with respect to the completion of such audit, which is anticipated to be
completed by Purchaser and the Auditors after Closing; _provided_  that the
covenants specified in clauses (ii) through (v) above and in the first
sentence of _Section 6.14(c)_ below shall be applicable before and after
Closing. The agreement between the Acquired Entities or Purchaser and the
Auditors shall provide that Purchaser shall be solely and exclusively
responsible for any and all fees, costs, and expenses in connection with the
audit and the other actions described in this _Section 6.14(b)_.

is a member of Sellers Indemnified Group) shall give written notice to the
Indemnifying Party of the Third-Party Indemnification Claim as soon as
practicable after the Indemnified Party becomes aware of any fact, condition
or event that may give rise to Losses for which indemnification may be sought
under this _Article VII_; _provided_ that the failure to give, or any delay
in promptly giving, such notice shall not relieve or limit the obligations of
the Indemnifying Party for any liability it may have to any Indemnified Party
except to the extent the rights or defenses of the Indemnifying Party
are materially prejudiced thereby.

(b) Except for any Third-Party Indemnification Claim for which the
Indemnified Party makes a claim under the RandW Insurance Policy or, if
obtained, a Tax Insurance Policy, as between the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party, if the remedy sought in the Third-Party Indemnification
Claim is solely money damages, or if the Indemnified Party otherwise permits,
then the Indemnifying Party, at its sole cost and expense, may, upon notice
to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after receiving notice of the
Third-Party Indemnification Claim, assume and thereafter conduct the defense
of the Third-Party Indemnification Claim with counsel of its
choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to assume
and conduct the defense if such Third-Party Indemnification Claim (i) seeks an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnified Parties, or (ii)
relates to a criminal action, provided that the Indemnifying Party will
not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with
respect to the Third-Party Indemnification Claim unless the settlement or
judgment is solely for money damages and the Indemnifying Party provides
evidence satisfactory to the Indemnified Party that (A) the Indemnifying
Party has admitted in writing its liability to hold the Indemnified Party
harmless from and against any Losses, damages, expenses, and Liabilities
arising out of such settlement or judgment or (B) such settlement or judgment
includes an unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from all Losses
with respect to such Third-Party Indemnification Claim, or (C) the
Indemnified Party expressly consents in writing thereto, which consent may be
withheld in the Indemnified Party's sole discretion. The Indemnifying Party
shall keep the Indemnified Party fully informed as to all material
developments in connection with the Third-Party Indemnification Claim. Unless
and until the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of the Third-
Party Indemnification Claim as provided above, the Indemnified Party may
defend against the Third-Party Indemnification Claim in any manner it
reasonably may deem appropriate at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party. With respect to Third-Party Indemnification Claims in
which the remedy sought is solely money damages, the Indemnified Party, at its
sole cost and expense, shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third-Party Indemnification Claim, the defense of which is assumed by the
Indemnifying Party with its own counsel. With respect to Third-Party
Indemnification Claims in which the remedy sought is not solely money
damages, the Indemnified Party, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnifying Party, shall be entitled to participate in the defense of any
Third-Party Indemnification Claim, the defense of which is assumed by the
Indemnifying Party with its own counsel. With respect to Third-Party
Indemnification Claims in which the remedy sought is not solely money damages,
the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Indemnification Claim
unless the Indemnified Party expressly consents in writing thereto, which
consent may be withheld in the Indemnified Party's sole discretion.

Section 7.05 _Limitation of Liability_.

  



  

(a) The aggregate liability of Sellers and the aggregate liability
of Purchaser in each case for indemnification under or in connection with
this Agreement shall not exceed the Purchase Price. Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, (i) nothing in this Agreement
(including _Section 7.01(a)_) shall in any way limit the right of any
Indemnified Party to seek recourse against the committing Party (or if acting
in concert, Parties) for Losses resulting from Fraud by such committing Party
or Parties in the making of the representations and warranties set forth in
this Agreement; (ii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Sellers
shall not have any liability or indemnification obligation (including, without
limitation, under _Section 7.02(a)(i)_) arising out of or in relation to the
amount of, the availability of, or the ability of Purchaser, the Company, GB,
or any of their Affiliates to utilize any Tax asset or attribute ( _e.g._ ,
net operating loss carryforward or Tax credit carryforward) in any Tax period
or portion thereof beginning on or after the Closing Date, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, any change thereof arising from any Tax-related
adjustment in a Pre-Closing Period (and Purchaser has carried out its own
independent tax due diligence to determine the amount of, the availability of,
and the ability of Purchaser, the Company, GB, or any of their Affiliates to
utilize, any such Tax asset or attribute); (iii) Sellers shall not have any
liability or indemnification obligation arising out of, or in relation to,
the financial information presented in the Requisite Financial Statement
Information, any underlying financial conditions, facts, or factual
circumstances reflected in the Requisite Financial Statement Information, or
the other activities conducted pursuant to _Section 6.14_; _provided_ , that
the limitation in this clause (iii) shall not relieve Sellers of their
liability and indemnification obligations, or preclude Purchaser from
recovering for any Losses that arise under this Agreement independent of how
any related item is presented in the Requisite Financial Statement
Information; (iv) Sellers shall not have any liability or indemnification
obligation to Purchaser arising out of, or in relation to, any liquidation of
the Acquired Entities except to the extent that the Sellers or their designee
file or cause another to file any election to change the U.S. federal income
tax classification of the Acquired Entities pursuant to Treasury Regulations
Section 301.7701-3; and (iv) Purchaser shall not have any liability or
indemnification obligation arising out of, or in relation to, the
information presented to Sellers pursuant to _Section 6.12_.

  



  

(b) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the indemnification
obligations set forth in this Agreement shall apply whether or not the
Indemnified Party is a formal party to any such lawsuits, claims, or other
Actions.

  



  

(c) Except in the case of Fraud or with respect to breaches of
covenants by Sellers (for which Sellers shall be liable), prior to the
Contemplated Innogy Restructuring, Purchaser acknowledges that innogy SE
shall be solely responsible for any monetary obligations of Sellers under
this Agreement and except for purposes of obtaining specific performance,
Purchaser will look solely to innogy SE for any other indemnification
obligations or remedies under this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.06 _Direct Claims_. Any Action by an Indemnified Party on
account of any Losses which do not result from a Third-Party Indemnification
Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party
giving the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. The
failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced or forfeits
rights or defenses by reason of such failure. Such notice by the Indemnified
Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail, shall include
copies of all material written evidence thereof and shall indicate the
estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of any Losses that have been or
may be sustained by the Indemnified Party. The Indemnifying Party shall have
forty-five (45) days after its receipt of such notice to respond in writing to
such Direct Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party
and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any
amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim and the Indemnified Party
shall assist the Indemnifying Party's investigation by giving such information
and assistance (including access to the Acquired Entities' premises and
personnel and the right to examine and copy any accounts, documents or
records) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its professional advisors may
reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such
forty-five (45)-day period, the Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have
agreed to such claim in full.

Section 7.07 _Determination of Loss Amount_. The amount of any
Losses subject to indemnification under _Section 7.02(a)(i)_ shall be
calculated net of any insurance proceeds (including under the RandW Insurance
Policy) or Third Party payments actually realized by the Indemnified Party. To
the extent required by _Section 7.02(a)_, the Indemnified Party shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to seek full recovery under all applicable
insurance policies (including under the RandW Insurance Policy) and Third Party
payments covering any Losses to the same extent as it would if such
Losses were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the event that an
insurance recovery (including under the RandW Insurance Policy) or Third Party
payment is received by the Indemnified Party with respect to any Losses for
which any such Party has been indemnified hereunder, then a refund equal to
the aggregate amount of the recovery (net of all direct collection costs and
expenses) shall be made promptly to the Party or Parties that provided such
indemnity payments to such Indemnified Party. The Purchaser Indemnified Group
shall not be entitled to recover Losses from Sellers if such Losses would
have been covered under the RandW Insurance Policy, if not for a failure by a
Purchaser Indemnified Group to promptly make a claim thereunder or to
otherwise comply with the terms thereof. No member of Purchaser Indemnified
Group will be indemnified for any Loss solely to the extent that the amount
of such Loss was reflected in the Final Purchase Price or the Net Working
Capital Adjustment in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

Section 7.08 _Acknowledgment of Purchaser_. Purchaser acknowledges
that it has conducted, to its satisfaction, an independent investigation and
verification of the financial condition, results of operations, financial or
other projections, assets, Liabilities, properties, and projected operations
of the Acquired Entities, the Plant and the Facility Assets and, in making
its determination to proceed with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Purchaser has relied on the results of its own independent
investigation and verification, in addition to the representations and
warranties of innogy SE expressly and specifically set forth in this
Agreement (or in any certificate or instrument delivered herewith
or therewith). SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY INNOGY SE CONSTITUTE
THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF INNOGY SE OR ANY
SIGNING SELLER (OR ANY AFFILIATE THEREOF ACTING ON BEHALF OF SUCH PARTY) TO
PURCHASER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, AND
PURCHASER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES, AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER REPRESENTATIONS
AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED (INCLUDING ANY
RELATING TO THE FUTURE OR HISTORICAL FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF
OPERATIONS, ASSETS OR LIABILITIES OF THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES, OR TO ANY
ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, OR SAFETY MATTERS) ARE SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMED BY
INNOGY SE OR ANY SIGNING SELLER AND ARE NOT BEING RELIED UPON BY PURCHASER OR
ANY OF ITS REPRESENTATIVES OR AFFILIATES.

Section 7.09 _Further Limitation_. Solely with respect to a Loss
resulting from (a) Sellers' or Purchaser's breach or nonfulfillment of, or
failure to comply with, any covenants of Sellers or Purchaser, as applicable,
under this Agreement, or (b) Purchaser's inaccuracy or breach of any
representation or warranty of Purchaser in this Agreement, or in
any certificate or instrument delivered pursuant to this Agreement, Sellers
Indemnified Group or Purchaser Indemnified Group, as applicable, shall not
have any liability under any provision of this Agreement for (i) special,
consequential, incidental, or indirect losses or damages (in tort, contract,
or otherwise), costs of capital or loss of business reputation or opportunity,
diminution in value or multiples of earnings damages under or with respect to
this Agreement or for any failure of performance related hereto that are not
a direct and reasonably foreseeable result of the event or matter that gave
rise to such Loss or (ii) any punitive or exemplary damages or losses,
howsoever caused, unless in each case of (i) or (ii), such Losses or damages
are payable to a Third Party. For the avoidance of doubt, lost profits shall
not be excluded for purposes of this _Section 7.09_ from recovery under this
Agreement to the extent constituting direct damages.

  



  

Section 7.10 _Duty to Mitigate_. The Indemnified Party shall use
Commercially Reasonable Efforts to mitigate the Losses upon becoming aware of
any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise thereto.

  



  

Section 7.11 _Exclusivity of Remedies_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement or any agreement or document
delivered in connection with this Agreement, or provided under any applicable
Law, from and after the Closing, except in case of Fraud, the remedies set
forth in this _Article VII_, _Section 6.14_, _Section 8.03_, and _Section
9.16_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of a Party against another
Party (or its Affiliates) with respect to any and all of the transactions and
matters covered by or arising under or in connection with this Agreement or
any other agreement or document delivered pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Nothing in this _Section 7.11_ is intended to constitute a waiver
or limitation of any rights that any Party (or their respective Affiliates) or
Indemnified Parties may have to assert claims against Third Parties,
including contractors performing any work in connection with the Plant, the
RandW Insurance Policy, or, if obtained, a Tax Insurance Policy.

  



  

Section 7.12 _Tax Treatment_. It is the intent of the Parties that
amounts paid under this _Article VII_ shall be treated as an adjustment to
the aggregate Purchase Price for all applicable Tax purposes, and the Parties
will report such payments consistently with such intent.

  



  

Article VIII 
 TERMINATION

  



  

Section 8.01 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated (but
only prior to the Closing Date) by:

  



  

(a) mutual written consent of Sellers and Purchaser;

  



  

(b) either Sellers or Purchaser, if any Governmental Entity shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced, or entered any
injunction, order, decree, or ruling or taken any other action (including the
failure to have taken an action) which, in either such case, has become final
and non-appealable and has the effect of making the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby illegal or otherwise preventing or
prohibiting consummation of such transactions; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section 8.01(b)_ shall not
be available to any Party which, at the time of the occurrence of the events
described therein, is in breach of any obligation, representation, or warranty
under this Agreement, or shall not have satisfied any condition to be
satisfied by it under _Sections 2.07(a)_ or _2.07(b)_ , as applicable;

-76-

 



    



  

(c) Sellers, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement set forth in this Agreement by Purchaser, such that
the conditions set forth in _Section 2.07(b)_ would not be satisfied as of
the time of such breach; _provided_ , that if such breach by Purchaser is
curable prior to the End Date through the exercise of Commercially Reasonable
Efforts, then Sellers may not terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.01(c)_ prior to thirty (30) days following the receipt of written notice
from Sellers to Purchaser of such breach (it being understood that Sellers may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 8.01(c)_ if (i) such
breach by Purchaser is cured during such period such that such conditions
would then be satisfied or (ii) Sellers are in breach of this Agreement such
that the conditions set forth in  _Section 2.07(a)_ would not be satisfied);

  



  

(d) Purchaser, upon a breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant, or agreement set forth in this Agreement by Sellers, such that the
conditions set forth in _Section 2.07(a)_ would not be satisfied as of the
time of such breach; _provided_ , that if such breach is curable by Sellers,
as applicable, prior to the End Date through the exercise of Commercially
Reasonable Efforts, then Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement under
this _Section 8.01(d)_ prior to thirty (30) days following the receipt of
written notice from Purchaser to Sellers of such breach (it being understood
that Purchaser may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
8.01(d)_ if (i) such breach by Sellers is cured during such period such that
such conditions would then be satisfied or (ii) Purchaser is in breach of
this Agreement such that the conditions set forth in  _Section 2.07(b)_
would not be satisfied);

  



  

(e) either Sellers or Purchaser, if the Closing has not occurred on
or prior to October 31, 2020 (the "End Date")  _provided_ , _however_ , no
Party shall have the right to terminate this Agreement under this _Section
8.01(e)_ if the Closing has failed to occur because such Party has failed to
perform or observe in any material respect their covenants and agreements
hereunder; _provided further_ , that:

  



  

(i) the End Date shall automatically be extended until November
30, 2020 if on October 31, 2020, in circumstances that the
conditions contained in _Section 2.07(a)(v)_ and _Section 2.07(b)(iv)_ have
not been waived, the sole reason why Closing has not occurred is that the
conditions contained in _Section 2.07(a)(v)_ and _Section 2.07(b)(iv)_
have not been satisfied and the UK CMA has not yet issued its phase 1
decision;

  



  

(ii) the End Date shall automatically be extended until March
31,2021 if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement become
referred for examination by the European Commission pursuant to Article 22 of
the EU Merger Regulation or for a phase 2 enquiry by the CMA pursuant to
section 33 or section 45 of the UK Enterprise Act 2002; and

-77-

 



    



  

(iii) if Conditions are imposed as set forth in _Section 8.01(f)_
and the End Date will occur within forty (40) Business Days, the End Date
shall automatically be extended until the date that is forty (40) Business
Days from the date on which such Conditions were imposed; or

  



  

(f) either Sellers or Purchaser, if (i) (A) the CMA requires any
sale, divestiture, permanent hold separate order, license, disposition, or
other permanent change in business practices or specified business conduct
(collectively, "Conditions") as a condition to granting the UK CMA Consent
_or_ (B) the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of
Justice places any Conditions upon the expiration or termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act or upon refraining from instituting judicial
or administrative action to enjoin or prohibit the transaction preliminarily
or permanently, and (ii) Purchaser does not within forty (40) Business Days
after receiving notice of such Conditions formally and irrevocably accept such
Conditions by (x) giving written notice of such acceptance to Sellers and,
where such acceptance is required in order for such Conditions to become
binding, to the Governmental Entity or Governmental Entities demanding or
offering such Conditions and (y) giving written notice of waiver to Sellers
of the applicable unsatisfied conditions set forth in _Section 2.07(a)(iv)_
and  _Section 2.07(a)(v)_.

  



  

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event a Party desires
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.01_, written notice
thereof shall promptly be given by the terminating Party to the other Parties,
and this Agreement shall terminate effective as such date. If this Agreement
is terminated as provided in _Section 8.01_, all filings, applications
and other submissions made to any Governmental Entity with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than any filings,
applications and other submissions made by Sellers, or any Acquired Entity
that do not involve Purchaser) shall, to the extent practicable, be withdrawn
from the Governmental Entity to which they were made; and except for those
obligations set forth in _Section 5.01_, the second sentence of _Section
6.14(c)_, _Section 6.14(d)_, _Section 8.03_, and _Article IX_, pursuant to
which the Parties shall continue to be bound, no Party shall have any further
obligation hereunder. The provisions of this _Section 8.02_ shall not
relieve any Party from liability for Fraud or any intentional breach of this
Agreement occurring prior to such termination.

  



  

Section 8.03 _Expense Reimbursement_. If (a) all of the conditions
set forth in _Section 2.07(a)(i)_,  _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ , and _(iv)_ (other
than those set by the CMA, the Federal Trade Commission or the United
States Department of Justice which give rise to Conditions) as well as those
in _Section 2.07(b)(i)_, _(ii)_ and _(iii)_ (other than those set by the
CMA, the Federal Trade Commission or the United States Department of Justice
which give rise to Conditions) of this Agreement have been satisfied (other
than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at Closing) and
(b) this Agreement is terminated by either Sellers or Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 8.01(b)_, _Section 8.01(e)_, or  _Section 8.01(f)_, then
Purchaser shall reimburse or cause to be reimbursed, to Sellers, (i) (x) if
such termination was by Purchaser, prior to or substantially concurrently
with, and as the condition to, such termination, or (y) if such
termination was by Sellers, within two (2) Business Days of such termination,
a fixed reimbursement of $1,000,000 for all fees and expenses (including all
such attorneys' fees, accountants' fees, financial advisory fees, and filing
fees) that have been paid or that may become payable by or on behalf of
Sellers with respect to the period prior to termination of this Agreement in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement, the Sellers
Documents, and otherwise in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (such fees and expenses, "Reimbursable Expenses"), without any
further documentation, and (ii) within thirty (30) Business Days after
Sellers' delivery to Purchaser of adequate supporting documentation
specifying in reasonable detail all reasonable, out-of-pocket Reimbursable
Expenses of Sellers, the amount, if any, by which such Reimbursable Expenses
exceed $1,000,000; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser
be obligated to pay more than $3,000,000 (including the amount payable
pursuant to _clause (i)_ );  _provided_ , _further_ , that Reimbursable
Expenses shall not include any fees or expenses incurred by or on behalf
of Sellers on or prior to June 1, 2019 or otherwise related to any portion of
the Sellers' sales process in which Purchaser was not an active participant.

Article IX 
 MISCELLANEOUS

  



  

Section 9.01 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) No Party may assign any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement or any Transaction Document (including by operation of law, merger
or division, or similar business combination transaction) without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, which consent may be granted or
withheld in the sole discretion of such other Party; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that this prohibition shall not limit a Party from merging into an entity
provided that the company resulting from such merger agrees to be bound by
this Agreement and all Transaction Documents; _further_ _provided_ , that
any Party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of the other Parties (i) in the case of Sellers,
to an RWE Transferee, subject to _Sections 9.01(b)_ , _9.11,_ and _9.12_ ,
(ii) to any financial institution providing purchase money or other financing
to such Party from time to time as collateral security for such financing so
long as such Party remains fully liable for its obligations under this
Agreement, and (iii) in the case of Purchaser, in a Permitted Transfer. Other
than as provided in _Article VII_ and _Section 6.12_, _Section 6.14_,
_Section 6.15_, and _Section 9.11 _hereof, nothing in this Agreement is
intended to or shall confer upon any other Person except the Parties any
rights or remedies hereunder or create any Third Party beneficiary rights in
any Person.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement:

  



  

(i) in the event that the Contemplated Innogy Restructuring occurs
prior to the Closing, a Signing Seller or Signing Sellers may transfer any or
all of its Membership Interests to RWE AG or to its Affiliates (such entities,
the "RWE Transferees");  _provided_ that (A) a copy of the fully-executed
Assignment of Agreement (Pre-Closing) is delivered to Purchaser, and (B) such
RWE Transferee (if not RWE AG) is at the time of such transfer connected to
RWE AG through an unbroken chain of domination- ( _Beherrschungs-_ ) and/or
profit and loss transfer agreements ( _Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrage_) in
accordance with German statutory Law with RWE AG that has been registered
with the commercial register of such RWE Transferee. Upon the delivery of a
fully-executed Assignment of Agreement (Pre-Closing) to Purchaser, such
Signing Seller or Signing Sellers making such delivery automatically shall be
released from all liability and further obligations under or in connection
with this Agreement without further action; _provided_ that nothing in the
foregoing shall release any liability for Fraud occurring prior to such
transfer or any breach of this _Section 9.01_. In such case:

-79-

 



    



  

(A) The RWE Transferee or RWE Transferees shall become
"Replacement Seller" or "Replacement Sellers," as the case may be, and
Replacement Seller or Replacement Sellers shall be deemed to be a "Seller" or
"Sellers" (as may be applicable) hereunder from the date of this Agreement,
_mutatis mutandis_ ;

  



  

(B) references to "innogy SE" in (1) the first sentence in
_Article III_ and (2) _Article VII_ with respect to innogy SE's
indemnification rights and obligations shall be deemed to be references to the
"Seller" or "Sellers" (as may be applicable) hereunder from the date of this
Agreement, _mutatis mutandis_ ; and

  



  

(C) references in _Section 3.27_ to "Seller" or "Sellers" shall
be deemed to include "Signing Seller" or "Signing Sellers," as appropriate,
_mutatis mutandis._

  



  

(ii) in the event that the Contemplated Innogy Restructuring occurs
following the Closing, Sellers may assign their rights and obligations under
and in connection with this Agreement to an RWE Transferee or RWE Transferees;
_provided_ that (A) a copy of the fully-executed Assignment of Agreement
(Post-Closing) is delivered to Purchaser and (B) such RWE Transferee (if not
RWE AG) is at the time of such transfer connected to RWE AG through an
unbroken chain of domination- ( _Beherrschungs-_ ) and/or profit and loss
transfer agreements ( _Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrage_) in accordance with German
statutory Law with RWE AG that has been registered with the commercial
register of such RWE Transferee. Upon the delivery of a fully-executed
Assignment of Agreement (Post-Closing) to Purchaser, Signing Sellers
automatically shall be released from all liability and further obligations
under this Agreement without further action; _provided_ that nothing in the
foregoing shall release any liability for Fraud occurring prior to such
transfer or any breach of this _Section 9.01_. In such case:

  



  

(A) The RWE Transferee or RWE Transferees shall become "Replacement
Seller" or "Replacement Sellers," as the case may be, and Replacement Seller
or Replacement Sellers shall be deemed to be a "Seller" or "Sellers" (as may
be applicable) hereunder from the date of this Agreement, _mutatis mutandis_ ;

  



  

(B) references to "innogy SE" in (1) the first sentence in

indemnification rights and obligations shall be deemed to be references to the
"Seller" or "Sellers" (as may be applicable) hereunder from the date of this

(C) references in _Section 3.27_ to "Seller" or "Sellers" shall
be deemed to include "Signing Sellers,"  _mutatis mutandis._

  



  

(c) In the event of any expiration or termination during the
Coverage Period of the domination- ( _Beherrschungs-_ ) and/or profit and
loss transfer agreements ( _Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrage_) referenced in _Section
9.01(b)_ Sellers shall provide sufficient notice so that, and without
limiting any rights of Purchaser under the Assignment Agreement
(including the guarantee referenced therein), Purchaser is able to make or
assert any claims necessary to secure its rights under German Law. In the
event of any expiration or termination during the Coverage Period of the
domination ( _Beherrschungs-_ ) and/or profit and loss transfer agreements (
_Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrage_) referenced in _Section 9.01(b)_, Sellers may
put in place a new structure of domination ( _Beherrschungs-_ ) and/or profit
and loss transfer agreements ( _Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrage_) to the effect
that RWE Transferee will once again be connected to RWE AG through an unbroken
chain of domination and/or profit ( _Beherrschungs-_ ) and loss transfer
agreements ( _Gewinnabf uhrungsvertrage_). As used in this _Section

accordance with, the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to
the conflicts of laws principles thereof, other than (a) New York General

Agreement is prepared for convenience or any other purpose, the provisions of

Agreement, or the breach thereof ("Dispute") shall be determined by
arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution
("ICDR") in accordance with its International Arbitration Rules (the "ICDR

arbitration, the Parties agree to attempt in good faith to negotiate a
resolution to any Dispute promptly. In the event that the Parties are unable

be entitled to nominate, within thirty-five (35) days of the commencement of
arbitration, one arbitrator; and the two party-nominated arbitrators will
nominate the president of the Tribunal. The arbitrators selected hereunder (i)
shall be knowledgeable in the subject matter of the Dispute; and (ii) shall
not be employed by, have an interest in, or otherwise be affiliated with any
of the Parties or their respective counsel. For the purposes of arbitrator
appointment, the Sellers collectively shall be one Party. The presiding
arbitrator selected hereunder shall (i) have at least twenty (20) years'

monetary damages shall include a breakdown in writing of the type or types

entered and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The Tribunal
shall have the authority to award the fees and expenses of the Tribunal,
administrative costs of the arbitration, and fees and expenses of the
prevailing Party (including reasonable attorney's fees) to the prevailing
Party. For purposes of the foregoing sentence, the prevailing Party shall be
determined by the Tribunal taking into account the circumstances of the case.

  



  

(j) Except as may be required by law or to enforce the arbitration
agreement or any arbitration award, or as required by the rules of any stock
exchange, neither a Party nor its representatives may disclose the existence,
content, or results of any arbitration hereunder without the prior written
consent of both Parties.

  



  

(k) EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY
LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY SUCH ACTION
OR PROCEEDING.

  



  

Section 9.04 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_. Except
for that certain letter agreement between the Acquired Entities and
Purchaser, dated June 11, 2020 ("Cost Reimbursement Agreement"), this
Agreement and all Exhibits and Schedules hereto together with all documents
to be entered into at or prior to Closing pursuant to this Agreement shall
constitute the entire understanding of the Parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and fully supersede all prior oral and written
agreements and understandings between the Parties (including their respective
Affiliates) with respect to such subject matter. No supplement, modification,
or waiver of this Agreement shall be binding unless executed in writing
by the Party to be bound thereby. No waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision

Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement is
held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, the other provisions of this Agreement will remain in full
force and effect. Any provision of this Agreement held invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable only in part or degree will remain in full force and effect to
the extent not held invalid, illegal, or unenforceable to the maximum extent
permitted by Law. Upon a determination that any provision of this
Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the Parties shall negotiate
in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of

that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are consummated as

Section 9.07 _Multiple Counterparts_. This Agreement may be

original for all purposes), each of which shall be deemed an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

  



  

Section 9.08 _Expenses_. Except as set forth in the Cost
Reimbursement Agreement or as otherwise specified herein (including in
_Sections 2.08_ , _Section 6.04(a)(i)_, and _Section 6.14_), each Party

incident to this Agreement and to any action taken by such Party in
preparation for carrying this Agreement into effect.

  



  

Section 9.09 _Burden and Benefit_. This Agreement shall be binding
upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the Parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Conflicts and Privilege_. Recognizing that KandL Gates
LLP has acted as legal counsel to Signing Sellers and the Acquired Entities
prior to and as of the date of this Agreement and that KandL Gates LLP may be
asked to act as legal counsel to Signing Sellers (or "Replacement Seller" or
"Replacement Sellers," if applicable) after the date of this Agreement, the
Parties acknowledge that the Acquired Entities have waived, on their own
behalf, and Purchaser hereby waives, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with KandL Gates LLP's representation of Signing Sellers (and 
"Replacement Seller" or "Replacement Sellers," if applicable) after the
Closing. The Parties also acknowledge that the Acquired Entities have agreed,
and Purchaser also agrees, that, as to all communications among KandL Gates LLP,
on the one hand, and the Acquired Entities (or any of them), the Signing
Sellers (or any of them), or the Acquired Entities and Signing Sellers (and
"Replacement Seller" or "Replacement Sellers," if applicable), on the other
hand, that relate in any way to this Agreement and to the transactions under
or related to this Agreement and are in fact subject to attorney-
client privilege, the attorney-client privilege and the expectation of client
confidence belong to Signing Sellers (and "Replacement Seller" or
"Replacement Sellers," if applicable), shall be owned and controlled by
Signing Sellers (and "Replacement Seller" or "Replacement Sellers," if
applicable), and shall not pass to Purchaser or the Acquired Entities nor be
retained by the Acquired Entities.

Section 9.11 _No Recourse_. It is expressly agreed and understood
that any obligations of a Party arising from (or in connection with any
performance under) this Agreement and/or any certificates or documents
delivered in connection with this Agreement are solely the obligations of
such Party, and no personal liability whatsoever (of any type or nature)
will attach to, or be incurred by, any member of Purchaser Indemnified Group
or Sellers Indemnified Group, as applicable, other than the applicable Party
because of the incurrence by such Party of any obligations set forth in this
Agreement or in any certificate or document delivered in connection with this
Agreement or by reason thereof, and any personal liability in respect of any
such obligations of any type or nature, and any and all claims for any such
liability against any such member of Purchaser Indemnified Group or Sellers
Indemnified Group, as applicable, other than the applicable Party, whether
arising in common law or equity or created by rule of law, statute,
constitution, or otherwise, are expressly released and waived by the other
Parties for and on behalf of itself and each member of its respective
indemnified group, in each case, as a condition of, and as part of the
consideration for, the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such
Party. Each member of Purchaser Indemnified Group or Sellers
Indemnified Group, as applicable, is expressly intended to be a Third Party
beneficiary of this _Section 9.11_.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Director and Officer Indemnification_. For a
period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, Purchaser shall not, and
shall ensure that the Acquired Entities do not, amend, repeal, or modify any
provision in the Organizational Documents of the Acquired Entities relating to
the exculpation, indemnification, or advancement of expenses of officers,
directors, or other Third Parties in any way that diminishes or adversely
affects the exculpation, mandatory indemnification, or mandatory advancement
of expenses provided therein.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Cumulative Remedies_. The rights and remedies of each
Party are cumulative of each other and of every other right or remedy such
Party may otherwise have at law or in equity, and the exercise of one or more
rights or remedies by such Party shall not prejudice or impair the concurrent
or subsequent exercise of other rights or remedies by such Party.

  



  

Section 9.14 _No Partnership or Joint Venture_. The Parties hereto
do not intend to create a partnership or joint venture by virtue of this
Agreement. No Party shall owe any fiduciary duty to any other Party by virtue
of this Agreement or any other Sellers Document or Purchaser Document or
otherwise.

  



  

Section 9.15 _No Merger_. This Agreement is a fully integrated
complete agreement and is not merged with or extinguished by any other
agreement.

  



  

Section 9.16 _Specific Performance_. In the event of any actual or
threatened breach by any of the Parties of any of the covenants, obligations,
or agreements in this Agreement, the Party who is or is to be thereby
aggrieved shall have the right to seek specific performance and injunctive
relief giving effect to its rights under this Agreement, in addition to any
other rights and remedies at law or in equity, subject to _Section 7.11_.
The Parties agree that any such breach or threatened breach could cause
irreparable injury, that the remedies at law for any such breach or threatened
breach, including monetary damages, are inadequate compensation for any loss
and that any defense in any action for specific performance that a remedy at
law would be adequate is waived.
