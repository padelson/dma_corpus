or  arrangement the main purpose, or one of the main purposes, of which is 
the avoidance of tax.  2.2 Only Options which are Replacement Options may be
granted by the Board  under this Plan.  3. GRANT OF OPTIONS  3.1 Subject
to the limits set out in these Rules and Schedule 5, the Board  may, in its

shall select. No further Options may be granted whilst  there exist
subsisting Options granted under the Plan where their grant  would breach any

Agreement shall be in substantially the form attached to  this Plan as

prescribe which complies with the requirements of Schedule  5.  4.3 An
Option Holder may renounce any Option granted to him within 30 days  after
the Date of Grant and if an Option is so renounced it will be  deemed never
to have been granted to him.      5. PLAN LIMITS  5.1 This Plan shall
commence on the Adoption Date and shall (unless  previously terminated by a
resolution of the Board or a resolution of  the Company in general meeting)
terminate upon the expiry of a period  of 10 years from such date. Upon
termination (however it occurs) no  further Options shall be granted, but
termination shall be without  prejudice to any accrued rights in existence at
the date of  termination.  5.2 The power of the Board to grant Options
under Rule 3 shall be limited  and take effect so that following any grant of
Options under the Plan,  an Option Holder will not hold Options granted under
the Plan or any UK  Inland Revenue approved CSOP scheme operated by the
Company or any  Qualifying Subsidiary over Shares with an aggregate market
value in  excess of any limit as may apply from time to time under Schedule
5,  determined on the basis of the Market Value of the Shares as at the 
Date of Grant of the relevant Option and the market value as at the  date of
grant of any options granted under any UK Inland Revenue  approved CSOP
scheme.  5.3 The number of Shares over which Options are granted under this
Plan  shall be taken into account when calculating the share limits
contained  in section 3 of the FndWhat.com 2003 Stock Incentive Plan, in 
accordance with the terms of that section.  6. TIME OF EXERCISE  6.1
Options shall vest in accordance with the terms of the Option Agreement  and
shall only become exercisable (subject to Rule 6.2 or any contrary  specific
provision contained in the Option Agreement) on the earliest  to occur of the
following:  6.1.1 the Board serving written notice on all Option Holders of
the receipt  of a third party arms length offer being made to any shareholder
or  shareholders the completion of which will result in the occurrence of a 
Sale, other than in circumstances where the assets are sold to an  Associated
Company or the Company is liquidated for the purposes of  amalgamation,
reorganisation or reconstruction of whatsoever kind,  which notice shall
specify the time limit by which any exercise of  rights must be finalised and
shall state that any exercise is subject  to actual completion of the
Sale;  6.1.2 the Board serving written notice on all Option Holders of the
receipt  of a third party arms length offer being made to any shareholder
or  shareholders the completion of which will result in the occurrence of a 
Change of Control, other than in circumstances where the Change of  Control
is to an Associated Company or the Company is liquidated for  the purposes of
amalgamation, reorganisation or reconstruction of  whatsoever kind, which
notice shall specify the time limit by which any  exercise of rights must be
finalised and shall state that any exercise  is subject to actual completion
of the Change of Control;  6.1.3 the date on which an Option Holder ceases
to be an Eligible Employee of  the Company or any Qualifying Subsidiary for
any reason other than  where he so ceases as a result of termination on his
committing any  breach which would entitle the Company or any Associated
Company to  terminate without notice that Option Holder\'s position as an
Eligible  Employee of the Company or any Associated Company whether under
the  terms of that Option Holder\'s employment contract or
otherwise;  6.1.4 on each date that the Option shall vest whether in whole
or in part in  accordance with the Option Agreement.  6.2 Options shall
vest (but not become exercisable purely as a result of  this Rule 6.2) if the
Company serves a notice of intention to procure  (an "Intention Notice") that
Option Holders are to be granted new  rights within six months of an event
under Rule 6.1.1 or 6.1.2 in  substitution for all or any part of the rights
they hold as Option  Holders. The Company has the right to revoke the
Intention Notice prior  to the said event to the effect that the Intention
Notice had never  been served and may instead serve notice under Rules 6.1.1
or 6.1.2.  6.3 Where new rights are granted in accordance with Rule 6.2,
they must be,  in the opinion of the Auditors (acting as experts and not as 
arbitrators) no less valuable overall than the prior rights.   7. LAPSE OF
OPTIONS  7.1 Options shall lapse on the earliest of the following
dates:  7.1.1 the tenth anniversary of the Date of Grant;  7.1.2 subject
to Rule 7.2, immediately on completion or, if earlier, the  expiry of the
date specified in the written notice of the Sale or  Change of Control in
accordance with Rule 6.1.1 or Rule 6.1.2 above;  7.1.3 immediately upon the
date on which an Option Holder commits any breach  which would entitle the
Company or any Associated Company to terminate  without notice the employment
of the Option Holder as an Eligible  Employee of the Company or any
Associated Company whether under the  terms of that Option Holder\'s
employment contract or otherwise;  7.1.4 one month after the date on which
an Option Holder ceases to be an  Eligible Employee of the Company or any
Associated Company in  accordance with Rule 6.1.3 above;  7.1.5 the passing
of an effective resolution or the making of an order by the  Court for the
winding-up of the Company.  7.2 Where an Intention Notice has been served
under Rule 6.2 and has not  been revoked, the Option shall lapse at the
expiry of six months from  the date of the Sale or Change of Control (as
applicable) or earlier at  the date (if any) specified in the Intention
Notice.  8. MANNER OF EXERCISE OF OPTIONS  8.1 An Option shall be
exercised by notice in writing (in the form  prescribed by the Company) given
by the Option Holder, or as the case  may be his personal representatives, to
the Company and the notice of  exercise of the Option shall be accompanied
by:  8.1.1 the relevant Option Agreement; and  8.1.2 a remittance for the
total Exercise Price payable.  8.2 The Option Holder shall also deliver a
remittance for the tax and/or  social security contributions, if required by
the Company or an  Associated Company pursuant to Rule 10.3, as a condition
of receiving  the Shares pursuant to Rule 8.3.  8.3 Within 30 days after
receipt of a notice of exercise, the Option  Agreement and the appropriate
remittance (if any) required pursuant to  Rule 8.1 above, the Board shall
issue or procure the transfer to the  Option Holder of the number of Shares
in respect of which the Option  has been validly exercised. Save for any
rights determined by reference  to a date on or before the date of issuance,
any Shares which are  issued shall rank pari passu and as one class with the
other issued  shares of the same class.  8.4 In respect of any Shares
issued under this Plan at a time when the  Shares are listed on a stock
exchange, the Company shall make  application to the stock exchange in
question for such Shares to be  admitted to listing.  9. VARIATION OF SHARE
CAPITAL  9.1 Subject to Rule 9.2 below, in the event of any variation in the
share  capital of the Company (whenever affected) by way of capitalisation
or  rights issue, sub-division, consolidation, reduction or otherwise, the 
Board may make such adjustments as it considers appropriate to:  9.1.1 the
number of Shares in respect of which any Option may be exercised; 
and  9.1.2 the Exercise Price at which Shares may be acquired by the
exercise of  any such Option; or     9.1.3 where any such Option has
been exercised but no Shares have been issued  or transferred to such
exercise, the number of Shares which may be so  issued or transferred and the
Exercise Price at which they may be so  acquired,  provided that the
overall value of the Option is unchanged and provided that no alteration may
be made to an Option which falls outside the provisions of Schedule 5.  9.2
As soon as reasonably practicable after making any adjustment under  Rule 9.1
above, the Board shall give notice in writing thereof to any  Option Holder
affected thereby.  10. WITHHOLDING  The Company or any Associated Company
shall be entitled to withhold, and the Option Holder shall be obliged to pay,
the amount of any tax and/or national insurance contributions (including if
applicable the employer\'s secondary Class 1 national insurance
contributions) attributable to or payable in connection with the grant or any
vesting, exercise, release or assignment of any Option (i) by deduction from
the Option Holder\'s salary or other earnings or payments due at any time,
(ii) directly from the Option Holder and/or (iii) by selling some of the
Shares the Option Holder is entitled to receive on the exercise of
the Option. The Company may also withhold some or all of the Shares due to
the Option Holder on the exercise of the Option until such tax and/or
national insurance contributions have been so recovered.  11.
ADMINISTRATION AND AMENDMENT  11.1 The Board shall have power from time to
time to make and vary such  regulations (not being inconsistent with this
Plan or Schedule 5) for  the implementation and administration of this Plan
as it thinks fit.  11.2 The decision of the Board, or any committee
appointed pursuant to Rule  11.6, shall be final and binding in all matters
relating to this Plan  (other than in the case of matters to be confirmed by
the Auditors in  accordance with these Rules).  11.3 The Rules may be
altered from time to time by the Board save that no  alteration or addition
may be made to the advantage of Option Holders  without the approval of the
Company in general meeting unless it is a  minor amendment to benefit the
administration of the Plan in which case  the approval of the Company in
general meeting is not necessary. No  amendment shall be made which would
adversely affect any of the  subsisting rights of Option Holders without the
written consent of  Option Holders who, if all Subsisting Options were to be
exercised in  full, would become entitled to not less than three-quarters of
all the  Shares which would fall to be transferred and/or allotted.  11.4
Written notice of any amendment to this Plan shall be given to all  Option
Holders.  11.5 The Company shall not be obliged to provide Eligible
Employees or  Option Holders with copies of any notices, circulars or other
documents  sent to shareholders of the Company.  11.6 The Board may
establish a committee to which it may delegate its powers  under this Plan.
The Board may, at any time, alter or direct the manner  in which the
committee shall act.  11.7 In any matter in which they are required to act
under this Plan, the  Auditors shall be deemed to be acting as experts and
not as arbitrators  and their determinations shall be final and binding on
all parties.  12. GENERAL  12.1 No person shall be treated for the
purposes of this Plan as ceasing to  be an Eligible Employee of the Company
or any Associated Company until  he ceases to be an Eligible Employee of the
Company and all other  Associated Companies.      12.2 Notwithstanding
any provision of any other Rule, the rights and  obligations of any
individual under the terms of his office or  employment with the Company or
any Associated Company shall not be  affected by his participation in this
Plan or any right which he may  have to participate therein. An individual
who is granted any Options  pursuant to this Plan shall have no rights to
compensation or damages  in consequence of the termination of his office or
employment with the  Company or an Associated Company for any reason
whatsoever, whether or  not in breach of contract, insofar as those rights
arise or may arise  from his ceasing to have rights under or be entitled to
exercise any  Options under this Plan as a result of such termination or from
the  loss or diminution in value of such rights or entitlements. If an 
individual did acquire any such rights, he would be deemed to have  waived
them irrevocably by not renouncing the Option pursuant to Rule  3.3.  12.3
Save as otherwise provided in this Plan any notice or communication to  be
given by the Company to any Eligible Employee or Option Holder may  be
personally delivered or sent by fax or by ordinary post to his last  known
address and where a notice or communication is sent by post it  shall be
deemed to have been received 72 hours after the same was put  into the post
properly addressed and stamped. Share certificates and  other communications
sent by post will be sent at the risk of the  Eligible Employee or Option
Holder concerned and the Company shall have  no liability to any such persons
in respect of any notification,  document, share certificate or other
communication so given, sent or  made.  12.4 Any notice to be given to the
Company shall be faxed, delivered or sent  to the Company at its registered
office and shall be effective upon  receipt.  12.5 Options granted under
this Plan shall be governed by and construed in  accordance with the laws of
England.           SCHEDULE I    THE FINDWHAT.COM EMI REPLACEMENT

the Option Holder\'s rights or entitlement to  exercise Options (or any
