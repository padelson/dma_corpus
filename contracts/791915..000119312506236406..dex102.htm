To Whom It May Concern:

As an inducement to PowerLight Corporation (the " _Company_ "), a California

Merger Agreement (the " _Lock-Up Period_ "); provided, however, that if the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 (the " _Registration Statement_ ") to be
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") by Parent
in connection with the Merger shall not have been declared effective by the
SEC prior to the thirty-first (31st) day after the date on which it was first
filed with the SEC (the " _31 st Day_"), the Lock-Up Period shall be extended
by the number of days from and including the 31st Day until and including the
day on which the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC), the
undersigned will not, without the prior written consent of the Company,
directly or indirectly, (i) offer to sell, sell, contract to sell, sell any
option or contract to purchase, purchase any option or contract to sell, grant
any option, right or warrant for the sale of, or otherwise dispose of or

date hereof, or acquired hereafter, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for any shares of Parent Class B Common Stock,
(ii) enter into, or cause any of its subsidiaries to enter into, a transaction
which would have the same effect, (iii) enter into any swap or other
arrangement or transaction that transfers (including pursuant to the granting
of any proxy), in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, any of the
economic consequences of, or voting rights arising from, ownership of
such shares of Parent Class B Common Stock, whether any such aforementioned
transaction is to be settled by delivery of the Parent Class B Common Stock or
such other securities, in cash or otherwise, (iv) exercise any right to
convert such shares of Parent Class B Common Stock into any other security,
or (v) publicly disclose the intention to make any such offer, sale, or
disposition, to enter into any such transaction, swap, or other arrangement or
to exercise any right to convert; provided, however, that nothing set forth
herein shall preclude the undersigned from pledging, or engaging in customary
hedging transactions with respect to, Parent Class B Common Stock (the actions
described in clauses (i) through and including (v), being referred to as a "
_Disposition Transaction_ "). In addition, the undersigned agrees that,
without the prior written consent of the Company, it will not, during the

Common Stock or any security convertible into or exercisable or exchangeable
for the Parent Class B Common Stock. Furthermore, during the Lock-Up Period, the undersigned hereby agrees not to,
and shall not instruct or authorize its officers, directors, employees,
financial advisors, representatives, agents, Subsidiaries and Affiliates to,
directly or indirectly, (i) solicit any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person in respect of a Disposition Transaction; or (ii) enter into any
agreement with any Person in respect of a Disposition Transaction.

In furtherance of the foregoing, Parent and its transfer agent and registrar
are hereby authorized to decline to make any transfer of shares of Parent
Class B Common Stock if such transfer would constitute a violation or breach
of this Agreement.

This Agreement shall be binding on the undersigned and the successors, heirs,
personal representatives and assigns of the undersigned. This Agreement shall
lapse and become null and void (and the Lock-Up Period shall terminate
immediately) if the Merger Agreement terminates or is terminated. This
Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the laws of
the State of California.
