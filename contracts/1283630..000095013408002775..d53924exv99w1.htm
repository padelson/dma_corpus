    ##### 

  

 

the " _Payment Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall not be entitled to vote or
exercise any rights of ownership with respect to the Parent Common Shares
held by it from time to time hereunder, except that it shall receive and hold
all dividends or other distributions paid or distributed with respect to such
shares for the account of the Persons entitled thereto. The Payment Fund
shall be invested (if at all) by the Exchange Agent, as directed by Parent, 
_provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall only be in obligations of
or guaranteed by the United States. 

   

 (b) Each holder of an outstanding Certificate or Certificates who has surrendered such Certificate or Certificates to the Exchange Agent will, upon acceptance thereof by the Exchange Agent, be entitled to receive (i) a certificate or certificates representing the number of whole Parent Common Shares into which the aggregate number of Company Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(i), _plus_ (ii) the amount of cash into which the aggregate number of Company Common Shares previously represented by such Certificate or Certificates surrendered shall have been converted into pursuant to Section 3.01(c)(ii), _plus_ (iii) an amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional Parent Common Shares pursuant to Section 3.05, in each case without interest.

Each outstanding Certificate that prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time represented Company Common Shares and which is not surrendered to the Exchange Agent in accordance with the procedures provided for herein shall, except as otherwise herein provided, until duly surrendered to the Exchange Agent, only be deemed to evidence the right to receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration. After the REIT Merger Effective Time, there shall be no further transfer on the records of the Company of Certificates representing Company Common Shares and if such Certificates are presented to the Company for transfer, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration. No dividends on Parent Common Shares that have been declared will be remitted to any Person entitled to receive Parent Common Shares under this Agreement until such Person surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing Company Common Shares, at which time such dividends shall be remitted to such Person, without interest. 

   

 (c) Promptly after the REIT Merger Effective Time (but in any event within four (4) Business Days after the REIT Merger Effective Time), appropriate transmittal materials in a form satisfactory to Parent and the Company (including a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate shall pass, only upon delivery of such certificate to the Exchange Agent) shall be mailed to each holder of record of Company Common Shares. Parent shall not be obligated to deliver cash and/or a certificate or certificates representing Parent Common Shares to which a holder of Company Common Shares would otherwise be entitled as a result of the REIT Merger until such holder surrenders the Certificate or Certificates representing the Company Common Shares for exchange as provided in this Section 3.04(c), or, in default thereof, an appropriate affidavit of loss and indemnity agreement and/or a bond as may be required by Parent or the Exchange Agent. If any certificates evidencing Parent Common Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate evidencing Company Common Shares surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or accompanied by an executed form of assignment separate from the Certificate and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such exchange pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other tax required by reason of the issuance of a certificate for 

    ##### 

  

 

Parent Common Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of
the Certificate surrendered, or otherwise establish to the satisfaction of
the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 

   

 (d) Any portion of the Payment Fund delivered to the Exchange Agent by Parent pursuant to Section 3.04(a) that remains unclaimed by the holders of the Company Common Shares and holders of LP Units for one year after the REIT Merger Effective Time (as well as any proceeds from any investment thereof) shall be delivered by the Exchange Agent to Parent. Any shareholders of the Company or unit holders of the Company Operating Partnership who have not theretofore complied with this Article III shall thereafter look only to Parent for the payment of the Parent Cash Consideration and the Partnership Cash Consideration, as applicable. Neither the Exchange Agent nor any party to this Agreement shall be liable to any Person in respect of the Parent Cash Consideration or the Operating Partnership Cash Consideration, as applicable, if the Payment Fund has been paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to rely upon the stock transfer books of the Company to establish the identity of those Persons entitled to receive the Company Common Share Merger Consideration specified in this Agreement, which books shall be conclusive with respect thereto. 

   

 (e) Parent and/or the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common Stock or LP Units such amounts, if any, as are required to be deducted or withheld under any provision of U.S. federal tax Law, or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. Amounts so withheld shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of shares of Company Common Stock or LP Units in respect of which such deduction or withholding was made. 

   

 (f) Appropriate adjustments shall be made to the procedures set forth in this Section 3.04 to permit the payment of the Company Common Share Merger Consideration, the Partnership Merger Consideration and other amounts payable under this Section 3.04 in the case of any uncertificated Company Common Shares or LP Units as if such shares or units were represented by certificates. 

   

 Section 3.05 _No Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, neither certificates nor scrip for a fractional Parent Common Shares shall be issued in the REIT Merger. Each holder of Company Common Shares who otherwise would have been entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share shall receive in lieu thereof cash (without interest) in an amount determined by multiplying (x) the fractional share interest to which such holder would otherwise be entitled (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) by (y) the average closing price of a Parent Common Share on the New York Stock Exchange (the " _NYSE_ ") on the ten (10) trading days immediately preceding the second (2nd) day prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time (as reported in the _Wall Street Journal_ , or if not reported therein, in another authoritative source), rounded to the nearest one-tenth of a thousand. No such holder shall be entitled to dividends, voting rights or any other rights in respect of any fractional share. 

  

 Section 3.06 _Dissenters  Rights_. No dissenters or appraisal rights shall be available with respect to the Mergers or the Contemplated Transactions.

the Companys Knowledge, threatened and (D) intends to continue to operate in

 Section 5.01 _Organization, Standing and Corporate Power of Parent_. 

  

 (a) Parent is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State of Maryland and has all of the requisite power, authority and necessary government approvals or licenses to own, lease and operate its properties, and to carry on its business as now being conducted, except where the failure to have such approvals or licenses would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business it is conducting, or the ownership, operation or leasing of its properties or the management of properties for others makes such qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent has all requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, lease and encumber its properties and carry on its business as now conducted. Parent has heretofore made available to the Company complete and correct copies of Parents Articles of Amendment and Restatement (the " _Parent Charter_ "), and Bylaws, as amended through the date hereof (the " _Parent Bylaws_ "). The Parent Charter and the Parent Bylaws are each in full force and effect. 

   

 (b) The minute books of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries for which minute books are maintained for the period since January 1, 2005 have been made available to Parent, accurately reflect in all material respects all action of the shareholders and directors and any committees of the Parent Board and each of the Subsidiaries of Parent and all actions of the partners and members of each of such Subsidiaries taken during such period.

Each Subsidiary of Parent is duly qualified or licensed to do business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the 

   ##### 

  

   

nature of its business or the ownership, operation or leasing of its
properties or the management of properties for others makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent
Material Adverse Effect. All outstanding equity interests in each Parent
Subsidiary have been duly authorized and are validly issued, fully paid and
(except for general partnership interests) non-assessable, and are not
subject to any preemptive rights and are owned by Parent or a Subsidiary of
Parent (except for limited partnership units in the Parent Operating
Partnership identified as being owned by a Person other than Parent in the
Parent Operating Partnership Agreement and equity interests in joint ventures
identified as being owned by a Person other than Parent in the partnership,
limited liability company or joint venture agreement thereof) and are so
owned free and clear of Liens except any Liens that would not, individually
or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse
Effect. There are no outstanding options, warrants or other rights to acquire
ownership interests from any Parent Subsidiary. Parent has heretofore made
available to the Company complete and correct copies of the Parent Operating
Partnership Agreement as amended to the date hereof and as in full force
and effect. 

   

 (c) Except for the stock of, or other equity interests in, the Subsidiaries of Parent disclosed in Section 5.02(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule, and the joint venture and other interests disclosed in Section 5.02(b) of the Parent Disclosure Schedule (the " _Parent Joint Venture Interests_ "), neither Parent nor any of the Parent Subsidiaries owns any stock or other ownership or equity or debt interest in any Person.

of its Subsidiaries internal controls over financial reporting. 

   

 (c) Parent has not identified any material weaknesses in the design or operation of Parents internal control over financial reporting.

be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Neither Parent nor any of
its Subsidiaries has received written notification of violation of, and to
the Knowledge of Parent, no claim exists alleging the violation of, any
applicable Law of any Governmental Authority, except for violations and
notices that would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. No investigation or review
by any Governmental Authority with respect to Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is pending or, to the Knowledge of Parent, is threatened, other
than those the outcome of which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 Section 5.11 _Taxes_. 

  

 (a) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has timely filed or has had timely filed on its behalf all Tax Returns required to be filed by it or on its behalf (after giving effect to any filing extension properly granted by a Governmental Authority having authority to do so or otherwise permitted by Law in each jurisdiction in which it is required to do so, based on its assets and/or operations). Each such Tax Return was, at the time filed, true, correct and complete in all material respects. Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries has paid (or Parent has paid on behalf of such Subsidiary), within the time and in the manner prescribed by Law, all Taxes that are due and payable. Parent has incurred no liability for any Taxes under Sections 857, 860(c) or 4981 of the Code, including any Tax arising from a prohibited transaction described in Section 857(b)(6) of the Code and the excise tax on redetermined rents, redetermined deductions, and excess interest under Section 857(b)(7) of the Code; and neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred any material liability for Taxes other than in the ordinary course of business and other than transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with the purchase or sale of property. No deficiencies for Taxes have been asserted or assessed in writing by a Governmental Authority against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, and no requests for waivers of the time to assess any such Taxes have been granted and remain in effect or are pending. No claim is pending or proposed by any Governmental Authority in any jurisdiction where Parent or any Parent Subsidiary does not file Tax Returns that Parent or any Parent Subsidiary is or may be subject to taxation by such jurisdiction, nor to the Knowledge of the Parent are there any facts that could reasonably be expected to give rise to such a claim.

be expected to result in a successful challenge by the IRS to its status as a
REIT, and no such challenge is pending, or to Parents Knowledge, threatened
and (D) intends to continue to operate in such a manner as to permit it to
continue to qualify as a REIT. Each Subsidiary of Parent which files Tax
Returns as a partnership or is a disregarded entity for U.S. federal
income tax purposes has since its formation or acquisition by Parent been
classified for U.S. federal income tax purposes as either a partnership or
disregarded entity and not as an association taxable as a corporation, or a
"publicly traded partnership" within the meaning of Section 7704(b) of
the Code that is treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax
purposes under Section 7704(a) of the Code. Each Subsidiary of Parent which
is a corporation has been since its formation classified as a qualified REIT
subsidiary under Section 856(i) of the Code or a taxable REIT subsidiary
under Section 856(l) of the Code. No Subsidiary of Parent is classified as or

 (f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries have any material liability for the Taxes of any Person other than Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (A) under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or any similar provision of state, local or foreign Law) or (B) as a transferee or successor. 

   

 Section 5.12 _Pension and Benefit Plans; ERISA_. 

  

 (a) Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, each Parent Plan complies and has been administered in form and in operation, in all material respects, with all applicable requirements of Law and their terms and no notice has been issued by any Governmental Authority questioning or challenging such compliance.

 ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS 

   

 Section 7.01 _Proxy Statement; Registration Statement; Other Filings_. As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company and Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement. Each of the Company and Parent shall, or shall cause their respective affiliates to, prepare and file with the SEC all Other Filings that are required to be filed by such party in connection with the Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions. Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning itself and its affiliates that is required to be included in the Registration Statement or, to the extent applicable, the Other Filings, or that is customarily included in registration statements prepared in connection with transactions of the type contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC with respect to the Registration Statement or the Other Filings, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the definitive Registration Statement to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the Companys shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable following clearance by the SEC. Parent shall also take any action (other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required to be taken under any applicable state securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Common Shares in the Mergers and the Company shall furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders 

   ##### 

  

 

of the Company Common Shares as may be reasonably requested in connection
with any such action. Each of the Company and Parent shall promptly (and in
no event later than one (1) Business Day after receipt) notify the other
party upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff or any
request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or supplements to the
Registration Statement or the Other Filings and shall provide the other party
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or Parent
(as applicable) and its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its
staff, on the other hand, relating to the Registration Statement or the Other
Filings. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholder Meeting, any
information relating to the Company, Parent, or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors, shall be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Other Filings, so that the Registration
Statement or the Other Filings shall not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
disseminated to the shareholders of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary stated above, prior to the filing of the
preliminary Registration Statement or the filing and mailing of the final
Registration Statement or filing the Other Filings (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect
thereto, each of the Company and Parent shall provide the other party a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such document or response. 

   

 Section 7.02 _Company Shareholder Meeting_. The Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders (including any adjournments or postponements thereof, the " _Company Shareholder Meeting_ "), as promptly as practicable after the date that the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, for the purpose of voting upon the approval of the REIT Merger (the " _Company Shareholder Approval_ "). Except as may be permitted by Section 7.04, the Company Board shall recommend to holders of the Company Common Shares that they approve the REIT Merger (the " _Company Board Recommendation_ ") and shall include the Company Board Recommendation in the Registration Statement. Subject to Section 7.04, the Company will use reasonable commercial efforts to solicit from its shareholders proxies in favor of the approval of the REIT Merger. 

  

 Section 7.03 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof until the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors, officers, employees and agents to, afford to Parent and to the directors, officers, employees, and agents of Parent access upon reasonable notice and at reasonable times without undue interruption (and will request the same from the Companys auditors, attorneys, financial advisors and lenders) to (a) the properties, books, records and contracts of the Company and the its Subsidiaries and (b) the officers and employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent shall obtain the Companys consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, to a schedule of properties to be visited and officers and employees to be accessed prior to any such visits or access. The Company shall furnish Parent such financial, operating and other data and information as Parent may reasonably request. Parent shall indemnify and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from and against any and all 

    ##### 

  

    

losses or damages incurred by the Company or its Subsidiaries as a result of
the Parents or the Parent representatives inspection of the
Company Properties, _provided,_ _however_ that the Parents indemnification
obligations hereunder shall not include any obligation whatsoever with
respect to any such losses or damages (including claims that any Company
Property has declined in value) arising out of, resulting from or incurred in
connection with the discovery of any existing condition at a Company
Property. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access or disclose information where
such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the Company or its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or binding agreement
entered into prior to the date of this Agreement ( _provided_ that the
Company and its Subsidiaries shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain
consent from the applicable third party or enter into a customary joint
defense agreement to enable the disclosure of such information). 

   

 (b) Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, all information obtained by Parent pursuant to this Section 7.03 and pursuant to the confidentiality agreement, dated October 4, 2007 (the " _Company Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company, shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Company Confidentiality Agreement. Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, all information obtained by the Company pursuant to the confidentiality agreement, dated January 18, 2008 (the " _Parent Confidentiality Agreement_ "), between Parent and the Company, shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Parent Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (c) No investigation pursuant to this Section 7.03 or otherwise shall affect any representation or warranty in this Agreement of any party hereto or any condition to the obligations of the parties hereto. 

   

 Section 7.04 _No Solicitation of Transactions_. 

  

 (a) From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of the REIT Merger Effective Time and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.01(a), the Company Parties shall not, and shall not authorize or permit any of their Subsidiaries, or any of its or their officers, trustees, directors, partners, Affiliates or employees or any investment banker, financial advisor, attorney, accountant or other representative retained by it or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Representatives_ "), directly or indirectly, to (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries, proposals or offers or any other efforts or attempts that constitute or that reasonably may be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal or (ii) initiate or participate in any discussions or negotiations (other than to seek clarifications with respect to an Acquisition Proposal) regarding, or that reasonably may be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition Proposal or enter into any merger agreement, share purchase agreement, asset purchase agreement or share exchange agreement, option agreement or other similar binding agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company to terminate this Agreement (an " _Acquisition Agreement_ "), except as permitted by Section 7.04(d) (except for a confidentiality agreement in compliance with Section 7.04(b)). 

   

 (b) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, at any time prior to the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, if the Company receives a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal from a third party (which was not solicited, initiated, knowingly 

    ##### 

  

    

encouraged or knowingly facilitated in violation of Section 7.04(a)) after the
date hereof, the Company (x) may furnish, or cause to be furnished, non-
public information with respect to the Company and the Subsidiaries of the
Company to the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal and to its financing
sources and Persons or entities working in concert with it (collectively, a "
_Third Party_ "), and (y) may participate in discussions and negotiations
regarding such Acquisition Proposal, if, in the case of either clause (x) or
(y), (A) prior to taking such action, the Company enters into a
confidentiality agreement with the Person who made such Acquisition Proposal
with confidentiality provisions no less favorable to such Third Party than the
Company Confidentiality Agreement is to Parent, (B) the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel
and independent financial advisors, that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is
reasonably likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal and (C) concurrently with
furnishing or causing to be furnished non-public information with respect
to the Company and the Subsidiaries of the Company to a Third Party, the
Company furnishes or causes to be furnished such information to Parent to the
extent not previously provided. The Company Parties shall not, and shall
cause each of the Companys Subsidiaries not to, enter into
any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof
which prohibits the Company Parties from providing such information to
Parent. 

   

 (c) The Company Parties shall provide prompt (within twenty-four (24) hours following receipt thereof) oral and written notice to Parent of (i) the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal, or any material modification or amendment to any Acquisition Proposal, by any Company Party, any Subsidiary of the Company or any Representative, (ii) a summary of the material terms and conditions of such Acquisition Proposal, and (iii) the identity of such Person or entity making any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company Parties shall keep Parent reasonably informed on a current basis, to the extent reasonably practicable, but in any event as promptly as practicable, of the status and material details (including any change to the material terms and conditions) of any such Acquisition Proposal. The Company Parties shall not, and shall cause each of the Companys Subsidiaries not to, enter into any confidentiality agreement with any Person subsequent to the date hereof which prohibits the Company Parties from providing such information to Parent. 

   

 (d) Subject to this Section 7.04(d) and to Section 9.01(e), neither the Company Board nor any committee of the Company Board may (i) withdraw, qualify or modify or propose publicly to withdraw, qualify or modify, in each case, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company Board Recommendation, or the approval or recommendation of any committee of the Company Board of the Mergers (ii) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal (any action described in clauses (i) or (ii) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ", it being agreed that the taking of any of the actions contemplated by Section 7.04(b), (c) or (f) shall not constitute, or be deemed to constitute, an Adverse Recommendation Change) or (iii) authorize or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any Acquisition Agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement in compliance with Section 7.04(b)). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company Board or a committee of the Company Board may (1) make an Adverse Recommendation Change for reasons not related to the receipt of an Acquisition Proposal if the Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be inconsistent with the trustees duties to the Company or its shareholders under applicable Law or (2) in response to a _bona fide_ written Acquisition Proposal (which was not solicited, initiated, knowingly encouraged or knowingly facilitated in violation of Section 7.04(a)) received after the date hereof, take an 

    ##### 

  

    

action referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) above and, in the case
of clause (iii), terminate this Agreement in accordance with Section 9.01(e)
if, after consultation with its independent financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, the Company Board determines in good faith that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal (a " _Subsequent
Determination_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that such actions may only be
taken at a time that is after (I) the third (3rd) Business Day following
Parents receipt of written notice from the Company that the Company Board is
prepared to take such action, and (II) at the end of such period, the Company
Board determines in good faith, after taking into account all amendments or
revisions irrevocably committed to by Parent and after consultation with its
independent financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Acquisition Proposal remains a Superior Proposal relative to the Mergers, as
supplemented by any Counterproposal (as defined below). Any such written
notice shall specify the material terms and conditions of such applicable
Acquisition Proposal, include the most current version of any Acquisition
Agreement (including any amendments, supplements or modifications thereto),
identify the person making such Acquisition Proposal and state that
the Company Board otherwise intends to make a Subsequent Determination
(subject to compliance with this Section 7.04(d)). During such three (3)
Business Day period, Parent shall be entitled to deliver to the Company a
counterproposal to such Acquisition Proposal (a " _Counterproposal_ ").
For purposes of clarification, the statement by the Company that it has
received an Acquisition Proposal, that the Company Board will consider such
Acquisition Proposal and that the Company Board continues to recommend this
Agreement pending such consideration shall not be deemed an
Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 (e) Upon execution of this Agreement, the Company, the Company Operating Partnership and the Companys Subsidiaries shall cease immediately and cause to be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions, solicitations or negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to an Acquisition Proposal by or on behalf of the Company, the Company Operating Partnership or any of the Representatives. The Company shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to cause (including by written request) each Person with whom it has executed a confidentiality agreement within the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof in connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all confidential or other non-public information heretofore furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company, the Company Operating Partnership or any of the Representatives. 

   

 (f) Any other provision of this Agreement notwithstanding, the Company Board may at any time take and disclose to the holders of Company Common Shares a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act, may issue a stop, look and listen announcement and may make any disclosure required by Rule 14a-9 promulgated under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Company nor the Company Board shall be permitted to recommend an Acquisition Proposal which is not a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _further_ , that, for the avoidance of doubt, any public statements by the Company commenting favorably on the merits of an Acquisition Proposal shall be an Adverse Recommendation Change other than (A) a "stop, look and listen" or similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act, (B) a statement expressly recommending that its shareholders reject an Acquisition Proposal or (C) if the statements are accompanied by an express reaffirmation of the Company Board Recommendation to its shareholders in favor of the REIT Merger. 

   

 (g) The Company shall not take any action to exempt any Person (other than Parent or any of its Affiliates and other than in connection with an Acquisition Agreement 

    ##### 

  

    

following a Subsequent Determination) from the restrictions on "control share
acquisitions" contained in the Maryland Control Share Acquisition Act, as
amended (or any similar provisions of the Maryland REIT Law) or otherwise
cause such restrictions not to apply. 

   

 Section 7.05 _Employee Benefits Matters_. 

  

 (a) At the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to assume in accordance with their terms the Companys obligations under all employment, severance and termination plans, arrangements, programs, policies, and agreements (including change-in-control provisions) of employees or independent contractors of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in each case that are expressly set forth in Sections 4.12 or 4.13 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (without giving effect to the proviso set forth in the definition of Company Disclosure Schedule) and that exist immediately prior to the execution of this Agreement. 

   

 (b) For a period of not less than twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, for each employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who was employed on the Closing Date and remains an employee of the Surviving Entity or its successors or assigns or any of their subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Continuing Employees_ "), Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide compensation and, to the extent set forth in Section 4.12 of the Company Disclosure Schedule (without giving effect to the provision set forth in the definition of Company Disclosure Schedule) benefits (including 401(k), group health, life, disability, and severance plans, but excluding equity compensation or promoted interests or comparable forms of compensation) substantially similar in the aggregate to such Continuing Employee and the employees dependents and beneficiaries, as appropriate, as Parent or its Subsidiaries provides to its similarly situated other employees; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing contained in this Section 7.05 or elsewhere in the Agreement (including Section 10.08 hereof) shall be construed to prevent, from and after the REIT Merger Effective Time, the termination of employment of any Continuing Employee or the amendment or termination of any particular Company Employee Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms. To the extent a Continuing Employee becomes eligible to participate in a Parent Plan, such Continuing Employee will be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and its Subsidiaries (and any predecessor entities thereof) before the Closing Date for purposes of vesting and eligibility (but not accrual of benefits) under such Parent Plan to the same extent as such employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service under the respective Company Employee Benefit Plan (except to the extent such credit would result in the duplication of benefits). 

   

 (c) Parent shall (or shall cause the Surviving Entity to) (i) waive any preexisting condition limitations otherwise applicable to the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under any Parent Plan that provides health benefits in which the Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate following the Closing Date, other than any limitations that were in effect with respect to such Continuing Employees as of the Closing Date under the analogous Company Employee Benefit Plan, (ii) credit any amount paid with respect to any deductible, co-payment and out-of-pocket maximums incurred by the Continuing Employees and their eligible dependents under the health plans in which they participated immediately prior to the Closing Date during the portion of the calendar year prior to the Closing Date in satisfying any deductibles, co-payments or out-of-pocket maximums under health plans in which they are eligible to participate after the Closing Date in the same plan year in which such deductibles, co- payments or out-of-pocket maximums were incurred and (iii) waive any waiting period 

    ##### 

  

    

limitation or evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be
applicable to a Continuing Employee and his or her eligible dependents on or
after the Closing Date, in each case to the extent such Continuing Employee
or eligible dependent had satisfied any similar limitation or requirement
under an analogous Company Employee Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date. 

   

 (d) Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company Board shall take such actions as are necessary to terminate the Companys Deferred Compensation Plans. Such action shall be contingent upon, and effective as of, the REIT Merger Effective Time. At the REIT Merger Effective Time, employees shall be paid the balance of their accounts upon termination of the Companys Deferred Compensation Plans. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 7.05 shall survive the Closing and are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and nothing herein, expressed or implied, is intended or shall be construed to confer upon or to give to any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns any legal or equitable or other rights or remedies (with respect to the matters provided for in this Section 7.05) under or by reason of any provision of this Agreement (including Section 10.08 hereof). Nothing in this Section 7.05 is intended as or shall be construed to be an amendment to any Company Employee Benefit Plan. 

   

 Section 7.06 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Without limiting any additional rights that any director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary may have under any employment or indemnification agreement or under the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws, the Company Operating Partnership Agreement or this Agreement or, if applicable, similar organizational documents or agreements of any of the Companys Subsidiaries, from and after the REIT Merger Effective Time, Parent, the Parent Operating Partnership, the Surviving Entity and the Surviving Partnership (the " _Indemnifying Parties_ "), jointly and severally, shall: (i) indemnify and hold harmless each person who is at the date hereof or during the period from the date hereof through the date of the REIT Merger Effective Time serving as a director, officer, trustee, manager, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company and acting in its capacity as such or any of its Subsidiaries or as a fiduciary under or with respect to any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) (collectively, the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, in connection with any Claim and any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, Expenses, judgments, fines, penalties and amounts paid in settlement (including all interest, assessments and other charges paid or payable in connection with or in respect of any thereof) resulting therefrom; and (ii) promptly pay on behalf of or, within thirty (30) days after any request for advancement, advance to each of the Indemnified Parties, to the fullest extent authorized or permitted by applicable Law, as now or hereafter in effect, any Expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect to or otherwise participating with respect to any Claim in advance of the final disposition of such Claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnified Party of any Expenses incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with enforcing any rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case without the requirement of any bond or other security), but subject to (x) receipt of documentation by Parent and Surviving Entity reasonably evidencing the need for such advancement, and (y) Parents or the Surviving Entitys, as applicable, receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party, to repay such Expenses if it is ultimately determined under applicable Laws that such Indemnified Party is not 

    ##### 

  

    

entitled to be indemnified); _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
Indemnifying Parties shall be liable for any amounts paid in settlement
effected without Parents prior written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and shall not be obligated to
pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (selected by a plurality of
the applicable Indemnified Parties) for all Indemnified Parties in any
jurisdiction with respect to any single Claim except to the extent that two
or more of such Indemnified Parties shall have conflicting interests in the
outcome of such action; _provided_ , _further_ , that the Indemnifying
Parties shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and
if a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that
indemnification by the Indemnifying Parties of such Indemnified Party in the
manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.
The indemnification and advancement obligations of the Indemnifying Parties
pursuant to this Section 7.06(a) shall extend to acts or omissions occurring
at or before the Partnership Merger Effective Time and any Claim relating
thereto (including with respect to any acts or omissions occurring
in connection with the approval of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions, including the consideration and
approval thereof and the process undertaken in connection therewith and any
Claim relating thereto), and all rights to indemnification and advancement
conferred hereunder shall continue as to a person who has ceased to be a
director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries after the date hereof and shall inure to the benefit
of such persons heirs, executors and personal and legal representatives.
None of the Indemnifying Parties shall settle, compromise or consent to the
entry of any judgment in any actual or threatened Action in respect of
which indemnification has been or could be sought by such Indemnified Party
hereunder unless the Indemnifying Parties agree to honor the indemnification
obligations hereunder and unless such settlement, compromise or judgment
includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all
liability arising out of such Action or such Indemnified Party otherwise
consents thereto. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification
under this Section 7.06, upon learning of any such Claim, shall promptly
notify the Company and, after the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity; _provided_ that the failure to so notify shall not affect the
obligations of the Company and the Surviving Entity except to the extent, if
any, such failure to promptly notify materially and adversely prejudices such
party. 

   

 As used in this Section 7.06(a): (x) the term " _Claim_ " means any threatened, asserted, pending or completed Action, whether instituted by any party hereto, any Governmental Authority or any other Person, that any Indemnified Party in good faith believes might lead to the institution of any Action, whether civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other, including any arbitration or other alternative dispute resolution mechanism, arising out of or pertaining to matters that relate to such Indemnified Partys duties or service as a director, officer, trustee, employee, agent, or fiduciary of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) maintained by any of the foregoing at or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time; and (y) the term " _Expenses_ " means reasonable attorneys fees and all other reasonable costs, expenses and obligations (including experts fees, travel expenses, court costs, retainers, transcript fees, duplicating, printing and binding costs, as well as telecommunications, postage and courier charges) paid or incurred in connection with investigating, defending, being a witness in or participating in (including on appeal), or preparing to investigate, defend, be a witness in or participate in, any Claim for which indemnification is authorized pursuant to this Section 7.06(a), including any Action relating to a claim for indemnification or advancement brought by an Indemnified Party. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees that all rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time now existing in favor of the current or former directors and officers of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as provided in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws (or, as applicable, the charter, bylaws, partnership agreement, limited liability company agreement, or other organizational documents of any of the Companys Subsidiaries) shall be assumed by the Surviving Entity in the Merger, without further action, at the REIT Merger Effective Time and shall survive the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of six (6) years from the REIT Merger Effective Time. 

   

 (c) For a period of six (6) years from the REIT Merger Effective Time, the operating agreement of the Surviving Entity shall contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification and limitations on liability of trustees and officers than are set forth in the Company Charter and Company Bylaws, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the REIT Merger Effective Time without the consent of the such affected indemnitee in any manner that would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who, at or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, were Indemnified Parties, unless such modification shall be required by Law and then only to the minimum extent required by Law. 

   

 (d) Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company shall purchase a "tail" insurance policy (which policy by its express terms shall survive the Mergers), of at least the same coverage and amounts and containing terms and conditions that are no less favorable to the trustees and officers of the Company as the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policy or policies, for the benefit of the current and former officers and trustees of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries with a claims period of six (6) years from the REIT Merger Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company be required to expend pursuant to this Section 7.06(d) more than the amount set forth in Section 7.06(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (the " _D andO Cap_"). In the event that, but for the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, the Company would be required to expend more than the DandO Cap, the Company shall obtain the maximum amount of such insurance obtainable by payment of annual premiums equal to the DandO Cap. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Entity to, maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor all obligations thereunder. 

   

 (e) If the Surviving Entity or any of its respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges with or into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation, partnership or other entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any persons, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Entity assume and honor the obligations set forth in this Section 7.06. 

   

 (f) Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to perform all of the obligations of the Surviving Entity under this Section 7.06. 

   

 (g) This Section 7.06 shall survive the consummation of the Mergers and is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties and their 

    ##### 

 \\\\ 

    

respective heirs and personal representatives, and shall be binding on the
Surviving Entity and its successors and assigns. 

   

 (h) Parent shall have the right to be consulted in the defense or settlement of any litigation against the Company, its trustees, directors or officers, or the Company Operating Partnership, relating to the Mergers or the Contemplated Transactions and to be kept reasonably informed of material developments in such litigation. 

   

 Section 7.07 _Further Action; Reasonable Commercial Efforts_. 

  

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties hereto shall (i) make promptly its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required submissions, under the HSR Act with respect to this Agreement and the Mergers, if required, and (ii) use its reasonable commercial efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate action, and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Mergers, including using its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all Permits, consents, approvals, authorizations, qualifications and orders of Governmental Authorities and parties to contracts with the Company and its Subsidiaries as are necessary for the consummation of the Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions in order to fulfill the conditions to the Mergers. In the event that any Company Party shall fail to obtain any third party consent described above, the Company Parties shall use their reasonable commercial efforts, and shall take such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent, to minimize any adverse effect upon the Company Parties and the Parent Parties and their respective businesses resulting, or which could reasonably be expected to result, after the REIT Merger Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such consent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than a Governmental Authority) with respect to any transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (i) unless required by the applicable agreement, without the prior written consent of Parent which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation due to such Person and (ii) none of the Parent Parties or their respective affiliates shall be required to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any commitment or incur any liability or other obligation. 

   

 (b) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing Section 7.07(a), Parent and the Company shall (i) promptly after the date of this Agreement, prepare and file the notification and report, if any, required to be filed under the HSR Act, and (ii) endeavor in good faith to make, or cause to be made, as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter and after consultation with the other parties, an appropriate response to any inquiries or requests received from the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") or the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") for additional information or documentation and any inquiries or requests received from any state attorney general, foreign antitrust or competition authority or other Governmental Authority in connection with antitrust or competition matters. Each of Parent and the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act and any other applicable antitrust Law as soon as practicable. Parent and the Company agree to each pay 50% of any filing fee required to be paid in connection with any filing under the HSR Act. In furtherance and not in limitation of 

    ##### 

  

    

the covenants of the parties contained in the foregoing, if any objections
are asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any
Law or if any suit is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC,
the DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of Parent, on
the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall take, or cause to be
taken, all other actions and do, or cause to be done, all other things
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective
the transactions contemplated hereby, including taking all such further
action as may be necessary to resolve such objections, if any, as the FTC,
DOJ, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition authorities of
any other nation or other jurisdiction may assert under any Law with respect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, and to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Law that may be asserted by any Governmental
Authority with respect to the Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions so as
to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably practicable (and in any
event no later than the Drop Dead Date), including (x) proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any assets or
businesses of Parent or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates or of the Company or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates and (y) otherwise taking or committing to take
any actions that, after the Closing Date, would limit Parents or
its Subsidiaries or Affiliates freedom of action, or the Companys or its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates freedom of action, with respect to, or its
ability to retain, one or more of its or its Subsidiaries or Affiliates
business lines, or assets, in each case as may be required in order to avoid
the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary
restraining order or other order in any suit or proceeding which would
otherwise have the effect of preventing the Closing or delaying the Closing
beyond the Drop Dead Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of Parent or
the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall
become subject to, or consent or agree to or otherwise take any action with
respect to, any requirement, condition, understanding, agreement or order of
a Governmental Authority to sell, to hold separate or otherwise dispose of,
or to conduct, restrict, operate, invest or otherwise change its respective
assets or businesses unless such requirement, condition, understanding,
agreement or order is binding only in the event that the Closing occurs.
Notwithstanding the matters covered by this Sections 7.07(b) above, no party
hereto shall be required to provide any other party with copies of
confidential documents or information included in its filings and submissions
under the HSR Act or any other applicable antitrust Law, and a party hereto
may request entry into a joint defense agreement as a condition to providing
any such materials and that, upon receipt of that request, the parties hereto
shall work in good faith to enter into a joint defense agreement to create
and preserve attorney-client privilege in a form and substance mutually
acceptable to the parties. 

   

 (c) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing Section 7.07(a), the Company and the Operating Partnership shall, prior to the earlier of the REIT Merger Effective Time or the Termination Date: 

    

 (i) use their reasonable commercial efforts to obtain the Loan Consents in the form reasonably acceptable to Parent; _provided_ that none of the Company or its Subsidiaries shall be required to spend or incur any expense associated therewith; and 

   

 (ii) use their reasonable commercial efforts to cause the Settlement Agreement to have been approved by the United States District Court for the 

   ##### 

  

   

 Eastern District of Pennsylvania, and make all payments and perform all other material obligations pursuant to that certain Settlement Agreement. 

  

 (d) The parties hereto agree to cooperate and assist one another in connection with all actions to be taken pursuant to Section 7.07(a) and (b), including the preparation and making of the filings referred to therein and, if requested, amending or furnishing additional information thereunder, including, subject to applicable Law, the Company Confidentiality Agreement and the Parent Confidentiality Agreement, providing copies of all related documents to the non-filing party and their advisors prior to filing, and, to the extent practicable, neither of the parties will file any such document or have any communication with any Governmental Authority without prior consultation with the other party. Each party shall keep the other apprised of the content and status of any communications with, and communications from, any Governmental Authority with respect to the Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions. To the extent practicable and permitted by a Governmental Authority, each party hereto shall permit representatives of the other party to participate in meetings and calls with such Governmental Authority. 

   

 (e) Parent acknowledges that the Company may seek certain Loan Consents and in connection therewith Parent agrees to provide, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide, all commercially reasonable cooperation in connection with obtaining any such Loan Consents as may reasonably be requested by the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parent Parties acknowledge and agree that, except as set forth on _Exhibit I_, the consummation of the Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions is not conditioned upon the Company obtaining any such Loan Consents. 

   

 (f) Each of the parties hereto agrees to cooperate and use its reasonable commercial efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any Action, including administrative or judicial Action, asserted by any party in order to avoid the entry of, or to have vacated, lifted, reversed, terminated or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that in whole or in part restricts, delays, prevents or prohibits consummation of the Mergers, including, without limitation, by vigorously pursuing all available avenues of administrative and judicial appeal. 

   

 Section 7.08 _Transfer Taxes_. The Parent Parties and the Company Parties shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and filing of all returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents (" _Transfer Tax Returns_ ") regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, documentary, value added, stock transfer, stamp, or other such taxes and any transfer, recording, conveyance registration and other fees and any similar fees and charges (together with any related interest, penalties or additions to Tax, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") that become payable in connection with the Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions, and shall reasonably cooperate in attempting to minimize the amount of Transfer Taxes. Subject to the local custom and practice of the jurisdiction in which Transfer Taxes are due, the Company Parties and, if applicable, the Parent Parties shall (a) prepare, or cause to be prepared, and shall timely file, or cause to be filed, all Transfer Tax Returns and (b) pay or cause to be paid (or make arrangements for payment of) Transfer Taxes, in accordance with local custom and practice, relating to (i) the Contemplated Transactions, including the Mergers, (ii) the properties sold, contributed to a joint venture or otherwise disposed of upon or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, (iii) the properties transferred in connection with the Interest Sale, (iv) transfers of the Disposition Assets upon or prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, and (v) the properties contributed to the 

   ##### 

  

 

Fidelity Joint Venture, regardless of whether the Transfer Tax arises from
the transfer of any such property or an ownership interest in the entity that
owns such property (directly or indirectly through one or more Persons). With
the exception of the Transfer Taxes set forth in the preceding sentence, from
and after the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall timely
(i) file, or cause to be filed, all Transfer Tax Returns and (ii) pay or
cause to be paid, without deduction or withholding from any consideration
or amounts payable to holders of the Company Common Shares, all Transfer
Taxes. 

   

 Section 7.09 _Public Announcements_. The parties hereto agree that no public release or announcement concerning the Mergers or the Contemplated Transactions shall be issued by a party without the prior written consent of the other parties (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed and may be provided by way of e-mail), except as such release or announcement may be required by Law or the rules or regulations of any securities exchange, in which case the party required to make the release or announcement shall use its reasonable commercial efforts to allow the other parties reasonable time to comment on such release or announcement in advance of such issuance. The parties have agreed upon the form of press releases announcing the Merger and the execution of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 7.10 _Financing_. 

  

 (a) Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Debt Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter and shall give the Company prompt notice of any material change with respect to such Debt Financing. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within two (2) Business Days, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (i) the Commitment Letter shall expire or be terminated for any reason, or (ii) any financing source that is a party to the Commitment Letter notifies Parent that such source no longer intends to provide financing to Parent on the terms set forth therein. Parent shall provide the Company promptly (and in any event within two (2) Business Days) with any amendments or alterations to the Commitment Letter. 

   

 (b) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letter or the Commitment Letter shall be terminated for any reason, Parent shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain alternative financing from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to consummate the Mergers and the Contemplated Transactions and pay any related costs and expenses, and, if obtained, will provide the Company with a copy of a new financing commitment. 

   

 (c) For the avoidance of doubt, Parent acknowledges and agrees that, notwithstanding anything set forth in this Agreement, the receipt of the Debt Financing or any other replacement financing is not a condition to the obligations of the Parent Parties to consummate the Mergers. 

   

 Section 7.11 _Tax Matters_. 

  

 (a) For federal and applicable state income tax purposes, each of the parties hereto shall report and treat the Merger as a taxable sale by the shareholders of the Company of all of the outstanding Company Common Shares to the Parent Operating Partnership in exchange for the aggregate REIT Merger Consideration to be received by shareholders of the Company. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (b) For federal and applicable state income tax purposes, each of the parties hereto shall report and treat the Partnership Merger as a taxable sale of interests in the Company Operating Partnership to the extent of interests exchanged for cash or Parent Common Shares, and a tax-deferred contribution pursuant to Code Section 721 to the extent of interests exchanged for interests in the Parent Operating Partnership. 

   

 (c) During the period from the date of this Agreement to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall: 

    

 (i) properly prepare and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed by them on or before the Closing Date (" _Post-Signing Returns_ ") in a manner consistent with past practice, except as otherwise required by applicable Laws; and 

   

 (ii) timely pay all Taxes due and payable in respect of such Post-Signing Returns that are so filed. 

  

 (d) Parent Operating Partnership shall, to the maximum extent permitted by law, cause the Company to designate any dividends paid by it on or prior to the Closing Date as capital gain dividends for purposes of Code Section 857(b)(3).

Prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, the Company agrees that its Board of Trustees (or its compensation committee) shall adopt resolutions specifically approving, for purposes of Rule 16b-3 under the Securities Act, the receipt, pursuant to this Agreement, of shares of Parent Common Shares by persons who will be directors or officers of Parent as of the REIT Merger Effective Time. 

  

 Section 7.14 _Resignations_. The Company shall cause the officers, trustees and directors of the Company, the Delaware Company, the Company Operating Partnership and each of the Student Housing Subsidiaries to deliver resignations from each such position effective as of the REIT Merger Effective Time. 

  

 Section 7.15 _Asset Sales_. 

  

 (a) _Mandatory Sale Efforts_. The Company and the Company Operating Partnership agree to use their commercially reasonable efforts to sell those Company Properties listed on _Exhibit G_ attached hereto (the " _Disposition Assets_ ") on the terms and conditions set forth on  _Exhibit G_ hereto. 

   

 (b) _Special Distribution_. Immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time, and subject to the sale of one or more of the Disposition Assets, if any, in accordance with  _Exhibit G_, the Company Board shall authorize, and the Company shall declare, a dividend payable to the holders of record of Company Common Shares on the close of business on the day preceding the Closing Date (and a corresponding distribution by the Company Operating Partnership to the holders of GP Units and LP Units) in accordance with _Exhibit G_. 

     ##### 

  

     

 Section 7.16 _Interest Sale_. 

  

 (a) The Company and the Company Operating Partnership shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions and to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Interest Sale on substantially the terms and conditions described in the Securities Purchase Agreement, including using commercially reasonable efforts to (i) satisfy on a timely basis all terms, covenants and conditions set forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement; (ii) enforce its rights under the Securities Purchase Agreement; and (iii) consummate the Interest Sale prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The Company shall keep Parent informed on a reasonably current basis and in reasonable detail with respect to all material activity concerning the status of the Interest Sale. The Company shall not amend or alter, or agree to amend or alter, or permit to be amended or altered, the Securities Purchase Agreement in any manner that (i) materially and adversely affects the rights and obligations of the Parent Parties hereunder (ii) subjects any of the Parent Parties to any post-closing liability relating to the Military Housing Subsidiaries to a greater extent than the Securities Purchase Agreement or (iii) would reasonably be likely to cause a delay of the Closing beyond the Drop Dead Date without the prior written consent of Parent. 

   

 Section 7.17 _Registration of Shares Underlying the Common Units_. Parent agrees to register the Parent Common Shares that may be issued pursuant to the redemption of Common Units issued to the holders of LP Units that elect to receive the Common Unit consideration on the Registration Statement. 

  

 Section 7.18 _Cooperation with Closing of Fidelity Contribution Agreement_ . The Company and the Company Operating Partnership each agrees to reasonably cooperate with Parent in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by the Fidelity Contribution Agreement immediately prior to the REIT Merger Effective Time; _provided_ , that the Company receives a written letter from the Parent Parties prior to the consummation of such transactions, in form and substance reasonable satisfactory to the Company, confirming that all of the conditions to the obligations of the Parent Parties to consummate the Mergers set forth in Section 8.02 have been irrevocably satisfied or waived. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent acknowledges that the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Fidelity Contribution Agreement is not a condition to the obligations of the Parent Parties to consummate the Mergers. 

  

 Section 7.19 _Affiliates_. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to identify those Persons who may be deemed to be "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 promulgated by the SEC under the Securities Act (the " _Company Affiliates_ ") and to cause each Company Affiliate to deliver to Parent as soon as practicable, and in any event prior to the date of the Company Shareholder Meeting, a written agreement substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit H_ to comply with the requirements of Rule 145 under the Securities Act in connection with the sale or other transfer of Parent Common Shares received in the REIT Merger.

 (e) No Governmental Authority in the United States shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any injunction, order, decree or ruling (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) which is then in effect and makes consummation of the Mergers illegal or prohibits consummation of the Mergers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the party claiming such failure of condition shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the entry of any such injunction or order, including taking such action as is required to comply with Section 7.07, and to appeal as promptly as possible any injunction or other order that may be entered. 

   

 (f) The Interest Sale shall have been consummated in accordance with the Securities Purchase Agreement (as amended, subject to compliance with Section 7.17(b)), _provided_ ,  _however_ , if the Securities Purchase Agreement has been terminated, this closing condition shall be deemed to be satisfied if the Company sells the Military Housing Subsidiaries to a substitute buyer reasonably satisfactory to Parent upon such terms and conditions (other than economic terms) substantially similar to those in the Securities Purchase Agreement (including specifically terms that provide for potential post-closing liability to the Company and the Company Operating Partnership that is no greater than that in the Securities Purchase Agreement).

    ##### 

  

    

amount did not constitute income described in Sections 856(c)(2)(A)-(H) or
856(c)(3)(A)-(I) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ "), as determined by the
Companys independent certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event the
Company receives either (A) a letter from the Companys counsel indicating
that the Company has received a ruling from the IRS described in Section
9.03(h) or (B) an opinion from the Companys outside counsel as described in
Section 9.03(h), an amount equal to the Company Expenses less the amount
payable under clause (1) above. To secure Parents obligation to pay
these amounts, Parent shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash equal to
the Company Expenses with an escrow agent selected by Parent and on such
terms (subject to Section 9.03(h)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the
Company Operating Partnership, Parent and the escrow agent. The payment

Partnership such amount pursuant to Section 9.03(c) by wire transfer or bank

Parent agrees to amend Section 9.03(g) and this Section 9.03(h) at the request of the Company in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Company Expenses that may be distributed to the Company Operating Partnership hereunder without causing the Company to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve the Companys chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 9.03(h) or (z) assist the Company in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 9.03(h).

    ##### 

  

    

receives either (A) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that Parent has
received a ruling from the IRS described in Section 9.03(j) or (B) an opinion
from Parents outside counsel as described in Section 9.03(j), an amount equal
to the Company Termination Fee or the Parent Expenses (as applicable) less
the amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure the Companys obligation
to pay these amounts, the Company shall deposit into escrow an amount in cash
equal to the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) with
an escrow agent selected by the Company and on such terms (subject to Section
9.03(j)) as shall be mutually agreed upon by the Parent Operating
Partnership, the Company and the escrow agent. The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable)
pursuant to Section 9.03(j) shall be made at the time the Company is obligated
to pay the Parent Operating Partnership such amount pursuant to Section
9.03(b) by wire transfer or bank check. 

   

 (j) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Company Termination Fee and/or Parent Expenses (as applicable) in escrow or any portion thereof shall not be released to the Parent Operating Partnership unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i) a letter from Parents independent certified public accountants indicating the maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to the Parent Operating Partnership without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying Income or a subsequent letter from Parents accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release such amount to Parent, or (ii) a letter from Parents counsel indicating that Parent received a ruling from the IRS holding that the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code (or alternatively, Parents outside counsel has rendered a legal opinion to the effect that the receipt by the Parent Operating Partnership of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) would constitute Qualifying Income, would be excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code or would not otherwise disqualify Parent as a REIT), in which case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) to the Parent Operating Partnership. The Company agrees to amend Section 9.03(i) and this Section 9.03(j) at the request of Parent in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) that may be distributed to the Parent Operating Partnership hereunder without causing Parent to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y) improve Parents chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this Section 9.03(j) or (z) assist Parent in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from its outside counsel as described in this Section 9.03(j). The escrow agreement shall also provide that any portion of the Company Termination Fee or Parent Expenses (as applicable) held in escrow for five years shall be released by the escrow agent to the Company.

Company or Parent, as applicable. The failure of any party to assert any of
its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of
those rights.
