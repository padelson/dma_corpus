5.4(p), 5.5(g), 5.5(i), 5.5(j) and 5.5(k) hereto, and is selling only such
interest or interests, if any, as it may own in YCMC or the CX Real Property
as the case may be.

 



 

5.8 _Exclusivity of Warranties and Specific Disclaimers_. Buyer acknowledges
that it is acquiring the Transferred Properties on the basis of its own
investigation of the physical condition of the Transferred Properties and YCMC
Properties and assumes the risk that adverse conditions outside the scope of
each Sellers representations and warranties set forth in Sections 5.1, 5.2,
5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 may not be revealed by Buyers own investigation. Buyer has
made its own estimate of prospective data such as future revenues, operating
costs, and liabilities based on Buyers own abilities and skills to operate

data. Buyer acknowledges that, EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED IN THE TRANSACTION
DOCUMENTS, (i) THE TRANSFERRED PROPERTIES AND YCMC PROPERTIES ARE SOLD "AS IS"

 **ARTICLE 6**

 

 ** **

 

 **ADDITIONAL COVENANTS**

 



 

6.1 _Announcements_. Except for disclosures that Sellers or Buyer reasonably
believe are required by Law or any securities exchange to which Sellers or
Buyer may be subject, no Party shall issue any press release or otherwise make
any public announcement with respect to the Transactions without the prior
written consent of the other Parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

 



 

6.2 _Transfer Requirements._

 



 

(a) _Transfer of CX Lease Agreements and Applicable Contracts_. Neither this
Agreement nor any Assignment and Assumption Agreement included in the
Ancillary Agreements shall constitute an assignment or an attempted assignment
of any Applicable Contract to the extent that such assignment or attempted
assignment would constitute a breach of

 



      
 

 



 

such Applicable Contract. To the extent any of the Applicable Contracts are
not transferred and assigned on the date hereof due to delays in procuring
required notices, consents or actions from or by any Government Authority or
third party, then such Applicable Contract shall not be assigned and
transferred until and unless the proper notice, consent or action requirement
shall have been satisfied. The Parties shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts, each as to matters within its control, to satisfy such requirements
as soon as reasonably practicable and agree to cooperate with each other in
any reasonable arrangement designed to provide Buyer with the benefits of such
Applicable Contracts.

 



 

(b) _Costs of Transfer_. Each of Buyer and the Entity Sellers or the CX Ranch
Sellers, as appropriate, shall bear its own costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the transfer, amendment, reissuance or issuance of the
Applicable Contracts. Buyer, at its sole expense, shall provide bonds, letters
of credit, guarantees or other security or support as may be required by Law
or any Government Authorities for the transfer or reissuance of any Permits or
Applicable Contracts to Buyer.

 



 

6.3 _Transfer of Permits and Security._

 



 

(a) _Permits and Transition Permits._ Each of Buyer and Sellers shall, with
the reasonable assistance of the other, as required, coordinate with each
applicable Government Authority to pre-approve, prior to closing, the transfer
to Buyer (and documentation associated with such transfer) of each Permit
applicable to YCMC and the CX Ranch Assets, or to have such Permit approved
for re-issuance. If for any reason any Permit applicable to YCMC or the CX
Ranch Assets has not been transferred to Buyer or reissued, as applicable, as
of the date hereof, then the Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall, to
the extent allowed by applicable Law, maintain each such Permit (each a
"Transition Permit") in full force and effect until the earlier of the
transfer or the reissuance of such Permit and shall, if requested by Buyer,
allow Buyer to use and operate under each such Transition Permit during such
period. The Sellers or their respective Affiliates shall maintain any related
bond, letter of credit, guarantee or other security or support required by Law
or any Government Authority for each such Transition Permit (the "Transition
Bonds") until the transfer or reissuance of such Transition Permit. Buyer
agrees to reimburse the Sellers for bond premiums, fee payments and other
direct costs incurred by Sellers or their Affiliates in connection with the
maintenance of the Transition Permits and the Transition Bonds from the date
hereof up to the date that the transfer or reissuance of the Transition Permit
occurs and the Transition Bond related thereto is released. Each of Buyer and
Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the transfer or
reissuance of all the Transition Permits to occur prior to December 31, 2012
and Sellers and their Affiliates shall continue to cooperate with Buyer and
each use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Transition Permits
to be transferred to or reissued. Buyer shall furnish any bonds or other
security required in connection with the transfer or reissuance of all such
Transition Permits, as promptly as requested by Sellers and, if sooner, when
required pursuant to applicable Law. If, after the date hereof, a consent or
other requirement to the transfer or reissuance of any Transition Permit is
required, then Sellers and their Affiliates shall continue to cooperate with
Buyer and each use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to cause
the Transition Permits to be transferred to or reissued for no additional
consideration payable to Sellers.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Transition Permit Violations. _If Sellers or their respective Affiliates
receive a notice of violation under any Transition Permit following the date
hereof but before the transfer or reissuance of such Transition Permit, which
is based on or arises out of the activities or operations of Buyer after the
date hereof, the applicable Seller will promptly notify Buyer, and Buyer shall
be responsible for curing such violation and any obligation or liability
associated therewith and shall indemnify Sellers and their Affiliates as
provided in Section 8.2. If the Sellers determine, in their reasonable
discretion, that Buyer will not cause such violation to be cured in the time
period required by applicable Law, then Sellers shall have the right to cure
such violation at Buyers expense after first providing Buyer with written
notice of the Sellers intent to cure and a reasonable opportunity to either
cure the violation or contest the violation.

 



 

6.4 _Government Authority Reviews and Approvals._

 



 

(a) _Government Reviews and Approvals_. If any Government Authority demands a
filing or other information, each Seller, Buyer and their respective
Affiliates shall cooperate and promptly undertake all filings and other
actions as may be required to comply with any review or approval requirements.
Should the reviewing agency advise any Party of its need for additional
information, that Party, with the cooperation of the other Parties if
appropriate, shall promptly respond to the reviewing agencys request. Should
the reviewing agency or another interested Government Authority advise any
party of its opposition to the Transactions, the Parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to persuade the agency concerned to abandon
its opposition and, failing to do so, the Parties shall take such additional
actions as agreed between the Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in any Transaction Document, nothing in this Agreement
shall require Buyer to take any action not otherwise required by this Section
6.4, including but not limited to (i) disposing or transferring any asset,
(ii) holding separate any assets or operations, or (iii) changing or modifying
any course of conduct or otherwise making any commitment (to any Government
Authority or otherwise) regarding the future operations of the Buyers
business or the Transferred Properties to obtain any approval from any
Government Authority, to prevent the initiation of any lawsuit by any
Government Authority, or to prevent the entry of any decree, judgment,
injunction preliminary or permanent, or any other order that would make the
Transactions unlawful. Furthermore, Buyer shall not be obligated to defend,
contest, or resist any action or proceeding (beyond the investigation
cooperation obligations in this Section 6.4) instituted (or threatened to be
instituted) challenging the Transactions as violative of any Law.

 



 

(b) _Ownership Change Filings_. Each of Buyer and Sellers shall promptly and
diligently make all necessary filings and satisfy all necessary requirements
with appropriate Government Authorities in order to transfer ownership of the
Transferred Properties from the Entity Sellers and/or the CX Ranch Sellers to
Buyer.

 



 

6.5 _Termination of Rights to Sellers  Insurance._

 



 

(a) Each of the Parties acknowledges that each Seller and its respective
Affiliates have maintained worldwide programs of property and liability
insurance coverage for themselves and their Affiliates, including with respect
to the Transferred Properties and the YCMC Properties, and insurance policies
that are written or reinsured by Affiliates or that require the payment of
retrospective premium adjustments to cover losses. All of the insurance
policies

 



      
 

 



 

through which such worldwide programs of coverage are presently or have
previously been provided (including all employers liability insurance
policies) are hereafter called "Seller Policies."

 



 

(b) It is the understanding and intention of Sellers and Buyer that:

 



 

(i) from and after the date hereof, no insurance coverage shall be provided
for Buyer or YCMC under any Seller Policy relating to the Transferred
Properties or YCMC Properties; and

 



 

(ii) from and after the date hereof, no claims regarding any matter
whatsoever, whether or not arising from events occurring prior to, at or after
the date hereof, shall be made against or with respect to any Seller Policy by
Buyer.

 



 

(c) Buyer, on behalf of itself and its successors and assigns, hereby
releases, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, each Seller and its
respective Affiliates from liability relating to any claim made by or through
Buyer after the date hereof against or with respect to any Seller Policy.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in the foregoing provision of this Section 6.5 shall in
any way limit, impair or constitute a release or discharge of any right of
Buyer or obligation of Sellers or their Affiliates with respect to any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement, indemnity or other obligation
contained in any Transaction Document (regardless of whether the same was, is
or may be covered by any insurance policy described herein), all of which
rights and obligations shall continue in full force and effect.

 



 

6.6 _Removal of Proprietary Information_. Except as provided in any third
party license included in the Transferred Properties, Sellers may remove all
proprietary information in tangible or intangible form that is (i) owned by a
third party (or is not in use or has not been in use within one (1) year prior
to the date hereof) concerning the Transferred Properties, (ii) proprietary to
Sellers or their respective Affiliates, or (iii) otherwise excluded from the
Transferred Properties pursuant to Section 2.2.

 



 

6.7 _Replacement of Seller Identification_. Buyer shall, at its own expense
and in a timely manner not exceeding thirty (30) calendar days after the date
hereof, remove or cause to be removed all signs and placards which identify
Sellers, or any affiliate of Sellers, as a prior owner of any of the YCMC
Properties or Transferred Properties, including any usage of trademarks or
trade names of Sellers and their respective Affiliates. Buyer shall, at its
own expense and in a timely manner not to exceed one week after the date
hereof, erect or install signs and placards as may be required by state or
other governmental agencies identifying Buyer as the owner and/or operator of
each of the Transferred Properties and YCMC Properties. Buyer shall,
immediately following the Closing and effective not later than one day
following the Closing Date, change the names of the YCMC Equity Owners to
names that do not use the trade names of Sellers and their respective
Affiliates.

 



 

6.8 _Return of Confidential Information_. Each Entity Seller represents and
certifies that it will take commercially reasonable actions to cause each
recipient of confidential information in connection with the Transactions
pursuant to each non-disclosure agreement entered into with

 



      
 

 



 

such recipients and the Confidential Information Memorandum and the
Confidential Information Memorandum Supplement to return or confirm
destruction of all confidential information received by such recipients ****
to the extent required by the terms of such non-disclosure agreements **,**
including taking commercially reasonable steps to enforce its rights under
such agreements, if reasonably requested by Buyer and at Buyers expense.

 



 

6.9 _Seller Records_. Within 30 days of Closing, Entity Sellers shall deliver
to Buyer copies of all Seller Records.

 



 

6.10 _Transition of Sales Relationship_. Within twenty (20) business days
after Closing, each of Chevron NPRB Lead and CONSOL NPRB Lead will:

 



 

(a) Provide to Buyer a list of potential customer contacts established by such
Seller or its Affiliates (domestic and export, all understood to be
"potential" customers given that no commercial sales agreements were signed)
and all draft agreements and analyses related to such potential customers,
except as noted below;

 



 

(b) Provide to Buyer a list of all material transportation and terminal
contacts made by such Seller or its Affiliates and related draft agreements
and analyses; and

 



 

(c) Meet with Buyers sales group for a question and answer session on the
documents provided above and sales and marketing efforts for YCMC in general.

 



 

Buyer understands that there are potential issues with one Japanese customer,
relative to its larger relationship with Chevron Corporation. Sellers may
exclude draft agreements, analyses and proposals with respect to this
potential customer from the obligations above, provided that Chevron NPRB Lead
identifies the potential customer.

 



 

At Buyers option, Chevron NPRB Lead will make Dave Lofe available for one
trip to Japan to meet with the listed potential customers in order to
facilitate transference of the relationship with YCMC; the scheduling of such
trip to be mutually determined and to occur no later than ninety (90) days
after the Closing. Buyer would arrange and pay for travel and accommodations,
and there would be no recourse of Buyer against Sellers or their employees as
a result of the trip or any statements made during such trip.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7**

 **TAXES**

 



 

7.1 _Transfer Taxes_. Notwithstanding Section 7.2(a), any recording fees,
transfer Taxes (including but not limited to any sales Tax), use Tax, real
property transfer Tax, asset transfer Tax, documentary stamp Tax or similar
other charges imposed on the conveyance of the Transferred Properties pursuant
to this Agreement by any Government Authority (collectively, "Transfer Taxes")
shall be promptly paid by Buyer in accordance with the Law or Government
Authority levying such Tax (or reimbursed to the Entity Sellers or the CX
Ranch Sellers, as appropriate, by Buyer within five (5) Business Days after
demand therefor); provided, however,

 



      
 

 



 

that if Buyer holds a direct payment permit which is valid on the date hereof,
Buyer shall assume all responsibility for remitting to the appropriate taxing
authority the sales and use Taxes due for such permit and shall provide the
Entity Sellers and the CX Ranch Sellers with any exemption certificates or
other documentation required under applicable Law in lieu of paying such
Sellers the Taxes due. Buyer shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Entity Sellers and the CX Ranch Sellers against any Transfer Taxes assessed
against or otherwise incurred by such Sellers as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the amounts of any penalties,
interest, attorneys fees and any other Losses related thereto.

 



 

7.2 _Tax Apportionment_.

 



 

(a) All property or ad valorem Taxes for the current year, including but not
limited to Taxes on real estate, fixtures, personal property and inventory,
shall be prorated between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Entity Sellers and
the CX Ranch Sellers, on the other hand, as provided herein. The Entity
Sellers, severally in proportion to their ownership of membership interests in
YCMC on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date (and not jointly), shall
be responsible for all such Taxes payable by YCMC for all taxable periods
ending prior to the Closing Date, and the CX Ranch Sellers, severally in
proportion to their economic interests in the relevant CX Ranch Asset
transferred by such CX Ranch Seller (and not jointly) and CONSOL NPRB Lead (as
to the CX Ranch Seller that is an Affiliate of CONSOL NPRB Lead) and Chevron
NPRB Lead, shall be responsible for all such Taxes payable with respect to the
CX Ranch Assets for all taxable periods ending prior to the Closing Date.
Buyer shall be responsible for the payment of all such Taxes payable for all
taxable periods beginning on or subsequent to the Closing Date. As to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date and ending on or after the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), all such Taxes shall be prorated by
allocating to the period before the Closing Date the amount of such Taxes for
the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is
the number of calendar days in the taxable period ending on the day
immediately prior to the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of calendar days in the entire taxable period. The Entity Sellers,
severally in proportion to their ownership of membership interests in YCMC on
the day immediately prior to the Closing Date of (and not jointly), shall be
responsible for any such Taxes of YCMC allocated to the portion of the taxable
period ending on the day immediately before the Closing Date. The CX Ranch
Sellers, severally in proportion to their economic interests in the relevant
CX Ranch Asset transferred by such CX Ranch Seller (and not jointly) and
CONSOL NPRB Lead (as to the CX Ranch Seller that is an Affiliate of CONSOL
NPRB Lead) and Chevron NPRB Lead, shall be responsible for any such Taxes
payable with respect to the CX Ranch Assets allocated to the portion of the
taxable period ending on the day immediate before the Closing Date, and Buyer
shall be responsible for any other such Taxes. If Taxes are prorated and based
on an estimate of the current period Taxes, there shall be a final settlement
between Buyer and the relevant Sellers based on the actual Taxes due for the
taxable period. Any refunds or rebates that may be received with respect to
the Taxes referenced in this Section 7.2(a) shall be prorated between Buyer
and the relevant Sellers in the same manner as described above to prorate
Taxes, and the relevant Sellers shall be entitled to all refunds and rebates
for taxable periods (and portions thereof) ending prior to the Closing Date
and the Buyer entitled to all refunds and rebates for taxable periods (and
portions thereof) beginning on and after the Closing Date that may be
received. Any refunds or rebates will be paid to the applicable Party within
thirty (30) days of receiving the refund or rebate.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Severance Tax (and ad valorem Tax based on such severance taxable value),
if any, shall be treated as attributable to the period ending on the Closing
Date to the extent that the coal which constitutes the base upon which such
Tax was levied was severed on or before the Closing Date, sold on or before
the Closing Date and the revenue from such sale was accrued or received on or
before the Closing Date. The Entity Sellers, severally in proportion to their
ownership of membership interests in YCMC on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (and not jointly), shall be responsible for all such Taxes
payable with respect to YCMC attributable to the period ending on the Closing
Date, and the CX Ranch Sellers, severally in proportion to their economic
interests in the relevant CX Ranch Asset transferred by such CX Ranch Seller
(and not jointly) and CONSOL NPRB Lead (as to the CX Ranch Seller that is an
Affiliate of CONSOL NPRB Lead) and Chevron NPRB Lead, shall be responsible for
all such Taxes payable with respect to the CX Ranch Assets attributable to the
period ending on the Closing Date.

 



 

(c) In the event that any Party receives a notice of any audit or
administrative or judicial or other proceeding involving Taxes, which, if
determined adversely, could result in a liability of the other Party or
Parties under this Agreement (the Party or Parties receiving such notice of
liability will hereafter be referred to as the "liable Party or Parties") the
liable Party or Parties will immediately notify the other Party or Parties
(the "responsible Party or Parties") in writing of such audit or
administrative or judicial or other proceeding. In the case of an audit or
administrative or judicial or other proceeding that relates to any taxable
period that is not a Straddle Period, the responsible Party or Parties after
receiving notice shall have the option of either:

 



 

(i) Paying the Tax directly, including payment under protest to preserve the
right to contest the liability, or

 



 

(ii) Challenging the proceeding referred to in such notice. The responsible
Party or Parties shall take all action necessary and shall have the right
(solely or jointly, as the case may be) to control any audits, disputes,
administrative, judicial, or other proceedings and incidents to such challenge
and to employ counsel of its respective choice therein. If the responsible
Party or Parties elect to challenge the validity of such bill, invoice, notice
of deficiency or similar communication or any portion thereof, the liable
Party or Parties shall extend reasonable cooperation to the responsible Party
or Parties in such efforts at no expense to the responsible Party or Parties.

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the liable Party or Parties may (solely or
jointly, as the case may be) elect to pay such notice of liability; however,
the responsible Party or Parties will not have to reimburse such payment
unless the responsible Party or Parties have consented to that payment and
reimbursement and the responsible Partys or Parties right to contest such
liability is preserved. If a notice of liability may affect the liability or
obligations of both a liable Party and another Party, the liable Party or
Parties shall keep the other Party or Parties reasonably informed of the
progress of any challenge of the liability asserted in such notice and the
other Partys or Parties consent shall be required prior to the settlement of
any such notice, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed.

 



      
 

 



 

If the notice of an audit, or administrative, judicial or other proceeding
relating to Taxes relates to a Straddle Period the liable Party or Parties and
responsible Party or Parties shall be entitled to jointly challenge the
proceeding referenced in the notice. The liable Party or Parties and
responsible Party or Parties shall control any audits, disputes,
administrative, judicial or other proceedings and incidents to such challenge
and to employ counsel of their choice. The Parties shall not consent to the
settlement of such proceeding without each liable and responsible Partys
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned, or delayed.

 



 

7.3 _Refunds_. Other than Taxes covered in Section 7.2(a), the Entity Sellers
shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes (associated with operations related
to the assets and entities subject to this Agreement) paid by YCMC or the
Entity Sellers (in proportion to their membership interests in YCMC) and each
CX Ranch Seller shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes paid by such CX Ranch
Seller, in each case to any Government Authority for taxable periods (or
portions thereof) ending prior to the Closing Date. Buyer shall be entitled to
any refund of taxes paid by Buyer or YCMC to any Government Authority for
taxable periods (or portions thereof) beginning on or after the Closing Date.
The Party receiving a refund shall make a good faith effort to ascertain the
source of the refund and to resolve by mutual consent the ownership of any
refunds related to the subject properties.

 



 

7.4 _Cooperation_. Subject to the reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, the Parties will provide to each other such records and assistance
as may be reasonably requested by any of them in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, and audit or other examination by any
Government Authority, and any judicial and administrative proceedings related
to the liability for Taxes (including any additions to or refund of taxes)
involving the Transferred Properties or the assets, activities, transactions
or payments of YCMC. The Parties shall also make employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Sellers and Buyer shall retain all books and
records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to Transferred Properties (or
any assets, activities, transactions or payments of YCMC) relating to any
taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until expiration of the
statute of limitations (and any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable
periods, and to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
Government Authority.

 



 

7.5 _Tax Returns_.

 



 

(a) Sellers shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns for YCMC and
the Transferred Properties (or any assets, activities, transactions or
payments of YCMC) including, as to YCMC, final IRS Form 1065 for the taxable
period ending on the Closing Date and applicable state tax forms, __ for all
taxable periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are filed after
the Closing Date (all such Tax Returns, other than only YCMCs final IRS Form
1065 and YCMCs final state partnership income tax return, the "Straddle
Returns"). The Straddle Returns shall be prepared consistently with the past
practice of YCMC and the Sellers, unless otherwise required by Law. Sellers
shall permit Buyer to review and comment on each Straddle Return prior to
filing and shall consider applying all reasonable comments of Buyer, at
Sellers discretion, related to such Straddle Return. To the extent any
Straddle Return is a separate entity Tax Return, Buyer or YCMC shall file such
Straddle Return and shall pay the Tax shown thereon promptly at the direction
of Sellers; provided that such payment obligation shall

 



      
 

 



 

not affect the apportionment set forth in Section 7.2. The cost of preparing
the Straddle Returns shall be borne by Sellers. Sellers shall reimburse Buyer
for Taxes apportioned to Sellers hereunder, whether shown as owed on the
original Straddle Return, amended Straddle Return, or as a result of an audit,
with respect to such periods within ten (10) days of payment by Buyer or YCMC
of such Taxes.

 



 

(b) Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed
all Tax Returns with respect to YCMC and the Transferred Properties, other
than the Tax Returns which Sellers shall prepare, or cause to be prepared,
pursuant to Section 7.5(a), which are due after the Closing Date. If any such
Tax Return relates to any period beginning before the Closing Date and is a
Tax Return where the Sellers may have responsibility hereunder for the Taxes
reported thereon, Buyer shall permit Sellers to review and comment on the
proposed Tax Return no later than thirty (30) days prior to the filing date of
such Tax Return (including extensions thereof) and shall consider applying all
reasonable comments of Sellers, at Buyers discretion, related to such Tax
Returns. Tax Returns described in the preceding sentence shall be prepared
consistently with the past practice of YCMC and the Sellers, as applicable,
unless otherwise required by Law.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not, nor shall it permit any Affiliate of Buyer to, amend,
refile, make or otherwise modify, or cause or permit YCMC to amend, refile,
make or otherwise modify, any Tax election or Tax Return of YCMC or with
respect to any Transferred Properties for any taxable period ending prior to
the Closing Date or any Straddle Period without the prior written consent of
the Entity Sellers (with respect to YCMC and its assets) and relevant CX Ranch
Seller (with respect to CX Ranch Assets), which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld conditioned or delayed. Sellers shall not, nor shall it
permit any Affiliate of a Seller to, amend, refile, make or otherwise modify,
or cause or permit YCMC to amend, refile, make or otherwise modify, any Tax
election or Tax Return of YCMC or with respect to any Transferred Properties
for any taxable period ending prior to the Closing Date or for any Straddle
Period where such amendment, refilling, modification or otherwise could
potentially have an adverse affect on Buyer, in each case without the prior
written consent of Buyer, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided that this sentence shall not apply to YCMCs
final IRS Form 1065 and YCMCs final state partnership income tax return.

their respective directors, officers, partners, managers, members, investors,
employees, agents and representatives) against any Losses attributable to (i)
a breach of, or default in, the performance by CONSOL NPRB Lead or any CONSOL
NPRB Lead Affiliate that is a CX Ranch Seller under any Transaction Document
of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by such Affiliates
pursuant to the Transaction Documents or (ii) any actual fraud or willful

 



      
 

 



 

misconduct by CONSOL NPRB Lead or any CONSOL NPRB Lead Affiliate that is a CX
Ranch Seller or any of their respective managers, members, directors or
officers in connection with the Transaction Documents or the Transactions.

 



 

8.2 _Losses Indemnified and Assumed by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) _Breaches of Representations and Warranties_. Buyer shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless Chevron NPRB Lead, CONSOL NPRB Lead and each CX Ranch
Seller and their respective Affiliates (including their respective directors,
officers, partners, managers, members, investors, employees, agents and
representatives) against any Losses attributable to a breach of Buyers
representations and warranties under any Transaction Document provided that
(i) the liability of Buyer for Losses for any claim made pursuant to this
Section 8.2(a) must exceed, in the aggregate, a deductible of one and one-half
percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price after which Buyer shall be responsible
for all such Losses from the first dollar (and not simply the amount in excess
of such deductible) and (ii) the cumulative liability for Buyer for all Losses
for all claims made pursuant to this Section 8.2(a) shall not exceed Sixty
Million Dollars ($60,000,000).

 



 

(b) _Breaches of Covenants and Obligations_. __ Buyer shall indemnify, defend
and hold harmless Chevron NPRB Lead, CONSOL NPRB Lead, each CX Ranch Seller
and their respective Affiliates (including their respective directors,
officers, partners, managers, members, investors, employees, agents and
representatives), from and after the date hereof, against any Losses
attributable to a breach of, or default in, the performance by Buyer of any
covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by Buyer pursuant to any
Transaction Document.

 



 

(c) _Assumption of Liabilities and Obligations_. _ _In addition to the
foregoing indemnity, Buyer hereby contractually assumes all Losses,
liabilities and obligations relating to the Transferred Properties not
specifically retained by the Entity Sellers and the CX Ranch Sellers,
including Reclamation liabilities and obligations pursuant to the terms of the
agreements contained in the conveyancing instruments included in _Exhibit A_
and _Exhibit B_ attached to this Agreement or pursuant to the instruments
required by the applicable Government Authorities for release and substitution
of Seller security assurances as described in Section 6.3. However, __ Buyer
does not assume any Losses, liabilities or obligations, and Sellers shall
remain liable with respect to (i) any Losses arising out of a breach by any
Seller or its Affiliates of the terms or conditions of any Transaction
Document or (ii) any Losses related to Excluded Items.

 



 

8.3 _Indemnification, Defense and Communication Procedures_. Upon any
Indemnitee becoming aware of anything which is or may give rise to a claim for
indemnification or grounds for making a claim under this Article 8 or of any
other claim, action or demand or matter likely to give rise to a claim for
indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnitee shall:

 



 

(a) notify the Indemnitor by written notice as soon as reasonably practicable
after it appears to the Indemnitee that any assessment or claim, action or
demand of a third party received by or coming to the notice of the Indemnitee
may result in a claim under this Article 8 or elsewhere in this Agreement,
specifying all material details as are then available to the Indemnitee
(provided, however, that an Indemnitees failure to notify does not release,
reduce or otherwise affect the Indemnitors duty to indemnify, except to the
extent of any actual prejudice suffered by the Indemnitor as a result of such
failure to notify);

 



      
 

 



 

(b) take such action and give such information and access to personnel,
premises, property, documents and records to the Indemnitor and its
professional advisers as the Indemnitor may reasonably request and the
Indemnitor shall be entitled to require the Indemnitee to take such action and
give such information and assistance in order to avoid, dispute, resist,
mitigate, settle, compromise, defend or appeal any claim in respect thereof or
adjudication with respect thereto, subject to the Indemnitor indemnifying the
Indemnitee against all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Indemnitee in complying with any such request or requirement;

 



 

(c) at the request of the Indemnitor and other than with respect to any action
seeking specific performance or other equitable remedies, allow the Indemnitor
to assume the defense of such actions, make any decision to arbitrate or
settle any such action, and otherwise undertake the sole conduct of such
actions as the Indemnitor may deem appropriate in connection with any such
assessment or claim in the name of the Indemnitee, and in that connection the
Indemnitee shall give or cause to be given to the Indemnitor all such
assistance as the Indemnitor may reasonably require in avoiding, disputing,
resisting, settling, compromising, defending or appealing any such claim and
shall instruct such attorneys or other professional advisors as the Indemnitor
may nominate to act on behalf of the Indemnitee, as appropriate, but to act in
accordance with the Indemnitors sole instructions, subject to the
Indemnitors indemnifying the Indemnitee against all costs and expenses
incurred by the Indemnitee in complying with any such requirement; and

 



 

(d) make no admission of liability, agreement, settlement or compromise with
any third party in relation to any such claim or adjudication without the
prior written consent of the Indemnitor (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 



 

In the event that a claim is within the scope of the indemnities of two or
more Indemnitors, each Indemnitor shall be responsible for the indemnity and
defense and shall bear the costs of indemnity and defense to the extent of and
in proportion to the coverage of its indemnity.

 



 

8.4 _No Liability if Loss is Otherwise Compensated For._

 



 

(a) No Indemnitee shall be entitled to recover damages or otherwise obtain
reimbursement or restitution more than once in respect of the same loss or
damage.

 



 

(b) No Indemnitor shall be liable for any claim to the extent the Indemnitee
has a claim, right of indemnification or right of set off against any third
party (other than in connection with an insurance claim pursuant to clause (d)
below and net of any expenses in obtaining such third party payment), unless
the Indemnitee assigns such claim, right of indemnification or right of set
off against such third party to the Indemnitor.

 



 

(c) Any payment made by an Indemnitor to an Indemnitee pursuant to this
Article in respect of any claim will be reduced by an amount equal to any
reduction in Taxes realized by the Indemnitee that are attributable to such
claim, taking into account any offsetting increases in Taxes associated
therewith.

 



 

(d) If any matters giving rise to a claim of indemnification by an Indemnitee
may be covered by any insurance policy or policies carried by (i) an
Indemnitee (other than a self-

 



      
 

 



 

administered claims program or policies issued or indemnified by an Indemnitee
or its Affiliates) or (ii) a party other than the Indemnitees (e.g., a policy
carried by a contractor of an Indemnitee that names an Indemnitee as an
additional insured), then such Indemnitee shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to pursue the claim and obtain compensation from its insurer or
insurers under such insurance policy or policies. If and when such
compensation is actually received from such insurers for the matters giving
rise to a claim of indemnification, such Indemnitee shall reduce such claim of
indemnification against the Indemnitor to the extent of Indemnitees insurance
recovery (minus expenses incurred in pursuing the claim with its insurer) or,
if payment has already been made on such claim of indemnification, then such
Indemnitee shall remit the insurance recovery (minus expenses incurred in
pursuing the claim with its insurer), to the Indemnitor.

 



 

8.5 _Survival_. The representations and warranties of Chevron NPRB Lead and
its Affiliates and of CONSOL NPRB Lead and its Affiliates in Sections 5.1,
5.2, 5.3, 5.4 and 5.5 and the representations and warranties of Buyer in
Section 5.6 shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions, but shall expire eighteen (18) months after the date
hereof, except to the extent that a notice of claim under Article 5, filed in
accordance with Section 8.3, shall have been given to the Party obligated
thereunder within such eighteen-month period. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the representations and warranties of Chevron NPRB Lead and its Affiliates and
of CONSOL NPRB Lead and its Affiliates in Sections 5.1(d), 5.2(d), 5.3(a),
5.3(b), 5.3(d), 5.3(h), 5.3(l), 5.3(q), 5.3(v), 5.4(a), 5.4(b), 5.4(d),
5.4(h), 5.4(l), 5.4(q), 5.4(v), 5.5(a), 5.5(e), 5.5(g), 5.5(i), 5.5(l) and
5.5(o) shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of
the Transactions, but shall expire on the seventh (7th) anniversary of the
date hereof.

 



 

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy; Exclusive Recourse_. Except for such equitable remedies
as may be available to enforce any of the provisions of this Agreement and
other than as set forth in Section 8.7 hereof, the indemnifications under this
Article or elsewhere in this Agreement are the Parties sole and exclusive
remedies, each against the other, with respect to matters arising solely under
this Agreement. The Parties hereby waive and release any other rights,
remedies, causes of action or claims arising under this Agreement. Buyer
agrees that except in cases of fraud or willful misconduct its sole and
exclusive recourse for indemnification claims with respect to Chevron NPRB
Lead or its Affiliates shall be against Chevron NPRB Lead and its sole and
exclusive recourse for indemnification claims with respect to CONSOL NPRB Lead
or its Affiliates shall be against CONSOL NPRB Lead, and hereby agrees to
bring any and all claims and disputes hereunder exclusively against Chevron
NPRB Lead or CONSOL NPRB Lead as applicable.

 



 

8.7 _Specific Performance_. __ Each Party acknowledges and agrees that the
other Parties may be damaged irreparably if any Transaction Document is not
performed in accordance with its terms or otherwise is breached and that a
Party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief to prevent breaches hereof
and thereof and to enforce specifically the Transaction Documents and its
terms in addition to any other remedy to which such Party may be entitled
hereunder and thereunder.

9.7 _Assignment_. No Party may assign any right granted to it under this
Agreement or delegate performance of any duty to be performed by it hereunder
without the express written consent of the other Parties, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, provided that the Buyer shall be
entitled to (i) assign and pledge its rights and interests under any
Transaction Document to any financing party under any existing credit facility
of the Buyer or its Affiliates or (ii) assign its rights and interests under
any Transaction Document to any Affiliate of the Buyer, provided further that
Buyer shall remain obligated to perform any of its duties under this Agreement
notwithstanding any such assignment. Subject to the foregoing, all rights and
duties of each Party hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding
upon its successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

9.8 _Governing Law and Dispute Resolution_. The interpretation and enforcement
of this Agreement, and any arbitration and arbitral decision pursuant to
clause (b) below, shall be governed by the substantive law of the State of New
York, without the application of its conflict of law rules; provided, however,
questions concerning arbitrability under the dispute resolution provision
hereof shall be governed exclusively by the United States Arbitration Act (9
U.S.C. § 1-16) and questions concerning real property or title to real
property shall be governed exclusively by the laws of the state in which such
real property is located.

 



 

(a) The Parties desire to avoid all forms of traditional litigation and
therefore agree, except as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement,
that all disputes, controversies or claims arising out of or relating to this
Agreement (collectively "Disputes") shall be resolved in accordance with the
following procedures:

 



 

(i) The Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve Disputes
through direct discussions. Each of Chevron NPRB Lead, CONSOL NPRB Lead and

 



      
 

 



 

Buyer commits its management to respond promptly to any communications
concerning Disputes.

 



 

(ii) If the Parties are unable to resolve any Dispute, than the party
asserting the existence of a dispute shall provide to the other Parties, a
description of the factual or legal basis for the Dispute through a formal
written notice.

 



 

(iii) Within fifteen (15) days of written notice that there is a Dispute,
representatives of the Parties with authority to settle the matter shall meet
at a mutually acceptable time and place in Denver, Colorado or such other
location as may be agreed, and as often thereafter as they deem reasonably
necessary in an effort to reach an amicable resolution. If a representative
intends to be accompanied at a meeting by an attorney, the other negotiator
shall be given at least three (3) Business Days notice of such intention and
may also be accompanied by an attorney.

 



 

(iv) If no amicable resolution or settlement is reached within sixty (60) days
as a result of the procedures in Sections 9.8(a)(i) \- (iii) above, the
Dispute shall be finally resolved through binding arbitration which shall be
conducted expeditiously. Chevron NPRB Lead, CONSOL NPRB Lead and Buyer and the
arbitration panel shall endeavor to complete the arbitration process within
one hundred twenty (120) days of the first status conference before the
arbitrators. Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, arbitration shall be
conducted in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association (the "Rules").

 



 

(A) The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three (3) arbitrators.
Each side (in the case of a dispute with Buyer, then Chevron NPRB Lead, CONSOL
NPRB Lead and Chevron NPRB Leads and CONSOL NPRB Leads Affiliates shall
collectively constitute one side) shall be permitted to nominate one
arbitrator and the two Party-nominated arbitrators shall confer and attempt to
agree on a suitable third arbitrator who will serve as chair for the
arbitration panel within five (5) Business Days or such other time as the
Parties may agree. If the two Party-nominated arbitrators are unable to agree
on a third arbitrator, or if any Party fails to nominate an arbitrator as
herein provided, the arbitrators shall be appointed in accordance with the
Rules. In any event, all arbitrators appointed hereunder shall have expertise
relevant to the matter under dispute.

 



 

(B) Unless the Parties agree otherwise, the place of arbitration shall be
Denver, Colorado. The arbitrators shall not be empowered to award any form of
punitive, incidental or consequential damages that are waived under this
Agreement. As part of any arbitral award pursuant to this paragraph, the
arbitrators shall render a reasoned award. The Parties consent to judgment on
such award being entered in any court having jurisdiction.

 



 

(C) Pending final resolution of the Dispute and award as described in Section
9.8(c) below each Party shall bear the costs of preparing its own claims

 



      
 

 



 

and/or defenses (including its own attorneys fees), however the Parties shall
share equally the costs of the arbitration, including the arbitrators fees.

 



 

(b) The dispute resolution proceedings contemplated by this provision shall be
as confidential and private as permitted by Law or the rules of any applicable
securities exchange. To that end, the Parties shall not disclose the
existence, content or results of any proceedings conducted in accordance with
this provision, and materials prepared or submitted in connection with such
proceedings shall not be admissible in any other proceeding; provided,
however, that this confidentiality provision shall not prevent a petition to
vacate or enforce an arbitral award, and shall not bar disclosures required by
Law or, in the judgment of such disclosing Party, required by any applicable
securities exchange or the regulations thereof. The Parties agree that any
decision or award resulting from proceedings in accordance with this dispute
resolution provision shall have no preclusive effect in any other matter
involving third parties.

 



 

(c) Should any Party institute any arbitration (or court proceeding, to the
extent permitted) under this Section 9.8 to enforce any provision hereof or
for damages by reason of the breach, default or liability of the other Parties
arising out of any provision of this Agreement or otherwise, the prevailing
Party or Parties (as determined by the arbitral panel or court) shall be
entitled to recover costs of the arbitration or court proceeding and
reasonable attorneys fees to be fixed by the arbitral panel or court.

 



 

(d) Each Party is required to continue to perform its obligations under this
Agreement pending final resolution of any Dispute.

 



 

(e) Any judicial proceedings permitted to be brought with respect to this
Agreement shall be brought in any state or federal court of competent
jurisdiction in the State of Colorado and the Parties generally and
unconditionally accept the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts. The Parties
waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, any objection which
they may now or hereafter have to the bringing of any such action or
proceeding in such jurisdiction.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding the agreement to arbitrate Disputes that do not require
injunctive relief, the Parties agree that each may petition a court of
competent jurisdiction to address issues that require injunctive relief from a
court and are not properly subject to arbitrability.

9.9 _Entire Agreement and Modifications._

 



 

(a) This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents constitute the entire
agreement between the Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof, superseding all prior statements, representations, discussions,
agreements and understandings relating to such subject matter; provided,
however, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect until and
unless the execution of this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions occurs.

 



 

(b) Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement, all
covenants, agreements, representations, guaranties, indemnities, and
warranties shall survive the execution of this Agreement and the consummation
of the Transactions, and the delivery and recordation of deeds, assignments or
bills of sale which convey the Transferred Properties to Buyer. Buyer
acknowledges that (i) it is not relying on any representation (written or
verbal) by any Seller or its Affiliates that is not specifically set forth in
the Transaction Documents, and (ii) it is relying solely on the
representations set forth in the Transaction Documents and its own evaluation
in making its decision to enter into the Transaction Documents to which it is
a party and the Transactions.

 



 

(c) No amendment or modification to this Agreement shall be binding unless
made in writing and signed by all Parties. The waiver or failure of any Party
to enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not be construed or operate
as a waiver of any further breach of such provision or of any other provision
of this Agreement.

 



 

9.10 _Parties in Interest_. Nothing in this Agreement, whether express or
implied, is intended to confer any rights or remedies under or by reason of
this Agreement on any persons other than the Parties, their respective
successors and assigns and any Indemnitee entitled to the benefit of the
indemnification provisions of Article 8 hereof, nor is anything in this
Agreement intended to relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any
third person to any Party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision of this
Agreement give any third persons any right of subrogation or action over and
against any Party to this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

9.11 _Severability_. In the event any provision of this Agreement is held to
be invalid by a court or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity
of any such provision shall in no way affect any other provision contained
herein; provided, however, that any such invalidity does not materially
prejudice any Parties in their respective rights and obligations contained in
the valid provisions of this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
remainder of this Agreement will be interpreted so as to best accomplish the
intent of the Parties within the limits of applicable Law.

 



 

9.12 _Records and Assistance._

 



 

(a) For a period which meets the minimum standards of Buyers internal
policies for record retention (but in any event, no less than three (3) years
after the date hereof), Buyer will retain any records evidencing the operation
and maintenance obligations or the cost of reimbursement rights of Buyer
hereunder or otherwise relating to the Transferred Properties prior to the
date hereof (the "Records"), and will make such Records available to Sellers
for inspection and copying upon reasonable notice at Buyers headquarters (or
at such other location in the United States as Buyer shall designate in
writing to Sellers) at reasonable times and during regular office hours. In
addition, Buyer will cooperate in providing information required by Sellers to
complete reports, statements, or other submissions required by Law, without
regard to whether such information is contained in the Records. Following the
expiration of such period, Buyer may destroy such Records, provided that until
the fifth (5th) anniversary of the date hereof, Buyer shall provide each
Seller with sixty (60) calendar days prior written notice of Buyers intent
to destroy any material Records transferred to Buyer pursuant to this
Agreement and if Sellers do not consent to the proposed destruction of
Records, Buyer shall either continue to retain the Records and continue to
make them available to Sellers as provided in the preceding sentence or
require Sellers to remove such records at Sellers cost and expense. To the
extent Buyer receives copies of the Records because such Records relate to
both the Transferred Properties and properties excluded from the Transferred
Properties, Buyer shall maintain those portions of the Records which do not
relate solely to the Transferred Properties strictly confidential and shall
not disclose any such Records to any person or agency, unless such disclosure
is required by Law or has otherwise been made publicly available

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (a) above, Sellers shall make
arrangements to have any tax records located at the Transferred Properties
removed within sixty (60) days of the date hereof. Buyer may request copies,
at Buyers expense, of any such designated tax records either prior to the
sixtieth day after the date hereof or thereafter upon written request of
Sellers.

 



 

(c) In the event of any dispute with respect to the ownership of the
Transferred Properties arising out of events which occurred prior to the date
hereof, Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Sellers and their Affiliates, at
Sellers sole cost and expense, in the resolution of such dispute, including
appearing in any litigation which may result therefrom; provided however,
Buyer shall not be obligated to cooperate in any such dispute (nor appear in
any related litigation) if such dispute involves (x) the Buyer or its
Affiliates, (y) any third party with whom the Buyer is a counterparty as a
result of the Transactions or (z) any controversy between any of the Sellers
party to any Transaction Document or their respective Affiliates; provided
further, however, that Buyers agreement to so cooperate shall not be deemed
an acceptance by Buyer of

 



      
 

 



 

any liability arising from such dispute, as to which the other provisions of
this Agreement shall control. Subject to execution of a customary non-
disclosure agreement among Buyer and Sellers, Buyer shall make available to
Sellers, upon Sellers request at all reasonable times, any and all files and
business records in Buyers custody or control transferred to Buyer hereunder
and, except in the case of a conflict of interest between the Parties, any and
all individuals employed by Buyer whose testimony or knowledge in the opinion
of each Sellers respective counsel may be necessary or useful to it
concerning the issues involved in such claims or litigation or in anticipation
thereof. Each Seller and Buyer agrees to preserve all documents required to be
preserved by any statutes, regulations, ordinances, orders, and other
government requirements.

 



 

(d) While Sellers and their Affiliates are transferring books and records
pertaining to the Transferred Properties to Buyer, such transferors by such
act in no way intend to waive their respective attorney-client and work
product privileges as to such documents which may be contained in such books
and records and in particular with respect to those files associated with
outstanding claims and lawsuits which have been identified in this Agreement.
Buyer shall continue to maintain the confidential status of those files or
turn them over to Sellers or their respective Affiliates if so requested.

 



 

9.13 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts and by different Parties on separate counterparts, all of which
shall be considered one and the same agreement, and each of which shall be
deemed an original. Signatures delivered by facsimile or by e-mail in portable
document format (pdf) shall be binding for all purposes hereof.
