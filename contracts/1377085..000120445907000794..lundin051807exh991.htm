sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged) and intending to be legally
bound hereby, the parties agree as follows:  

 -2-

 

  **ARTICLE I 
 GENERAL**

 

  ** _1.1_**

 

  ** _Defined Terms_**

 

 Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
meanings ascribed to such terms in Schedule A.

 

  ** _1.2_**

 

  ** _Arrangement_**

 

 (a)

 

 The parties hereto agree to effect the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Arrangement, on the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein and in the other Transaction Documents and to execute,
deliver and perform their obligations under the respective Transaction
Documents to which they are party.

 

 (b)

 

 As soon as reasonably practicable following the execution and delivery of
this Agreement: (i) Tenke shall file, proceed with and diligently prosecute
an application to the Court for the Interim Order; (ii) Tenke shall call and
hold the Tenke Meeting for the purpose of approving the Tenke Arrangement
Resolution; (iii) Lundin shall call and hold the Lundin Meeting for the
purpose of approving the Lundin Resolution; and (iv) Tenke shall prepare

 (c)

 

 If the Tenke Arrangement Resolution is approved at the Tenke Meeting, and
the Lundin Resolution is approved at the Lundin Meeting, Tenke shall, as soon
as practicable thereafter, proceed with and diligently pursue an application
for the Order and Lundin, Newco, Tenke and the Tenke Shareholders shall
complete the Arrangement in the manner contemplated by the Plan

 -7-

 

 

 

  ** _2.7_**

 

  ** _Public Filings; Financial Statements_**

 

 (a)

 

 Tenke has filed all documents required pursuant to Canadian Securities
Laws, (the "Tenke Securities Documents"). As of their respective dates, the
Tenke Securities Documents complied in all material respects with the then
applicable requirements of Canadian Securities Laws, and, at the
respective times they were filed, none of the Tenke Securities Documents
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any
statement therein, in light of the circumstances under which it was made, not
misleading. Tenke has not filed any confidential material change reports
which have not at the date hereof become public knowledge.

 

 (b)

 

 The consolidated financial statements (including, in each case, any notes
thereto and related management discussion and analysis) of Tenke included in
the Tenke Securities Documents were prepared in accordance with GAAP applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
therein or in the notes thereto) and fairly presented the
consolidated assets, liabilities and financial condition of Tenke and its
consolidated subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated earnings, results of operations and changes in financial
position of Tenke and its consolidated subsidiaries for the periods then
ended (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to the absence of
footnote disclosure and to normal year-end audit adjustments and to any other
adjustments described therein).  Except as disclosed in the Tenke Securities
Documents or in Section 2.7(b) of the Tenke Disclosure Letter, Tenke has not,
since December 31, 2006, made any change in the accounting practices or
policies applied in the preparation of its financial statements.

 

 (c)

 

 Tenke is a "reporting issuer" (or its equivalent) under Canadian Securities
Laws of each of the Provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan,
Ontario and Quebec. Tenke is not currently in default in any material
respect of any requirement of Canadian Securities Laws and Tenke is
not included on a list of defaulting reporting issuers maintained by any of
the securities commissions or similar regulatory authorities in each of
such Provinces.

 

 (d)

 

 There has not been any reportable event (within the meaning of NI 51-102 of
the Canadian Securities Administrators) since December 31, 2006 with the
present or former auditors of Tenke.

 

 (e)

 

 Except as disclosed in the Tenke Securities Documents, there are no
contracts with Tenke, on the one hand, and: (i) any officer or director

other hand.

 

  ** _2.8_**

 

  ** _Taxes_**

 

 Except as described in Section 2.8 of the Tenke Disclosure Letter, each
Tenke Group Member has timely filed, or has caused to be timely filed on its
behalf, all Tax Returns required to be filed by it, all such Tax Returns are
complete and accurate in all material respects, and the statute
of limitations for the assessment of Taxes has expired for all Tax Returns of
the Tenke Group or those Tax Returns have been examined by the appropriate
taxing authorities for all periods through December 31, 2005. All Taxes
shown to be due on such Tax Returns, or otherwise owed, have been timely
paid, other than those which are being contested in good faith and in respect
of which adequate reserves have been provided in the most recently published
financial statements of Tenke. Tenke\'s most recent audited consolidated

furnish such information or access with respect to Tenke and the Tenke Group
to the person making such Tenke Competing Proposal pursuant to a
confidentiality agreement with such person that is no less restrictive than

respect to any Tenke Competing Proposals that are continuing as of the date

to Tenke, their approval of the Arrangement, this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the recommendation to vote in favour of the Tenke

intent (any such agreement an "Tenke Transaction Agreement") to effect a
Tenke Competing Proposal.

 

 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if Tenke has received a Tenke Superior
Proposal (as defined below), the Board of Directors of Tenke may (subject to
the other terms of Section 4.6(b)): (A) withdraw or modify its recommendation
of the Tenke Arrangement Resolution; (B) approve or recommend a Tenke
Superior Proposal; or (C) cause Tenke or any of its subsidiaries to
enter into a Transaction Agreement to effect a Superior Proposal, but in each
case only if: (x) the Board of Directors of Tenke determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that such action is necessary in
order for them to act in a manner consistent with their fiduciary duties
under applicable law; and (y) Tenke shall have furnished Lundin with written
notice at least four (4) Business Days prior to the date any such actions are
proposed to be taken specifying which actions are proposed to be taken and,
after taking into account modifications to this Agreement proposed by Lundin
during such three Business Day period, such Tenke Competing Proposal would
still constitute a Tenke Superior Proposal. If Lundin makes a proposal to
amend this Agreement to increase the consideration payable to the Tenke
Shareholders pursuant to the Arrangement, such that the Tenke Competing
Proposal is no longer a Tenke Superior Proposal, each party shall execute
such documents to give effect to such proposal and Tenke shall not enter into
such Tenke Competing Proposal.

written Tenke Competing Proposal made by a third party that the Board of
Directors determines in good faith and by formal resolution,

 -5-

 

  **ARTICLE III 
 THE ARRANGEMENT**

 

  ** _3.1_**

 

  ** _Effectiveness_**

 

 Subject to the terms of the Arrangement Agreement, this Plan of Arrangement
will become effective in the sequence set out in Section 3.2 (except as
otherwise provided therein) and will be binding from the Effective Time on:
(i) Tenke; (ii) Newco; and (iii) all registered and beneficial owners of
Tenke Shares; (iv) all registered and beneficial holders of Tenke options;
and (v) all registered and beneficial owners of Newco Shares.

 

  ** _3.2_**

 

  ** _The Arrangement_**

 

 On the Effective Date and commencing at the Effective Time, the following
shall occur and be deemed to occur in the following order without further act
or formality:

 

 (a)

 

 the authorized capital of Tenke will be amended by redesignating the Tenke
Shares as Class B Shares and the Articles of Tenke shall be deemed to be
amended accordingly and each certificate representing an outstanding
Tenke Share shall, as and from the time such redesignation is effective,
represent a Class B Share;

 

 (b)

 

 the authorized capital of Tenke will be amended by the creation of an
unlimited number of Class A Shares and the Articles of Tenke shall be deemed
to be amended accordingly;

 

 (c)

 

 Tenke will transfer the South American Assets and the Cash to Newco and, in
consideration therefor, Newco will issue to Tenke, as fully paid and non-
assessable, that number of Newco Shares equal to the number of Tenke Shares
issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time, other
than Tenke Shares held by Dissenting Shareholders;

 

 (d)

 

 each issued Class B Share, other than those held by
Dissenting Shareholders, will be exchanged with Tenke for one Class A Share
and one Newco Share acquired by Tenke in accordance with Section 3.2(c) and
the certificates representing the outstanding Class B Shares of Tenke shall
thereafter represent Class A Shares;

 

 (e)

 

 each issued Class B Share held by Dissenting Shareholders (for greater
certainty, being Tenke Shareholders who have duly complied with the Dissent
Rights and are ultimately entitled to be paid for their dissenting shares)
will be acquired by Tenke in consideration for Tenke agreeing to pay
the amount to be paid as determined in accordance with Article IV of this
Plan of Arrangement in respect of the dissenting shares;

 

 (f)

 

 each issued Class B Share acquired in accordance Section 3.2(e) will be
cancelled;

 

 (g)

 

 the stated capital of Tenke for the outstanding Class A Shares will be an
amount equal to the stated capital of Tenke for the Class B Shares, less the
fair market value of the Newco Shares distributed to Tenke Shareholders,
other than Dissenting Shareholders, pursuant to Section 3.2(d) and the paid-
up capital of the Class A Shares of Tenke will be reduced accordingly;  

 -6-

 

 (h)

 

 the Class B Shares will be cancelled;

 

 (i)

 

 each issued Class A Share will be transferred to Lundin in consideration of
1.73 Lundin Shares and $0.001 in cash;

 

 (j)

 

 each Tenke Stock Option outstanding immediately before the Effective Date
will be exchanged for a stock option to be issued by Lundin (a "Lundin New
Option") pursuant to which the holder of the Tenke Stock Option will be
entitled to receive, upon exercise of the Lundin New Option, that number
of Lundin Shares which the holder would have been entitled to receive as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Arrangement if,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, such holder had been the registered
holder of the number of Tenke Shares to which such holder was therefore
entitled upon exercise of the Tenke Stock Option. Save and except as
otherwise agreed to by Lundin and the holders of Tenke Stock Options, the
term to expiry, conditions to and manner of exercising, vesting schedule, the
status under applicable laws, and all other terms and conditions of each
Lundin New Option will otherwise be unchanged from those contained in or
otherwise applicable to the related Tenke Stock Option. It is intended that
the provisions of Subsection 7 (1.4) of the Tax Act apply to such exchange.
Therefore, in the event that the amount, if any, by which the total fair
market value (determined immediately after the Effective Time) of the Lundin
Shares that a holder is entitled to acquire on exercise of the Lundin New
Option exceeds the amount payable to acquire such shares under the Lundin New
Option (the "Lundin Stock Option In-The-Money Amount") exceeds the amount by
which the total fair market value (determined immediately before the
Effective Time) of the Tenke Shares that the holder was entitled to acquire
on exercise of the Tenke Stock Option exceeds the amount payable to acquire
such shares under the Tenke Stock Option (the "Tenke Stock Option In-The-
Money Amount"), the number of Lundin Shares which may be acquired on exercise
of the Lundin New Option will be adjusted accordingly with effect at and from
the Effective Time to ensure that the Lundin Stock Option In-The-Money Amount
does not exceed the Tenke Stock Option In-The-Money Amount and the ratio of
the amount payable to acquire such shares to the value of such shares to
be acquired shall be unchanged. In addition each Tenke Stock Option which, by
its terms, would expire 90 days after the holder of such option ceased to
be eligible to hold options under the Tenke Stock Option Plan, shall be
deemed to have been amended to provide that such option shall not expire
until 180 days after the holder of such option ceased to be eligible to hold
options under the Tenke Stock Option Plan;

 

 (k)

 

 Newco will redeem its outstanding Class A Shares for $0.001 per share and
such shares will be cancelled;

 

 (l)

 

 no fractional Lundin Shares will be issued in connection with the exchange
in Section 3.2(i), but rather shareholders entitled to a fractional Lundin
Share will receive cash in lieu thereof in accordance with Section 3.5
of this Plan of Arrangement;

 

 (m)

 

 the names of Tenke Shareholders, other than Lundin, will be removed from
the central securities register of Tenke;

 

 (n)

 

 Lundin will become the holder of all Class A Shares and the central
securities register of Tenke will be revised accordingly; and  

 -7-

 

 (o)

 

 the exchanges and cancellations provided for in this Section 3.2 will be
deemed to occur on the Effective Date, notwithstanding that certain of the
procedures related thereto are not completed until after the Effective Date.

 

  ** _3.3_**

 

  ** _Effect of the Arrangement_**

 

 As at and from the Effective Time:

 

 (a)

 

 Tenke will be a wholly-owned subsidiary of Lundin;

 

 (b)

 

 Tenke will continue to hold all of its mineral properties, cash and assets,
save and except for the Cash and South American Assets transferred to Newco
as part of the Arrangement;

 

 (c)

 

 The holders of Tenke Shares, other than Dissenting Shareholders, will hold
Lundin Shares and Newco Shares in replacement for their Tenke Shares, as
provided by this Plan of Arrangement; and

 

 (d)

 

 The holders of Tenke Stock Options will hold Lundin Stock Options in
replacement for their Tenke Stock Options as provided by this Plan
of Arrangement.

 

  ** _3.4_**

 

  ** _Post Effective Time Procedures_**

 

 (a)

 

 After the Effective Date, certificates formerly representing Tenke Shares
which are held by a Former Tenke Shareholder will, except for Tenke Shares
held by Dissenting Shareholders, represent only the right to
receive certificates representing Lundin Shares and Newco Shares, all in
accordance with the terms of this Plan of Arrangement.

 

 (b)

 

 On or promptly after the Effective Date, Lundin shall deliver or arrange to
be delivered to the Depositary certificates representing the Lundin Shares
required to be issued to Former Tenke Shareholders in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3.1 hereof, which certificates shall be held by
the Depositary as agent and nominee for such Former Tenke Shareholders
for distribution to such Former Tenke Shareholders in accordance with the
provisions of Article III hereof.

 

 (c)

 

 On or promptly after the Effective Date, Newco shall deliver or arrange to
be delivered to the Depositary certificates representing the Newco Shares
required to be issued to Former Tenke Shareholders in accordance with
the provisions of Section 3.1 hereof, which certificates shall be held by
the Depositary as agent and nominee for such Tenke shareholders for
distribution to such Former Tenke Shareholders in accordance with the
provisions of Article III hereof.

 

 (d)

 

 A Former Tenke Shareholder who is an Eligible Holder and who
has transferred a Class A Share to Lundin pursuant to the Arrangement shall
be entitled to make an income tax election, pursuant to section 85 of the Tax
Act (and any analogous provisions of provincial income tax law) with respect
to such transfer by providing two signed copies of the necessary election
forms to an appointed representative, as directed by Tenke or Lundin, within
90 days following the Effective Date, duly completed with the details of the
number of shares transferred and the applicable agreed amounts for the
purposes of such election. Thereafter, subject to such election forms
complying with requirements under the Tax Act (or applicable provincial
income tax law), such forms shall be signed and returned to such Former Tenke
Shareholder within 90 days after the receipt thereof by Lundin or any
successor corporation for filing with the Canada Revenue Agency (or the
applicable provincial tax authority). Lundin or any successor corporation
shall not be responsible for the proper completion of any election form and,
except for the obligation to sign and return duly completed election forms
which are received within 90 days of the Effective Date, Lundin or any
successor will not be responsible for any taxes, interest or penalties
resulting from the failure of a Former Tenke Shareholder to properly complete
or file such election forms in the form and manner and within the
time prescribed by the Tax Act (or any applicable provincial legislation).
In its sole discretion, Lundin or any successor corporation may choose to
sign and return an election form received by it more than 90 days following
the Effective Date, but will have no obligation to do so.  

 -8-

 

  ** _3.5_**

 

  ** _No Fractional Lundin Shares_**

 

 No fractional Lundin Shares shall be issued to Former Tenke Shareholders
and any fractional number of Lundin Shares shall be accumulated, and all

otherwise entitled to receive a fractional interest in a Lundin Share will
receive a cash payment equal to such person\'s pro rata portion of the net
proceeds after expenses received by the Depositary upon such sale of the
whole Lundin Shares.

 

  **ARTICLE IV 
 RIGHTS OF DISSENT**

 

  **4.1**

 

  **Dissent Rights**

 

 Notwithstanding Article 3, each registered holder of Tenke Shares is
entitled to dissent from the Arrangement and to be paid the fair value of
the Tenke Shares held by such holder in respect of which such holder
dissents, determined as of the day before the date on which the Arrangement
Resolution is passed (and in the event that the Arrangement becomes
effective) in connection with the Plan of Arrangement (the **" Dissent
Right"**) provided that such holder complies with section 190 of the CBCA (as
modified by the Interim Order, the Final Order and this section 4.1) as if
section 190 (as so modified) were applicable to such registered holders. 

 

 Holders of Tenke Shares who exercise Dissent Rights and who: (i) are
ultimately determined to be entitled to be paid fair value for their
Tenke Shares; or (ii) are ultimately determined not to be entitled, for any
reason, to be paid fair value for their Tenke Shares, shall have participated
and shall be deemed to have participated in the Arrangement, as at the
Effective Time, on the same basis as a non-Dissenting Shareholder and shall
receive Newco Shares and Lundin Shares in respect of their Tenke Shares on
the basis set forth in Article 3.

 

 In no case shall Tenke, Lundin or any other Person be required to recognize
a Dissenting Shareholder as a holder of Tenke Shares after the Effective Time
and the name of each Dissenting Shareholder shall be deleted from the
register of holders of Tenke Shares as at the Effective Time.  

 -9-

 

  **ARTICLE V 
 CERTIFICATES**

 

  **5.1**

 

  **Share Certificates**

 

 Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented one or more outstanding
Tenke Shares together with such other documents and instruments as would have
been required to effect the transfer of the Tenke Shares formerly represented
by such certificate under the CBCA and the by-laws of Tenke and
such additional documents and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably
require, the holder of such surrendered certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall deliver to such holder
following the Effective Time, a certificate representing the Newco Shares and
the Lundin Shares which such holder is entitled to receive in accordance with
Section 3.1 hereof.

 

  **5.2**

 

  **Lost Certificates**

 

 In the event that any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented one or more outstanding Tenke Shares shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by
the Person claiming such certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Depositary will issue to such Person the Lundin Shares that such Person would
have been entitled to had such share certificate not been lost, stolen or
destroyed. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Person to whom the Newco Shares and Lundin Shares
are to be issued shall, as a condition precedent to the payment thereof, give
bonds satisfactory to Newco and Lundin in such sums as Newco and Lundin may
direct or otherwise indemnify the Depositary, Newco and Lundin in a manner
satisfactory to each of them against any claim that may be made against the
Depositary, Newco or Lundin with respect to the certificate alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

  **5.3**

 

  **Distributions with Respect to Unsurrendered Certificates**

 

 No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Lundin Shares or Newco Shares with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to the holder of any
unsurrendered certificate which, immediately prior to the Effective Time,
represented outstanding Tenke Shares unless and until the holder of such
certificate shall have complied with the provisions of Section 5.1 and
Section 5.2 hereof.  Subject to applicable law and to Section 5.4 hereof, at
the time of such compliance, there shall, in addition to the delivery of a
certificate representing the Lundin Shares and Newco Shares to which such
holder is thereby entitled, be delivered to such holder, without interest,
the amount of the dividend or other distribution with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to Lundin Shares or Newco
Shares, as the case may be.  

 -10-

 

  **5.4**

 

  **Withholding Rights**

 

 Newco, Lundin and the Depositary shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from all dividends or other distributions otherwise payable to any Former
Tenke Shareholder such amounts as Newco, Lundin or the Depositary is required
or permitted to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under the
_Income Tax Act_ (Canada), the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986 or
any provision of any applicable federal, provincial, state, local or foreign
tax law, in each case, as amended. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes hereof
as having been paid to the Former Tenke Shareholder in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made, provided that such withheld amounts
are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority.

 

  **5.5**

 

  **Limitation and Proscription**

 

 To the extent that a Former Tenke Shareholder shall not have complied with
the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 hereof on or before the date
which is six years after the Effective Date (the "final proscription date"),
then the Newco Shares and Lundin Shares which such Former Tenke Shareholder
was entitled to receive shall be automatically cancelled without
any repayment of capital in respect thereof and the certificates representing
such Newco Shares and Lundin Shares shall be delivered to Newco and/or Lundin
by the Depositary for cancellation and shall be cancelled by Newco and Lundin
and the interest of the Former Tenke Shareholder in such Newco Shares and
Lundin Shares shall be terminated as of such final proscription date.

Tenke Shares.

could not be  made whole by monetary damages. It is accordingly agreed that
in the event  of any breach hereof by the Shareholder, (i) Tenke shall be

injunctive  relief and/or any other equitable remedy, the defence of adequacy
of a  remedy at law; and (iii) the Shareholder further agrees to waive any

obtaining of any injunctive or other equitable relief.
