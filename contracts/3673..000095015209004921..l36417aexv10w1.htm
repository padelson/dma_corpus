<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, dated as of May&nbsp;4, 2009 (this &#147;<U>Agreement</U>&#148;), is made by
and among The Potomac Edison Company, a Virginia and Maryland corporation (&#147;<U>Seller</U>&#148;), and
Rappahannock Electric Cooperative (&#147;REC&#148;), a Virginia utility consumer services cooperative
(&#147;<U>Buyer</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Seller is engaged in the business of distributing electric power for retail and wholesale
customers, providing electric generation service to retail customers, providing related services
and products and engaging in related activities in the Commonwealth of Virginia (the &#147;<U>VA
Distribution Business</U>&#148;).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Seller desires to sell and assign, and Buyer desires to purchase and assume, certain assets
and liabilities associated with the portion of Seller&#146;s VA Distribution Business in the exclusive
service territory described in <U>Annex A</U> hereto, as further set forth and subject to the
terms and conditions herein. The Acquired Assets (as defined herein) and the Assumed Obligations
(as defined herein) are collectively referred to herein as the &#147;<U>Transferred Business</U>.&#148; The
service territory described in <U>Annex A</U> allocated to Buyer is referred to herein as the
&#147;<U>Transferred Territory</U>.&#148;
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Concurrently herewith, Seller is entering into an asset purchase agreement with Shenandoah
Valley Electric Cooperative (&#147;<U>SVEC</U>&#148;) pursuant to which Seller is agreeing to sell and
assign, and SVEC is agreeing to purchase and assume, certain assets and liabilities associated with
the portion of Seller&#146;s VA Distribution Business in the exclusive service territory described in
<U>Annex A</U> hereto allocated to SVEC. Such agreement between Seller and SVEC is referred to
herein as the &#147;<U>Sister Purchase Agreement</U>&#148; and the assets to be sold and liabilities to be
assumed pursuant to such agreement are referred to herein as the &#147;<U>Sister Business</U>.&#148; The
service territories described in <U>Annex A</U> are intended to include all of Seller&#146;s
distribution service territory and distribution customers in the Commonwealth of Virginia (with
certain exceptions expressly noted in <U>Section&nbsp;2.2</U>).
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;D.&nbsp;In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Sister Purchase
Agreement, Seller wishes to assign all of its right and obligations under the Power Purchase
Agreements (as defined herein) from and after the Effective Time (as defined herein); it is
contemplated that the Power Purchase Agreements will be assigned to and assumed by Old Dominion

has a full requirements power supply agreement; should ODEC not accept such assignment and
assumption then Buyer, together with SVEC, as buyer under the Sister Purchase Agreement, wish to
assume such Power Purchase Agreements from and after the Effective Time.
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;E.&nbsp;Buyer acknowledges that it is Seller&#146;s intention to exit the VA Distribution Business in
its entirety pursuant to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and in the Sister
Purchase Agreement and the assignment of the Power Purchase Agreements, and that except as
otherwise expressly contemplated herein or in the Sister Purchase Agreement, such transactions are
intended to be consummated simultaneously.

at the Shared Locations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, assets

and the Sister Purchase Agreement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that prior to Closing
Buyer may request certain revisions to or clarifications of such divisions (which revisions or
clarifications also will require the agreement of the buyer to the Sister Purchase Agreement) and
Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and SVEC in regards thereto and to enter into amendments
hereto to further reflect such division as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and SVEC.

indemnification is to be sought from an Indemnifying Party, the Indemnitee will give such
Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof. Such notice shall describe the nature
of the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and shall indicate the estimated amount, if
practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The
Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or, by giving written notice to the
Indemnitee, to elect to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Party&#146;s
own expense and by such Indemnifying Party&#146;s own counsel, and the Indemnitee will cooperate in good

steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within twenty (20)&nbsp;days after receiving
notice from the Indemnitee that the Indemnitee believes the Indemnifying Party has failed to take
such steps, the Indemnitee may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable
for all reasonable expenses thereof. If there is a conflict of interests between Indemnitee and
Indemnifying Party, Indemnitee may elect to be represented by its own counsel at Indemnifying
Party&#146;s expense. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will
not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that would lead to liability or create any
financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee. If a firm offer is made to settle a
Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation
