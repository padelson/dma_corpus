 A. Seller is engaged in the business of distributing electric power for retail and wholesale customers, providing electric generation service to retail customers, providing related services and products and engaging in related activities in the Commonwealth of Virginia (the " _VA Distribution Business_ "). 

  

 B. Seller desires to sell and assign, and Buyer desires to purchase and assume, certain assets and liabilities associated with the portion of Sellers VA Distribution Business in the exclusive service territory described in _Annex A_ hereto, as further set forth and subject to the terms and conditions herein. The Acquired Assets (as defined herein) and the Assumed Obligations (as defined herein) are collectively referred to herein as the " _Transferred Business_." The service territory described in _Annex A_ allocated to Buyer is referred to herein as the " _Transferred Territory_." 

  

 C. Concurrently herewith, Seller is entering into an asset purchase agreement with Shenandoah Valley Electric Cooperative (" _SVEC_ ") pursuant to which Seller is agreeing to sell and assign, and SVEC is agreeing to purchase and assume, certain assets and liabilities associated with the portion of Sellers VA Distribution Business in the exclusive service territory described in  _Annex A_ hereto allocated to SVEC. Such agreement between Seller and SVEC is referred to herein as the " _Sister Purchase Agreement_ " and the assets to be sold and liabilities to be assumed pursuant to such agreement are referred to herein as the " _Sister Business_." The service territories described in _Annex A_ are intended to include all of Sellers distribution service territory and distribution customers in the Commonwealth of Virginia (with certain exceptions expressly noted in _Section 2.2_). 

  

 D. In connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the Sister Purchase Agreement, Seller wishes to assign all of its right and obligations under the Power Purchase Agreements (as defined herein) from and after the Effective Time (as defined herein); it is contemplated that the Power Purchase Agreements will be assigned to and assumed by Old Dominion Electric Cooperative, a Virginia utility aggregation cooperative (" _ODEC_ "), with whom Buyer has a full requirements power supply agreement; should ODEC not accept such assignment and assumption then Buyer, together with SVEC, as buyer under the Sister Purchase Agreement, wish to assume such Power Purchase Agreements from and after the Effective Time. 

  

 E. Buyer acknowledges that it is Sellers intention to exit the VA Distribution Business in its entirety pursuant to the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and in the Sister Purchase Agreement and the assignment of the Power Purchase Agreements, and that except as otherwise expressly contemplated herein or in the Sister Purchase Agreement, such transactions are intended to be consummated simultaneously.

 2.5 _Assignment of Equipment Leases_. To the extent requested by Buyer, Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assign to Buyer at the Closing Sellers rights under the Equipment Leases, including seeking to obtain any required consents to such assignments from the lessor(s) to such Equipment Leases with respect to the equipment covered by such leases and used or held by used in the Transferred Territory. In the event Seller is unable to assign any such rights under the Equipment Leases (or the portion thereof relating to the Transferred Business) as of the Closing as a result of the failure to obtain any consent of any lessor under such Equipment Lease, it will notify Buyer promptly that it will not be able to assign such Equipment Lease (or such portion thereof) to Buyer at the Closing.

Any Seller Lease Buy-Out consummated by Seller pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ will be at the sole cost and expense of Buyer, and any personal property, equipment or vehicles acquired by Seller upon the exercise of a Seller Lease Buy-Out will be transferred to Buyer at the Closing for no additional consideration. Any personal property, equipment or vehicles transferred to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ will be deemed an " _Acquired Asset_ " for all purposes under this Agreement. 

   ##### 

  

  

 2.6 _VA Distribution Business; Inventory_. 

  

 (a) Prior to Closing, Buyer and Seller agree to work together in good faith to separate the buildings, improvements, fixtures and other equipment at the Shared Locations based on the intention of the parties expressed in this Agreement and Good Utility Practices. The Assignment and Assumption Agreement to be entered into at Closing may further define the separation of assets at the Shared Locations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, assets identified as Distribution Facilities on such Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to be Distribution Facilities for all purposes of this Agreement, and assets identified as Transmission Facilities on such Assignment and Assumption Agreement shall be deemed to be Transmission Facilities for purposes of this Agreement. 

  

 (b) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that this Agreement reflects a division of Sellers VA Distribution Business between Buyer and SVEC pursuant to the Sister Purchase Agreement. The division of Sellers VA Distribution Business has been agreed between Buyer and SVEC and generally is based on the division of circuits reflected on _Annex A_ hereto. Seller has undertaken in good faith to reflect such division in the terms of, and schedules and exhibits to, this Agreement and the Sister Purchase Agreement. Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that prior to Closing Buyer may request certain revisions to or clarifications of such divisions (which revisions or clarifications also will require the agreement of the buyer to the Sister Purchase Agreement) and Seller agrees to cooperate with Buyer and SVEC in regards thereto and to enter into amendments hereto to further reflect such division as may be reasonably requested by Buyer and SVEC. 

  

 (c) Buyer may request, no later than sixty (60) days prior to the expected Closing Date, that Seller add certain materials or supplies to Inventory at a service center or substation so that such materials or supplies shall be included as Acquired Assets, and Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to the extent it has available such materials in supplies to meet Buyers reasonable requests relating thereto, including Buyers specifications for such materials and supplies. Inventory moved prior to the Effective Time to a service center or substation at Buyers request pursuant to this _Section 2.6(c)_ shall be deemed an Acquired Asset.

 (b) Not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will prepare and deliver to Buyer a certificate (the " _Purchase Price Certificate_ ") of an authorized officer of Seller setting forth (i) Sellers best good faith estimate of the Net Book Value of the Acquired Assets (the " _Estimated NBV_ "), Customer Deposits and the Designated Assets Value, all as of the Effective Time, and (ii) the amount of the Closing Payment. The Purchase Price 

   ##### 

  

    

Certificate shall be prepared on the same basis and in the same format as the
2008 Statement will be presented on _Schedule 5.5_. As used herein, the term
" _Closing Payment_ " means the sum of (i) the Estimated NBV _multiplied by_
1.65, _plus_ (ii) the estimated Designated Assets Value, _less_ (iii) the
estimated Customer Deposits, all as of the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) From and after the delivery of the Purchase Price Certificate until the Closing, Buyer will be permitted to review Sellers working papers relating to the preparation of the Purchase Price Certificate, and Seller will provide Buyer with reasonable access to the persons involved in preparing or reviewing the Purchase Price Certificate. The purpose of such review will be to allow Buyer to review changes to the Net Book Value of the Acquired Assets, the Designated Assets Value and Customer Deposits from December 31, 2008 to the Effective Time. 

  

 3.2 _Post-Closing True-Up_. 

  

 (a) Seller will deliver, no later than sixty (60) days after the Effective Time, Sellers determination of the Net Book Value of the Acquired Assets, Customer Deposits and Designated Assets Value, all as of the Effective Time and taking into account any Correction Adjustments (the " _Closing Statement_ ").

Buyer will reasonably cooperate with Seller in connection with the preparation of the Closing Statement and related information, and will provide to Seller reasonable access to such books, records, personnel and other information as may be reasonably requested from time to time. 

  

 (b) Buyer may dispute the Closing Statement or any item set forth thereon; __provided__ ,  _ _however__ , that Buyer will notify Seller in writing of any disputed item, and the basis of such dispute, within thirty (30) days of Buyers receipt of the Closing Statement (the " _Closing Statement Review Period_ "); and __provided__ , __further__ , that Buyers dispute of any item set forth on the Closing Statement shall be limited to (i) changes in the Net Book Value of the Acquired Assets, Customer Deposits or the Designated Assets Value between December 31, 2008 as set forth in the 2008 Statement and the Effective Time and (ii) the Correction Adjustments. During the Closing Statement Review Period, Buyer may review Sellers working papers and other information reasonably requested relating to the Closing Statement, and Seller will provide Buyer with reasonable access to persons involved in preparing or reviewing the Closing Statement. In the event of a dispute with respect to any part of the Closing Statement, Buyer and Seller will use reasonable efforts to reconcile their differences. If Buyer and Seller are unable to reach a resolution of such differences within thirty (30) days of receipt of Buyers written notice of dispute to Seller, Buyer and Seller will submit the amounts remaining in dispute for determination and resolution to the Independent Accounting Firm, which will be instructed to issue a report, to be delivered to Buyer and Seller within thirty (30) days of submission of the amounts remaining in dispute to the Independent Accounting Firm, stating its determinations and resolutions regarding the amounts disputed, with such report being final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto with respect to the amounts disputed (such determination, an " _Independent Accounting Firm Closing Statement Determination_ "). Seller and Buyer will each make available to the Independent Accounting Firm all work papers, books and records relating to the 

   ##### 

  

    

Transferred Business to the extent relevant to the determination of amounts
set forth on the Closing Statement. 

  

 The Independent Accounting Firm shall, within five (5) Business Days of its agreement to resolve the disputed items submitted to it, provide to Buyer and Seller the names and resumes of at least three partners of the Independent Accounting Firm (which resumes shall include a description of each such individuals substantial experience in the preparation and audit of financial statements of corporations engaged in businesses similar to the Transferred Business and a disclosure of each such individuals existing or prior business and/or personal relationships (if any) with Buyer, Seller or any employees or counsel of any such Person) who are willing to serve as the individual responsible for determining and resolving the matters submitted by Buyer and Seller to the Independent Accounting Firm (such person, the " _Independent Accounting Firm Partner_ "). If, on or before the third Business Day after their receipt of the information called for by the preceding sentence, Buyer and Seller have been unable after good faith negotiation to agree upon and select one of the individuals so identified to act as the Independent Accounting Firm Partner, then Buyer and Seller shall each have the right on or before the fifth Business Day after their receipt of such information to deliver to the Independent Accounting Firm a confidential communication striking any or all of the individuals previously identified as a potential Independent Accounting Firm Partner as to whom an existing business and/or personal relationship was disclosed pursuant to the preceding sentence, and/or striking no more than one of the other individuals previously identified as a potential Independent Accounting Firm Partner. The Independent Accounting Firm shall then proceed to select the Independent Accounting Firm Partner from among the previously identified individuals who have not been stricken from consideration; if all such previously identified individuals are so stricken, the Independent Accounting Firm shall designate at least three additional partners who are eligible to serve as the Independent Accounting Firm Partner and the forgoing selection procedure shall be repeated until an Independent Accounting Firm Partner is selected. 

  

 (c) The Closing Statement and the Net Book Value of the Acquired Assets or amount of Customer Deposits or the Designated Assets Value set forth thereon will be adjusted (including with respect to Correction Adjustments) (i) in accordance with any amount mutually agreed to in writing by Seller and Buyer with respect to any item set forth on the Closing Statement, and (ii) in accordance with any Independent Accounting Firm Closing Statement Determination. As used herein, the term " _Final NBV_ " means, as applicable, (x) the Net Book Value of the Acquired Assets set forth on the Closing Statement, as so adjusted pursuant to either clause (i) and/or (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, as applicable, or (y) if Buyer fails to dispute in writing the Net Book Value of the Acquired Assets, the Designated Assets Value, or the Customer Deposits (including the Correction Adjustments related thereto) set forth on the Closing Statement within the Closing Statement Review Period, the computation of such Net Book Value of the Acquired Assets set forth on the Closing Statement. The fees and disbursements of the Independent Accounting Firm with respect to this _Section 3.2_ will be allocated between Buyer and Seller so that Buyers share of such fees and disbursements will be in the same proportion that the aggregate amount of such disputed amounts so submitted by Buyer to the Independent Accounting Firm that is unsuccessfully disputed by Buyer (as finally determined by the Independent Accounting Firm or mutually agreed by the parties) bears to the total amount of all disputed amounts so submitted by Buyer to the Independent Accounting Firm. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Upon final determination of the Final NBV, the Designated Assets Value, and Customer Deposits (including the Correction Adjustments related thereto), all as of the Effective Time in accordance with _Section 3.2(c)_, Buyer or Seller, as applicable, shall pay to the other no later than five (5) days following the final determination thereof by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the party to receive funds, as applicable, the amount that (i)(A) the sum of the Estimated NBV _multiplied by_ 1.65, _plus_ (B) the estimated Designated Assets Value, _less_ (C) the estimated Customer Deposits, is greater or less than (ii)(A) the Final NBV _multiplied by_ 1.65, _plus_ (B) the Designated Assets Value as of the Effective Time, _less_ (C) the Customer Deposits as of the Effective Time. 

  

 (e) Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, items relating to the ownership, lease, maintenance or operation of the Transferred Business attributable to a period commencing prior to the Effective Time and terminating on or after the Effective Time, including personal property or real estate taxes, utilities, rents (including poll attachment rental revenue but excluding Income Taxes), shall be prorated based on the same units used to compute the item in question, and otherwise measured by calendar days. 

  

 (f) Any amount paid under _Section 3.2(d)_ will be paid with interest for the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the day preceding the date of payment, calculated at the U.S. prime rate as in effect on the Closing Date as published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (the " _Applicable Rate_ ") and will, to the maximum extent allowed by applicable Laws, constitute an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price. 

  

 3.3 _Allocation of Final Purchase Price_. Buyer and Seller agree that the Final Purchase Price shall be allocated among the Acquired Assets, in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, as set forth on _Schedule 3.3_ (the " _Allocation_ "). Seller shall prepare a post-Closing allocation (" _Post-Closing Allocation_ ") taking into account any post-Closing adjustment to the Final Purchase Price pursuant to _Section 3.2_ and consistent with the methods and allocations used in the Allocation within thirty (30) days following any adjustment to the Final Purchase Price pursuant to  _Section 3.2_ and shall deliver such proposed Post-Closing Allocation to Buyer for Buyers review and comment. If Buyer does not object in writing to the proposed Post-Closing Allocation, it shall be deemed to be accepted by Buyer as proposed by Seller. If Buyer objects to the Post-Closing Allocation, Buyer shall provide Seller written reasons for Buyers objection(s) with thirty (30) days following delivery of the proposed Post-Closing Allocation. Buyer and Seller shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to agree upon such Post-Closing Allocation. If agreement cannot be reached within twenty (20) days of the Buyers receipt of Sellers written objections, the parties shall submit the disagreement to an Independent Accounting Firm Partner selected pursuant to the procedures outlined in _Section 3.2(b)_ who shall determine and resolve the matter by issuing a report, to be delivered to Buyer and Seller within thirty (30) days of submission of the disagreement to the Independent Accounting Firm, stating its determinations and resolutions regarding the disagreement, with such report being final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto with respect to the amounts disputed. Buyer and Seller shall (i) file Internal Revenue Service Form 8594 and all federal, state and local Tax Returns, in accordance with such agreed allocation, and (ii) report the transactions contemplated by this Agreement for Tax purposes in a manner consistent with the final allocation of the Final Purchase Price (as the same may be adjusted) pursuant to this _Section 3.3_. Buyer and Seller shall provide the other promptly with 

   ##### 

  

    

any other information reasonably required to complete Form 8594\. Pursuant to
the provisions of  _Section 7.7_, Buyer and Seller will notify the other in
the event of an examination, audit or other proceeding regarding the agreed
upon allocation of the Final Purchase Price (as the same may be adjusted).

 (c) Buyer and Seller (or their respective ultimate parent entity) will each file or cause to be filed with the Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") and the United States Department of Justice (" _DOJ_ ") the notification and report form and any supplemental information requested in connection with such notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The parties will consult with each other as to the appropriate time of filing such notifications and will use their commercially reasonable efforts to make such filings at such time, to respond promptly to any requests for additional information made by either of such agencies, and to cause the waiting periods under the HSR Act to terminate or expire at the earliest possible date after the date of filing. Buyer agrees to pay all filing fees associated with such HSR filings.

cooperate with Buyers efforts in this regard and assist in any transfer or

 (h) Buyer will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all necessary corporate authority, as set forth on _Schedule 6.2_, to consummate the transactions described in this Agreement (including, if required, _Section 7.20_ hereof).

 (i) Buyer and Seller acknowledge that the Acquired Assets are intended to include certain 34.5 sub-transmission lines to the extent owned by Seller and associated with the Green Valley hydroelectric facility owned by an Affiliate of Seller. The transfer of such sub-transmission lines may require the approval of the FERC to a modification of the license for such hydroelectric facility. Seller will use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such license modification, however, if the necessary approvals have not been obtained prior to Closing, such sub-transmission lines will be retained by Seller until necessary FERC approvals have been obtained at which time such sub-transmission lines will be transferred to Buyer. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, such approvals shall not be conditions to Closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (other than the transfer of such sub-transmission lines) and the payment of the Final Purchase Price related to these sub-transmission lines shall be deferred until the transfer is made by Seller to Buyer. 

  

 7.4 _Further Assurances_. 

  

 (a) From time to time after the Closing, without further consideration, Seller will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such documents to Buyer as Buyer may reasonably request in order to vest more effectively in Buyer Sellers right, title and interest in and to the Acquired Assets. From time to time after the date of this Agreement, Buyer will, at its own expense, execute and deliver such documents to Seller as Seller may reasonably request in order to consummate more effectively the assumption of the Assumed Obligations pursuant to this Agreement. 

  

 (b) If after the Closing Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the one hand, or Buyer or any of its Affiliates, on the other hand (as applicable, the " _Receiving Party_ "), receives any funds that, pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, belong to the other party (the " _Entitled Party_ "), the Receiving Party shall hold such funds in trust for, and immediately pay over such funds to, the Entitled Party. 

  

 (c) (i) To the extent that Sellers rights under any Acquired Asset may not be assigned without the consent of another Person which consent has not been obtained by the Closing Date, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same, if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach of contract or be unlawful. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (ii) Seller agrees that if any Acquired Asset is not assigned on or before the Closing Date, Seller, at Buyers option and to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Laws and contractual obligations related to such Acquired Asset, will, after the Closing Date, appoint Buyer to be Sellers agent for such Acquired Asset, or to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Laws and such contractual obligations, enter into such reasonable arrangements with Buyer or take such other actions as are necessary to provide Buyer with the same or substantially similar rights and obligations that Seller had immediately prior to Closing as Buyer may reasonably request. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, from and after the Closing, Buyer shall have primary responsibility for obtaining all consents as may be required to transfer the Acquired Assets and Buyer shall use reasonable commercial efforts to obtain all such consents as soon as practicable after Closing; __provided__ , __however__ , Seller will cooperate with Buyer after Closing in connection with Buyers efforts to obtain the relevant assignment to, or consent in favor of, Buyer and upon Buyers providing to Seller reasonable evidence that the necessary consents have been obtained to transfer any Acquired Asset, Seller shall promptly assign such asset to Buyer in accordance with this Agreement. 

  

 (d) To the extent that Sellers rights under any warranty described in _Section 2.1(l)_ may not be assigned without the consent of another Person and such consent has not been obtained on or before the Closing Date, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign the same, if an attempted assignment would constitute a breach thereof, or be unlawful. If any consent to an assignment of any such warranty is not obtained by Closing, or if any attempted assignment would be ineffective or would impair Buyers rights and obligations under the warranty in question, so that Buyer would not in effect acquire the benefit of all such rights and obligations, Seller, at Buyers option and expense, will use commercially reasonable efforts at the cost and expense of Buyer, to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and by such warranty, to enforce such warranty for the benefit of Buyer so as to provide Buyer to the maximum extent possible with the benefits and obligations of such warranty. 

  

 (e) To the extent any party identifies (prior to or after Closing) any Contract (a) that constitutes a Shared Contract in effect as of such time and as of the Closing and (b) is not listed on _Schedule 5.14(b)_, then such party shall promptly notify the other parties of such Contract. The parties shall expeditiously and in good faith negotiate a mutually acceptable arrangement pursuant to which Seller and Buyer share the benefits, liabilities and obligations of each Shared Contract from and after Closing in an equitable manner and title to such contract shall be held by Seller, Buyer or in such other manner as the parties may agree. For the avoidance of doubt, all of the liabilities and obligations under any such Contract that are allocated to Seller shall constitute Retained Obligations and all of the liabilities and obligations allocated to Buyer shall constitute Assumed Obligations. 

  

 (f) Buyer shall cooperate in good faith with SVEC as necessary to give effect to the intent of the parties herein and in the Sister Purchase Agreement with respect to the division of the Sellers VA Distribution Business, including provisions intended to correct any inadvertent errors in such division at Closing and shall, at its own expense, execute and deliver such documents to SVEC as SVEC may reasonably request in order to vest more effectively in SVEC Sellers right, title and interest in and to assets to be transferred to SVEC.

 7.6 _Expenses_. Except to the extent specifically provided herein and except due to any breach, whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Related Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby shall be borne by the party incurring such costs and expenses.

 (b) Except as provided in _Sections 7.7(a)_ and _7.7(h)_ , in respect of Taxes, if any, on or with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Transferred Business, (i) Seller shall be liable and indemnify Buyer for all such Taxes with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, that ends before the Effective Time and (ii) Buyer shall be liable and indemnify Seller for all such Taxes with respect to a taxable period, or portion thereof, that begins as of or after the Effective Time.

   ##### 

  

  

 (d) Subject to this _Section 7.7_, Buyer shall remit to Seller any refund of Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets or Transferred Business to the extent such Taxes are attributable to any taxable period, or portion thereof, ending before the Effective Time, and Seller shall remit to Buyer any refund of Taxes relating to the Acquired Assets or Transferred Business to the extent such Taxes are attributable to any taxable period, or portion thereof, beginning as of or after the Effective Time. Any refund of taxes received by Buyer or Seller that relates to the Straddle Period shall be prorated between the Buyer and the Seller in the manner contemplated by _Section 7.7(h)_. Payments pursuant to this _Section 7.7(d)_ shall be made within thirty (30) calendar days of receipt of the payment. 

  

 (e) (i) Buyer shall notify Seller in writing within sixty (60) days of Buyers receipt of written notice of any federal or state, local or foreign pending or threatened audits, adjustments or assessments (each a " _Tax Audit_ "), which may affect Sellers liability for Taxes. If Buyer fails to give such notice to Seller, Buyer shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to the extent, if any, such failure to give notice precludes Sellers right to effectively participate in the Tax Audit. Seller shall notify Buyer in writing within sixty (60) days of Sellers receipt of written notice of any federal or state, local or foreign pending or threatened Tax Audit, which may affect Buyers liability for Taxes. If Seller fails to give such notice to Buyer, Seller shall not be entitled to indemnification for any Taxes arising in connection with such Tax Audit to the extent, if any, such failure to give notice adversely affects Buyers right to effectively participate in the Tax Audit. 

  

 (ii) If such Tax Audit relates to any Taxes or Tax items for which Seller is liable in full hereunder, Seller shall at its expense control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit,  _ _provided__ , __however__ , Buyer shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Audit at its own expense; 

  

 (iii) If such Tax Audit relates to any Taxes or Tax items for which Buyer is liable in full hereunder, Buyer shall at its expense control the defense and settlement of such Tax Audit,  _ _provided__ , __however__ , Seller shall be entitled to participate in such Tax Audit at its own expense; and

 (f) Any payment by Buyer to Seller or Seller to Buyer pursuant to this _Section 7.7_ will be treated for all purposes by both parties as an adjustment to the Final Purchase Price, unless otherwise required by Law.

 (h) Except as set forth in _Section 7.7(a)_, any Taxes imposed with respect to the Acquired Assets or the Transferred Business with respect to a Straddle Period (including 

   ##### 

  

    

property Taxes) shall be prorated between Seller and Buyer based on the number
of days of ownership during the Straddle Period, with Seller being
responsible for the prorated portion of such Taxes for the period up to and
including the Effective Time and Buyer being responsible for the prorated
portion for the remainder of the Straddle Period. Buyer shall pay to Seller
at Closing its prorated portion of the Taxes attributable to a Straddle
Period or, if such Taxes are not finally determined as of the Closing Date,
an estimate of the prorated portion of such Taxes based on current year
information to the extent available and/or prior year information,
which estimate shall be adjusted to the actual prorated amount at the time
such Taxes are finally determined. Seller shall be responsible for paying the
total amount of the Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period to the
appropriate taxing authorities and shall indemnify Buyer against
liability for such Taxes. 

  

 7.8 _Employees_. 

  

 (a) At least forty-five (45) days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall provide Buyer with an up-to-date list of Employees. Buyer agrees that it shall make an offer of employment to (i) those Employees who, on the Closing Date, are actively at work or on temporary leave for purposes of jury or annual two-week national service/military duty, on vacation or on a regularly scheduled day off from work (" _Eligible Employees_ "), and (ii) to those Employees who, on the Closing Date, are on maternity or paternity leave, military leave with veterans reemployment rights under federal law, leave under the Family Medical Leave Act of 1993, or long-term or short-term disability or medical leave (" _Leave Employees_ "); __provided__ , __however__ , that any offer of employment to, and any employment by Buyer or any of its Affiliates of, an Eligible Employee or a Leave Employee shall be subject to the Closing and to Buyers standard employment requirements, including satisfactory completion of pre-employment background checks and drug screening. Such offers of employment for Eligible Employees and Leave Employees shall be made on or before the Closing Date and (i) as to Eligible Employees, will be effective as of the Effective Time, and (ii) as to Leave Employees, will be effective upon each such Leave Employees return to active employment; _provided_ , that, as to Leave Employees, such return occurs within 12 months after the Effective Time, other than those Employees on military duty or leave. Seller and Buyer shall coordinate the transition of the employment of those Leave Employees who are on vacation as of the Effective Time. Such offers of employment shall be made on substantially the same terms and conditions, including benefits, as exist for similarly-situated employees of Buyer and contain no reduction in base salary or wages for any such offered Employee from the base salary or wages in effect for such Employee with Seller immediately prior to his or her Hire Date (or immediately prior to taking leave from Seller if such offered Employee is a Leave Employee), including the offer to participate in the Buyer Benefit Plans as provided below. Those Eligible Employees and Leave Employees described in this _Section 7.8(a)_ who accept Buyers offer of employment made pursuant to this _Section 7.8(a)_ and become employees of Buyer shall be herein referred to as the " _Transferring Employees_." 

  

 (b) Effective 12:00:00 a.m. as of the date a Transferring Employee becomes employed by Buyer (his or her " _Hire Date_ "), he or she shall cease to participate in the employee welfare benefit plans (as such term is defined in ERISA) maintained or sponsored by Seller or its Affiliates (the " _Prior Welfare Plans_ ") and shall, if applicable, commence to participate in welfare benefit plans of Buyer or its Affiliates (the " _Replacement Welfare Plans_ "). Buyer shall (i) waive 

   ##### 

  

    

all limitations as to pre-existing condition exclusions and waiting periods
with respect to the Transferring Employees under the Replacement Welfare
Plans, other than, but only to the extent of, limitations or waiting periods
that were in effect with respect to such Employees under the Prior Welfare
Plans and that have not been satisfied as of the Hire Date, and (ii) provide
each Transferring Employee with credit for any co-payments and deductibles
paid prior to the Hire Date in satisfying any deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements under the Replacement Welfare Plans (on a pro-rata basis in the
event of a difference in plan years). Seller shall retain all liabilities and
obligations arising under the Prior Welfare Plan whether or not reported prior
to the Effective Time. 

  

 (c) As of his or her Hire Date, each Transferring Employee shall be given credit for all service with Seller and its Affiliates under all employee benefit plans, programs, and arrangements and all fringe benefit plans, programs, and arrangements of Buyer and its Affiliates (" _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") in which they become participants, except as otherwise provided herein;  _ _provided__ , __however__ , that eligibility to participate in any Buyer Benefit Plan shall not be waived if, even with service credit for the period of time any Employee was employed by Seller and its Affiliates, such Employee would not be eligible to participate in such Buyer Benefit Plan. Such service credit shall not affect the treatment of the Hire Date as the date of hire of such Transferring Employee. The service credit given is for purposes of eligibility, vesting and service related level of benefits, but not benefit accrual; provided, however, that eligibility to participate in any Buyer Benefit Plan shall not be waived if, even with service credit for the period of time any Employee was employed by Seller, such Employee would not be eligible to participate in such Buyer Benefit Plan. For the avoidance of doubt, the service credit as to benefit accrual for any Transferring Employee under any defined benefit Benefit Plan of Buyer shall not include any period a Transferring Employee was not employed by Buyer. 

  

 (d) To the extent allowable by applicable Laws and the terms of the relevant Buyer Benefit Plan, Buyer shall take any and all necessary action to cause the trustee of a defined contribution plan of Buyer or one of its Affiliates to accept direct "rollovers" of plan loan notes and cash distributions made to the Transferring Employees who become employed by Buyer from Sellers Employee Stock Ownership and Savings Plan. 

  

 (e) Seller shall be fully responsible for and shall pay any severance benefits, if any, owed under Sellers Separation Allowance Plan or pursuant to the Collective Bargaining Agreement. 

  

 (f) Seller shall provide Buyer with copies of all Transferring Employee Records required to be disclosed by applicable Law, subpoena or legal or regulatory process. 

  

 (g) For the one year period following Closing, Seller agrees to be bound by and comply with the requirements and restrictions in _Section 7.1(d)(i)_; provided, however, that Seller may hire any Transferring Employee after the Effective Time, provided that Buyer either consents to such hire or confirms to Seller that Buyer had terminated the employment of such Transferring Employee after the Effective Time. Seller may also hire or continue to retain, at its discretion, any Employee who does not receive an offer of employment from Buyer on or before the Closing Date. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (h) Buyer and Seller do not anticipate the issuance of any notices pursuant to the WARN Act. Notwithstanding the foregoing, should Buyer becomes aware of any situation that may require a WARN Act notice or other similar notice required under law or contract (" _WARN Notice Requirements_ ") to be given to the Employees prior to Closing, Buyer will immediately notify Seller and direct Seller as to the proper notices to be given and the Employees and other parties to receive such notices. Upon receipt of such notification, Seller will cooperate with Buyer in the issuance of all notices under the WARN Notice Requirements. Should any notice thus given not be timely under the WARN Notice Requirements, Buyer will pay all amounts owed to the Employees or to any other party or Governmental Entity as is required by the WARN Notice Requirements. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall be responsible for performing and discharging all requirements under the WARN Act and under applicable state and local Laws and regulations for the notification of its employees with respect to the Acquired Assets. 

  

 (i) Seller shall not make any payment to any Transferring Employee on or after the Hire Date of such Transferring Employee other than payments for vacation time accrued by such Transferring Employee prior to his or her Hire Date or payments in accordance with Sellers normal payroll practices concerning the timing for the payment of wages earned with Seller prior to the Hire Date, unless such payment is either pursuant to the terms of a Benefit Plan, including any variable pay payable under Sellers variable pay plan, or pursuant to the payment schedule provided to Buyer within forty-five (45) days after the date of this Agreement. Buyer shall upon request from Seller provide Seller with information verifying the continued employment of Transferring Employees with Buyer or its Affiliates. 

  

 (j) Transferring Employees shall receive credit under Buyers vacation policy on their Hire Date equal to their vacation accrued under Sellers vacation policy and thereafter shall accrue additional vacation time on the same basis as similarly situated employees of Buyer. However, if as of a Transferring Employees Hire Date Sellers vacation policy provides a greater number of vacation days in a calendar year to such Transferring Employee, then such Transferring Employee shall be entitled to receive under Buyers vacation policy each year, on and after his or her Hire Date, such number of vacation days that he or she would have received annually under Sellers vacation policy after taking into account such Employees time of service with Seller and its Affiliates, until such time as the Transferring Employee receives a greater number of vacation days in a calendar year under Buyers vacation policy based on such Transferring Employees time of service with Buyer (including such employees time of service with Seller and its Affiliates). 

  

 7.9 _Name of the Transferred Business After the Effective Time_. Promptly (but in any event no more than ninety (90) days after the Effective Time, Buyer shall ensure that the Transferred Business ceases to do business as " _Allegheny Power_ " and will thereafter conduct such business with a name that will not otherwise indicate or imply that Seller or any of its Affiliates have an ownership interest in, or are otherwise associated with or related to, the Transferred Business, Buyer or any of its Affiliates. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall replace pole tags and other identifiers referring to Seller on the Distribution Facilities as reasonably practicable when Buyer performs routine maintenance on the Distribution Facilities in the ordinary course of Buyers operations and the same shall not be subject to the aforementioned ninety (90) day required replacement period. 

   ##### 

  

  

 7.10 _Insurance_. Buyer acknowledges that the Acquired Assets will not be covered by any insurance policy in respect of fire, liability, workers compensation or otherwise following the Effective Time except to the extent Buyer procures any insurance. Accordingly, the parties agree that Buyer will be responsible for procuring insurance in respect of the Acquired Assets from and after the Effective Time (to the extent that Buyer determines that such insurance is desirable). 

  

 7.11 _Certain Notices; Information_. 

  

 (a) Seller shall provide to Buyer within ten (10) Business Days following the filing or receipt by Seller copies of all filings made by Seller with and tariffs received from the Virginia Commission respecting the Transferred Business.

 (d) The expiration, termination or extinguishment of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement shall not affect the parties obligations under this _Section 9.2_ if, prior to such expiration, termination or extinguishment, the Indemnitee provided the Person required to provide indemnification under this Agreement (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") with proper notice of the claim or event for which indemnification is sought pursuant to this _Section 9.2_.

Such notice shall describe the nature of the Third Party Claim in reasonable detail and shall indicate the estimated amount, if practicable, of the Indemnifiable Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnitee. The Indemnifying Party will have the right to participate in or, by giving written notice to the Indemnitee, to elect to assume the defense of any Third Party Claim at such Indemnifying Partys own expense and by such Indemnifying Partys own counsel, and the Indemnitee will cooperate in good faith in such defense at such Indemnitees own expense. 

  

 (b) If within ten (10) days after an Indemnitee provides written notice to the Indemnifying Party of any Third Party Claim the Indemnitee receives written notice from the Indemnifying Party that such Indemnifying Party has elected to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim as provided in the last sentence of _Section 9.3(a)_, the Indemnifying Party will not be liable for any legal expenses subsequently incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with the defense thereof; __provided__ , __however__ , that if the Indemnifying Party fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently such Third Party Claim within twenty (20) days after receiving notice from the Indemnitee that the Indemnitee believes the Indemnifying Party has failed to take such steps, the Indemnitee may assume its own defense, and the Indemnifying Party will be liable for all reasonable expenses thereof. If there is a conflict of interests between Indemnitee and Indemnifying Party, Indemnitee may elect to be represented by its own counsel at Indemnifying Partys expense. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party Claim that would lead to liability or create any financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other obligation on the part of the Indemnitee and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party may accept and agree to such offer in its sole discretion. 

  

 (c) Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss that does not result from a Third Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") will be asserted by giving the 

   ##### 

  

    

Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, stating the
nature of such claim in reasonable detail and indicating the estimated
amount, if practicable. 

  

 (d) If the amount of any Indemnifiable Loss, at any time subsequent to the making of an indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement or otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, the amount of such reduction, less any costs, expenses or premiums incurred in connection therewith (together with interest thereon from the date of payment thereof at the U.S. prime rate then in effect published in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition), will promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any indemnity payment, the Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such indemnity payment, be subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which the indemnity payment relates. Without limiting the generality or effect of any other provision hereof, each such Indemnitee and Indemnifying Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination rights, and otherwise cooperate in the prosecution of such claims at the direction of the Indemnifying Party. Nothing in this _Section 9.3(d)_ shall be construed to require any party hereto to obtain or maintain any insurance coverage. 

  

 (e) A failure to give timely notice as provided in this _Section 9.3_ will not affect the rights or obligations of any party hereunder except if, and only to the extent that, as a result of such failure, the party that was entitled to receive such notice was actually prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 (e) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if a breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement on the part of Buyer set forth in this Agreement shall have occurred which would cause any condition to the obligations of Seller to effect the Closing not to be satisfied or has had or is reasonably expected to have a Buyer Material Adverse Effect, and such breach is incapable of being cured or, if capable of being cured, shall not have been cured within 45 days following receipt by Buyer of notice of such breach from Seller. 

  

 (f) This Agreement may be terminated by Buyer if both (i) within 90 days after the delivery of the test results pursuant to _Section 7.19_ (to the extent Seller has such results) Buyer provides Seller with written notice (together with a copy of the underlying report) that an environmental consulting firm appointed by Buyer and reasonably consented to by Seller estimates that the costs of Remediation for all or any portion of the Owned Real Property, a Transferred Easement or any real property lease to be assumed by Buyer at Closing (using the lowest cost response allowed under Environmental Laws that is consistent with prudent industry practices) are reasonably likely to exceed $1 million, and (ii) Seller shall not have agreed within 90 days after receipt of such notice to reimburse Buyer all of the actual out-of-pocket costs of Remediation in excess of $1 million; __provided__ , __that__ if Seller disagrees with the determination made by such environmental consulting firm of the costs of Remediation, then Seller shall perform such additional investigation, including soil and groundwater sampling and analysis, as shall be reasonably necessary to confirm Sellers estimates or dispute Buyers estimates, and may submit the issue of determining such costs to arbitration in accordance with _Section 11.13_ below. If Seller exercises its right to arbitration regarding such a dispute, Buyer may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(f)_ unless and until the arbitration process and any associated appellate rights have been exhausted and Seller shall have had a 30-day period from the conclusion of such proceedings to make the reimbursement payments (as such costs are actually incurred) or to commit to complete such Remediation as provided in the applicable award. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (g) This Agreement may be terminated by Seller if Buyer shall not have obtained the approval described in _Schedule 6.2_ on or prior to August 25, 2009. 

  

 10.2 _Procedure and Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this Agreement and abandonment of the transactions contemplated hereby by one or more of the parties pursuant to  _Section 10.1_, written notice thereof shall forthwith be given by the terminating party to the other party and this Agreement shall terminate and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned, without further action by any of the parties hereto. If this Agreement is terminated as provided herein: 

  

 (a) Said termination shall be the sole remedy of the parties hereto with respect to breaches of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement and none of the parties hereto nor any of their respective directors, officers, Affiliates or advisors, as the case may be, shall have any liability or further obligation to any other party or any of their respective directors, officers, Affiliates or advisors, as the case may be, pursuant to this Agreement, except in each case as stated in this _Section 10.2_ and in _Sections 7.2(b)_ , _7.5_ and _7.6_ ; __provided__ , __however__ , that no such termination shall relieve any party from any liability arising from the willful or intentional breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination; and 

  

 (b) All filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant to this Agreement, to the extent practicable, shall be withdrawn from the agency or other Person to which they were made.

 11.4 _Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any party hereto, including by operation of law without the prior written consent of the other party. 

  

 11.5 _Rights Under This Agreement; No Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and insure solely to the benefit of the parties hereto. Except as provided in  _Section 9.2_, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights hereunder. 

  

 11.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia as to all matters, including but not limited to matters of validity, construction, effect, performance and remedies. 

  

 11.7 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same instrument. 

  

 11.8 _Interpretation; Construction_. The parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provisions of this Agreement. 

  

 11.9 _Schedules and Exhibits_. All Exhibits and Schedules referred to herein are intended to be and hereby are specifically made a part of this Agreement. The Seller disclosure schedules are collectively referred to herein as the " _Disclosure Schedules_." The Disclosure Schedules constitute an integral part of this Agreement and modify the respective representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller contained herein. Items set forth in any Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to have been disclosed in each other Disclosure Schedule to which the information disclosed therein is responsive or applicable to the extent that it is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure that such disclosure is responsive or applicable thereto. The inclusion of an item does not necessarily mean, and should not be construed as an admission, that the item included will have, or is or would reasonably be expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect or otherwise is material to Seller or the relevant Section of the Agreement; Seller in many instances is disclosing more information than the Agreement requires. 

  

 11.10 _Entire Agreement_.

   ##### 

  

    

referred to herein or therein. It is expressly acknowledged and agreed that
there are no restrictions, promises, representations, warranties, covenants
or undertakings contained in any material made available to Buyer pursuant to
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement (including the Information
Memorandum, dated March 20, 2009, or the Request for Proposal, dated March
20, 2009, previously made available to Buyer by Seller). This Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, whether written or oral,
between the parties with respect to such transactions other than, to the
extent expressly provided herein, the Confidentiality Agreement. 

  

 11.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE RELATED AGREEMENTS OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. 

  

 11.12 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Buyer and Seller submit to the jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in the Commonwealth of Virginia in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement and, subject to Section 11.13 hereof, agree that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court. Buyer and Seller also agree not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of this Agreement in any other court. 

  

 11.13 _Arbitration_. 

  

 (a) Except as otherwise provided herein, and with the exception of the "Post-Closing True-Up" of _Section 3.2_, in the event of any dispute between Seller and Buyer arising after the Closing (whether relating to facts, events or circumstances occurring or existing prior to, on or after the Closing Date), and relating to, resulting from or arising out of any provision of this Agreement, the party asserting such dispute shall give written notice to the other of the fact that a dispute has arisen pursuant hereto. Such notice shall include (i) a statement setting forth in reasonable detail the facts, events, circumstances, evidence and arguments underlying such dispute and (ii) proposed arrangements for a meeting to attempt to resolve the dispute to be held within sixty (60) days after such notice is given. Within thirty (30) days after such notice is given, the other party hereto shall submit to the party giving such notice a written summary responding to such statement of facts, events, circumstances, evidence and arguments contained in the notice and an acceptance of or proposed alternative to the meeting arrangements set forth in the initial notice. 

  

 (b) The chief executive officers (or any other executive officer or officers directly reporting to, or duly designated by, such chief executive officers) of each of the parties shall meet at a mutually acceptable time and place to attempt to settle any dispute in good faith;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such meeting shall be held at the principal offices of the party receiving the notice of dispute unless otherwise agreed; and _provided_   _further_ , that any such meeting shall be held no later than sixty (60) days after the written notice of dispute is given pursuant to paragraph (a) above. Each party shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to preparation for, attendance at and participation in such meeting. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (c) If (i) a meeting has been held in accordance with paragraph (b) above, (ii) any such dispute of the kind referred to in paragraph (a) shall not have been resolved at such meeting, and (iii) the aggregate amount in dispute exceeds $50,000, then either party may submit such dispute to binding arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules and procedures for Large, Complex Commercial Disputes of the American Arbitration Association (the " _Commercial Arbitration Rules_ "). In the event that such dispute is submitted to arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration Rules, then the arbitration tribunal shall be composed of three arbitrators (one arbitrator selected by each party within thirty (30) days after the meeting held in accordance with paragraph (b) above with the third selected by the other two arbitrators or, in the absence of agreement between them, the American Arbitration Association), the venue of the arbitration shall be Washington, D.C., the language of the arbitration shall be English, the decision shall be made in writing and be made under the applicable U.S. Federal or Commonwealth of Virginia substantive law, and the arbitration shall commence no later than sixty (60) days after the meeting held in accordance with paragraph (b) above. The decision, judgment and order of the arbitration tribunal shall be final, binding and conclusive as to the parties and their respective Representatives, and may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties intend that the provisions of this _Section 11.13_ will apply to all disputes arising out of this Agreement. Other than the fees and expenses of the arbitrators, which shall be shared equally by the parties, each party shall bear its own costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) relating to the arbitration. Punitive, special or exemplary damages shall not be recoverable in the arbitration and the panel shall not have the power to award punitive, special or exemplary damages or to find that this limitation is waived or inapplicable, regardless of whether a court so finds under the applicable Law. 

  

 (d) All arbitration proceedings under this _Section 11.13_, including all communications, proceedings, decisions, or awards relating to any such arbitration, shall be kept strictly confidential, shall not be subject to disclosure except as may be required by Law, or for the provisions of professional advice to which the arbitration is relevant, and shall not be used as evidence in any judicial or administrative proceeding, except in connection with any application for confirmation, modification, vacation, or entry of judgment on the award to which the communications or proceedings relate. 

  

 11.14 _Certain Remedies_. Each Party agrees that the remedy at law for any breach or threatened breach by it of any of the covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement will be inadequate and that in the event of such breach or threatened breach each of such provisions shall be specifically enforceable against the breaching Party by injunction, judgment or other court order, temporary or, permanent or both. Nothing in this Section shall limit the remedies available at law or in equity for any such breach or threatened breach of any of such provisions, and judicial remedies available pursuant to this Section shall be cumulative and not exclusive of any other judicial remedies otherwise available; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Party shall have any right to rescind this Agreement as a result of the breach or default of any other Party hereunder, and any and all rights of rescission are hereby waived.
