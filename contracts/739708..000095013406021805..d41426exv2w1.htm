 (a) _Cancellation of Company Securities_. Each share of the Companys common stock, par value $0.10 per share (the " _Company Common Stock_ "), held by the Company as treasury stock or held by Mergerco immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be cancelled, retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration or payment shall be delivered in exchange therefor or in respect thereof. 

   

 (b) _Conversion of Company Securities_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_ hereof, Dissenting Shares and Rollover Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $37.60 plus the Additional Per Share Consideration, if any, in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Each share of Company Common Stock to be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in this _Section 3.01(b)_ shall be automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and the holders of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") or book-entry shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such Company Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such Company Common Stock other than the right to receive, upon surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance with _Section 3.02_ of this Agreement, the Merger Consideration. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Mergerco Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, each share of common stock, par value $0.001 per share, of Mergerco (the " _Mergerco Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable shares of the Surviving Corporation (with the relative rights and preferences described in an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation adopted as of the Effective Time as provided in _Section 2.04_, the " _Surviving Corporation Common Stock_ "). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Mergerco Common Stock cancelled in accordance with this  _Section 3.01(c)_, when so cancelled, shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such shares of Mergerco Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock as set forth in this _Section 3.01(c)_. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the number of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall occur as a result of a reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a reverse stock split), or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend or stock distribution with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(b)_ shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change (including, without limitation, to provide holders of shares of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such transaction). 

   

 Section 3.02 Exchange of Certificates. 

  

 (a) _Designation of Paying Agent; Deposit of Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Parents shall designate a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company for the payment of the Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 3.01(b)_. On the Closing Date, promptly following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit, or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent for the benefit of holders of shares of Company Common Stock, cash amounts in immediately available funds constituting an amount equal to the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration plus the Total Option Cash Payments (the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ ") (exclusive of any amounts in respect of Dissenting Shares, the Rollover Shares and Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to _Section 3.01(a)_) (such amount as deposited with the Paying Agent, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). In the event the Exchange Fund shall be insufficient to make the payments contemplated by _Section 3.01(b)_ and _Section 3.03_, the Surviving Corporation shall promptly deposit, or cause to be deposited, additional funds with the Paying Agent in an amount which is equal to the deficiency in the amount required to make such payment. The Paying Agent shall cause the Exchange Fund to be (A) held for the benefit of the holders of Company Common Stock and Company Options, and (B) applied promptly to making the payments pursuant to _Section 3.02(b)_ hereof. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any purpose that is not expressly provided for in this Agreement. 

   

 (b) _Delivery of Shares_. As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time and in any event not later than the second business day after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) (i) to each holder of record of a Certificate or Book-Entry Share, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock (x) a letter of transmittal, which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, as applicable, shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof pursuant to _Section 3.04_ hereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent and which shall be in the form and have such other provisions as Mergerco and the Company may reasonably specify and (y) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares shall have been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide that at the election of the surrendering holder, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares may be surrendered, and the Merger Consideration in exchange therefor collected, by hand delivery); and (ii) to each holder of a Company Option, a check in an amount due and   ##### 

  

  

  

payable to such holder pursuant to _Section 3.03_ hereof in respect of such
Company Option. If payment of the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration is made to a person other than the person in whose name the
surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition of payment
that (A) the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (B) the person requesting
such payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason
of the payment of the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this  _Section
3.02_, each Certificate, Book-Entry Share or option certificate, as
applicable, shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive the applicable portion of the Aggregate Merger
Consideration or Option Cash Payments, as applicable, in cash as contemplated
by this _Section 3.02_ or _Section 3.03_ without interest thereon. 

   

 (c) _Surrender of Shares_. Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with a letter of transmittal duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, to be mailed (or made available for collection by hand if so elected by the surrendering holder) within five (5) business days following the later to occur of (i) the Effective Time; or (ii) the Paying Agents receipt of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share, and the Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Share so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares upon compliance with such reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an orderly exchange thereof in accordance with normal exchange practices. No interest shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares on the Merger Consideration (or the cash pursuant to _Section 3.02(b)_) payable upon the surrender of the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 

   

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates, Book-Entry Shares or Company Options for twelve (12) months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any such holders prior to the Merger who have not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation, as general creditors thereof for payment of their claim for cash, without interest, to which such holders may be entitled. If any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to one (1) year after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such earlier date on which any cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Authority), any such cash in respect of such Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, subject to any and all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

    #####

 Section 3.03 Stock Options and Other Awards 

  

 (a) _Company Options_. As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by the Parents and a holder of Company Options with respect to such holders Company Options, each Company Option, whether vested or unvested, shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any holder of any Company Option, become fully vested and converted into the right at the Effective Time to receive, as promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, a cash payment (less applicable withholding taxes and without interest) with respect thereto equal to the product of (a) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Company Option multiplied by (b) the number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option (the " _Option Cash Payment_ " and the sum of all such payments, the " _Total Option Cash Payments_ "). In the event that the exercise price of any Company Option is equal to or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Company Option shall be cancelled without payment therefor and have no further force or effect. Except for the Company Options set forth in Section 3.03(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, as of the Effective Time, all Company Options shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a Company Option shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Option Cash Payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take any and all actions reasonably necessary to effectuate this _Section 3.03(a)_, including, without limitation, providing holders of Company Options with notice of their rights with respect to any such Company Options as provided herein. 

   

 (b) _Other Awards_. As of the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by the Parents and a holder of Restricted Shares with respect to such holders Restricted Shares, each share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time subject to vesting or other lapse restrictions pursuant to any Company Option Plan or an applicable restricted stock agreement (each, a " _Restricted Share_ ") which is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall vest and become free of restriction as of the Effective Time and shall, as of the Effective Time,   ##### 

  

  

  

be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
in accordance with  _Section 3.01(b)_. 

   

 (c) _Amendments to and Termination of Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to make any amendments to the terms of the Company Option Plans and to obtain any consents from holders of Company Options and Restricted Shares that, in each case, are necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by _Section 3.03(a)_ and _Section 3.03(b)_. Without limiting the foregoing the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Company will not at the Effective Time be bound by any options, stock appreciation rights, warrants or other rights or agreements which would entitle any person, other than the holders of the capital stock (or equivalents thereof) of the Parents, Mergerco and their respective subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof. In furtherance of the foregoing, and subject to applicable Law and agreements existing between the Company and the applicable person, the Company shall explicitly condition any new awards or grants to any person under its Company Option Plans, annual bonus plans and other incentive plans upon such persons consent to the amendments described in this  _Section 3.03(c)_ and, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, shall withhold payment of the Merger Consideration to or require payment of the exercise price for all Company Options by any holder of a Company Option as to which the Merger Consideration exceeds the amount of the exercise price per share under such option unless such holder consents to all of the amendments described in this _Section 3.03(c)_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all Company Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at or before the Effective Time. 

   

 (d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_ , The Board of Directors of the Company shall terminate all purchases of stock under the Companys 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") effective as of the day immediately after the end of the month next following the date hereof, and no additional offering periods shall commence under the Company ESPP after the date hereof. The Company shall terminate the Company ESPP in its entirety immediately prior to the Closing Date, and all shares held under such plan, other than Rollover Shares, shall be delivered to the participants and shall, as of the Effective Time, be cancelled and converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section 3.01(b)_. 

   

 Section 3.04 Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article III_. 

  

 Section 3.05 Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding _Section 3.01(b)_ hereof, to the extent that holders thereof are entitled to appraisal rights under Article 5.12 of the TBCA, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has properly exercised and perfected his or her demand for appraisal rights under Article 5.12 of the TBCA (the " _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right 

   ##### 

  

    

to receive the Merger Consideration, but the holders of such Dissenting
Shares shall be entitled to receive such consideration as shall be determined
pursuant to Article 5.12 of the TBCA (and at the Effective Time, such
Dissenting Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive such consideration
as shall be determined pursuant to Article 5.12 of the TBCA); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if any such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost his or her right to appraisal and payment
under the TBCA, such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon
be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon, and such
shares shall not be deemed to be Dissenting Shares. Any payments required to
be made with respect to the Dissenting Shares shall be made by the
Surviving Corporation (and not the Company, Mergerco or either Parent) and
the Aggregate Merger Consideration shall be reduced, on a dollar for dollar
basis, as if the holder of such Dissenting Shares had not been a shareholder
on the Closing Date. The Company shall give the Parents notice of all
demands for appraisal and the Parents shall have the right to participate in
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to all holders of Dissenting
Shares. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the
Parents, voluntarily make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any demand for payment from any holder of Dissenting Shares. 

  

 Section 3.06 Transfers; No Further Ownership Rights. After the Effective Time, there shall be no registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer following the Effective Time, they shall be cancelled against delivery of the Merger Consideration, as provided for in _Section 3.01(b)_ hereof, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates. 

  

 Section 3.07 Withholding. Each of the Paying Agent, the Company, Mergerco and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from payments otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement any amounts as they are respectively required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 Section 3.08 Rollover by Shareholders. At the Effective Time, each Rollover Share issued and outstanding immediately before the Effective Time shall be cancelled and be converted into and become the number of validly issued shares of equity securities of the Surviving Corporation calculated in accordance with Section 3.08 of the Mergerco Disclosure Schedule. As of the Effective Time, all such Rollover Shares when so cancelled, shall no longer be issued and outstanding and shall automatically cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate representing any such Rollover Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the shares of equity securities of the Surviving Corporation as set forth in this  _Section 3.08_. 

  

 Section 3.09 Additional Per Share Consideration. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) No later than ten (10) business days before the Closing Date, if the Closing Date shall occur after the Additional Consideration Date, the Company shall prepare and deliver to the Parents a good faith estimate of Additional Per Share Consideration, together with reasonably detailed supporting information (the " _Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration_ "). 

   

 (b) Before and after the delivery of the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement, the Company shall provide the Parents reasonable access to the records and employees of the Company and its subsidiaries, and the Company shall, and shall cause the employees of the Company and its subsidiaries to, (i) cooperate in all reasonable respects with the Parents in connection with the Parents review of the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement and (ii) provide the Parents with access to accounting records, supporting schedules and relevant information relating to the Companys preparation of the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement and calculation of Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration as the Parents shall reasonably request and that are available to the Company or its affiliates. Within five (5) business days after delivery of the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement to the Parents, the Parents may notify the Company that they disagree with the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement. Such notice shall set forth, to the extent practicable, in reasonable detail the particulars of such disagreement. If the Parents do not provide a notice of disagreement within such five (5) business day period, then the Parents shall be deemed to have accepted the calculations and the amounts set forth in the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement delivered by the Company, which shall then be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. If any notice of disagreement is timely provided in accordance with this _Section 3.09(b)_, then the Company and the Parents shall each use commercially reasonable efforts for a period of one (1) business day thereafter (the " _Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration Resolution Period_ ") to resolve any disagreements with respect to the calculations in the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement. 

   

 (c) If, at the end of the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration Resolution Period, the Company and the Parents are unable to resolve any disagreements as to items in the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement, then KPMG, LLP (New York Office) (or such other independent accounting firm of recognized national standing in the United States as may be mutually selected by the Company and the Parents) shall resolve any remaining disagreements. If neither KPMG, LLP (New York Office) nor any such mutually selected accounting firm is willing and able to serve in such capacity, then the Parents shall deliver to the Company a list of three other accounting firms of recognized national or international standing and the Company shall select one of such three accounting firms (such firm as is ultimately selected pursuant to the aforementioned procedures being the " _Accountant_ "). The Accountant shall be charged with determining as promptly as practicable, whether the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration as set forth in the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration statement was prepared in accordance with this Agreement and (only with respect to the disagreements as to the items set forth in the notice of disagreement and submitted to the Accountant) whether and to what extent, if any, the Estimated Additional Per Share Consideration requires adjustment. 

    ##### 

  

     

 (d) The Accountant shall allocate its costs and expenses between the Parents (on behalf of Mergerco) and the Company based upon the percentage of the contested amount submitted to the Accountant that is ultimately awarded to the Company, on the one hand, or the Parents, on the other hand, such that the Company bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to the Parents (such portion of such costs and expenses, the " _Company Accountant Expense_ ") and the Parents (on behalf of Mergerco) bear a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to the Company. The determination of the Accountant shall be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes hereunder. 

   

 (e) In order to permit the parties to prepare for an orderly Closing, the Company will deliver monthly reports calculating the previous months Operating Cash Flow on or before the 20th day of each month starting January 15, 2007 (with respect to performance during December 2006) and will provide the Parents with access to accounting records, supporting schedules and relevant information relating to the Companys preparation thereof as the Parents shall reasonably request and that are available to the Company or its affiliates.

the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary

which they were made, not misleading. The Proxy Statement will comply in
all material respects with the provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder. 

   

 (b) _Covenants of the Parents with Respect to the Proxy Statement_. None of the information with respect to the Parents, Mergerco or their respective subsidiaries specifically provided in writing by the Parents or any person authorized to act on their behalf for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will, at the time of the mailing of the Proxy Statement or any amendments or supplements thereto, and at the time of the Shareholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. 

   

 (c) _Cooperation_. The Company and the Parents shall cooperate and consult with each other in preparation of the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Parents will furnish to the Company the information relating to it required by the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder to be set forth in the Proxy Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary stated above, prior to filing and mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the party responsible for filing or mailing such document shall provide the other party an opportunity to review and comment on such document or response and shall discuss with the other party and include in such document or response, comments reasonably and promptly proposed by the other party.

misleading, such party shall promptly inform the other. Each of the Parents
and the Company agree to correct any information provided by it for use in

Section 6.05 Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings. 

   

 (a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, the parties hereto will use their respective reasonable best efforts to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated hereby and to cause the conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article VII_ to be satisfied, including (i) in the case of the Parents, the obtaining of all necessary approvals under any applicable communication Laws required in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any obligations of the Parents in accordance with _Section 6.05(b)_; (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or non-actions, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities or other persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Authorities if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Authority or other persons necessary in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this 

    ##### 

  

    

Agreement or the consummation of the transactions performed or consummated by
such party in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, including seeking
to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other
Governmental Authority vacated or reversed; and (iv) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and
other transactions to be performed or consummated by such party in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement and to fully carry out the purposes of this
Agreement. Each of the parties hereto shall promptly (in no event later than
fifteen (15) business days following the date that this Agreement is
executed) make its respective filings, and thereafter make any other required
submissions under the HSR Act and any applicable non-U.S. competition or
antitrust Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Parents and the Company shall cooperate to prepare such applications as may
be necessary for submission to the FCC in order to obtain the FCC Consent
(the " _FCC Applications_ ") and shall promptly (in no event later
than thirty (30) business days following the date that this Agreement is
executed) file such FCC Applications with the FCC. Said FCC Applications
shall specify that Mergerco, or any person having an attributable ownership
interest in Mergerco as defined for purposes of applying the FCC
Media Ownership Rules (" _Attributable Investor_ "), shall render non-
attributable all interests in any assets or businesses which would conflict
with the FCC Media Ownership Rules (including, without limitation, the equity
debt plus rules) if such interests were held by Mergerco or any
Attributable Investor following the Effective Time, including, without
limitation, any such interest that Mergerco or any Attributable Investor is
or may become obligated to acquire (the " _Attributable Interest_ "). The
Parents shall, and the Parents shall cause each Attributable Investor to,
(i) render non-attributable under the FCC Media Ownership Rules each
Attributable Interest, and (ii) not acquire or enter into any agreement to
acquire any Attributable Interest, and not permit to exist any interest that
conflicts with the FCCs alien ownership rules. The action required by clause
(i) above shall be completed not later than the Effective Time. The parties
shall diligently take, or cooperate in the taking of, all necessary,
desirable and proper actions, and provide any additional information,
reasonably required or requested by the FCC. Each of the Parents and the
Company will keep the other informed of any material communications (including
any meeting, conference or telephonic call) and will provide the other copies
of all correspondence between it (or its advisors) and the FCC and each of
the Parents and the Company will permit the other to review any material
communication relating to the FCC Applications to be given by it to the FCC.
Each of the Parents and the Company shall notify the other in the event it
becomes aware of any other facts, actions, communications or occurrences that
might directly or indirectly affect the Parents or the Companys intent or
ability to effect prompt FCC approval of the FCC Applications. The Parents
and the Company shall oppose any petitions to deny or other objections filed
with respect to the FCC Applications and any requests for reconsideration or
judicial review of the FCC Consent. Each of the Parents and the Company
agrees not to, and shall not permit any of their respective subsidiaries to,
take any action that would reasonably be expected to materially delay,
materially impede or prevent receipt of the FCC Consent. The fees required by
the FCC for the filing of the FCC Applications shall be borne one-half by the
Parents (on behalf of Mergerco) and one-half by the Company 

   

 (b) The Parents agree to take promptly any and all steps necessary to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any antitrust, competition or communications or broadcast Law (including the FCC Media Ownership Rules) that may be required by any U.S. federal, state or local or any applicable non-U.S. antitrust or competition Governmental Authority, or by the FCC or similar Governmental Authority, in each case with 

    ##### 

  

    

competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties to close the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable, including
committing to or effecting, by consent decree, hold separate orders,
trust, or otherwise, the Divestiture of such assets or businesses as are
required to be divested in order to obtain the FCC Consent, or to avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of or vacate or lift, any Order, that
would otherwise have the effect of preventing or materially delaying
the consummation of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section
6.05_, if the FTC or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department
of Justice has not granted the necessary approvals under the HSR Act of the
date that is nine (9) months following the date hereof, then, if the
respective antitrust counsel to the Company and the Parents, in consultation
with each other and in the exercise of their professional judgment, jointly
determine that a Divestiture (as defined below) is required to obtain the
necessary approvals under the HSR Act, they shall provide written notice of
such determination to the Parents and the Company (the " _Divestiture Notice_
"). Upon receipt of the Divestiture Notice, the Parents shall promptly, and in
any event within twelve (12) months, implement or cause to be implemented a
Divestiture. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Divestiture_ " of any asset
or business shall mean (i) any sale, transfer, separate holding, divestiture
or other disposition, or any prohibition of, or any limitation on, the
acquisition, ownership, operation, effective control or exercise of full
rights of ownership, of such asset; or (ii) the termination or amendment of
any existing or contemplated Mergercos or Companys governance structure or
contemplated Mergercos or Companys contractual or governance rights.
Further, and for the avoidance of doubt, the Parents will take any and all
actions necessary in order to ensure that (x) no requirement for any non-
action, consent or approval of the FTC, the Antitrust Division of the United
States Department of Justice, any authority enforcing applicable antitrust,
competition, communications Laws, any State Attorney General or
other governmental authority, (y) no decree, judgment, injunction, temporary
restraining order or any other order in any suit or proceeding, and (z) no
other matter relating to any antitrust or competition Law or any
communications Law, would preclude consummation of the Merger by
the Termination Date. 

   

 (c) Each of the Parents and the Company shall give (or shall cause its respective subsidiaries to give) any notices to third parties, and the Parents and the Company shall use, and cause each of its subsidiaries to use, its reasonable best efforts to obtain any third party consents not covered by paragraphs (a) and (b) above, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of the parties hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority, including immediately informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority, and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings or communications between either party and any Governmental Authority with respect to this Agreement. 

   

 (d) In order to avoid disruption or delay in the processing of the FCC Applications, the Parents and the Company agree, as part of the FCC Applications, to request that the FCC apply its policy permitting license assignments and transfers in transactions involving multiple markets to proceed, notwithstanding the pendency of one or more license renewal applications. The Parents and the Company agree to make such representations and 

    ##### 

  

    

undertakings as necessary or appropriate to invoke such policy, including
undertakings to assume the position of applicant with respect to any pending
license renewal applications, and to assume the risks relating to such
applications. The Parents and the Company acknowledge that license renewal
applications (each, a " _Renewal Application_ ") may be pending before the
FCC with respect to the Company Stations (each, a " _Renewal Station_ "). To
the extent reasonably necessary to expedite grant of a Renewal Application,
and thereby facilitate grant of the FCC Applications, the Parents and the
Company shall enter into tolling agreements with the FCC with respect to the
relevant Renewal Application as necessary or appropriate to extend the
statute of limitations for the FCC to determine or impose a
forfeiture penalty against such Renewal Station in connection with any
pending complaints, investigations, letters of inquiry, or other proceedings,
including, but not limited to, complaints that such Renewal Station
aired programming that contained obscene, indecent or profane material (a "
_Tolling Agreement_ "). The Parents and the Company shall consult in good
faith with each other prior to entering into any such Tolling Agreement.
Section 6.05(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth all main
radio and television stations owned by the Company with Renewal Applications
pending as of the date of this Agreement. 

   

 Section 6.06 Access to Information; Confidentiality. 

  

 (a) From the date hereof to the Effective Time or the date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 8.01_, except as otherwise prohibited by applicable Law or the terms of any contract entered into prior to the date hereof or as would reasonably be expected to violate or result in a loss or impairment of any attorney-client or work product privilege (it being understood that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not result in such violation, loss or impairment), the Company shall and shall cause each of its subsidiaries to (i) provide to the Parents (and their respective officers, directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, permitted financing sources, agents and other representatives (collectively, the " _Representatives_ ")) reasonable access during normal business hours to the Companys and Material Subsidiaries officers, employees, offices and other facilities, properties, books, contracts and records and other information as the Parents may reasonably request regarding the business, assets, liabilities, employees and other aspects of the Company and its subsidiaries; (ii) permit the Parents to make copies and inspections thereof as the Parents may reasonably request; and (iii) furnish promptly to the Parents such information concerning the business, properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the Company and its subsidiaries as the Parents or their respective Representatives may reasonably request. In addition, during such period, the Company shall provide the Parents and their respective Representatives copies of the unaudited monthly consolidated balance sheet of the Company for the month then ended and related statements of earnings, and cash flows in the form and promptly following such time as they are provided or made available to the Senior Executives. 

   

 (b) The parties shall comply with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective obligations under the Confidentiality Agreements. 

   

 Section 6.07 No Solicitation of Competing Proposal. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, commencing on the date of this Agreement and continuing until 11:59 p.m., Eastern Standard Time, on December 7, 2006 (the " _No-Shop Period Start Date_ "), the Company and its subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall have the right to directly or indirectly (i) initiate, solicit and encourage Competing Proposals from third parties, including by way of providing access to non-public information to such third parties in connection therewith; _provided_ , that the Company shall enter into confidentiality agreements with any such third parties and shall promptly provide to the Parents any material non-public information concerning the Company or its subsidiaries that is provided to any such third party which has not been previously provided to the Parents; and (ii) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding, and take any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal that constitutes, or may reasonably be expected to lead to, a Competing Proposal.

 (c) Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in _Section 6.07(b)_, from the date hereof and prior to the receipt of Requisite Shareholder Approval, if the Company receives any written Competing Proposal which the Board of Directors of the Company believes in good faith to be bona fide and did not result from a breach of _Section 6.07(b)_, (i) which the Board of Directors of the Company determines, after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal; or (ii) which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with the Companys outside legal and financial advisors could reasonably be expected to result, after the taking of any of the actions referred to in either of clause (x) or (y) below, in a Superior Proposal, the Company may, subject to compliance with  _Section 6.07(h), t_ake the following actions: (x) furnish information to the third party making such Competing Proposal, provided the Company receives from the third party an executed confidentiality agreement (the terms of which are substantially similar to, and no less favorable to the Company, in the aggregate, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreements) and (y) engage in discussions or negotiations with the third party with respect to the Competing Proposal;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall promptly provide the Parents any non-public information concerning the Company or any of its subsidiaries that is provided to the third party making such Competing Proposal or its Representatives which was not previously provided to the Parents.

 _Section 8.02(a)_; and  _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of
Directors of the Company may not effect a Change of Recommendation pursuant

conditions of any such Superior Proposal (including the identity of the party
making such Superior Proposal) and shall have contemporaneously provided a
copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making
such Superior Proposal and other material documents and (ii) the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to make a Change of
Recommendation in connection with the Superior Proposal could be reasonably
likely to violate the Companys Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law, and (iii) the Company shall have promptly notified the
Parents in writing of the determinations described in clause (ii) above, and
(iv) following the expiration of the Notice Period, and taking into account
any revised proposal made by the Parents since commencement of the Notice
Period, the Board of Directors of the Company has determined in good faith,

remains a Superior Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that during such
Notice Period the Company shall in good faith negotiate with the Parents, to
the extent the Parents wish to negotiate, to enable the Parents to make such
proposed changes to the terms of this Agreement, provided, further, that in

Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors of the Company shall, in each case
deliver to the Parents an additional notice, and the Notice Period shall
recommence; (v) the Company is in compliance, in all material respects, with

The Company agrees that it shall not and shall cause the Companys subsidiaries not to enter into any confidentiality agreement or other agreement with any person subsequent to the date of this Agreement which prohibits the Company from providing such information to the Parents. The Company agrees that neither it nor any of its subsidiaries shall terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision or any existing standstill or confidentiality agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a party and that it and its subsidiaries shall enforce the provisions of any such agreement, unless failure by the Board of Directors of the Company to take such action could reasonably be expected to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 (h) As used in this Agreement, " _Competing Proposal_ " shall mean any proposal or offer (including any proposal from or to the Companys shareholders from any person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) other than the Parents, Mergerco and their respective subsidiaries relating to: (i) any direct or indirect acquisition or purchase, in any single transaction or series of related transactions, by any such person or group acting in concert, of 15% or more of the fair market value of the assets, issued and outstanding Company Common Stock or other ownership interests of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or to which 15% or more of the Companys and its subsidiaries net revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are attributable; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer (including through the filing with the SEC of a Schedule TO), as defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that if consummated, would result in any person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of the Company Common Stock; or (iii) any merger, consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, issuance of or amendment to the terms of outstanding stock or other securities, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving the Company as a result of which any person or group acting in concert would acquire assets, securities or businesses described in clause (i) above.

    ##### 

  

    

proposed by the Parents in writing and the conditionality and likelihood of
consummation of the Superior Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 6.08(b)_ or elsewhere in this Agreement, neither Mergerco nor the Surviving Corporation shall (and Mergerco shall cause the Surviving Corporation not to) settle or compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment or otherwise seek termination with respect to any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation for which indemnification may be sought under this _Section 6.08(b)_ unless such settlement, compromise, consent or termination includes an unconditional release of all Indemnitees from all liability arising out of such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation. The Surviving Corporation shall be entitled, but not obligated to, participate in the defense and settlement of any such matter;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement agreed to or effected without the Surviving Corporations written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) upon reasonable prior notice and an opportunity to participate in the discussions concerning such settlement; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated pursuant to this _Section 6.08(b)_ to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel

actual material conflict of interest in such action. 

   

 (c) At the Companys election in consultation with the Parents, (i) the Company shall obtain prior to the Effective Time "tail" insurance policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from the Effective Time with respect to directors and officers liability insurance in amount and scope no less favorable than the existing policy of the Company for claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or prior to the Effective Time at a cost that does not exceed 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for DandO Insurance (as defined below); or (ii) if the Company shall not have obtained such tail policy, the Parents will provide, or cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, for a period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys directors and officers insurance and indemnification policy with an insurance and indemnification policy that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (the " _D andO Insurance_") that is no less favorable, taken as a whole, than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage, _provided_ , _however_ , that the Parents and the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance;  _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Parents or the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount. 

   

 (d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.08_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.08_. The provisions of this _Section 6.08_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee, his or her successors, heirs or representatives.

In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall succeed to the obligations set forth in this _Section 6.08_.

exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived
for such employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent as
under the applicable Company Benefit Plan, and the Parents shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents under an Company Benefit Plan

employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as if
such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. 

   

 (d) Following the Effective Time, the Parents shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to honor all collective bargaining agreements by which the Company or any of its subsidiaries is bound in accordance with their terms.

 (b) shall not acquire or make any investment in any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, other business organization or any division thereof that holds, or has an attributable interest in, any license, authorization, permit or approval issued by the FCC if such acquisition or investment would delay, impede or prevent receipt of the FCC Consent; and 

    #####

Upon and from and after each such event, the term " _Debt Financing_ " as used herein shall be deemed to mean the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters that are not so superseded at the time in question and the New Debt Financing Commitments  to the extent then in effect. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Marketing Period_ " 

    ##### 

  

    

shall mean the first period of twenty-five (25) consecutive business days
throughout which (A) the Parents shall have the Required Financial
Information that the Company is required to provide the Parents pursuant to

_Section 7.02_ (other than _Section 7.02(c)_) shall be satisfied and
nothing has occurred and no condition exists that would cause any of the
conditions set forth in _Section 7.02_ (other than  _Section 7.02(c)_) to
fail to be satisfied assuming the Closing were to be scheduled for any time
during such twenty-five (25) consecutive business day period; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to August
17, 2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than September 4,
2007 or if the Marketing Period has not ended on or prior to December 14,
2007, the Marketing Period shall commence no earlier than January 7, 2008.
The Parents shall (x) furnish complete and correct and executed copies of
the Financing Agreements promptly upon their execution, (y) give the Company
prompt notice of any material breach by any party of any of the Financing
Commitments, any New Debt Financing Commitment or the Financing Arrangements
of which the Parents become aware or any termination thereof, and

Parents efforts to arrange the Financing (or any replacement thereof). 

   

 (b) The Company shall, and shall cause its subsidiaries, and their respective officers, employees, consultants and advisors, including legal and accounting of the Company and its subsidiaries at the Parents sole expense, to cooperate in connection with the arrangement of the Financing as may be reasonably requested in advance written notice to the Company provided by the Parents (provided that such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its subsidiaries or otherwise impair, in any material respect, the ability of any officer or executive of the Company or Outdoor Holdings to carry out their duties to the Company and to Outdoor Holdings, respectively). Such cooperation by the Company shall include, at the reasonable request of the Parents, (i) agreeing to enter into such agreements, and to execute and deliver such officers certificates (which in the good faith determination of the person executing the same shall be accurate), including certificates of the chief financial officer of the Company or any subsidiary with respect to solvency matters and as are customary in financings of such type, and agreeing to pledge, grant security interests in, and otherwise grant liens on, the Companys assets pursuant to such agreements, provided that no obligation of the Company under any such agreement, pledge or grant shall be effective until the Effective Time; (ii) (x) preparing business projections, financial statements, pro forma statements and other financial data and pertinent information of the type required by Regulation S-X and Regulation S-K under the Securities Act and of the type and form customarily included in private placements resold under Rule 144A of the Securities Act to consummate the offerings of debt securities contemplated by the Financing Commitments, all as may be reasonably requested by the Parents and (y) delivery of audited consolidated financial statements of the Company and its consolidated subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2007, as appropriate (together with the materials in clause (x), the " _Required Financial Information_ "), which Required Financial Information shall be Compliant; (iii) making the Companys Representatives available to assist in the Financing, including participation in a reasonable number of meetings, presentations (including management presentations), road shows, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with rating agencies, including one or more meetings with prospective lenders, and assistance with the preparation of materials for rating agency presentations, offering documents and similar documents required in connection with the Financing; (iv) reasonably cooperating with the

 (c) The Company shall waive any of the conditions to the Debt Tender Offer as may be reasonably requested by the Parents (other than the conditions that the Debt Tender Offer is conditioned on the Merger as provided in clause (i) above), so long as such waivers would not cause the Notes Tender Offer to violate the Exchange Act, the TIA, or any other applicable Law, and shall not, without the prior written consent of the Parents, waive any condition to the Debt Tender Offer or make any change, amendment or modification to the terms and conditions of the Debt Tender Offer (including any extension thereof) other than as agreed between the Parents and the Company or as required in the reasonable judgment of the Company to comply with applicable Law.

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the Merger be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent possible.
