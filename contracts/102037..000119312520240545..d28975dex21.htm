Notwithstanding the foregoing to the contrary, Transaction Costs shall not
include any Post-Close Costs, and Buyer shall (and shall cause the Company)
to take such actions as may be required to comply after the Closing with any
Post-Close Costs.

 

(n) In calculating the Closing Consideration Amount and the other payments
and calculations to be made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, _Section_ __ _
1.4_, _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, and _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, (i) the amounts of the
Closing Consideration Amount, the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital, the
Estimated Closing Cash Amount, the Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount, the
Estimated Transaction Costs and the Adjustment Amount (and all components
thereof, as applicable) shall be determined in accordance with this  _Article
I_ and/or the definitions thereof, as applicable, which amounts shall be final
and binding on the Parties, and (ii) no single item shall be given duplicative
effect. The calculations to be made pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ and
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_, valuations and estimates for the Closing Date Working
Capital shall not reflect or take into account Type II subsequent events
between the Closing Date and the date of preparation or completion of such

standards but

 



5

    

 will take into account Type I subsequent events between the Closing Date and
the date of preparation or completion of such calculation as such events are
determined under generally accepted accounting standards.

1.3 _Closing Date Statement_. No later than five Business Days before the
Closing Date, the Seller Representative shall deliver to Buyer a statement
(the " _Closing Date Statement_ ") setting forth or attaching, as applicable:

 

(a) the Companys good faith estimate of Closing Date Working Capital ("
_Estimated Closing Date Working Capital_ "), and either (i) the amount, if
any, by which such estimate exceeds Target Working Capital (any such amount,
an " _Estimated Working Capital Excess_ ") or (ii) the amount, if any, by
which such estimate is less than Target Working Capital (any such amount, an
" _Estimated Working Capital Deficit_ ");

 

(b) the Companys good faith estimate of the aggregate amount of the
Transaction Costs (the " _Estimated Transaction Costs_ ") (together with the
name of each payee thereof that is to receive a payment of Transaction Costs
(other than the Net Deferred Compensation Payment Amount) at the Closing and,
if applicable, the related invoice), and a schedule setting forth the
Deferred Compensation Payment Amount for each participant in the Deferred
Compensation Plan;

 

(c) the Companys good faith estimate of Closing Date Cash (the "
_Estimated Closing Cash Amount_ ") and Closing Date Indebtedness (the "
_Estimated Closing Indebtedness Amount_ "), including a detailed itemization
of the components of each of the foregoing; and

 

(d) the resulting calculation of the Closing Consideration Amount.

 

1.4 _Closing Payments_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 1.5_, at the Closing,
Buyer shall pay, or shall cause the Company to pay, the following payments:

(a) an amount in cash equal to the Closing Consideration Amount as
follows: (i) to each Seller, such Sellers Closing Payment Amount, and (ii) to
the Seller Representative, the Seller Representative Reserve Amount;

 

(b) to the Escrow Agent, the Purchase Price Escrow Amount, the
Indemnification Escrow Amount, the Scheduled Matter Escrow Amount and the
Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount;

(c) to the "holder" and/or "lender," as applicable, under each of the
Credit Documents, an amount in cash equal to the respective, aggregate amount

applicable portion of the Transaction Costs (other than the Net Deferred
Compensation Payment Amount) and the Deferred Compensation Payment Amount.

 

1.5 _Mechanics of Payments_. All cash payments under or pursuant to this
Agreement shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
one or more accounts designated by the payee thereof. Such accounts shall be
designated, at the latest, no fewer than two Business Days prior to the
Closing Date.

 



6

    

1.6 _Post-Closing Purchase Price Determination_.

 

(a) After Closing, Buyer shall prepare and, within 90 days after the
Closing Date, Buyer shall deliver to the Seller Representative, a statement
(together with reasonable supporting documentation) setting forth Buyers
determination of (i) Closing Date Working Capital, (ii) Closing Date Cash,
(iii) Closing Date Indebtedness and (iv) the Transaction Costs (the "
_Purchase Price Adjustment Statement_ "), including a detailed itemization of
the components of each of the foregoing _clauses (i)_  _(iv)_. If Buyer does
not so timely deliver the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement to the Seller
Representative, at the election of the Seller Representative in its sole
discretion and in good faith, the Seller Representative may determine that the
calculations of Closing Date Working Capital, Closing Date Cash, Closing Date
Indebtedness and Transaction Costs shall be equal to the Seller
Representatives estimates of such amounts as set forth on the Closing Date
Statement, and if so elected, such amounts shall be final and binding on the
Parties for all purposes hereunder and shall be deemed to be the final
calculations in the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.

 

(b) If the Seller Representative disagrees with the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement, the Seller Representative shall notify Buyer in writing
of such disagreement within 30 days after delivery of the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement, which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the
nature of such disagreement, including the specific items involved and the
dollar amounts thereof (a " _Purchase Price Dispute Notice_ "). Any component
of Buyers Purchase Price Adjustment Statement that is not the subject of an
objection by the Seller Representative shall be final and binding on
the Parties and deemed to be part of the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement. If the Seller Representative does not deliver a Purchase Price
Dispute Notice within such 30-day period, the Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, as delivered by Buyer to the Seller Representative, shall be the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement. If the Seller Representative does
deliver a Purchase Price Dispute Notice within such 30-day period (the
aggregate amount in dispute as set forth in the Purchase Price Dispute Notice,
the " _Disputed Amounts_ "), then the Disputed Amounts shall be resolved
pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.6(c)_. Within five Business Days of receipt by
Buyer of the Purchase Price Dispute Notice, if the balance of the Purchase
Price Escrow Account exceeds the aggregate amount of the Disputed Amounts
_plus_ any amounts agreed by the Parties pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
1.6_ that would, as of such time, result in a negative Adjustment Amount,
Buyer and the Seller Representative shall provide joint written instructions
to the Escrow Agent to distribute promptly from the Purchase Price Escrow
Account such amount to the Equity Sellers in accordance with the percentages
set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ A_.

 

(c) Buyer and the Seller Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any Disputed Amounts and, if the Parties are able to resolve all
Disputed Amounts, the Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, as modified to
reflect such resolution, shall be the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement. If Buyer and the Seller Representative are unable to resolve all
Disputed Amounts within 20 days after delivery of the Seller Representatives
Purchase Price Dispute Notice, then the Disputed Amounts shall be referred for
final determination to Deloitte and Touche LLP (such firm, or another
firm determined pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, the " _Accounting
Arbitrator_ ") within 15 days after the end of such 20-day period. If Deloitte
and Touche LLP has 

 



7

    

 any material relationship with Buyer, the Seller Representative or any of
their respective Affiliates, or is otherwise unwilling or unable to serve,
Buyer and the Seller Representative shall jointly appoint as the Accounting
Arbitrator a different nationally recognized firm of independent certified
public accountants, which does not have any material relationship with Buyer,
the Seller Representative or any of their respective Affiliates. If Buyer and
the Seller Representative are unable to agree upon an alternative Accounting
Arbitrator within such 15-day period, then the Accounting Arbitrator shall be
an accounting firm of national standing designated by the American
Arbitration Association in New York, New York (which does not have any
material relationship with Buyer, the Seller Representative or any of their
respective Affiliates). The Seller Representative and Buyer shall execute any
agreement reasonably required by the Accounting Arbitrator for its engagement
hereunder. The Accounting Arbitrator shall consider only those Disputed
Amounts, which Buyer and the Seller Representative have been unable
to resolve. The Accounting Arbitrator will act as an arbitrator (not an
expert) and may select as a resolution the position of either Buyer or the
Seller Representative for each Disputed Amount (based solely on presentations
and supporting material provided by the Parties and not pursuant to any
independent review) or may impose an alternative resolution which cannot be
higher than the highest value or lower than the lowest value presented by each
Party for a disputed amount. Except as otherwise set forth in this _Section_
__ _ 1.6(c)_, the Accounting Arbitrator may conduct such proceedings as the
Accounting Arbitrator believes, in its sole discretion, will assist in the
determination of the disputed items;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, except
as Buyer and the Seller Representative may otherwise agree, all communications
between Buyer and the Seller Representative or any of their respective
representatives, on the one hand, and the Accounting Arbitrator, on the other
hand, will be in writing with copies simultaneously delivered to the non-
communicating party. The Accounting Arbitrator shall deliver to Buyer and the
Seller Representative, as promptly as practicable, and in any event within 45
days after its appointment, a written report setting forth the resolution of
such Disputed Amounts. Such report shall be final and binding upon the
Parties. In selecting such resolution, the Accounting Arbitrator shall rely
solely on the terms of this Agreement and on written submissions and
supporting material provided by Buyer and the Seller Representative, and at
the Accounting Arbitrators election, pursuant to responses provided by Buyer
and the Seller Representative to inquiries posed by the Accounting
Arbitrators review of the foregoing, but not pursuant to an independent
review. Upon the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator, the Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement, as adjusted to the extent necessary to reflect the
Accounting Arbitrators decision (and as otherwise adjusted in accordance with
this _Article I_ ), shall be the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement.
The fees, costs and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be allocated
to and borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and the Sellers, on the other hand,
based on the inverse of the percentage that the Accounting Arbitrators
determination (before such allocation) bears to the Disputed Amount as
originally submitted to the Accounting Arbitrator. For example, should the
items in dispute total in amount to $1,000 and the Accounting Arbitrator
awards $600 in favor of the Seller Representatives position, 60% of the
costs of its review would be borne by Buyer and 40% of the costs would be
borne by the Sellers.

 

(d) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause the Company to permit the
Seller Representative and its counsel, accountants and other advisors
reasonable access (during normal business hours upon reasonable notice, with
the right to make copies) to the financial and other relevant books and
records of the Company (including the Companys accounting working papers in
the Companys possession), and cause the personnel of the Company to cooperate
with the Seller Representative and its representatives to the extent
reasonably required (including by 

 



8

    

 making personnel of the Company and its and their relevant representatives
available to the Seller Representative and its representatives), in each case
for the purposes of the review and objection right and dispute process
contemplated in this _Section_ __ _ 1.6_.

 

1.7 _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_.

 

(a) The "Adjustment Amount," which may be positive or negative, shall mean
(i) Closing Date Working Capital as reflected on the Final Purchase Price
Adjustment Statement _minus_ the Estimated Closing Date Working Capital as
reflected on the Closing Date Statement, _plus_ (ii) the Estimated Closing
Indebtedness Amount as reflected on the Closing Date Statement _minus_ the
Closing Date Indebtedness as reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement, _plus_ (iii) the Closing Date Cash as reflected on the Final
Purchase Price Adjustment Statement  _minus_ the Estimated Closing Cash
Amount as reflected on the Closing Date Statement, _plus_ (iv) the Estimated
Transaction Costs as reflected on the Closing Date Statement _minus_ the
Transaction Costs as reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment
Statement.

(b) If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number or zero, then:

 

(i) Buyer and the Seller Representative shall provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to distribute promptly from the Purchase
Price Escrow Account all of the funds contained therein to the Equity Sellers
in accordance with the percentages set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ A_; and

 

(ii) Buyer shall promptly pay the Adjustment Amount to the Equity Sellers
in accordance with the percentages set forth on _Schedule_ __ _ A_.

(c) If the Adjustment Amount is a negative number, then Buyer and
the Seller Representative shall provide joint written instructions to the
Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Purchase Price Escrow Account all of
the funds contained therein as follows:

 

(i) to Buyer, an amount equal to the lesser of: (A) the balance of the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, or (B) the absolute value of the Adjustment
Amount; and

(ii) if the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than the
balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, the Escrow Agent shall
distribute the remainder of the funds in the Purchase Price Escrow Account to
the Equity Sellers in accordance with the percentages set forth on _Schedule
A_. 

(d) To the extent that the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount exceeds
the balance of the Purchase Price Escrow Account, then the amount in excess
of the Purchase Price Escrow Amount shall be paid promptly by the Sellers to
Buyer, in accordance with the percentages set forth on _Schedule A_.

 

(e) Any amounts payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ shall be paid
(or joint instruction to the Escrow Agent shall be provided) within two
Business Days after final determination pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ of
the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to an account designated by the Party receiving such payment.

 



9

    

(f) The Sellers and Buyer agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this
_Section 1.7_ as an adjustment to the purchase price allocable to the Equity
Sellers pursuant to _Schedule_ __ _ A_ for federal, state, local and non-U.S.
Income Tax purposes. 

(g) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ and 
_Article VIII_ , neither Buyer nor any Seller shall have any right to make any
claim against the other Party under this Agreement in respect of the
Adjustment Amount, the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement or the other
payments and calculations to be made pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_,
_Section_ __ _ 1.4_, _Section_ __ _ 1.6_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.7_. For the
avoidance of doubt, the provisions of  _Section_ __ _ 1.6_, _Section_ __ _
1.7_ and _Article VIII_ provide the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties
with respect to the matters that are or that may be addressed through such
sections;  _provided_ , for the avoidance of doubt, that either Party may
seek specific performance or take other necessary legal action to enforce such
provisions.

 

1.8 _Escrowed Portion of the Purchase Price_. For the purpose of (a)(i)
securing Sellers obligations under  _Sections_ __ _ 1.6_ and _1.7_ , Buyer
shall deliver $2,000,000 in cash (the " _Purchase Price Escrow Amount_ ") at
the Closing, to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account (the " _Purchase Price Escrow Account_ "), which will be
designated and administered by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the escrow
agreement to be in substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _
C-1_ (the " _Company Escrow Agreement_ "), (ii) securing Sellers obligations
under _Article VIII_ , Buyer shall deliver $3,000,000 in cash (the "
_Indemnification_ _Escrow Amount_ ") at the Closing, to the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Indemnity Escrow Account,
which will be designated and administered by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the
Company Escrow Agreement, and (iii) securing Sellers obligations under
_Article VIII_ with respect to the Scheduled Matter, Buyer shall deliver the
Scheduled Matter Escrow Amount in cash at the Closing, to the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Scheduled Matter Escrow
Account, which will be designated and administered by the Escrow Agent
pursuant to the Company Escrow Agreement, and (b) securing Buyers obligations
to pay a portion of the Purchase Price to KD Seller in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 1.11_, Buyer shall deliver $6,000,000 in cash at the Closing
(the " _Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount_ "), to the Escrow Agent by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account (the " _Deferred
Purchase Price Escrow Account_ ") that will be designated and administered by
the Escrow Agent pursuant to the escrow agreement to be in substantially the
form attached hereto as  _Exhibit_ __ _ C-2_ (the " _Deferred Purchase Price
Escrow Agreement_ "). The Company Escrow Agreement will provide, among other
things, that (i) the Purchase Price Escrow Amount held in the Purchase Price
Escrow Account will be released in accordance with the amounts provided on the
Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.6_ and  _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, (ii) the Indemnification Escrow Amount held
in the Indemnity Escrow Account will be used as a source of payment for
certain indemnification obligations of the Sellers under _Article VIII_ ,
and (iii) the Scheduled Matter Escrow Amount held in the Scheduled Matter
Escrow Account will be used as a source of payment for indemnification
obligations of the Sellers under _Article VIII_ with respect to the Scheduled
Matter. The Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Agreement will provide, among
other things, that the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount held in the
Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Account will be released in accordance with the
amounts and provisions provided in  _Section_ __ _ 1.11_. The Sellers and
Buyer agree that the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount is (x) maintained
to protect Buyers significant investment in the Company, (y) part of, and
inseparable from, the overall purchase consideration paid for the Company,
and (z) is not compensatory in nature and the Employment Agreement is the sole
compensatory arrangement involving KD Seller

 



10

    

 and the Company (and Buyer) with respect to the post-Closing period. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Sellers and Buyer agree to treat any portion of the
Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount released from the Deferred Purchase
Price Escrow Account in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ as an adjustment
to the purchase price allocable to KD Sellers Common Stock in accordance
with  _Schedule_ __ _ A_ for federal, state, local and non-U.S. Income Tax
purposes, and neither the Sellers nor Buyer shall take any position during the
course of any audit or other proceeding inconsistent with such treatment
unless required by applicable Law.

1.9 _Withholdings_. Notwithstanding any other provision in this
Agreement, Buyer, the Company and the Escrow Agent may deduct and withhold any
Taxes from any payments to be made pursuant to this Agreement ("
_Withholdings_ ") as it reasonably determines it is required to deduct and
withhold, shall collect any necessary forms or other information related
thereto, shall timely pay over to the applicable Governmental Entity any such
amounts deducted or withheld, and shall comply with all applicable
reporting obligations with respect thereto. To accomplish any such
Withholding for employees of the Company, any such payment subject to
Withholdings shall be made through the payroll system of the Company after
reduction in respect of such payment for applicable Withholding. To the
extent that any such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such deducted or
withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been delivered and paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
Withholding was made. For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall make a
Withholding with respect to any amounts attributable to the purchase of the
HPS Transferred Real Property from HPS. If Buyer determines it is required to
make any other Withholding (other than (i) as a result of the failure to
provide the certificates required under _Section_ __ _ 2.2(l)_ or _Section_
__ _ 2.2(m)_ or (ii) with respect to any payment that is compensatory in
nature), it shall give prompt notice to the Seller Representative and
cooperate with the Seller Representative in good faith to reduce or mitigate
such withholding.

 

1.10 _Deferred Compensation_. On or prior to the Closing, the Company will
terminate, or cause to be terminated, the Deferred Compensation Plan in
accordance with Code Section 409A, with the effectiveness of such termination
to be concurrent with the Closing. The Seller Representative shall give Buyer
prompt notice of such actions taken pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 1.10_.

1.11 _Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount_. The Closing Payment Amount
due to KD Seller under this Agreement shall not include the Deferred Purchase
Price Escrow Amount, which will be distributed to KD Seller as described in
this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_.

 

(a) Over the three-year period following the Closing Date, interest will
accrue on the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount to be payable to KD
Seller on each anniversary of the Closing Date, provided KD Seller has
remained employed with Silva through the applicable anniversary date and all
other conditions in this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_ have been met by KD Seller.
Interest will be calculated as a simple interest rate as follows:

(i) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, 3% of the Deferred
Purchase Price Escrow Amount.

Purchase Price Escrow Amount.

 



11

applicable anniversary date and all other conditions herein have been met by
KD Seller, the annual interest payment will be paid to KD Seller by Buyer in a
single lump-sum payment within 30 days following the applicable anniversary
date.

(ii) If KD Seller remains employed with the Company through the
third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow
Amount will be distributed to KD Seller from the Deferred Purchase Price
Escrow Account within five days following the third anniversary of the Closing
Date.

 

(iii) If, prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company
terminates KD Sellers employment without Cause or KD Seller resigns with
Good Reason, the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount and any unpaid annual
interest payment under _Section_ __ _ 1.11(a)_ (with interest for the year of
termination calculated on a _pro rata_ basis through KD Sellers separation
from service) will be, in respect of such interest payment, paid to KD Seller
by Buyer in a single lump-sum payment within 30 days following KD
Sellers separation from service and, in respect of the Deferred Purchase
Price Escrow Amount, distributed to KD Seller from the Deferred Purchase Price
Escrow Account within five days following KD Sellers separation from service.
KD Seller will forfeit any additional annual interest payments due to be
payable after KD Sellers separation from service.

 

(iv) If, prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, the Company
terminates KD Sellers employment for Cause, (A) KD Seller will forfeit
recovery of $3 million from the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount, (B) the
remaining $3 million from the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount will be
distributed to KD Seller from the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Account
within five days following KD Sellers separation from service, and (C) KD
Seller will forfeit any annual interest payments due to be payable for the
year of KD Sellers separation from service and any period thereafter.

(v) If, prior to the third anniversary of the Closing Date, KD Seller
resigns without Good Reason, (A) the entire Deferred Purchase Price Escrow
Amount will be forfeited, (B) KD Seller shall not be entitled to any
distribution from the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Account, and (C) KD
Seller will forfeit any annual interest payments due to be payable for the
year of KD Sellers separation from service and any period thereafter.

 

(c) Upon the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount (or a portion thereof)
becoming due to KD Seller under this  _Section_ __ _ 1.11_, each of Buyer
and the Company shall execute joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
to distribute promptly from the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Account the
Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount to be distributed to KD Seller in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 1.11_.

 



12

    

(d) KD Seller agrees to report the full Closing Payment Amount due
KD Seller, including the Deferred Purchase Price Escrow Amount, _less_ KD
Sellers tax basis, as realized gain on a capital asset for the year in which
the Closing Date occurs and to pay the applicable Income Tax with respect to
such realized capital gain with KD Sellers Income Tax returns for the
taxable year in which the Closing Date occurs. Neither KD Seller nor Buyer
shall take any position during the course of any audit or other proceeding
inconsistent with such treatment unless required by applicable Law.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF BUYER

 

Except as set forth on Buyers Disclosure Schedule, as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 11.16(d)_, Buyer represents and warrants to each Seller, as
of the date hereof and as of the Closing Date, as follows:

5.1 _Organization and Power_. Buyer is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the Commonwealth of
Virginia, and has all requisite corporate power and authority to carry on its
business as now being conducted and as presently proposed to be conducted by
it. Buyer is duly qualified or licensed to transact business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in each of those jurisdictions in which
the nature of the business it is conducting, or the operation, ownership or
leasing of its assets or properties, makes such qualification or licensing
necessary, other than in such jurisdictions where the failure to be so duly
qualified or licensed and in good standing would not materially
adversely affect the ability of Buyer to timely consummate any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or perform its obligations hereunder.

 

5.2 _Authorization of Transaction_. Buyer has all necessary corporate
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and all other
Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party and to perform its
obligations hereunder and thereunder. No other proceedings or actions on the
part of Buyer are necessary to approve and authorize Buyers execution and
delivery of any Transaction Documents to which it is or will be a party or the
performance of its obligations hereunder or thereunder. This Agreement
constitutes, and each of the other Transaction Documents to which Buyer is or
will be a party will when executed constitute, a valid and binding obligation
of Buyer, enforceable against Buyer in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability hereof or thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency or
other Laws affecting creditors rights generally and limitations on the
availability of equitable remedies.

5.3 _Absence of Conflicts_. The execution, delivery and performance by
Buyer of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which Buyer is
or will be a party do not, and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein and therein will not, subject to obtaining the consents,
approvals, authorizations and permits and making the filings described in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.3_ or as set forth on _Buyer_ __ _s Disclosure Schedule_ __
_ 5.3_, (a) violate, conflict with, or result in any breach of, any of the
terms, conditions or provisions of Buyers organizational and governing
documents, (b) violate any order, writ, judgment, injunction, decree, statute,
Law, rule or regulation of any Governmental Entity applicable to Buyer or by
which or to which any portion of Buyers properties or assets is bound or
subject, (c) violate, conflict with, or result in any violation or breach of,
or constitute a default (with or without due notice or lapse of time or both)
under, or give rise to any right of termination, cancellation or acceleration
under, or a loss of any benefits by Buyer under any of the terms, conditions
or provisions of any material agreement, or (d) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien upon any properties or assets of Buyer, which

 



45

    

 would, in each case, materially adversely affect the ability of Buyer to
timely consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby. No consent,
registration or declaration of, or filing with, any Governmental Entity or
any other person is required by Buyer in connection with the execution,
delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which Buyer is a party or the consummation by Buyer of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, except for (i) such filings
in connection with any Transfer Taxes, if any, (ii) such other filings and
consents as may be required under any environmental, health or safety Law or
regulation pertaining to any notification, disclosure or required approval
necessitated by the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents to which Buyer is a party, (iii) the applicable
requirements under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Laws, or
(iv) such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations, registrations,
declarations, filings, notices or permits the failure of which to be obtained
or made would not materially adversely affect the ability of Buyer to timely
consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

5.4 _Litigation_. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
Proceedings pending (or, to Buyers Knowledge, threatened) against or
affecting Buyer at law or in equity, or before or by any Governmental Entity,
which could reasonably be expected to adversely affect Buyers performance
under this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

 

5.5 _Investment Representations_.

 

(a) Assuming the representations and warranties of the Sellers and the
Company contained in this Agreement are true in all respects, at and
immediately after the Closing, and after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Buyer and the Company (i) will be solvent (in that both
the fair value of its assets will not be less than the sum of its debts and
that the present fair saleable value of its assets will not be less than the
amount required to pay its probable Liability on its debts as they become
absolute and matured), (ii) will have adequate capital with which to engage in
its business and (iii) will not have incurred and does not immediately plan
to incur debts beyond its ability to pay as they become absolute and matured.
No transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of any
of Buyer, the Sellers or the Company.

 

(b) Buyer is acquiring the Common Stock for its own account with the
present intention of holding such securities for investment purposes and not
with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any distribution of such
securities in violation of any federal or state securities Laws. Buyer
acknowledges that it is informed as to the risks of the
transactions contemplated hereby and of ownership of the Common Stock.

5.6 _Financial Ability_. Buyer has (and will have on the Closing Date)
the necessary and immediately available funding to fund in cash all of the
amounts required to be provided by Buyer for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and the other Transaction Documents to which
it is or will be a party and sufficient for the satisfaction of all of
Buyers obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
to which it is or will be a party, including the payment of the amounts
payable pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 1.4_ and _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ and

 



46

    

 the payment of all associated costs and expenses of Buyer in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents to which it is or will be a party. Such funding is not subject to
any delay, restriction or required Consent. Buyer has not incurred any
obligation, commitment, restriction or Liability of any kind, and is not
contemplating or aware of any obligation, commitment, restriction
or Liability of any kind, in any case which would impair or adversely affect
such funding. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that Buyers performance of its
obligations under this Agreement is not in any way contingent upon the
availability of financing of any kind to Buyer, whether or not for, or
related to, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.7 _Brokers_. Other than with respect to any Liabilities, expenses or
fees owed to Harris Williams, no broker, finder or financial advisor or other
Person is entitled to any brokerage fees, commissions, finders fees or
financial advisory fees in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby by reason of any action taken by Buyer or any of its respective
partners, directors, managers, officers, employees, representatives or agents.

Representative, in its sole discretion, and (ii) suppliers, customers,

discretion and sensitivity to the Companys relationships with its current

6.4 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Sellers shall give prompt
written notice to Buyer of: (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any

inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the date of this Agreement
to the Closing determined as if such representation or warranty were made at
such time; (b) the failure of the Company or any Seller to comply with or
satisfy in any material respect any covenant to be complied with by it

respective obligations hereunder. The Company shall be entitled to make
any such notification under _clause (a)_ above in the form of updates and/or
modifications to the Sellers Disclosure Schedule or the Company Disclosure
Schedule and such notification shall amend and supplement the appropriate
schedules previously delivered. No such notification (or failure to provide
such notification) shall be given any effect for purposes of determining the
accuracy of the representations and warranties made by the Sellers pursuant to
this Agreement, determining whether the conditions set forth in _Article VII_
have been satisfied, and shall not affect any right or remedy of Buyer under
this Agreement, including for purposes of the indemnification or termination
rights contained in this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, this

Representation and Warranty Insurance (pursuant to the terms thereof) for
breaches of representations and warranties covered thereunder.

earlier of the termination of this Agreement or the Closing Date, the Seller

after the payment of any amounts owing pursuant thereto as part of the

thereto to release and waive any and all claims that any of them may have
under such agreements.

6.7 _Notification of Certain Matters_. Buyer shall give to the Company
prompt written notice of: (a) the occurrence, or failure to occur, of any
event of which Buyer has Knowledge that would be reasonably likely to cause

other Transaction Document to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect
at any time from the date of this Agreement to the Closing determined as if
such representation or warranty were made at such time; (b) the failure of
Buyer to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant to be
complied with by it hereunder; (c) any written notice or other written
communication from any Person alleging that the Consent of such Person is or
may be required in 

 



52

    

 connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and (d) any
written notice or other written communication from any Governmental Entity in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No such
notification shall affect the representations or warranties of the Parties or
the conditions to their respective obligations hereunder.

 

6.8 _Preserve Accuracy of Representations and Warranties; Notification_.
Buyer and each Seller shall promptly notify the other of any development that
they become aware of that would cause any of the conditions set forth in
_Article VII_ on the Closing Date not to be satisfied. No such notification
(or failure to provide such notification) shall be given any effect for
purposes of determining the accuracy of the representations and warranties
made by Sellers or Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, determining whether the
conditions set forth in _Article VII_ have been satisfied, and shall not
affect any right or remedy of any Party under this Agreement, including for
purposes of the indemnification or termination rights contained in this
Agreement.

 

6.9 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Except as set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule_ __ _ 6.9(a)_,
Buyer shall take commercially reasonable efforts so that on and after the
Closing Date and at all times prior to the first anniversary of the Closing
Date, or, if earlier, their termination of employment, officers and employees
of the Company who are in the employ of the Company immediately prior to the
Closing (" _Covered Employees_ ") are employed immediately after the Closing
and provided with (i) at least the same annual base salary or hourly wage rate
and at least the same annual bonus target opportunities as the base salary or
hourly wage rate and annual bonus target opportunities in effect for such
Covered Employees immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (ii) employee
benefits, plans and programs (including, but not limited to, incentive
compensation, pension, life insurance, welfare, profit sharing, 401(k),
severance, salary continuation and fringe benefits, but excluding with respect
to the Deferred Compensation Plan) which are substantially comparable in
the aggregate to those made available by the Company to such officers and
employees immediately prior to the Closing. For purposes of eligibility to
participate and vesting in all benefits provided by Buyer, its Subsidiaries or
the Company after the Closing, and for purposes of level of benefit accruals
solely with respect to paid time-off and severance benefits, the Covered
Employees will be credited with their years of service with the Company and
prior employers to the same extent, such service was recognized under the
corresponding Employee Benefit Plan, and service with prior employers is taken
into account under the plans of Buyer and its Subsidiaries and does not result
in a duplication of benefits for the same period of service. For purposes of
determining satisfaction of any annual deductible limitation and out-of-pocket
maximum that may apply under the group health plans provided by Buyer, its
Subsidiaries or the Company after the Closing, each Covered Employee will be
credited for covered expenses paid by the Covered Employee under Employee
Benefit Plans during the then current annual period of coverage. The
eligibility of Covered Employees to participate in any welfare benefit plan or
program of Buyer and the Company shall, to the extent commercially feasible,
not be subject to any exclusions or limitations for any pre-existing
conditions except to the extent such individual was or would have been subject
to such exclusion under similar benefit plans and programs of the Company.
Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall create any rights in
any officer or employee or former officer or employee (including any
beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the Company in respect of continued
employment or specific compensation and benefits for any specified period of
any nature or kind whatsoever.

 



53

    

(b) Subject to the other provisions set forth in this  _Section_ __ _
6.9_, after the Closing and subject to Applicable Law and the terms of any
Employee Benefit Plan, Buyer and the Company may amend, modify or terminate
any Employee Benefit Plan in existence prior to the Closing.

 

(c) To the extent requested by Buyer, the Company shall amend, freeze
and/or terminate and payout any Employee Benefit Plan set forth on _Company
Disclosure Schedule 6.9(c)_ in accordance with Applicable Law and effective
immediately prior to the Closing Date.

 

(d) From and after the date hereof through the earlier of the termination
of the Agreement or the Closing Date, the Sellers shall provide commercially
reasonable assistance (excluding the need to make any payments to such Covered
Employees therefor) to obtain from all Covered Employees (other than any
individual Seller or any Key Employee) certain confidentiality and work
product agreements, to be effective as of the Closing Date.

(e) Contingent upon and subject to the Closing, the Company shall (i) make
all payments due under the Deferred Compensation Plan, (ii) terminate the
Deferred Compensation Plan so that no further amounts will be credited or
accrued thereunder, and (iii) use best efforts to obtain full and complete
releases from all participants in the Deferred Compensation Plan for all
amounts accrued and payable thereunder, in each case in compliance with the
terms of the Deferred Compensation Plan and the provisions of Section 409A of
the Code. Additionally, contingent upon and subject to the Closing and
termination and payout of the Deferred Compensation Plan, the Company shall
adopt a Deferred Incentive Compensation Plan substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Company Disclosure Schedule 6.9(e)_ for the benefit of
the participants listed therein, to be effective after the Closing.

 

(f) This _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ shall be binding upon and inure solely to the
benefit of each of the Parties to this Agreement, and nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_, express or implied, shall confer upon any other Person
any rights or remedies of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this 
_Section_ __ _ 6.9_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be
construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement
or arrangement, except with respect to the Employment Agreement,
the Consulting Agreements, the retention incentive compensation plan for Key
Employees and the Post-Close Severance Obligations. The Parties hereto
acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_
shall not create any right in any employee or any other Person to any
continued employment with the Company, Buyer or any of their respective
Affiliates or compensation or benefits of any nature or kind whatsoever.

 

(g) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, Buyer agrees that in the
event that the Company, at Buyers direction, terminates any Covered Employee
(other than any Key Employee) without cause during the two-year period
immediately following the Closing Date, such Covered Employee shall be
entitled to severance pay equal to two weeks base wages for every year of
service with the Company not to exceed 52 weeks (the " _Post-Close Severance
Obligation_ "). For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(g)_, "cause" means
a determination by the Company, in its sole discretion, that any of the
following has occurred: (i) any act by any such Covered Employee that
constitutes insubordination, misconduct, fraud, misappropriation,
embezzlement, or gross misfeasance of duty; (ii) such Covered Employees
violation of any Company policy, including human resources policy or code of
conduct; (iii) such Covered Employees misuse of

 



54

    

 alcohol or prescription drugs while working, or of any substance which
repeatedly and materially interferes with such Covered Employees ability to
perform services on behalf of the Company, or (iv) such Covered Employees
commission of, conviction of or pleading guilty to any crime other than a
routine traffic offense. The Company will pay the Post-Close Severance
Obligation in accordance with its normal payroll practices (no less
frequently than monthly), subject to applicable tax withholdings, provided the
Covered Employee executes within the 45 days after termination of the Covered
Employees employment, and does not revoke, a release, in the form acceptable
to the Company, that releases the Company and its affiliates from any and all
claims the Covered Employee may have in connection with the Covered Employees
employment or termination thereof. The Company will commence payment of the
Post-Close Severance Obligation with the first payroll date immediately
following the date the Covered Employees release is effective and
irrevocable, with subsequent installments until paid in full, with the Covered
Employee being entitled to receive at the time of that first payroll date the
installments the Covered Employee otherwise would have received had the Post-
Close Severance Obligation commenced immediately after termination of the
Covered Employees employment.

 

6.10 _Access to Information_.

 

(a) Buyer shall (and shall cause the Company to) hold all the Books and
Records of the Company thereof existing on the Closing Date and not to
destroy or dispose of any such Books or Records for a period of seven years
from the Closing, and thereafter, if it desires to destroy or dispose of such
Books and Records, to offer first in writing at least ninety (90) days prior
to such destruction or disposal to surrender them to the applicable Seller.
During that seven year period, Buyer shall (and shall cause the Company to),
during normal business hours, upon reasonable notice, make available
and provide the Sellers and their representatives (including counsel and
independent auditors and the Seller Representative) with access to the
facilities and properties of the Company and to all information, files,
documents and records (written and computer) that are not otherwise protected
by legal privilege relating to the Company or the Business or operations for
any and all periods prior to or including the Closing Date that it may require
with respect to any reasonable business purpose (including, without
limitation, any Tax matter) or in connection with any Proceeding of any kind
by or against any Person, and shall (and shall cause the Company to) cooperate
fully with the Sellers and their representatives (including counsel
and independent auditors) in connection with the foregoing, at the sole cost
and expense of such Seller, including by making Tax, accounting and financial
personnel and other appropriate employees and officers of the Company
available to the Sellers and their respective representatives (including
counsel, independent auditors and the Seller Representative), with regard to
any reasonable business purpose. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, neither Buyer nor the Company shall be required to disclose
any information to Sellers if such disclosure would: (A) jeopardize any
attorney-client privilege; or (B) violate any Applicable Law or breach any
confidentiality agreement or fiduciary duty; _provided_ , that each of the
Company, Buyer and the Sellers will use its commercially reasonable efforts,
consistent with market practice, to make appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements such that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply.

 

(b) For a period of seven years after the Closing Date or, if greater, the
applicable period specified in the Companys applicable document retention
policy, Sellers shall, and shall cause their Affiliates in connection with the
Business, to, (i) retain the Books and Records relating to the Business
relating to periods prior to and including the Closing Date, to the extent

 



55

    

 not included in the Assets, and (ii) upon reasonable notice, afford Buyer or
its representatives reasonable access, at their sole expense (including the
right to make, at Buyers sole expense, photocopies), during normal business
hours, to such Books and Records for any reasonable purpose in connection with
matters relating to or affected by the operations of the Business on or prior
to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Sellers shall not be required to disclose any information to Buyer
or the Company if such disclosure would: (A) jeopardize any attorney-client
privilege; or (B) violate any Applicable Law or breach any confidentiality
agreement or fiduciary duty; _provided_ , that each of the Company, Buyer and
the Sellers will use its commercially reasonable efforts, consistent with
market practice, to make appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements
such that the foregoing restrictions shall not apply.

6.11 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification or exculpation
(including advancement of expenses) existing in favor of, and all limitations
on the personal liability of, each present and former director or senior
executive officer of the Company (the " _Indemnified Company Parties_ ")
provided for in the Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws in effect
as of the date of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. From
and after the Closing, the Buyer agrees that the Company shall indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, including the advancement of expenses, until
the sixth anniversary of the Closing the Indemnified Company Parties against
all Losses arising out of or relating to acts or omissions by them in their
capacities as such, which acts or omissions occurred at or prior to the
Closing, in each case to the fullest extent provided under the terms of the
Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws in effect on the date of this
Agreement. In determining whether an Indemnified Company Party is entitled to
indemnification under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11(a)_, if requested by such
Indemnified Company Party, such determination shall be made by special,
independent counsel selected by Buyer and approved by the Indemnified Company
Party (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) and who has not
otherwise performed services for Buyer or its Affiliates within the last three
years (other than in connection with such matter).

 

(b) The Company shall not amend its articles of incorporation or bylaws so
as to modify the indemnification or exculpation provisions therein in a
manner inconsistent with this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ or otherwise adverse to
the Indemnified Company Parties unless such modification is required by
Applicable Law.

 

(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain and pay for (at Buyers
cost and expense, to be reimbursed by Buyer at Closing to the extent then
paid or accrued as a Liability by the Company) directors and officers
liability insurance, fiduciary liability insurance and employment practices
liability insurance with coverage with separate limits of not less than $1.0
million for each line of coverage, including, without limitation, liability,
defense, fiduciary (including HIPAA sublimit) and employment practices
liability with and an extended reporting period endorsement with a coverage
period of six years after the Closing Date, with at least the same coverage
and amounts and terms and conditions with respect to claims arising out of or
relating to events which occurred before or at the Closing Date (including in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the " _D andO
and EPL Tail Policy_"). Buyer shall bear the cost of the DandO and EPL Tail
Policy. During the term of the DandO and EPL Tail Policy, Buyer shall not (and
shall cause the Company not to) take any action following the Closing to
cause the DandO and EPL Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to
be amended, waived or modified.

 



56

    

(d) If the Company or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger, or (ii)
transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, then, and in each case, to the extent not assumed by operation
of law, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
the Company, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations set forth in
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to
or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its officers, directors, managers or
employees, it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided
for in this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ is not prior to or in substitution for any
such claims under such policies.

 

(f) The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_ shall survive the Closing
and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
of the Indemnified Company Parties, their heirs and their personal
representatives and shall be binding on all successors and permitted assigns
of the Company and may not be terminated or amended in any manner adverse to
such Persons without their prior written consent.

6.12 _HSR_. From the date hereof through the date of termination of the
required waiting period under the HSR Act, Buyer shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates not to, take any action that could reasonably be expected to
hinder or delay the obtaining of clearance or the expiration of the required
waiting period under the HSR Act or any other applicable Antitrust Law.

 

6.13 _Governmental Consents_. Promptly following the execution of this
Agreement, but in no event later than five Business Days following the date
of this Agreement, the Company and Buyer shall file, or cause to be filed by
their respective "ultimate parent entities," with the FTC and the DOJ, the
notifications and other information (if any) required to be filed under the
HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated herein and in the other
Transaction Documents. In addition, the Company and Buyer shall promptly
proceed to prepare and file with the appropriate Governmental Entities
such additional requests, reports or notifications as may be required or, in
the reasonable opinion of Buyer or the Company, advisable, in connection with
this Agreement. With respect to each of the above filings, the Parties shall
diligently and expeditiously prosecute, and shall cooperate fully with each
other in the prosecution of, such matters including subject to Applicable Law,
by permitting counsel for the other Party to review in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of the other Party in connection with any such filing
or any proposed written communication with any Governmental Entity and by
providing counsel for the other Party with copies of all filings and
submissions made by such Party and all correspondence between such Party (and
its advisors) with any Governmental Entity and any other information supplied
by such Party and such Partys Subsidiaries to a Governmental Entity or
received from such a Governmental Entity in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided, however_ , that (a) materials may
be redacted before being provided to the other Party (i) to remove (x)
references concerning the valuation of the Company and (y) individual
customer pricing information, (ii) as necessary to comply with contractual
arrangements, and (iii) as

 



57

    

 necessary to avoid disclosure of other competitively sensitive information
or to address reasonable privilege or confidentiality concerns, and (b) copies
of documents filed by a Party hereto pursuant to Item 4(c) of the
Notification and Report Form filed with the FTC and the DOJ shall not be
required to be provided to any other Party hereto. Each of Buyer and the
Company shall furnish to the other such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of any such filing or submission. Buyer and the Company shall keep
each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and any
inquiries or requests for additional information from, the FTC or the DOJ.
Buyer and the Sellers shall share equally in paying the filing fees with
respect to any filings required under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Laws or by
any Governmental Entity. Buyer and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to resolve objections, if any, as may be asserted by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement under the HSR Act and any other Antitrust Laws. In connection
therewith, if any Proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any transaction contemplated by this Agreement as in violation of
any Antitrust Laws, Buyer and the Company shall cooperate and use
commercially reasonable efforts to contest and resist every such Proceeding.
For the avoidance of doubt, "commercially reasonable efforts" shall not impose
upon Buyer any obligation to agree to effect: (i) the sale, divestiture,
disposition, licensing, or holding separate of one or more businesses,
product or service lines or assets of Buyer or the Company or (ii) any
limitations on Buyers freedom of action with respect to one or more
businesses, product or service lines, or assets of Buyer or the Company.
Buyer and the Sellers shall share equally in paying the filing fees with
respect to any filings required under the HSR Act or any Antitrust Laws or by
any Governmental Entity.

 

6.14 _Reasonable Efforts; Further Assurances_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.13_ which shall govern the subject matter
thereof and except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, prior to the
Closing, upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, Buyer, the Sellers and the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (subject to any
Applicable Laws) to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby as
promptly as practicable. In addition, no party hereto shall take any
action after the date of this Agreement to materially delay the obtaining of,
or result in not obtaining, any Consent from any Governmental Entity necessary
to be obtained prior to Closing.

 

(b) At and after the Closing, the officers and directors of the Company
will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the

Assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Company as a result
of, or in connection with, the transactions contemplated hereby.

Equity Seller shall voluntarily transfer or assign any shares of Common Stock
owned of record by such Equity Seller.

 



58

    

(d) Prior to the Closing or the earlier termination of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any Equity Seller shall exercise any claims, rights or
remedies which the Company or such Equity Seller, as applicable, has or may
have under or in connection with the Shareholders Agreement, whether
in relation to past, present or future circumstances, and regardless of
whether it presently knows or could know of the grounds or legal basis for any
such claim or right, including, without limitation, any claims, rights or
remedies arising under or in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

6.15 _Investigation and Agreement by Buyer; No Other Representations or
Warranties_.

(a) Buyer agrees and acknowledges that it is sophisticated and was advised
by experienced counsel and, to the extent it deemed necessary, other advisors
in connection with this Agreement. Buyer understands, acknowledges and agrees
that it (i) has made its own inquiry and investigation into, and,

respect to matters Buyer considers material in determining whether to enter
into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions contemplated in

statements or documents heretofore or hereafter delivered to or made
available to Buyer or Buyers representatives, including the information in
the electronic data room of the Company, the confidential information
memorandum, any management presentations or other due diligence information,
except to the extent and as expressly and specifically covered by a
representation and warranty made by the Company or the Sellers set forth in
_Article IV_ or _Article III_ , the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, the Company
Disclosure Schedule or any Transaction Document, respectively), have not been
relied upon by Buyer and are expressly and specifically disclaimed and shall
not form the basis of any claim by Buyer for breach of representation or
warranty; _provided_ , that such limitation shall not apply in the case of
Fraud.

 



59

    

6.16 _Representation and Warranty Insurance_. A buyer-side representation
and warranty insurance policy is being conditionally bound as of the date
hereof, which is substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit_ __ _
F_ and shall be on customary terms and conditions (including the insurer

indirectly, any subrogation rights against the Sellers with respect to any
claim made by an insured thereunder, and the insurer thereunder expressly
agreeing that Buyer and its Affiliates shall have no obligation to pursue any
claim against the Sellers in connection with any Loss, Liability or damage)
(the " _Representation and Warranty Insurance_ "). At Buyers reasonable
request, Sellers shall, and shall cause the Company to, reasonably cooperate
with Buyer to obtain and bind the Representation and Warranty Insurance.
Sellers shall timely provide, within 60 days after the Closing Date, to the
insurer named in the Representation and Warranty Insurance and Buyer a copy
of the USB, CD or DVD-ROM (or a link to an electronic download) specified in
Clause XV of the Representation and Warranty Insurance policy. The cost of the
Representation and Warranty Insurance and any fees, costs or deductibles
associated therewith shall be borne solely by Buyer. Buyer agrees to not seek
to make, enter into or consent to, any amendment to the Representation and
Warranty Insurance following the Closing that would adversely affect the
rights of the Sellers without the Seller Representatives prior written
consent.

 

6.17 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) Tax Indemnification. Subject to the limitations provided in _Section_
__ _ 8.4_ hereof, pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_ hereof, the Sellers
shall indemnify the Buyer Indemnified Parties after the Closing and hold the
Buyer Indemnified Parties harmless from and against, without duplication, all
Losses resulting from or attributable to (i) any and all Taxes (or the
nonpayment thereof) of the Company and Serv Food for all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods, including, for the avoidance of doubt, Taxes attributable to the
matters set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule 4.7_ , (ii) any and all
Taxes of the Equity Sellers and RE Sellers, (iii) any and all Taxes of any
Person imposed on the Company as a transferee or successor, by contract or
agreement, or pursuant to any Law or otherwise, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring at or before the Closing, (that is not a Buyer
Closing Date Transaction), (iv) any Taxes for which the Company is liable
pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 or any similar provision of
state, local or non-U.S. Law as a result of having been a member of an
affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary group before the Closing, (v)
any Transfer Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 6.17(e)_, (vi) any Taxes attributable to the Pre-Signing Restructuring,
and (vii) any and all employment, payroll and withholding Taxes imposed on
the Buyer or the Company with respect to payments made to employees pursuant

Taxes pursuant to the CARES Act) (Taxes described in clauses (i) through
(vii), the "Indemnified Taxes"). This _Section_ __ _ 6.17(a)_ and _Section_
__ _ 8.2(d)_ shall survive until 60 days after the expiration of the
applicable statute of limitations for the underlying Tax matter ( _provided_ ,
that such survival shall not exceed the period allowed pursuant to 10 Del.
Code § 8106(c)).

(b) _Tax Return Preparation_.

(i) Buyer shall prepare and file (A) all Tax Returns related to the
Transferred Real Property and (B) all Tax Returns of the Company that are
required to be filed after the Closing Date, in each case, that relate to any
Tax period ending on or before the Closing

 



60

    

 Date or any Straddle Period. Buyer shall prepare such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with past practices (unless otherwise required by Applicable
Law) and, to the extent applicable, the conventions provided in _Section_ __
_ 6.17(c)_. Buyer shall send the Seller Representative a copy of each such
(A) Income Tax Return (together with such schedules and supporting work papers
as the Seller Representative may reasonably request) for its review and
comment at least 20 days prior to the due date of such Tax Return and (B)
other Tax Return for its review and comment as soon as practicable prior to
the due date of such Tax Return. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall
cooperate in good faith to resolve any reasonable comments provided by the
Seller Representative to Buyer at least 10 days prior to the due date of such
Income Tax Return. Buyer shall consider in good faith the
Seller Representatives comments with respect to any other Tax Returns
prepared by Buyer pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.17(b)(i)_. Except to the
extent taken into account in the calculation of Closing Date Indebtedness
and resulting in an adjustment to the Purchase Price, as adjusted and finally
determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, the Seller Representative, on
behalf of the Sellers, shall pay to Buyer Sellers allocable share of
any Taxes for a Pre-Closing Tax Period shown on such Tax Returns no later
than five days before the due date for the Tax Return for such Taxes.

 

(ii) Except as required by Applicable Law, Buyer shall not, and shall not
cause or permit the Company to (A) amend a Tax Return of the Company for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period; (B) other than in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.17(c)_, make or revoke an election on any Tax Return filed after the
Closing Date that adversely affects the Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or (C) enter into (or pursue) any voluntary
disclosure agreement with any Governmental Entity that relates solely to
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company for any taxable period that ends on or
before the Closing Date, in each case, if such action would be reasonably
likely to increase any Tax Liability for the Sellers (including Taxes for
which the Sellers are obligated to indemnity a Buyer Indemnified Party
pursuant to this Agreement) without the prior written consent of the Seller
Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed.

 

(c) _Tax Elections and Reporting_. With respect to certain Tax matters,
the Sellers and Buyer agree as follows: 

(i) To the extent permitted or required by Applicable Law, the
Companys year-end for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes shall end as of the
end of the Closing Date.

 

(ii) To the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, to treat any
Transaction Deductions paid or accrued on or before the Closing as deductible
in a Pre-Closing Tax Period, and no party hereto shall apply the "next day
rule" under Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) to such
deductions.

(iii) To properly make an election under Revenue Procedure 2011-29 to
deduct seventy percent (70%) of any Transaction Deductions that are success-
based fees as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.263(a)-5(f).

(iv) To treat any gains, income, deductions, losses, or other items
realized by the Company for Income Tax purposes solely with respect to any
Buyer Closing Date

 



61

    

 Transaction as occurring on the day immediately following the Closing Date
and to utilize the "next day rule" in Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) (or any similar provision of state, local, or non-U.S.
Law) for purposes of reporting such items on applicable Tax Returns.

 

(v) That no election under Code Section 338(g) shall be made with respect
to the acquisition of the Purchased Shares.

(vi) That an election pursuant to Code Section 172(b)(3) shall be made to
waive the carryback of any net operating loss attributable to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period.

(vii) That no election shall be made by any party under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(2) (or any similar provision of state, local,
or non-U.S. Law) to ratably allocate items incurred by the Company.

(viii) The Equity Sellers shall cause the Company to (A) file an IRS Form
3115, Application for Change in Accounting Method, to change the Companys
capitalization method from the "simplified production method" pursuant to
Treasury Regulation Section 1.263A-2(b) to the "modified simplified
production method" pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.263A-2(c) for the
Tax period ending June 30, 2020 (the " _Capitalization Method Election_ ")
and (B) file, with respect to the Capitalization Method Election, an eligible
acquisition transaction election pursuant to Section 7.03(3)(d) of IRS
Revenue Procedure 2015-13 (the " _Eligible Acquisition Transaction Election_
"). The Equity Sellers shall cause the Company to accrue during the Pre-
Closing Tax Period all taxable income attributable to the Eligible
Acquisition Transaction Election. For the avoidance of doubt, the
determination of Closing Date Indebtedness shall include all Income Taxes
associated with the elections described in this paragraph.

(ix) The Sellers and the Company shall work with Buyer to resolve any
potential Liabilities, or minimize the expected impact of any potential
Liabilities or penalties, related to (A) the payment of Income Tax or value
added Tax arising out of the Representative Office and (B) the non-
capitalization of certain expenses.

(d) _Straddle Period Proration_. For the taxable year that includes the
Closing Date, for purposes of determining the amount of Taxes allocable to the
Sellers, to the extent applicable and permissible under Applicable Laws, the
parties agree to elect (and have the Company elect) to have each Tax year of
the Company to end on the Closing Date and, if such election is not permitted
or required in a jurisdiction with respect to a specific Tax such that the
Company is required to file a Tax Return for a Straddle Period, to utilize
the following conventions for determining the amount of Taxes attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date: (i) in the case
of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, the
amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall equal the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the
portion of the period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which
is the number of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; and (ii) in the
case of all other Taxes (including Income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment
Taxes, withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to the portion of the
Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined as if the
Company filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for the portion
of the Straddle Period ending as of the end of the day on the Closing Date
using a

 



62

    

 "closing of the books methodology." For purposes of applying the foregoing,
(A) any item determined on an annual or periodic basis (including amortization
and depreciation deductions) for Income Tax purposes shall be allocated to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the
relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and (B) any Tax or item of
income, gain, loss, deduction or credit solely from a Buyer Closing Date
Transaction shall be allocated to the portion of the Straddle Period beginning
on the day after the Closing Date.

 

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other such Taxes and fees (including any penalties and
interest), and all conveyance fees, recording charges and other such charges
incurred in connection with this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be
borne (i) solely by Sellers with respect to Transfer Taxes payable in
connection with (A) the acquisition of the Transferred Real Property and (B)
the indirect transfer of the Representative Office, and (ii) 50% by the
Sellers and 50% by Buyer with respect to all other Transfer Taxes. The
Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate to timely file all reasonably necessary Tax
Returns and other documentation with respect to all such Transfer Taxes and
shall reasonably cooperate with the applicable Taxing authority with
respect thereto.

(f) _Cooperation_. Buyer, the Company and each Seller shall (and shall
cause their respective Affiliates to) (i) assist in the preparation and
timely filing of any Tax Return of the Company and any Tax Return with respect
to the Transferred Real Property for any Pre-Closing Tax Period; (ii) assist
in any audit or other legal proceeding with respect to any Tax Return of the
Company and any Tax Return with respect to the Transferred Real Property for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period; and (iii) provide certificates or forms, and
timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate to establish
an exemption for (or reduction in) any Tax described in _Section_ __ _
6.17(e)_.

 

(g) _Tax Contests_. If any Governmental Entity issues to the Company (i) a
written notice of its intent to audit or conduct another legal proceeding
with respect to Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period or (ii) a notice of deficiency for Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period, Buyer shall notify the Seller Representative of its receipt of such
written communication from the Governmental Entity within 10 days of receipt.
The Company shall control any audit, examination or other legal proceeding in
respect of any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company (a " _Tax Contest_ ");
_provided_ , _however_ , with respect to a Tax Contest for a Pre-Closing Tax
Period, (A) Buyer shall not, and shall not allow the Company to, settle,
resolve, or abandon such Tax Contest without the prior written consent of the
Seller Representative, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or
delayed; (B) Buyer shall keep the Seller Representative duly informed with
respect to the commencement, status, and nature of any such Tax Contest; and
(C) if such Tax Contest would be reasonably likely to increase any Tax
Liability of the Sellers (including Taxes for which the Sellers are obligated
to indemnify a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to this Agreement), the Seller
Representative, at the Equity Sellers sole cost and expense, shall have the
right to participate in any such Tax Contest.

(h) _Refunds_. All refunds of Taxes of the Company, received on or prior
to the second anniversary of the Closing Date, solely with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period (including the portion of a Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date as determined in accordance with the same
principles provided for in _Section_ __ _ 6.17(d)_) (whether in the form of
cash received or

 



63

    

 a credit against Taxes otherwise payable) for Taxes paid by the Company
prior to the Closing Date or by the Equity Sellers pursuant to _Section_ __ _
6.17(a)_, and that are not the result of a carryback of an item or attribute
from a Post-Closing Tax Period, shall be for the benefit of the Sellers. To
the extent that Buyer or the Company receives a refund that is for the benefit
of the Sellers, Buyer shall pay to the Seller Representative for distribution
to the Sellers the amount of such refund (and interest actually received from
the Governmental Entity with respect to such refund). The amount due to the
Sellers shall be payable promptly after receipt of the refund from the
applicable Governmental Entity (or, if the refund is in the form of credit,
promptly after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such credit or offset)
net of any Taxes of Buyer or the Company attributable to such refund or
credit and reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in obtaining and paying
to Sellers such refund or credit described in this _Section_ __ _
6.17(h)_. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, to take all reasonable
actions necessary, or reasonably requested by the Seller Representative, at
the expense of Sellers, to timely claim any refunds that will give rise to a
payment under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.17(h)_ and, for the sole purpose of
obtaining a refund of German withholding Tax relating to dividends paid by
Serv Food to the Company pursuant to the Pre-Signing Restructuring, Buyer
shall cause the Company to keep the German Tax POA in place until such refund
is obtained from the applicable Governmental Entity. To the extent the
Companys federal Income Tax Return for the taxable year ending on
the Closing Date (as prepared and filed in accordance with _Section_ __ _
6.17(b)(i)_) reflects a net operating loss, an amount equal to the product of
(i) the amount of such net operating loss, and (ii) 21% shall be treated as
a refund giving rise to a payment under this _Section_ __ _ 6.17(h)_. If any
Tax refund paid to the Sellers pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.17(h)_ is
disallowed or required to be repaid to a Governmental Entity (in each case,
in whole or in part), the Sellers shall promptly reimburse Buyer for such
refund, _plus_ any interest and penalties payable therewith.

 

(i) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Company (other than agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business and not primarily related to
Taxes) shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and after the Closing Date,
Buyer and the Company shall not be bound thereby or have any Liability
thereunder.

(j) _280G_. No later than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing, the
Company will (i) submit to all Persons entitled to vote (as determined in
accordance with the Treasury Regulations under Code Section 280G (the " _280G
Vote_ ")) the material facts (the " _280G Disclosure_ ") concerning all
payments and benefits that the Company (after consultation with Buyer
following provision to Buyer of the Companys calculations and supporting
documentation) reasonably believes, in the absence of shareholder approval of
such payments and benefits, could be "excess parachute payments" within the
meaning of Code Section 280G(b)(1) (" _Potential_ _Parachute Payments_ "), in
accordance with Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B), and (ii) solicit the approval and
consent of all such Persons with respect to the Potential Parachute Payments.
Prior to the 280G Vote, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to cause each "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the
Code) who might receive any Potential Parachute Payments to execute and
deliver to the Company an agreement to waive his or her Potential Parachute
Payments unless the shareholders of the Company approve such payments
in accordance with the requirements of Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and
the regulations promulgated thereunder (a " _280G Waiver_ "), and such 280G
Waiver shall continue to be in effect immediately prior to the Closing.
Any Potential Parachute Payments for which the requisite

 



64

    

 shareholder approval under Code Section 280G(b)(5)(B) was not obtained
shall, in accordance with the 280G Waivers entered into by the affected
individuals, not be paid or provided for in any manner. The Company agrees to
provide Buyer written drafts of the 280G Waiver, the 280G Disclosure, and
other documents for the 280G Vote in advance of delivering such documents to
the disqualified individuals and the Companys shareholders, as applicable,
and allow Buyer a reasonable opportunity to provide reasonable comments on
such documents and the Company shall incorporate any such reasonable comments
into the documents.

 

6.18 _Exclusivity_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of (i) the termination of this
Agreement or (ii) the Closing, each Seller shall not (and shall not permit
the Company and each of their respective Affiliates, agents and
representatives to), directly or indirectly, encourage, solicit or initiate
discussions or negotiations with, or provide any information to, or waive,
terminate or modify any provision of any contractual "standstill" or similar
obligations of, any Person (other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) in
furtherance of any purchase, sale, transfer, merger, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, reorganization, recapitalization,
tender or exchange offer, joint venture, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving shares of capital stock of the Company, or otherwise
obtaining ownership or control of the Company, the Transferred Real Property
or any of the Assets or any other transaction or series of transactions that
could result in any Person other than Buyer (or its Affiliates) acquiring any
shares of capital stock of the Company, the Transferred Real Property or
Assets, or otherwise obtaining ownership or control of the Company, the
Transferred Real Property or any of the Assets, in each case, other than the
transactions described in this Agreement and other than sales of inventory
and other assets in the ordinary course of business (an " _Alternate
Transaction_ "). For purposes of the definition of "Alternate Transaction", a
Person also shall mean any group of Persons, including the equity holders of
any Person (other than Buyer and its Affiliates). Each Seller shall, and shall
cause such Sellers Affiliates (including the Company) to, cease immediately
all discussions and negotiations regarding any proposal that constitutes,
or may reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternate Transaction, and such
Seller shall promptly notify Buyer if any Person contacts such Seller or the
Company with respect to an Alternate Transaction.

 

(b) In addition to the other obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_,
the Sellers shall promptly (and in any event within two Business Days after
receipt thereof by any Seller or their representatives) advise Buyer orally
and in writing of any proposal received for an Alternate Transaction, any
request for information with respect to any Alternate Transaction, or any
inquiry with respect to or which would reasonably be expected to result in an
Alternate Transaction.

 

(c) Each Seller agrees that the rights and remedies for noncompliance with
this _Section_ __ _ 6.18_ shall include having such provision specifically
enforced by any court having equity jurisdiction, it being acknowledged and
agreed that any such breach or threatened breach shall cause irreparable
injury to Buyer and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy
to Buyer.

6.19 _Audited Financial Statements; Cooperation_. After the date
hereof, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts, at Buyers
cost and expense, to assist and cooperate with Buyer upon Buyers reasonable
request and as reasonably necessary to permit Buyers preparation, 

 



65

    

 within 45 days after the Closing Date, of audited and unaudited financial
statements of the Company for such periods and containing such information
sufficient to permit Buyer to comply with the requirements of Regulations S-K
and S-X promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the Sellers will not be deemed to
have breached its obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6.19_ unless the
Sellers have materially breached their obligations under this _Section_ __ _
6.19_.

 

6.20 _Lien Releases_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use
commercially reasonably efforts to facilitate the release of any Lien (other
than Permitted Encumbrances) on the Assets, Transferred Real Property and
other properties of the Company, that first arises following the date hereof.

 

6.21 _Estoppels_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall use its

effectuate filings reasonably necessary in connection with the replacement of
the authorized signatory and representative of the Representative Office; 
_provided_ , that the current signatories and representatives as specified by
the Company shall remain authorized signatories and representatives through
the Closing Date. Buyer shall not, and shall cause such signatories and
representatives it appoints not to, take any action by or on behalf of the
Company in respect of the Representative Office prior to the Closing Date. In
the event this Agreement is terminated prior to Closing, Buyer shall promptly
take all action necessary and make such filings and notices as may be
required or requested by the Company to remove any authorized signatories and
representatives appointed by Buyer pursuant to this Section 6.22, without
liability to the Company or the Sellers.

 

6.23 _Title Company Documentation_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company, DDS and HPS shall use commercially reasonable efforts (but excluding
making payments to any third party or incurring any obligation to provide
indemnification) to deliver to Buyer all documentation the Title Company may
reasonably request in order to be committed to issue to the Company the DDS
Title Policy and HPS Title Policy, as applicable.

Matter Escrow Amount; and

 

(iv) _fourth_ , solely to the extent such Losses or any portion thereof
relate to breaches or inaccuracies of Fundamental Representations,
Indemnified Taxes or the item in _Section_ __ _ 8.2(g)_ and either (i) the
Representation and Warranty Insurance is not sufficient to cover the amount of
such Losses (excluding Losses covered by or applied to any deductible or
retention amount thereunder), or (ii) such Losses are not covered by the
Representation and Warranty Insurance, then the Buyer Indemnified Parties
shall recover such Losses from the Sellers.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, except as otherwise set
forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(e)(ii)_, in no event shall the Sellers have any
Liability for Losses pursuant to (i) _ Section_ __ _ 8.2(b)_, until the

source of recovery for Sellers indemnity and defense obligations
therefor; (iii) _ Section_ __ _ 8.2(g)_ after the Scheduled Matter Release
Date; and (iv) _ Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_ until the Buyer Indemnified Parties
have recovered such Losses first, from the Representation and Warranty
Insurance and second, from the then remaining Indemnification Escrow Amount;
_provided,_ that in no event shall any Buyer Indemnified Party be permitted to
recover any amounts in excess of the then remaining Indemnification
Escrow Amount from Sellers in respect of _Section_ __ _ 8.2(d)_ to the
extent such Losses for Indemnified Taxes thereunder relate to the Excluded
Liabilities; _provided_ , _further_ , that the foregoing limitation in 
_clause (ii)_ above shall not apply to any Excluded Representation that is
also an Indemnified Tax.

 



71

    

(d) The maximum Liability for all Losses for which indemnification
is sought under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall not exceed, in the aggregate, the
Purchase Price; _provided_ , _that_ , such limitations, or any other
limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ , shall not apply in the case
of Fraud. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall
any Sellers Liability under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents exceed, in the aggregate, an amount equal to the proceeds received
by such Seller hereunder; _provided_ , _that_ , such limitations, or any
other limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ , shall not apply in the
case of Fraud.

 

(e) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not
be entitled to indemnification under this Agreement if and to the extent that
the Losses are reflected on the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and
are paid by the Sellers as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.7_ and (ii) the
order of priority set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(b)_ and the other
limitations set forth in this _Article VIII_ shall not apply to the payment by
the Sellers of any amounts owed to Buyer as reflected in the Final Purchase
Price Adjustment Statement or pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.17(b)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 6.17(e)_, which amounts are to be paid directly by the Sellers
as set forth therein. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in
calculating the Closing Date Working Capital, no reserve with respect to the
Excluded Liabilities or the Scheduled Matter shall be included. For the
avoidance of doubt, the indemnity under _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ shall not include
any Losses paid prior to 11:59 p.m. on the date immediately preceding the
Closing Date (to the extent such Losses paid have in fact reduced the amount
of Company Cash at Closing).

 

(f) The amount of Losses shall be determined net of any amounts actually
received by the Buyer Indemnified Parties under insurance policies.

8.5 _Notice of Loss; Third-Party Claims_.

 

(a) An Indemnified Party shall promptly give the Indemnifying Party written
notice in reasonable technical and legal detail of any matter which an
Indemnified Party has determined has given, or could give, rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, stating the amount of the Loss, if
known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference to the
provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of indemnification
is claimed or arises.

(b) If an Indemnified Party shall receive notice from a third party of any
action, audit, demand or assessment against it (each, a " _Third-Party Claim_
"), which could give rise to a claim for Loss under this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party shall promptly give the Indemnifying Party written notice
in reasonable detail of such Third-Party Claim, stating the amount of the
Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing a reference
to the provisions of this Agreement in respect of which such right of
indemnification is claimed or arises, together with copies of all notices and
documents served on or received by the Indemnified Party and its
representatives in respect thereof. A failure by the Indemnified Party
to give notice in a timely manner pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.5(b)_
shall not limit the obligation of the Indemnifying Party under this Agreement,
except to the extent such Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced
thereby. The Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to assume and control the
defense of such

 



72

    

 Third-Party Claim at its expense (which, for the avoidance of doubt, (i) for
such matters for which the Indemnification Escrow Amount is the sole course of
recovery, shall be paid from the Indemnity Escrow Account and (ii) for the
Scheduled Matter, shall be paid from the Scheduled Matter Escrow Account until
the Scheduled Matter Escrow Amount is depleted and then paid by the
Indemnifying Party) and through counsel of its choice, if it gives notice of
its intention to do so to the Indemnified Party within 30 days of the receipt
of such notice from the Indemnified Party, it being understood that such
election shall be without prejudice to the rights of the Indemnifying
Party to dispute whether such claim involves recoverable or indemnifiable
Losses under this Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party elects to undertake any
such defense against a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party may
participate in such defense at its own expense. The Indemnified Party shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense and make available to
the Indemnifying Party, at the Indemnifying Partys expense, all witnesses,
pertinent records, materials and information in the Indemnified Partys
possession or under the Indemnified Partys control relating thereto (or in
the possession or control of any of its representatives) as is reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party or its counsel. The Indemnified Party
shall not admit any Liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge any Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to settle any Third-
Party Claim (i)(A) for which it obtains a full release of the Indemnified
Party from all Liabilities in respect of such Third-Party Claim, and (B) the
settlement of which does not involve any relief other than money damages
which will be paid by the Indemnifying Party or (ii) the settlement of which
the Indemnified Party consents to in writing (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

 

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Third-Party Claim that is a Tax
Contest shall be governed by  _Section_ __ _ 6.17(g)_ and not _subsections
(a)_ and _(b)_ of this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_.

 

8.6 _Exclusive Remedy_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary other than
with respect to the Surviving Covenants,  _Article IX_ and _Article XI_ , (i)
for any and all Losses arising out of any breaches of the representations and
warranties of the Sellers or any breaches of covenants of the Sellers that do
not require performance following the Closing, in each case made in this
Agreement or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto, Buyer shall be
entitled to recovery solely and exclusively from the Representation and
Warranty Insurance or the Indemnification Escrow Amount (solely to the extent
permitted pursuant to this _Article VIII_ and subject to the limitations set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 8.4_), other than the Fundamental Representations,
the Indemnified Taxes or the item in  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(g)_, (ii) in no
event shall the Sellers be liable for any indemnification or other payment to
Buyer under or in connection with this Agreement except as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.17(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.17(e)_ and
this _Article VIII_ , and (iii) in no event shall Buyer have any right to seek
any indemnification, payment or any other recourse of any type, under or in
connection with, this Agreement (A) from the Sellers, other than as set forth
in _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, _Section_ __ _ 6.17(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.17(e)_
and this _Article VIII_ , or (B) from any other Person (including any past,
present or future director, officer, employee, manager, member, partner,
equityholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney or other representative of the
Company or the Sellers) that is not expressly named as a Party to this
Agreement; _provided_ , _that_ such limitations shall not apply in the case of
Fraud and, for the avoidance of doubt, either Party may seek specific
performance to enforce the provisions set forth in this Agreement.

 



73

    

(b) From and after the Closing, except as otherwise set forth in 
_Section_ __ _ 1.7_ or this _Article VIII_ , the rights provided under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance shall be the sole and exclusive remedy
of Buyer with respect to any and all claims arising out of or relating to the
Sellers representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement, other
than the Fundamental Representations and the Indemnified Taxes, and no other
remedy shall be available pursuant to any contract, misrepresentation, strict
liability or tort theory by Buyer and its officers, directors, employees,
agents, Affiliates, attorneys, consultants, insurers, successors and assigns
related thereto or related to Buyers investigation of the Company and the
Transferred Real Property, all such remedies being hereby expressly waived to
the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law; _provided that_ such
limitations shall not apply in the case of Fraud. In addition to the
foregoing, except with respect to the Surviving Covenants or as otherwise set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 1.7_, _Section_ __ _ 6.17(b)_, _Section_ __ _
6.17(e)_, this _Article VIII_ , _Article IX_ or _Article XI_ , Buyer shall not
be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement (or any related agreements) or
any further indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever, all of
which are hereby expressly waived by Buyer to the fullest extent permitted
under Applicable Law (except to the extent otherwise expressly set forth
herein); _provided that_ such limitations shall not apply in the case of
Fraud. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement
shall operate to limit the Liability of the Sellers or Buyer for Fraud.

8.7 _Additional Indemnification Matters_.

 

(a) For purposes of determining whether there has been any breach of a
representation or warranty, and for purposes of determining the amount of
Losses resulting therefrom, all qualifications or exceptions in any
representation or warranty or the definition of any defined term used therein
relating to or referring to the terms "material", "materiality", "in all
material respects", "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase
shall be disregarded, it being the understanding of the Parties that for
purposes of determining Liability under  _Article VIII_ , the representations
and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall be read as if
such terms and phrases were not included in them.

 

(b) The right of any Party to indemnification, reimbursement or other
remedy under this Agreement shall not be affected by any investigation
(including any environmental investigation or assessment) conducted with
respect to, or any knowledge acquired (or capable of being acquired) at any
time, whether before, on or after the Closing Date, with respect to
the accuracy or inaccuracy of or compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement or otherwise with
respect to the transactions set forth in this Agreement.

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
limitations (including any survival limitations and other limitations set
forth in this _Article VIII_ ), qualifications or procedures in this Agreement
shall be deemed to limit or modify the ability of Buyer to make claims under
or recover under the Representation and Warranty Insurance; it being
understood that any matter for which there is coverage available under the
Representation and Warranty Insurance shall be subject to the terms,
conditions and limitations, if any, set forth in the Representation and
Warranty Insurance.

 



74

    

(d) Within five Business Days after the Release Date, the Escrow Agent
shall release the sum of (i) any funds remaining in the Indemnification Escrow
Amount _plus_ any interest earned thereon (the " _Indemnity Escrow Account_ ")
as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the Release Date  _minus_ (ii) the
amount of all Unsatisfied Escrow Claims, to or at the direction of the Seller
Representative. At any time following the Release Date, to the extent the
amount of funds contained in the Indemnity Escrow Account exceeds
the Unsatisfied Escrow Claims amount, the excess funds in the Indemnity
Escrow Account shall be promptly released to or at the direction of the Seller
Representative. " _Unsatisfied Escrow Claims_ " shall mean the aggregate
amount of any and all claims for indemnification by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ that (x) were asserted in good faith
by the delivery of a claim notice to the Seller Representative prior to, and
are pending on, the Release Date or (y) have been finally determined in favor
of the Buyer Indemnified Parties, but which have not been fully paid to such
Buyer Indemnified Parties as of the Release Date. Buyer and the Seller
Representative shall deliver joint written instructions to the Escrow Agent
instructing the Escrow Agent to make any distributions from the Indemnity
Escrow Account provided for herein.

 

(e) Within five Business Days after the Scheduled Matter Release Date, the
Escrow Agent shall release the sum of (i) any funds remaining in the
Scheduled Matter Escrow Amount _plus_ any interest earned thereon (the "
_Scheduled Matter Escrow Account_ ") as of 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the
Scheduled Matter Release Date to or at the direction of the Seller
Representative. Buyer and the Seller Representative shall deliver joint
written instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to make
the distribution from the Scheduled Matter Escrow Account provided
for herein.

(f) The Sellers and Buyer agree to treat any payment made pursuant to this
_Article VIII_ as an adjustment to the Base Purchase Price for federal,
state, local and non-U.S. Income Tax purposes.

 

8.8 _Specified Litigation_.

 

(a) For purposes of the Specified Litigation, " _Losses_ " shall mean the
aggregate of: (i) any settlement payments due to the counterparty to the
Specified Litigation or money damages awarded to the counterparty to the
Specified Litigation by a court, in each case to the extent paid or payable by
a Buyer Indemnified Party, _plus_  (ii) the Defense Costs. " _Defense Costs_
" shall mean the fees, costs and expenses incurred by the Buyer Indemnified
Parties (including attorneys, consultants and experts fees, costs and
expenses) in the investigation, settlement, negotiation or defense of the
Specified Litigation. Defense Costs do not include any salaries, benefits or
other compensation for officers or employees of any of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties or the Sellers who are parties to the Consulting Agreements.

(b) The Seller Representative shall include the Company and the Buyer
Indemnified Parties in all material decisions with respect to the defense,
prosecution, investigation, strategy, negotiation and settlement of the
Specified Litigation. The Seller Representative, with consent of the Company
and the Buyer Indemnified Parties, which consent (i) shall not be
unreasonably withheld and (ii) may only be revoked in the event Buyer
reasonably determines that the Losses arising from or related to the Specified
Litigation, including the Defense Costs, are reasonably expected to exceed
the minimum range amounts that the Sellers have informed the

 



75

    

 Buyer may be required to settle the Specified Litigation, may lead the
Specified Litigation with counsel of its choosing, which counsel shall be
reasonably acceptable to Buyer, and may settle the Specified Litigation so
long as any settlement meets the criteria in the last sentence of _Section_ __
_ 8.5(b)_. In the event that the Company and the Buyer Indemnified Parties
revoke their consent in accordance with the second sentence of this _Section_
__ _ 8.8(b)_, then the Company and the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall have
the right to control all aspects of the Specified Litigation thereafter. For
the avoidance of doubt, the fees and expenses of such counsel from and after
the Closing shall be invoiced to and incurred by the Company and included as
"Defense Costs."

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, prior to
the Closing, without requiring any consent of Buyer, the Company may, in its
sole discretion, settle in full or in part, or otherwise compromise the
Specified Litigation, so long as such settlement or compromise involves only a
monetary payment that, together with all unpaid Defense Costs, will be paid
in full prior to 11:59 P.M. on the date immediately prior to the Closing Date
(to the extent such Losses paid have in fact reduced the amount of Company
Cash at Closing) and (i) does not include any statement or admission of
fact regarding culpability of, or a failure to act by or on behalf of, the
Company, (ii) does not involve any injunctive relief against the Company and
(iii) provides for a complete release and dismissal with prejudice of the
claims that are the subject of Specified Litigation.

(d) Buyer shall take commercially reasonable actions (and shall cause
the Company to take commercially reasonable actions), excluding instituting a
Proceeding against any insurance carrier with respect to such carriers
obligations in respect of the Specified Litigation, to pursue from the
Companys insurance carrier under the Companys existing insurance policy
that covers the Specified Litigation, with the cost and expenses of pursuing
such coverage (" _Insurance Costs_ ") to be included as Losses from the
Specified Litigation. To the extent proceeds from such insurance coverage are
received after the Buyer Indemnified Parties have been indemnified therefor
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(f)_, Buyer shall cause proceeds to be remitted
to the Sellers, net of any Insurance Costs, or deposited in the Indemnity
Escrow Account if prior to the Release Date. In the event the Specified
Litigation is settled prior to the Closing Date, Buyer shall cause any
proceeds received from such insurance coverage to be remitted to the Sellers,
net of any Insurance Costs.

8.9 _Scheduled Matter_. Buyer shall take commercially reasonable actions
(and shall cause the Company to take commercially reasonable actions),
excluding instituting a Proceeding against any insurance carrier with respect
to such carriers obligations in respect of the Scheduled Matter, to
pursue from the Companys insurance carrier under the Companys existing
insurance policies that cover the Scheduled Matter, with Insurance Costs to be
included as Losses from the Scheduled Matter. To the extent proceeds from such
insurance coverage are received after the Buyer Indemnified Parties have been
indemnified therefor pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.2(g)_, Buyer shall cause
proceeds to be remitted to the Sellers, net of any Insurance Costs, or
deposited in the Scheduled Matter Escrow Account if prior to the Scheduled
Matter Release Date. For the avoidance of doubt, the Scheduled Matter shall be
deemed a Third-Party Claim.

ARTICLE IX

 

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS

 

9.1 _Restrictive Covenants_.

 

(a) To further induce Buyer to purchase the Purchased Shares, and in
consideration of the payments by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement, each
Seller agrees, separately and not jointly, to the restrictive covenants
contained herein:

 

(i) Each Seller hereby agrees that such Seller shall not, during the period
beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of the
Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_ "), directly or indirectly, for such
Sellers own account, as a partner or joint venturer with any other Person or
as an employee, officer, agent, manager, representative or member of any
corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association or other
Person (i) compete with or (ii) own, manage, operate, control or participate
in the ownership (other than (A) as a minority shareholder of any corporation
or other entity the securities of which are publicly held or traded or (B) as
a passive investor, holding not more than 2% of any class of equity
securities, of such an entity which is not publicly traded), management,
operation or control of any corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, proprietorship, association or other Person that competes with,
the Company by providing or offering to provide to any Person within the
United States (the " _Restricted Territory_ "), any services or goods that
are the same or substantially similar to, and in competition with, the Company
Products offered by the Company in the Business during the 18 months prior to
the Closing Date.

 

(ii) Each Seller hereby agrees that such Seller shall not, within the
Restricted Territory and during the Restricted Period, directly or
indirectly, for such Sellers own account, as a partner or joint venturer with
any other Person or as an employee, officer, agent, manager, representative or
member of any corporation, limited liability company,
partnership, association or other Person, (A) solicit, induce or influence
any Person who was a Customer of the Company within 18 months prior to the
Closing Date to discontinue, reduce the extent of, or otherwise interfere with
such Persons relationship with the company; or (B) transact business with
any Customer of the Company if the purpose of such transaction is to provide
any services or goods that are the same or substantially similar to, and in
competition with, the Company Products offered by the Company in the Business
during the 18 months prior to the Closing Date. For purposes of this
Agreement, a Customer of the Company is a Person who purchased Company
Products from the Company during the 18 months prior to the Closing Date.

(iii) Each Seller hereby agrees that such Seller shall not, during the
period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the third anniversary of
the Closing Date, directly or indirectly, for such Sellers own account, as a
partner or joint venturer with any other Person or as an employee, officer,
agent, manager, representative or member of any corporation, limited
liability company, partnership association or other Person, recruit or solicit
any person who was an employee of the Company as of the Closing Date to leave
the Company for the purpose of working for any Person, unless such employees
employment has been terminated by the Company after Closing or more than 180
days shall have passed since the employees voluntary termination of his or
her employment with the Company.

 



77

    

(iv) Each Seller hereby agrees that such Seller shall not, within the
Restricted Territory and during the Restricted Period, directly or indirectly,
for such Sellers own account, as a partner or joint venturer with any other
Person or as an employee, officer, agent, manager, representative or member of
any corporation, limited liability company, partnership, association or other
Person, solicit, induce or influence any person who was a Vendor of the
Company, Supplier of the Company, or lessor or landlord of the Company within
the 18 months prior to the Closing Date to discontinue, reduce the extent of,
discourage the development of, or otherwise interfere with such Persons
relationship with the Company. For purposes of this Agreement, a Vendor or
Supplier of the Company is a Person who sold or provided, in exchange for
compensation, services or goods to the Company during the 18 months prior to
the Closing Date that are essential to the manufacturing and production of
Company Products. The terms of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)(iv)_ shall not
apply to providers or sellers of non-essential, ancillary items, such as
office supplies and other items typically purchased by persons or entities
not engaged in the Business.

(b) Each of the covenants and agreements by the Sellers contained in 
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ shall be deemed to be and construed as a covenant and
agreement independent of any other provision of this Agreement. Each Seller
acknowledges and agrees with respect to himself that the covenants set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ are reasonable and necessary for the
protection of the Business and the business of Buyer, that Buyer shall sustain
irreparable injury in the event of a breach or threatened breach by such
Seller of any of such covenants and agreements and that Buyer does not and
shall not have an adequate remedy at law for any such breach or threatened
breach. Accordingly, each Seller consents and agrees for such Seller that, if
such Seller breaches or threatens to breach any such covenant or agreement,
Buyer shall be entitled to immediate injunctive relief and to specific
performance and that no Seller shall assert in any action or Proceeding the
defense or claim that Buyer has an adequate remedy at law. The foregoing
shall not, however, be deemed to limit the remedies of Buyer for any such
breach or threatened breach. Any claims with respect to a breach of the
provisions set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_ must be made (if at
all) within 18 months after the expiration of the applicable restricted
period.

(c) Each Seller covenants and agrees that, if such Seller violates any of
the covenants or agreements set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_, in addition
to any and all other remedies available to Buyer, Buyer shall be entitled to
an accounting and repayment of all profits, compensation or benefits which
any Seller, directly or indirectly, has realized or may realize in connection
with any such violation; reasonable attorneys fees and costs; and such
remedies shall be in addition to and not in limitation of any injunctive
relief, and/or other rights or remedies to which Buyer is or may be entitled
at law or in equity or under this Agreement.

 

(d) In the event that any of the provisions of _Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_, 
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_ or _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_, shall be held to be
invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of such Sections shall
nevertheless continue to be valid and enforceable as though the invalid or
unenforceable parts had not been included therein. In the event that the scope
of the restricted activities set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.1_ shall be
found by a court, as set forth in  _Section_ __ _ 11.12,_ to exceed the
maximum restriction on activities such court deems reasonable and enforceable,
such scope of activities or geographical area shall be modified by the court
and shall be deemed to become and thereafter shall be the maximum scope of
activities which such court deems reasonable and enforceable.

 



78

    

(e) Each Seller has carefully read and considered the provisions of 
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(a)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.1(b)_, _Section_ __ _ 9.1(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.1(d)_ and, having done so, agrees that the restrictions set
forth in such Sections are fair and reasonable and are reasonably required
for the protection of the interests of Buyer and its officers, directors, and
other employees and that such restrictions are not violative of any public
policy.

 

9.2 _Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Each Seller acknowledges that the success of the Company and the
Business after the Closing depends upon the continued preservation of the
confidentiality of certain information possessed by Sellers, that the
preservation of the confidentiality of such information by Sellers is an
essential premise of the bargain among Sellers and Buyer, and that
Buyer would be unwilling to enter into this Agreement in the absence of this
_Section_ __ _ 9.2_. Accordingly, each Seller hereby agrees that such Seller
shall not, without the prior written consent of Buyer, disclose to any Person,
or use in a manner that would result in a breach of any of Sellers covenants
hereunder, any of Buyers Confidential Information or, following Closing, any
of the Companys Confidential Information. For purposes of this  _Section_ __
_ 9.2_, " _Confidential Information_ " means, with respect to Buyer or the
Company (as applicable) any information belonging or pertaining to such Person
that is confidential or proprietary to such Person, including, (i) in the
case of Buyer: (A) the identity of Buyer, and (B) the terms and conditions
upon which Buyer employs its employees and independent contractors; (ii) in
the case of the Company, (A) the Companys Customers and their purchasing
histories, (B) the Company vendors or potential vendors, and the terms or
proposed terms upon which the Company may purchase products and services from
such vendors, (C) the terms and conditions upon which the Company employs its
employees and independent contractors; (D) technology used by the Company to
provide its services, (E) private information concerning the Companys
Customers that a Seller learns in the course of such Sellers ownership of
the Company, including any trade secrets and proprietary information involving
the Company Products, and (F) information provided to the Company by third
parties under a duty to maintain the confidentiality of such information; and
(iii) in the case of Buyer and the Company, such partys (A) marketing and/or
business plans and strategies, and (B) financial reports and analyses
regarding the revenues, expenses, profitability and
operations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information does not
include information that: (i) has been voluntarily disclosed to the public by
Buyer or the Company (as applicable), except where such public disclosure has
been made by a Seller after Closing without authorization from the Company;
(ii) has been independently developed and disclosed by others; or (iii) which
has otherwise entered the public domain through lawful means. Further, the
provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_ will not prohibit (a) any retention
of copies of records or disclosure (i) required by any Applicable Law so long
as reasonable prior notice is given to Buyer of such disclosure and a
reasonable opportunity is afforded to Buyer to contest the same, (ii)
required by any federal or state securities law or (iii) made in connection
with the enforcement of any right or remedy relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby or the defense of such enforcement by any
other party or (b) the disclosure of information in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 11.11_. In the event that any Seller or Affiliate thereof becomes
legally compelled to disclose any Confidential Information, such Seller or
Affiliate thereof will notify Buyer promptly in writing of such requirement so
that Buyer may seek (at Buyers sole cost) a protective order or other
appropriate remedy or, in Buyers sole discretion, waive compliance with the
terms of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_. In the event that no such protective order
or other remedy is obtained, or that Buyer waives compliance with the terms of
this  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, each

 



79

    

 Seller or Affiliate thereof, as the case may be, will furnish only that
portion of the Confidential Information which such Seller or Affiliate thereof
is advised by counsel is legally required and will exercise commercially
reasonable efforts, at Buyers sole expense, to obtain reliable assurance that
confidential treatment will be accorded such furnished Confidential
Information.

 

(b) Each Seller agrees that such Seller shall not, directly or indirectly,
divulge or make use of any Confidential Information of Buyer or, after the
Closing, the Company. Each Seller shall make all reasonable efforts to protect
and maintain the confidentiality of the Confidential Information of Buyer and,
following the Closing, the Company. In the event that a Seller becomes aware
of unauthorized disclosures of Buyers Confidential Information or, following
Closing, the Companys Confidential Information, by anyone at any time,
whether intentionally or by accident, such Seller shall promptly notify Buyer
and, following Closing, the Company.

(c) The Parties acknowledge and agree that the success of the Company and
the Business depends upon the continued preservation of the confidentiality of
certain information possessed by Sellers, the Company, Buyer, or their
Affiliates, that the preservation of the confidentiality of such information
by the Parties is an essential premise of the bargain among Sellers and
Buyer, and that the each Party would be unwilling to enter into this Agreement
in the absence of this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_. Accordingly, the Parties
acknowledge that the information provided to it or its representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, including
in connection with any diligence (whether prior to, on or after the Closing
Date) is subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, the terms of
which are incorporated herein by reference and binding on Sellers and Buyer.
In the event Closing does not occur, the Parties will remain bound by this
provision and the Confidentiality Agreement in accordance with its terms.
Effective upon, and only upon, the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement will
terminate.

ARTICLE X

 

TERMINATION

 

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby may be terminated prior to the Closing:

(a) by mutual written consent of Buyer and the Seller Representative, on
behalf of the Sellers;

 

(b) by either Buyer, on the one hand, or the Seller Representative, on the
other:

 

(i) if there shall have been any breach by the other Party (which, in the
case of the right of termination by Buyer, shall also include any breach by
Sellers or the Company) of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
set forth in this Agreement, which breach (a) would give rise to the failure
of a condition to the Closing hereunder in the favor of the terminating party
and (b) in the case of a termination by Buyer, cannot be cured, or has not
been cured within 20 days (the " _Cure Period_ "), following receipt by the
Seller Representative of written notice of such breach; 

 



80

    

(ii) if a court of competent jurisdiction or other Governmental Entity
shall have issued an order, decree or ruling or taken any other action, in

Agreement under this _Section_ __ _ 10.1(b)(iii)_ shall not be available to
any Party whose breach of any representation or warranty or whose failure to
perform or observe in any material respect any covenant or obligation
contained in this Agreement has been the cause of or resulted in the failure
of the Closing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to occur on
or before the Termination Date.

Any termination pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 10.1_ (other than a
termination pursuant to clause (a) hereof) shall be effected by written notice

officers, directors, managers, members, employees, agents or equityholders,
except (a) _ Article X_, _Article XI_ and _Exhibit A_ shall survive such
termination and (b) subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8.6_, the Liability of any
Party for any material and intentional breach prior to such termination by
such Party of the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of such
Party set forth in this Agreement occurring prior to the termination of this
Agreement shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the non-
breaching Party (and if the Sellers are the non-breaching Party, then the
Sellers acting through the Seller Representative) shall be entitled to pursue
any and all legally available remedies and to seek the recovery of all Losses,
Liabilities, damages, costs and expenses of every kind and nature including
reasonable attorneys fees, in each case relating to such material and
intentional breach.

MISCELLANEOUS

 

11.1 _Amendment and Waiver_. This Agreement may only be amended if such
amendment is set forth in a writing executed by Buyer and the Seller
Representative (on behalf of the Sellers). Except as otherwise set forth
herein, no waiver of any provision of this Agreement or any default,
misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or covenant hereunder,
whether intentional or not, shall be binding unless such waiver is in writing
and signed by the Party against whom such waiver is to be enforced. No failure
by any Party to insist upon the strict performance of any covenant, duty,
agreement or condition of this Agreement or to exercise any right or remedy
with respect to a breach thereof shall constitute a waiver of any such breach

Representative, on the one hand, and the Buyer, on the other, may (a) extend
the time for performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other
Party; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of the
other Party contained herein or in any Transaction Document, or any other
document delivered by the other Party pursuant to this Agreement; or (c) waive
compliance with any of the agreements of the other Party or conditions to such
obligations contained herein, which, in each case, in the case of any such
extension or waiver by Buyer or the Seller Representative, shall include acts,
inaccuracies or compliance by Buyer, Sellers or the Company (as applicable).
No waiver shall be deemed to be, or shall constitute, a waiver of any other
provision of this Agreement, whether or not similar, nor shall waiver
constitute a continuing waiver unless expressly provided.

Agreement, each Party shall take all such necessary action. The Parties shall
execute any additional instruments reasonably necessary to consummate the
transactions described in this Agreement.

11.5 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision of this Agreement
will be interpreted in such a manner as to be effective and valid under
Applicable Laws, but if any provision of this Agreement is held to be
prohibited by or invalid under Applicable Laws, such provision will be
ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity, without
invalidating the remainder of such provision or the remaining provisions of
this Agreement which shall remain in full force and effect.

 

11.6 _Other Definitional Provisions_. The terms "hereof," "herein" and
"hereunder" and terms of similar import will refer to this Agreement as a
whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. Article, Section,
clause, subsection, subclauses, Exhibit and Schedule references contained in
this Agreement are references to Articles, Sections, clauses, subsections,
subclauses, Exhibits and Schedules in or attached to this Agreement, unless
otherwise specified. Each defined term used in this Agreement has a comparable
meaning when used in its plural or singular form. Each gender specific term
used in this Agreement has a comparable meaning whether used in a masculine,
feminine or gender neutral form. Whenever the terms "include" or "including"
are used in this Agreement (whether or not such terms are followed by the
phrase "but not limited to" or "without limitation" or words of similar
effect) in connection with a listing of items within a particular
classification, that listing will be interpreted to be illustrative only and
will not be interpreted as a limitation on, or an exclusive listing of, the
items within that classification. Each reference in this Agreement to any
Applicable Laws will be deemed to include such Applicable Laws as
it hereafter may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to time and
any successor thereto, unless such treatment would be contrary to the express
terms of this Agreement. Any term used but not defined in this Agreement shall
have the meaning given to such term in _Exhibit A_ , which _Exhibit A_ is

be United States dollars (unless a contrary intention appears) and will, when
the context allows, include equivalent amounts in other currencies. The word
"extent" in the phrase "to the extent" shall mean the degree to which
a subject or other thing extends and such phrase shall not mean "if."

11.7 _Captions_. The captions used in this Agreement are for convenience
of reference only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement and will not
be deemed to limit, characterize or in any way affect any provision of this
Agreement, and all provisions of this Agreement will be enforced and
construed as if no caption had been used in this Agreement.

11.8 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and the
Schedules), the Transaction Documents, the agreements, documents, instruments
and certificates referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto, and the
Confidentiality Agreement contain the entire agreement between the Parties

subject matter hereof in any way.

executed and delivered (including by facsimile transmission or .pdf, .tif,

_Electronic Delivery_ ")) in one or more counterparts, all of which shall
be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one
or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and delivered to
the other Parties, it being understood that all Parties need not sign the same
counterpart. No Party hereto shall raise the use of Electronic Delivery to
deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument
was transmitted or communicated through the use of Electronic Delivery as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each Party forever waives any
such defense, except to the extent such defense relates to lack of
authenticity.

Exchange Commission on a timely basis following its execution and otherwise
make this Agreement available pursuant to applicable securities Laws and

warranties and agreements contained in this Agreement. Buyer, the Company and

86

    

11.16 _Rules of Construction_.

 

(a) Any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation
of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any Party that drafted it is of
no application and is hereby expressly waived.

(b) The inclusion of any information on the Company Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and
solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in the
Company Disclosure Schedule or that such items are material to the Company.
The headings, if any, of the individual sections of the Company Disclosure
Schedule are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to
constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Company Disclosure
Schedule is arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in _Article
IV_ merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of
the Company Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a particular
representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an
exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the
extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties
is reasonably apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence
or absence of an appropriate section of the Company Disclosure Schedule with
respect to such other representations or warranties or the presence or absence
of a reference thereto in either the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the
particular representation or warranty.

 

(c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and
warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Company Disclosure
Schedule is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or
acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same
be used in any dispute or controversy between the Parties to
determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described
herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement (other than with respect to any representation, warranty or
provision of this Agreement in which such specification occurs).

(d) The inclusion of any information on Buyers Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and
solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in Buyers Disclosure
Schedule, that such information is required to be listed in Buyers Disclosure
Schedule or that such items are material to Buyer. The headings, if any, of
the individual sections of Buyers Disclosure Schedule are inserted for
convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a
part of this Agreement. Buyers Disclosure Schedule is arranged in sections
corresponding to those contained in _Article V_ merely for convenience, and
the disclosure of an item in one section of Buyers Disclosure Schedule as an
exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed
adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations
or warranties contained in _Article V_ to the extent that the relevance of
such item to such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the
face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate
section of Buyers Disclosure Schedule with respect to such other
representations or warranties or a reference thereto in either
Buyers Disclosure Schedule or in the particular representation or warranty
in _Article V_.

(e) The inclusion of any information on the Sellers Disclosure Schedule
shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and
solely by virtue of the

 



87

    

 inclusion of such information in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule, that such
information is required to be listed in the Sellers Disclosure Schedule or
that such items are material to Sellers. The headings, if any, of the
individual sections of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule are inserted for
convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a
part of this Agreement. The Sellers Disclosure Schedule is arranged in
sections corresponding to those contained in _Article III_ merely for
convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Sellers
Disclosure Schedule as an exception to a particular representation
or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect
to all other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of
such item to such representations or warranties is reasonably apparent on the
face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate
section of the Sellers Disclosure Schedule with respect to such other
representations or warranties or the presence or absence of a reference
thereto in either the Sellers Disclosure Schedule or in the particular
representation or warranty.

11.17 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, the
Company, Buyer and the Sellers shall each pay all of their own fees, costs and
expenses (including fees, costs and expenses of legal counsel, investment
bankers, advisors, accountants, brokers or other representatives and
consultants and appraisal fees, costs and expenses) incurred by such Person in
connection with the preparation, negotiation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the other Transaction Documents, the performance of their
respective obligations hereunder and thereunder, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby; _provided that_ Buyer shall pay
the fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent and the fees and expenses for the
updated Phase I environmental site assessment reports for the Transferred
Real Property delivered by the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(h)_. In
addition, the Parties acknowledge that the Transaction Costs may include, and
the Company shall bear and pay at Closing, certain fees and expenses of the
Sellers.

11.18 _Enforcement_. The Parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur, for which no adequate remedy at law would exist and for which monetary
damages would be inadequate, in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a
timely basis or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that, prior
to a valid termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.1_,
the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions or other
equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement (including the
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
Buyers obligation to pay, and the right of the Sellers to receive, the
Closing Consideration Amount) in any court identified in _Section_ __ _
11.12_, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity.

 

11.19 _Conflicts and Privilege_. Buyer, the Sellers and the Company hereby
agree that, in the event a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or
the Company and the Sellers, Winston and Strawn LLP may represent the Sellers in
such dispute even though the interests of Sellers may be directly adverse to
the Company, and even though Winston and Strawn LLP may have represented the
Company in a matter substantially related to such dispute, or may be handling
ongoing matters for the Company. Buyer and the Company further agree that, as
to all communications between Winston and Strawn LLP, the Company and the
Sellers that relate in any way to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, the attorney-client, work product,

 



88

    

 business strategy or similar protection or privilege and the expectation of
client confidence belongs to the Sellers and may be controlled by the same,
and shall not transfer, pass to or be claimed or controlled by the Company or
Buyer notwithstanding the transfer of Common Stock hereunder; _provided that_
the Sellers shall not waive such attorney-client privilege other than to the
extent appropriate in connection with the enforcement or defense of their
respective rights or obligations existing under this Agreement and the other
Transaction Documents. Each of Buyer and, following the Closing, the Company,
for itself and their respective directors, managers, partners, members,
officers, employees and Affiliates, and each of their successors and assigns,
hereby further agree not to take any action that would result in any
subsequent waiver of the privilege respecting any such privileged
communication. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event a dispute arises
between Buyer or the Company and a Person other than the Sellers after the
Closing, the Company may assert the attorney-client privilege to prevent
disclosure of confidential communications by Winston and Strawn LLP to such
Person; _provided, however_ , that the Company may not waive such privilege
without the prior written consent of the applicable Seller, which consent will
not be unreasonably withheld.

 

11.20 _Release_.

 

(a) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, the Company, for
itself and on behalf of its shareholders, successors and assigns, hereby
fully and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges (i) the
applicable Sellers and (ii) all directors and officers of the Company holding
such position at any time prior to the Closing from any and all manner of
actions, causes of actions, claims, obligations, demands, damages, costs,
expenses, compensation or other relief, whether known or unknown, whether in
law or equity, of any kind, which the Company now has or has ever had
against such Persons, arising out of or relating to or accruing from (A) in
respect of the Sellers, such Sellers ownership of capital stock issued by the
Company, and (B) in respect of such directors and officers, for acts or
omissions on behalf of the Company or their relationship with the Company, in
each case other than with respect to any act of Fraud by such individual or
their respective obligations under this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents. The Company understands and agrees that it is expressly waiving
all claims against such Persons covered by this release including those claims
that it may not know of or suspect to exist which, if known, may have
materially affected the decision to provide this release, and the Company
expressly waives any rights under Applicable Law that provide to the contrary.

 

(b) Effective as of immediately prior to the Closing, each Seller hereby
fully and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever discharges the
Company, Buyer and each of their Affiliates, and their respective past and
present directors, managers, officers, employees and agents (individually, a
"releasee" and collectively, the "releasees"), in their capacity as such,
from any and all actions, causes of actions, claims, obligations, demands,
damages, costs, expenses, compensation or other relief, whether known or
unknown, whether in law or equity, of any kind, which such Seller now has
or has ever had against the releasees, arising out of or relating to or
accruing from such Sellers ownership of any equity securities issued by the
Company. The foregoing notwithstanding, the release and discharge provided for
herein shall not release (i) the Company, Buyer or any other releasee of
their respective obligations or Liabilities, if any, pursuant to this
Agreement or any other applicable Transaction Document, (ii) the Company of
any indemnification and/or exculpation obligations of the Company to such
Seller who is a current or former director or officer of the Company, in their
capacity as such, pursuant to the Companys

 



89

    

 articles of incorporation or bylaws or Applicable Law, or (iii) be deemed to
constitute a waiver of the availability of insurance to cover claims. Each
Seller understands and agrees that it is expressly waiving all claims against
the releasees covered by this release including those claims that it may not
know of or suspect to exist which, if known, may have materially affected the
decision to provide this release, and such Seller expressly waives any rights
under Applicable Law that provide to the contrary.

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, any Liability and/or obligations of a
Seller or the Sellers under this Agreement shall be a several Liability and/or
obligation of each such Seller, and nothing in this Agreement shall create
joint and several Liability of the Sellers except as set forth in _Article
IV_ and _Article VIII_.

11.21 _Seller Representative and Seller Representative Reserve Amount_.

(a) In order to administer efficiently the transactions contemplated hereby
and by the Transaction Documents, each Seller hereby irrevocably designates
and appoints the Seller Representative as its representative. Each Seller
hereby irrevocably grants the Seller Representative full unqualified power and
authority to delegate to one or more Persons the authority granted to it
hereunder and to act as true, lawful and exclusive agent and attorney-in-fact
for such Seller, with full power of substitution to do any and all things and
execute any and all documents which may be necessary, convenient or
appropriate to facilitate the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the completion of certain covenants set forth
herein, including:

(i) to execute (as applicable) and deliver the other Transaction Documents
on behalf of such Seller; 

(ii) to give or agree to, on behalf of the Sellers, any and all consents,
waivers, amendments or modifications deemed by the Seller Representative, in
its discretion, to be necessary or appropriate under this Agreement or the
other Transaction Documents and the execution or delivery of any documents
that may be necessary or appropriate in connection therewith;

(iii) to defend and/or settle any disputes with Buyer following the Closing
relating to this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents and negotiate
and compromise the same;

(iv) to agree to the Final Purchase Price Adjustment Statement and the
allocation of the purchase price among the Sellers pursuant to _Schedule_ __ _
A_;

 

(v) to authorize payment to Buyer of cash from the Purchase Price Escrow
Account, the Indemnity Escrow Account or the Scheduled Matter Escrow Account;

(vi) to engage attorneys, accountants, agents or consultants on behalf of
the Sellers in connection with this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents and paying any fees related thereto;

 



90

    

(vii) to terminate this Agreement in accordance with  _Section_ __ _
10.1_ and to seek any actions permitted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 10.2_ in
connection therewith, if applicable;

 

(viii) to take any actions relating to tax matters as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 6.17_; and

 

(ix) to take any and all additional action necessary or appropriate in the
good faith judgment of the Seller Representative for the accomplishment of
the foregoing or as is contemplated to be taken by or on behalf of such
Seller, by the terms of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
All decisions and actions by the Seller Representative shall be conclusive
and binding upon each Seller, and no such Seller shall have the right to
object, dissent, protest or otherwise contest the same. By execution of this
Agreement, each Seller agrees that Buyer and the Company shall be able to
rely conclusively on the instructions, actions and decisions of the Seller
Representative on behalf of Sellers pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 11.21_
(each, an " _Authorized Action_ ").

 

(b) The Seller Representative may act on the opinion or advice of, or
information obtained from, any attorney, banker, broker, accountant or other
expert and shall not be responsible for any Loss occasioned by so acting. The
Seller Representative shall not solely by reason of this agency arrangement
have any fiduciary relationship in respect of any Seller. In performing the

limit the Sellers or any group of Sellers from agreeing among themselves, with
the Seller Representative, to require certain Seller approvals for the Seller
