 ** _LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT_**

 



 

THIS LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the " _Agreement_
") is entered into on the 3rd day of December, 2013, by and among EGS
Electrical Group LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the " _Company_
"), Emerson Electric Co., a Missouri corporation (" _Buyer_ "), SPX
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and SPX Holding, Inc., a
Connecticut corporation (the " _Seller_ "). Each of the Company, Buyer, Parent
and the Seller are referred to herein as a " _Party_ " and together as the "
_Parties_."

 



 

 **RECITALS**

 



 

A. Apple JV Holding Corp., an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer, owns
55.5% (the " _Emerson Percentage_ ") of the limited liability company
interests of the Company.

 



 

B. The Seller owns 44.5% (the " _Seller Percentage_ ") of the limited
liability company interests of the Company (the " _Seller Interests_ "). The
Seller is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent.

 



 

C. Buyer desires to purchase from the Seller, on the following terms and
conditions, the Seller Interests.

 



 

D. The Seller desires to sell the Seller Interests to Buyer, on the following
terms and conditions.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the recitals and the mutual covenants,
representations, warranties, conditions, and agreements hereinafter contained
and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which are hereby acknowledged, and intending to be legally bound, the Parties
agree as follows:

 



 

 **ARTICLE I _ 
PURCHASE AND SALE_**

 



 

1.1 _The Seller Interests_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing (as hereinafter defined), the Seller shall
sell, assign, transfer, convey and deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase,
acquire and accept from the Seller, all right, title and interest in and to
the Seller Interests, free and clear of any Lien (as defined below). As used
in this Agreement, " _Lien_ " shall mean any lien, claim, encumbrance,
security interest, charge, pledge, or other restriction or adverse claim of
whatever nature, including without limitation for the avoidance of doubt, any
Tax lien, other than any restriction or obligation under the Amended and
Restated Limited Liability Agreement of the Company dated as of September 15,
1997, by and among the Company, Appleton Electric Co., Emerson Electric Co.,
General Signal Corporation and G.S. Building Systems Corporation (as such
agreement has been amended from time to time, the " _Company LLC Agreement_
").

 



      
 

 



 

1.2 _Consideration_.

 



 

The purchase price to be paid by Buyer for the Seller Interests (the "
_Purchase Price_ ") shall be an amount equal to (a) the product of
$1,275,000,000.00, _multiplied by_ the Seller Percentage, which product is
Five Hundred Sixty-Seven Million Three Hundred Seventy-Five Thousand Dollars
($567,375,000), plus (b) $3,335,000, plus (c) an amount equal to One Hundred
Eleven Thousand One Hundred Eleven Dollars ($111,111) per day multiplied by
the number of days from and including December 1, 2013 through the earlier of
(1) the day prior to the Closing Date or (2) December 31, 2013; provided that
if the Closing occurs after February 1, 2014, then the Purchase Price shall be
further increased by an amount equal to One Hundred Eleven Thousand One
Hundred Eleven Dollars ($111,111) per day multiplied by the number of days
from and including February 1, 2014 through the day prior to the Closing Date
(together with the amount set forth in clauses (a) and (b) above, the "
_Closing Payment_ "), plus (d) the Additional Consideration (as defined
below), if any.

 



 

1.3 _Additional Consideration_.

 



 

(a) In the event a Sale Transaction:

 



 

(i) is consummated with respect to all or substantially all of the Company and
the Subsidiaries;

 



 

(ii) the definitive agreement with respect to which is executed on or after
the date hereof and no later than forty-eight (48) months following the
Closing Date; and

 



 

(iii) where the Consideration (as defined below) exceeds $1,275,000,000 minus
the amount of any Consideration in any Sale Transaction involving a product
line of the Company or any Subsidiary (the " _Overall Threshold_ "), then

 



 

Buyer shall pay to the Seller, within three (3) business days after the
closing of the Sale Transaction, an amount equal to the Seller Percentage
_multiplied by_ the amount of the Consideration in excess of the Overall
Threshold. For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall there be any double
counting between a sale pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ and a sale pursuant to
_Section 1.3(b)_.

 



 

(b) In the event one or more Sale Transactions:

 



 

(i) is consummated with respect to one or more product lines of the Company or
any Subsidiary listed on _Schedule 1.3(b)(i)_ that cumulatively comprised
more than 15% of the total sales of the Company and the Subsidiaries for the
2013 fiscal year, which 15% is $77,623,605;

 



 

(ii) the definitive agreement with respect to which is executed on or after
the date hereof and no later than forty-eight (48) months following the
Closing Date; and

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) where the Consideration exceeds the Partial Threshold (as defined
below), then

 



 

Buyer shall pay to the Seller, within three (3) business days after the
closing of each such Sale Transaction, an amount equal to the Seller
Percentage multiplied by the amount of Consideration in such Sale Transaction
in excess of the Partial Threshold (the " _Product Line Purchase Price_ ").
For the avoidance of doubt, and in each instance as calculated using the
methodology reflected on _Schedule 1.3(b)(ii)_ , if Buyer sells pursuant to a
Sale Transaction one or more product lines of the Company or any Subsidiary
listed on _Schedule 1.3(b)(i)_ that did not cumulatively comprise more than
$77,623,605 of sales for the 2013 fiscal year, then the Seller shall not be
entitled to any payment for the sale of such product line(s) until Buyer sells
pursuant to one or more Sale Transactions additional product line(s) pursuant
to one or more definitive agreements executed within the period described in
_Section 1.3(b)(ii)_ above that, together with the product line(s) previously
sold, comprised more than $77,623,605 of sales for the 2013 fiscal year (the "
_15% Threshold_ "), at which time, Buyer shall pay to the Seller the Product
Line Purchase Price with respect to all such Sale Transactions. After Buyer
sells pursuant to a Sale Transaction one or more product lines listed on
_Schedule 1.3(b)(i)_ that cumulatively meet the 15% Threshold and pays to the
Seller the Product Line Purchase Price, if Buyer sells pursuant to a Sale
Transaction any additional product lines of the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries listed on _Schedule 1.3(b)(i)_ pursuant to one or more
definitive agreements executed within the period described in _Section
1.3(b)(ii)_ above, Buyer shall pay to the Seller the Product Line Purchase
Price with respect to each such additional product lines sold. An example of
the foregoing calculations is attached as _Schedule 1.3(b)(iii)_.

 



 

(c) As used herein, the following terms shall have the following meanings:

 



 

(i) " _Additional Consideration_ " shall mean any payments made pursuant to
_Section 1.3(a)_ or _Section 1.3(b)_. For all Tax purposes, all Additional
Consideration shall be treated by the Parties as adjustments to the Purchase
Price to the extent permitted by applicable law.

 



 

(ii) " _Consideration_ " shall mean (A) the total value of all cash,
securities and other property paid or payable, directly or indirectly, by an
acquirer to a seller or sellers in connection with a Sale Transaction
(including, without limitation, amounts paid, distributed or issued, or to be
paid, distributed or issued, to holders of common stock, preferred stock,
convertible securities, warrants, stock appreciation rights, options or
similar rights or securities or, in the case of a Sale Transaction, the form
of which is the contribution or other transfer of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (or portion thereof, including, without limitation, one or more
product lines), to a partnership, joint or collaborative venture or similar
arrangement (a " _Joint Venture_ "), the total value of that portion of the
product line, business or businesses of the Company or its Subsidiaries
contributed or to be contributed or transferred to such Joint Venture and
which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall not include any cash or other
property or rights contributed or transferred by Buyer or one of Buyers
Affiliates that is not the Company or its Subsidiaries to such Joint Venture),
and, in each case, any amounts paid in respect of covenants not to compete,
plus (B) the aggregate principal amount of all indebtedness for borrowed money
(including, without limitation, capitalized leases and preferred stock
obligations) outstanding immediately prior to consummation of a Sale
Transaction or

 



      
 

 



 

otherwise, directly or indirectly, assumed, refinanced (including without
limitation any premiums paid), extinguished or consolidated in connection with
such Sale Transaction. Consideration also shall include, in the case of a sale
of assets, the net book value of any working capital (other than cash) of the
seller of such assets not acquired in such Sale Transaction. If any portion of
Consideration is paid into escrow, related to future events (contingent or
otherwise) or subject to increase by payments related to future events, then
the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to determine pursuant to this
_Section 1.3_ how such Consideration, if any, shall be included in the
calculation of the amount. For purposes of computing Consideration hereunder,
non-cash consideration consisting of publicly traded securities shall be
valued at the average of their closing price for the five trading days
immediately prior to the closing of the Sale Transaction and any other non-
cash consideration shall be valued at the fair market value thereof as
determined in good faith by the Parties. If any amounts payable in a Sale
Transaction are computed in any currency other than U.S. Dollars, the value of
such currency for purposes hereof shall be converted into U.S. Dollars at the
prevailing exchange rate on the date on which such amounts are paid.

 



 

(iii) " _Partial Threshold_ " means the product of (A) $1,275,000,000,
_multiplied by_ (B) a fraction, the numerator of which is the sales for the
2013 fiscal year of the product line(s) being sold, and the denominator of
which is $517,492,000.

 



 

(iv) " _Sale Transaction_ " means, whether effected directly or indirectly or
in one or a series of transactions, the sale, transfer, exchange or other
disposition to a third party of all or a portion of the business, assets,
product lines or divisions of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each
case, whether by way of merger or consolidation, reorganization,
recapitalization or restructuring, tender or exchange offer, share exchange,
negotiated purchase, leveraged buyout or partnership, Joint Venture, business
combination or other transaction the substantive effect of which is a sale to
a third party of all or a portion of the business, assets, product lines or
divisions of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(v) " _Subsidiaries_ " means all of the Companys subsidiaries as the same may
exist from time to time.

 



 

(d) In the event of a dispute between the Seller and Buyer regarding this
_Section 1.3_, (i) Buyer shall pay to the Seller, within three (3) business
days after such closing of a transaction contemplated by _Section 1.3(a)_ or
_Section 1.3(b)_, the amount of Additional Consideration that Buyer believes
in good faith is owing to the Seller pursuant to _Section 1.3(a)_ or _Section
1.3(b)_, and (ii) the Seller and Buyer shall in good faith attempt to resolve
any such dispute, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall
be final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If the parties are
unable to resolve any such dispute within thirty (30) business days after a
closing of a Sale Transaction contemplated by _Section 1.3(a)_ or _Section
1.3(b)_, either party may submit the dispute for resolution to a nationally
recognized accounting firm acceptable to Buyer and the Seller which has done
no work for any Party for the last three years, or if none is selected by the
Parties, then a firm selected by the American Arbitration Association (the "
_Independent Accountant_ "). Promptly, but no later than twenty (20) business
days after the dispute is submitted to the Independent Accountant, the
Independent Accountant shall determine, based solely on presentations by the
Seller and Buyer, and not by

 



      
 

 



 

independent review, only those issues remaining in dispute and shall render a
report as to the dispute, and the resulting computation of the Additional
Consideration, if any, which shall be final, binding and conclusive on the
parties. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant incurred
in connection with the calculation of the Additional Consideration shall be
allocated between the Seller and Buyer in proportion to the amount by which
their respective determinations of the Additional Consideration differed from
the amount determined by the Independent Accountant at the time the
determination of the Independent Accountant is rendered on the determination
of the Additional Consideration, provided that each of the Seller and Buyer
shall bear its own counsel, expert and accounting fees. Buyer shall make
available to the Seller (upon request) all books, records, agreements and work
papers reasonably related to any transaction contemplated by _Section 1.3(a)_
or _Section 1.3(b)_. Buyer will pay any additional amount owing to the Seller
within three (3) business days following resolution of the dispute. All
payments of Additional Consideration shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account designated by the Seller.

 



 

1.4 _Closing_. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all applicable
conditions to Closing, the closing (the "Closing") shall take place at the
offices of Bryan Cave LLP, One Metropolitan Square, 211 N. Broadway, Suite
3600, St. Louis, Missouri, 63102, or at such other location as the Parties
hereto may agree (provided that the Closing may be conducted remotely by
facsimile, e-mail or other electronic communication), at 12:01 a.m., local
time (the " _Effective Time_ ") on the third Business Day after the
satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable Law) of the latest to occur of
the conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VII_ hereof, unless extended by mutual
agreement of the Parties (such date, the " _Closing Date_ "). For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Business Day_ " shall mean any day which is not a Saturday,
Sunday or a legal holiday in the State of Delaware, United States of America.
Effective as of the Closing Date, the Seller shall cease to be a Member (as
defined in the Company LLC Agreement) of the Company.

 



 

1.5 _Deliveries of Parent and the Seller at Closing_. At the Closing, Parent
and the Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer:

 



 

(a) duly executed documents transferring the Seller Interests, free and clear
of all Liens, in a form and substance satisfactory to Buyer;

 



 

(b) a non-foreign affidavit, duly executed and dated as of the Closing Date,

(e) an amendment to that certain Trademark License Agreement by and between

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of their
respective states of incorporation. Parent and the Seller have all requisite
power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform their
obligations hereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.
The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent and the
Seller have been duly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part
of Parent and the Seller. This Agreement constitutes a legal, valid and

body, governmental agency, arbitrator, mediator or similar body, franchise or

the Seller, the performance by Parent or the Seller of their respective
obligations hereunder, nor the consummation by Parent or the Seller of the

or commitments of any kind outstanding obligating Parent or the Seller to
issue, acquire, transfer, pledge or encumber the Seller Interests. Except as
set forth on _Schedule 2.3(i)_ , since the acquisition of the Seller
Interests, there has not been any sale, assignment, transfer or other
conveyance of the Seller Interests by Parent or the Seller, nor has Parent or
the Seller entered into any written or oral contract, agreement, commitment,

outstanding or effective for the sale, assignment transfer or conveyance
thereof. Except as set forth on _Schedule 2.3(ii)_ , there are no unitholder
agreements, buy-sell agreements, voting trusts or other agreements or
understandings to which Parent or the Seller is a party or to which it is
bound relating to any of the Seller Interests.

waiver, approval or authorization of, or declaration to or filing or

("Government") or any third person is required in connection with the
execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement by Parent or the Seller,
or the consummation by Parent or the Seller of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Parties acknowledge that in making the representations and
warranties set forth in this _Section 2.4_ and _Section 2.2_ solely as it
relates to non-U.S. competition law filings, the Seller and Parent are relying
in part on certain financial information furnished by Buyer and the Company
related to Buyers and the Companys operations in the applicable
jurisdictions.

or in arbitration, mediation or alternative dispute resolution), Government or
grand jury investigation, or other action (any of the foregoing, " _Action_ ")
or any judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree of any court or other

 **ARTICLE V** ** _ 
_****_RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS_**

 



 

In consideration of the Purchase Price and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby:

 



 

5.1 _Covenant_. The Seller and Parent agree, effective upon the Closing, that
neither Parent nor the Seller shall:

 



 

(a) during the Restrictive Period (as hereinafter defined), directly or
indirectly, as a principal, employee, partner, shareholder, member, officer,
director, agent or

 



       
 

 



 

otherwise, compete, assist in or provide financial resources to any activity
which competes with the business now carried on by the Company or the
Subsidiaries anywhere in the world (a " _Competitive Business_ "); provided,
however, that the running of such time period shall be tolled during any
period of time during which the Seller or Parent violates the provisions of
this paragraph. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) the purchase or resulting
ownership by the Seller or Parent of a business that derives less than the
lesser of (x) fifteen percent (15%) of its total annual revenues or (y)
$15,000,000 in annual revenues from Competitive Businesses, measured for the
fiscal year ended immediately prior to the date of such purchase, shall not
constitute a breach of this _Section 5.1(a)_; provided, however, that the
Seller or Parent may acquire a business that derives $15,000,000 or more in
annual revenues, or fifteen percent (15%) or more of its total annual
revenues, from a Competitive Business, as long as the acquiring person shall
begin a process to divest such Competitive Business within sixty (60) days
after the closing of such acquisition or combination (which process shall
include engaging a reputable financial advisor in connection therewith), and
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to divest such Competitive Business
on commercially reasonable terms, and if such divestiture is not completed
within twelve months after the Closing, then the running of the Restrictive
Period shall be tolled during any period of time during which such Competitive
Business is held in excess of twelve months, (B) Parent or the Seller may,
directly or indirectly, hold publicly traded interests in or securities of any
person engaged in a Competitive Business to the extent that such investment
does not, directly or indirectly, confer more than five percent (5%) of the
voting power of such person and (C) in the event of a Change in Control of
Parent, the provisions of this _Section 5.1(a)_ shall not apply to the
acquirer of Parent or any of its Affiliates (other than the Seller and Parent)
and nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to restrict the ability of
Parent or the Seller from providing financial resources to the acquirer or any
of the acquirers Affiliates, regardless of whether they are engaging in a
Competitive Business, provided that in no event shall such financial resources
be used to permit any breach of this Section 5.1(a) by the Seller and Parent.
As used herein, a " _Change in Control of Parent_ " shall mean any person who
is or becomes the beneficial owner (as defined in Rule 13d-3 under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934), directly or indirectly, of voting securities
of Parent representing more than 50% of Parents outstanding voting securities
or rights to acquire such securities;

 



 

(b) during the Restrictive Period, use or disclose to anyone except authorized
personnel of the Company or a Subsidiary or Advisors (as hereinafter defined)
any trade secrets or confidential matters concerning the Company or any
Subsidiary, including, without limitation, secrets, customer lists (including,
without limitation, the name and/or requirements of any customer of the
Company or any Subsidiary) and credit records, employee data, sales
representatives and their territories, mailing lists, consultant arrangements,
pricing policies, operational methods, marketing plans or strategies, product
development and techniques or plans, research and development programs and
plans, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans, designs
and design projects, any intellectual property of the Company or any
Subsidiary (unless previously publicly disclosed in a manner which would not
and does not constitute a breach of this Agreement, the Company LLC Agreement
or any other relevant agreement) and any other research or business
information concerning the Company or any Subsidiary which the Company or any
Subsidiary currently treats as confidential (whether or not a trade secret
under applicable law) (collectively, the " _Confidential Material_ "). If the
Seller or Parent is or may be obligated to disclose any Confidential Material
pursuant to applicable law, regulation or legal process, then the Seller or
Parent, as applicable, shall provide Buyer with

 



      
 

 



 

prompt written notice before any such disclosure sufficient to enable Buyer
either to seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy preventing or
prohibiting such disclosure or to waive compliance with the provisions of this
_Section 5.1(b)_ or both. Nothing herein shall prevent the Seller from using
or disclosing information (and such information shall not be deemed to be
Confidential Material) that is generally available to the public, that becomes
available to the Seller, Parent or one of their Affiliates on a non-
confidential basis from a source other than the Company or Buyer, provided
that such source is not bound by a confidentiality agreement or other
contractual, legal, or fiduciary obligation of confidentiality to the Company
with respect to such information, or that is independently developed by the
Seller, Parent or one of their Affiliates without reference to any
Confidential Material. Parent and the Seller will, and will use reasonable
efforts to promptly cause their respective Affiliates, officers, directors,
employees, agents, representatives and advisors to destroy or return upon
request all Confidential Material, and all copies thereof, obtained by Parent
and the Seller or on their behalf from any of the Company, a Subsidiary, Apple
JV Holding Corp. or any of their respective Affiliates that are subject to the
provisions of this _Section 5.1(b)_; provided, however, that Parent and the
Seller (i) may maintain copies of Confidential Material pursuant to legal,
fiduciary or professional standards to which they are subject, and in
connection with bona fide internal document retention policies, so long as
such retained copies are not available to the segment operating teams of
Parent, the Seller or any of their Affiliates (including, without limitation,
in the event that Parent or the Seller is acquired, any of such acquirers
Affiliates) and (ii) shall not be required to delete Confidential Material
saved pursuant to automated computer backup procedures, so long as any such
backup tapes or media are not generally available to their employees
generally; or

 



 

(c) directly or indirectly, during the 36 month period after the Closing Date,
solicit, encourage to leave employment, or hire any employee of the Company or
any Subsidiary or any person who at the time of proposed hire by the Seller
had been an officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary within the
previous 6 months; provided, however, that the foregoing restriction shall not
apply to any employee whose employment is terminated by the Company or any
Subsidiary. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and the Seller shall be
permitted to solicit employees pursuant to a general advertisement or non-
targeted solicitation or through the use of an employment agency or search
firm (so long as such agency or firm was not directed by Parent or the Seller
to contact such employee or officer); provided, however, that neither Parent
nor the Seller shall, directly or indirectly, hire any person during such 36
month period who responds to such advertisement or solicitation or to the
solicitation of such employment agency or search firm if such person is listed
on _Schedule 5.1(c)_.

 



 

5.2 _Enforceability_. The Seller and Parent acknowledge that the foregoing
restrictions are reasonable and agree that in the event of any breach thereof,
the harm to Buyer, the Company and/or the Subsidiaries will be irreparable and
without adequate remedy at law and therefore that injunctive relief with
respect thereto will be appropriate. In the event that a court of competent
jurisdiction determines, in an Action brought by or on behalf of Buyer, the
Company or a Subsidiary, that any of the foregoing provisions are
unenforceable as stated, the Parties intend that such restrictions be modified
to permit the maximum enforceable restriction on the Sellers or Parents
competition with the Company or any Subsidiary.

 



 

5.3 _Time Period; Advisors_. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Restrictive
Period_ " shall mean a period of five (5) years from and after the Closing
Date and " _Advisors_ " shall mean,

 



      
 

 



 

collectively any financial or legal advisors to the Seller or Parent who have
a need to know the information described in _Section 5.1(b)_ and who are
under an obligation to keep the information confidential. Notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the Seller and Parent agree that
the Seller and Parent shall be responsible for any breach of the terms of
_Section 5.1(b)_ by any Advisor.

status of any communication with, and inquiries or requests for additional
information from, the Brazilian Government, and shall each use its
commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with any such inquiry or
request. No Party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any

announcing Party is unavailable for review of the announcement and remains
unavailable after a good faith attempt was made for it to be contacted.

(c) The Tax Matters Partner shall cause the Company to make, for the Companys
taxable year that includes the Closing Date, a valid election pursuant to

to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from liability for
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Closing Date now existing in favor of
Parent, Seller, their Affiliates and their current or former directors,

pursuant to Article 11 of the Company LLC Agreement or any statutory rights
under Delaware law will survive the Closing and will continue in full force
and effect in accordance with their respective terms for a period of not less

comply with, all provisions granting such rights, and (ii) shall not, and
shall not permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, repeal or
modify any provision in the respective organizational documents of such
Company or Subsidiary or the Company LLC Agreement relating to the exculpation

the intent of the Parties that the Covered Persons shall continue to be
entitled to such exculpation and indemnification to the full extent of the
law.

Subsidiary, or their respective successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with

all of whom shall be express third-party beneficiaries hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

6.8 _LLC Agreement_.

 



 

(a) The Parties hereby waive, and, to the extent required, amend any and all
provisions of the Company LLC Agreement necessary to be waived and/or amended
in connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

Eaton for Parent to assign to the Company the SOLA trademark and variations
thereof and the applications and registrations therefor. If Eaton does not
consent to such assignment prior to the Closing Date or within a reasonable
period following the Closing, Parent and the Seller will reasonably cooperate
with Buyer and the Company to amend the Sola Trademark License Agreement to
expressly permit the current use and registration of such trademarks by the
Company to the extent any such amendment may be entered into without the
consent of Eaton. To the extent that Eatons consent is required, the Parties
shall reasonably cooperate to obtain such consent; provided, however, that

and/or enforcement of this Agreement and interest on the amount of such Losses
at the Federal Funds Rate, as it appears in the Wall Street Journal, from the
date that such Losses were incurred until the date of payment to the
Indemnified Party, determined based upon a 360-day year (in all, "Indemnified
Losses") incurred or to be incurred by any of them resulting from or arising
out of:

 



 

(i) any Excluded Liabilities, as such term is defined in the General Signal

(ii) any nonfulfillment, nonperformance, nonobservance or other breach or
violation, or default in performance, by Parent or the Seller of any covenant

violation, or default in performance, by Buyer or the Company of any covenant
or agreement of Buyer contained in this Agreement; or

Company in this Agreement.

 



 

8.4 _Procedures for Claims_.

 



 

(a) In the event that Buyer seeks indemnification on behalf of a Buyer
Indemnified Person, or Parent and the Seller seek indemnification on behalf of
a Seller Indemnified Person, such Party seeking indemnification (the "
_Indemnified Party_ ") shall give reasonably prompt written notice to the
Party from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ")
specifying the facts constituting the basis for such claim and the amount,

 



       
 

 



 

to the extent known, of the claim asserted; provided, however, that the right
of a Person to be indemnified hereunder shall not be adversely affected by a
failure to give such notice unless, and then only to the extent that, an
Indemnifying Party is actually and materially damaged thereby. Subject to the
terms hereof, the Indemnifying Party shall pay (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) the amount of any valid claim not more than 60
days after the Indemnified Party provides notice to the Indemnifying Party of
such amount.

 



 

(b) If an Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder because
of a claim asserted by any claimant other than an Indemnified Party hereunder
(a " _Third Person_ "), the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying
Party prompt notice thereof after such assertion is actually known to the
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that the right of a Person to be
indemnified hereunder in respect of claims made by a Third Person shall not be
adversely affected by a failure to give promptly such notice unless, and then
only to the extent that, an Indemnifying Party is actually and materially
prejudiced thereby. Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 8.4_, the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right, upon the giving of (i) written notice
to the Indemnified Party and (ii) an unconditional acknowledgement that based
on the facts alleged in the claim, the Indemnified Party is obligated to
indemnify the Persons to be indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third
Person claim, to investigate, contest, and defend the claim alleged by such
Third Person (a " _Third Person Claim_ "), provided that the Indemnifying
Party may not settle the Third Person Claim without the consent of the
Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), unless the settlement (i) involves only money damages which will be
paid entirely by the Indemnifying Party and (ii) includes a complete release
of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party may thereafter participate in
(but not control) the defense of any such Third Person Claim with its own
counsel at its own expense, unless separate representation is necessary to
avoid a conflict of interest, in which case such representation shall be at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that the
Indemnifying Party need only pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of one
counsel to all of the Indemnified Parties. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this _Section 8.4_, in connection with any Third Person
Claim where (w) the Indemnifying Party fails or refuses to acknowledge within
thirty (30) days of its receipt of the notice referred to in the first
sentence of this _Section 8.4(b)_ that based on the facts alleged in the
claim, the Indemnifying Party is obligated to indemnify the Persons to be
indemnified hereunder with respect to such Third Person Claim, (x) there is a
credible threat of any material relief other than solely monetary damages
being granted, (y) there is a substantial conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party in the conduct of the defense of
such Third Person Claim or (z) there are specific defenses available to the
Indemnified Party which are different from or additional to those available to
the Indemnifying Party and which are reasonably likely to be materially
adverse to the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall have the
right to assume and direct the defense of such Third Person Claim, subject to
the limitations set forth in this Section. In such an event, the Indemnifying
Party need only pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel of the
Indemnifying Party and one counsel to all of the Indemnified Parties. If the
Indemnified Party otherwise exercises its rights contained herein to assume
and direct the defense of such Third Person Claim, (a) the Indemnified Party
may defend against such claim using counsel of its choice, in such manner as
it may reasonably deem appropriate, provided, however, that the Indemnified
Party shall not settle the Third Person Claim without the consent of the
Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, (b) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) the
defense

 



      
 

 



 

of such action, with its own counsel at its own expense, and (c) if the
Indemnified Party has assumed the defense of the Third Person Claim pursuant
to clause (w) above, then the Indemnifying Party shall have the right at any
time to assume and direct the defense of the Third Person Claim by notice to
the Indemnified Party containing the acknowledgement set forth in clause (w)
above. The Parties shall make available to each other all relevant information
in their possession relating to any such Third Person Claim and shall
cooperate in the defense thereof.

 



 

8.5 _Limitations on Indemnity_.

 



 

(a) Neither Parent nor the Seller shall have any claim for contribution from
or against the Company or any Subsidiary as a result of any indemnification or
other payments made by the Seller to any of the Buyer Indemnified Persons
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) If the Closing occurs, the indemnification provided in this _ARTICLE
VIII_ and _Section 6.7_ and the right to equitable relief provided in
_Section 9.8_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies for any inaccuracy or
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Parent,
the Seller, the Company or the Buyer in this Agreement. For all Tax purposes,
all amounts payable by one Party in indemnification of the other shall be
considered an adjustment to the Purchase Price, to the extent permitted by
applicable law.

 



 

(c) The amount of any Indemnified Losses for which indemnification is provided
under this _ARTICLE VIII_ shall be net of any amounts actually recovered
under insurance policies maintained by an Indemnified Party in effect
immediately prior to Closing and applicable to such Indemnified Loss, net of
reasonable expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in obtaining such
recovery, and the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of
such amounts, to any rights which the Indemnified Party may have against any
such insurance policies; provided, however, that the Indemnified Party shall
have no obligation to first submit or to collect upon any applicable insurance
coverage as a precondition to making a claim for indemnification hereunder or
obtaining indemnification for Indemnified Losses therefor. To the extent that
any insurance payment is actually recovered by an Indemnified Party after the
related indemnification payment has been made pursuant to this Agreement, the
Indemnified Party will pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amounts of such
insurance payments promptly after they are actually recovered; provided,
however, that the Indemnified Party shall not pay over to the Indemnifying
Party any such amounts that exceed the related indemnification payment that
has been made by the Indemnifying Party pursuant to this Agreement. If
permitted under the terms of the applicable insurance policies, in lieu of the
foregoing, the Indemnified Party may subrogate or assign its rights to recover
under such insurance policies to the Indemnifying Party. For the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this paragraph shall be deemed to construe any self-insured
amount or retention as an amount that could be recovered under an insurance
policy.

 



 

(d) The Parties shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Indemnified Losses associated with any claim for indemnification under this
_ARTICLE VIII_ after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be
expected to give rise to any Indemnified Losses that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder.

 



 

(e) Neither the Buyer nor the Company shall be entitled to be compensated more
than once for the same Loss.

shall be referred to as the " _Termination Date_ ".

_Section 6.3_ (Public Announcements; Confidentiality), _Section 9.7_
(Expenses), and _Section 9.9_ (Governing Law).

 



 

9.3 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Schedules and Exhibits hereto
embody the entire agreement and understanding of the Parties with respect to
the subject matter hereof, and supersede all prior and contemporaneous
agreements and understandings relative to such subject matter.

 



 

9.4 _Assignment; Binding Agreement_. This Agreement and the various rights and
obligations arising hereunder shall inure to the benefit of and be binding

9.8 _Remedies Cumulative_. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, all
rights and remedies of the Parties under this Agreement are cumulative and

hereto agree that irreparable damage, for which monetary damages (even if
available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the event that the
parties hereto do not perform any provision of this Agreement in accordance
with its specified terms or otherwise breach such provisions. Accordingly, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that the Parties shall be entitled to an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof, in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
in law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy

 



      
 

 



 

at law or that any award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy
for any reason at law or in equity. Any Party seeking an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide
any bond or other security in connection with such order or injunction.

 



 

9.9 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall in all respects be construed in
accordance with and governed by the substantive laws of the State of Delaware,
without reference to its choice of law rules.

 



 

9.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction; Waivers_. Each of the Parties irrevocably
agrees that any legal action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect hereof brought by a
Party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be brought and determined
exclusively in the federal or state courts in Delaware encompassing the County
of New Castle, and each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard
to any such action or proceeding for itself and in respect to its property,
generally and unconditionally, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the aforesaid
courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to
assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim, or otherwise, in any
action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (a) any claim that it is
not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named court for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 9.10_, (b) that it or its property is exempt or immune from
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
court (whether through judgment or otherwise), and (c) to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law that (i) the suit, action or proceeding in any
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such suit,
action or proceeding is improper and (iii) this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such court. Each Party hereto
waives all personal service of any and all process upon such Party related to

be made by hand delivery, certified mail or confirmed telecopy directed to
such Party at the address specified in Section 9.1 hereof; and service made by
certified mail shall be complete seven days after the same shall have been
posted.

 



 

9.11 _No Waiver_. Any failure by either of the Parties hereto to comply with
any of the obligations, agreements or conditions set forth herein may be
waived by the other Party; provided, however, that any such waiver (a) shall
be in writing signed by the waiving party, and (b) shall not be deemed a
waiver of any other obligation, agreement or condition.

 



 

9.12 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any rule or law, or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest extent
possible.

 



 

9.13 _Amendments_. No modification, amendment or waiver of any of the
provisions of this Agreement shall be effective unless in writing and signed
by the Parties hereto.

 _Schedule 1.3(b)(ii)_

 



 

15% of Total Sales of the Company for Fiscal Year 2013

 



 

Total Fiscal Year 2013 Sales = $517,490,703

 



 

$517,490,703 x 15% = $77,623,605

      
 

 



 

 _Schedule 1.3(b)(iii)_

 



 

Example Calculations

 



 

(#s in millions)

 



 

15% threshold = $77,623,605 (77.6 for purposes of this Schedule)

 



 

1. Assume the sale of the General Lighting Product Line

 



 

a) For a purchase price of 8

 



 

General Lighting FY2013 Sales: 7

 

Total EGS FY2013 Sales: 517

 

Partial Threshold: 7/517 * 1275 = 17.26

 



 

Sale does not exceed Partial Threshold

 

Sale does not exceed 15% Threshold (7 is less than 77.6)

 

No payment

 



 

b) For a purchase price of 70

 



 

General Lighting FY2013 Sales: 7

 

Total EGS FY2013 Sales: 517

 

Partial Threshold 7/517 * 1275 = 17.26

 



 

Sale exceeds Partial Threshold by 70 - 17.26 or 52.74

 

However, sale does not exceed 15% Threshold

 

No payment

 



 

2\. Assume that after the Sale of the General Lighting Product Line, there is
a sale of the Hazardous Lighting Product Line

 



 

a) For a purchase price of 30

 



 

Hazardous Lighting FY2013 Sales: 77

 

Total EGS FY2013 Sales: 517

 

Partial Threshold 77/517 * 1275 = 189.9

 



 

Sale does not exceed Partial Threshold

 



 

When combined with example 1a) above:

 



 

Combined 2013 sales for the product lines sold (7+77) exceed 15% Threshold

 

However, no payment, since neither sale exceeded the applicable Partial
Threshold

      
 

 



 

When combined with example 1b) above:

 



 

Payment of 23.5 (44.5% of 52.74), since the combined 2013 sales for the
product lines sold exceeded the 15% Threshold and the sale of General Lighting
exceeded the Partial Threshold

 



 

b) For a purchase price of 200

 



 

Power Supplies FY2013 Sales: 77

 

Total EGS FY2013 Sales: 517

 

Partial Threshold 77/517 * 1275 = 189.9

 



 

Sale exceeds Partial Threshold by 10.1 (200-189.9)

 



 

When combined with example 1a) above:

 



 

Since the combined 2013 sales for the product lines sold exceeded the 15%
Threshold and the sale of the Hazardous Lighting Product line exceeds the
Partial Threshold by 10.1, payment of 4.5 (44.5% of 10.1)

 



 

When combined with example 1b) above:

 



 

Since the combined sales for the product lines sold exceeded the 15% Threshold
and the two sales exceeded the applicable Partial Threshold by 62.84 (10.1 +
52.74), payment of 28 (44.5% of 62.84)

      
 

 



 

 _Schedule 2.2_

1. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement, dated as of June 30, 2011 (as amended, supplemented or modified, including the First Amendment dated October 5, 2011 and the Second Amendment dated May 8, 2013, the "SPX Credit Agreement"), among Parent as borrower, the Foreign Subsidiary Borrowers party thereto, the lenders party thereto, Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent and Deutsche Bank AG Deutschlandgeschaft Branch, as Foreign Trade Facility Agent, Parent is required either to apply the net (after tax) cash proceeds from the sale of the Seller Interests to prepay loans outstanding under the SPX Credit Agreement or to reinvest such proceeds in the business of Parent and its subsidiaries (unless a waiver is obtained).
