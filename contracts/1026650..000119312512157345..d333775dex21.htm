Company with respect to certain of the obligations of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement.

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth below, the
parties hereto agree as follows:

 

ARTICLE 1

 

THE MERGER

Section 1.01. _The Closing._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at
10:00 a.m., New York time, as soon as practicable (and, in any event, within
two Business Days) after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder,
waiver of all conditions to the Merger set forth in _Article 9_ (excluding
conditions that, by their terms, are satisfied at the Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of such
conditions), unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to its terms
or unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto;
_provided_ , _however_ , that if the Marketing Period has not ended at the
time of the satisfaction or waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the
conditions set forth in _Article 9_ (excluding conditions that, by their
terms, are satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver
(to the extent permitted hereunder) of such conditions), the Closing shall
occur on the earlier to occur of (x)  any Business Day during the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent
on no less than three Business Days prior notice to the Company and (y) the
final day of the Marketing Period, in each case subject to satisfaction or
waiver (to the extent permitted hereunder) of the conditions set forth in
_Article 9_ , or at such other time and on a date as agreed to in writing by
the parties (the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the
offices of Pepper Hamilton LLP, 3000 Two Logan Square, Eighteenth and Arch
Streets, Philadelphia, PA 19103, unless another place is agreed to by the
parties hereto.

 

Section 1.02. _The Merger_.

(a) As soon as practicable on the Closing Date, the Company and Merger
Subsidiary shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of
merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware, in such form as required by, and executed in accordance
with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL (the date and time of the filing of
the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of
Delaware, or such later time as is specified in the Certificate of Merger and
as is agreed to by the parties hereto, being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Effective Time_ ") and shall make all other filings or recordings required
under the DGCL in connection with the Merger.

(b) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged with and into
the Company in accordance with the DGCL, whereupon the separate existence of
Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the surviving
corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). From and after the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation shall possess all the properties, rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises and be subject to all of the
debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all
as provided under the DGCL. 

ARTICLE 2

EFFECTS OF THE MERGER

 

Section 2.01. Conversion of Shares _._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than
Company Restricted Stock Awards, Excluded Shares and Appraisal Shares) (each a
" _Company Share_ ") shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted at the Effective Time into and
represent the right to receive $8.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger
Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such Company Shares shall cease
to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist and each
certificate (" _Certificate_ ") or book entry previously representing any such
shares (" _Book Entry Shares_ ") shall thereafter represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration, in respect of such shares upon the
surrender of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares in accordance with _Section
2.02_ (or in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, upon
delivery of an affidavit (and bond, if required) in the manner provided in
_Section 2.07_).

 



2 (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned, Merger Subsidiary-Owned and Company-Owned
Company Common Stock_. Each share of Company Common Stock issued or
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time owned by Parent, Merger
Subsidiary or any other Subsidiary of Parent and shares owned by the Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company (collectively, the " _Excluded Shares_ "),
shall automatically be cancelled, extinguished without payment of any
consideration therefor and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Subsidiary_. Each share of common stock of Merger
Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and become one fully paid and non-assessable share of
common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, of the Surviving Corporation with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

Section 2.02. _Surrender and Payment._

 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an exchange agent (the "
_Exchange Agent_ ") reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of
exchanging Certificates or Book Entry Shares representing Company Shares for
the applicable Merger Consideration. Immediately upon completion of the
Merger, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, the
Merger Consideration to be paid in accordance with this _Article 2_. Promptly
after the Effective Time and, in any event, not later than the third Business
Day following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall send, or shall
instruct the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of Company Shares
at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal, which shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Company, and instructions (which shall specify that
the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates or Book Entry Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

(b) Each holder of Company Shares shall be entitled to receive the Merger
Consideration in respect of the Company Common Stock represented upon
surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate or Certificates (or
affidavits of loss in lieu thereof (and bond, if required) as provided in
_Section 2.07_ or, in the case of Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the
procedures as set forth in the letter of transmittal) representing
such shares, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates.

(c) Promptly after the Effective Time and, in any event, not later than the
third Business Day following the Closing Date, the Surviving Corporation shall
send, or shall instruct the Exchange Agent to send, to each record holder of
a Company Stock Option or a Company Restricted Stock Award in respect of which
a cash payment is payable at the Effective Time under _Section 2.04_ a notice
summarizing such holders rights under this Agreement with respect to such
award and setting forth any procedures that such holder must follow to receive
payment.

(d) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be paid to a Person
other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate or the Book
Entry Share is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that either
such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall

 



3  otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such book entry shall be
properly transferred, and the Person requesting such payment shall pay to the
Exchange Agent any transfer or other similar Tax required as a result of such
payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or
Book Entry Share or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that
such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 

(e) The payment of the applicable Merger Consideration upon the surrender of
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall
be deemed to have been payment in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining
to the Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate or Book
Entry Share. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
further registration of transfers of Company Shares on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this _Article 2_.

(f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to _Article 2_ (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that
remains unclaimed by holders of Company Shares six months after the Effective
Time shall be returned to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any
such holder who has not exchanged such Company Shares for the Merger
Consideration in accordance with this _Section 2.02_ prior to that time shall
thereafter look to Surviving Corporation only as general creditors thereof
with respect to any Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Shares
without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Surviving
Corporation shall not be liable to any holder of Company Shares for any
amounts paid to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Company
Shares at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by Applicable Law, the property of Surviving Corporation or its
designee free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto.

 

Section 2.03. _Appraisal Rights_ _._ Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock (including shares
of Restricted Stock) issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time that are held by any holder who (i) has not voted such shares of Company
Common Stock in favor of the Merger at the Stockholder Meeting, (ii) is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_ ") and complies in all respects with
the provisions of Section 262, and (iii) has not effectively withdrawn,
forfeited or otherwise lost the right to demand relief as a dissenting
stockholder under the DGCL as of the Effective Time (the " _Appraisal Shares_
"), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
as provided in _Sections 2.01(a)_ and _2.04_ and pursuant to the procedures
for the payment of Merger Consideration (as Company Shares) in _Section
2.02_, but instead such holder of Appraisal Shares shall only be entitled to
payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of
Section 262\. At the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall automatically
be cancelled and shall cease to exist or be outstanding, and each holder
of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except

 



4  such rights as are granted under Section 262\. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive,
withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262, or a court of
competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the
relief provided by Section 262, then the rights of such holder under Section
262 shall cease to exist and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have
been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to
receive such holders Merger Consideration as provided in _Sections 2.01(a)_
and _2.04_. The Company shall provide prompt written notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, any withdrawal of
any such demand and any other demand, notice or instrument delivered to the
Company prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the DGCL that relates to such
demand, and Parent shall have the opportunity and right to direct all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle or otherwise negotiate, any such
demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.

Section 2.04.  _Company Stock Options; Company Restricted Stock Awards;
Corporate Actions_.

(a) _Company Stock Options._ At the Effective Time, each then outstanding and
unexercised Company Stock Option (vested or unvested) granted under any
Company Stock Plan, shall become fully vested, and shall be cancelled and
converted into the right to receive, as soon as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, a cash payment equal to (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the
Merger Consideration over (B) the per share exercise price of such Company
Stock Option, multiplied by (ii) the number of Company Shares covered by such
option, less any required withholding Taxes imposed on the recipient of such
payment with respect to such payment. Each holder of a Company Stock Option
with a per share exercise price that is equal to or greater than the Merger
Consideration shall not be entitled to receive any payment with respect to
such Company Stock Options, which shall be cancelled effective as of the
Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Option,
whether vested or unvested, shall no longer represent the right to purchase
shares of Company Common Stock, but in lieu thereof shall represent only the
nontransferable right to receive a cash payment, if any, pursuant to this
Agreement.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock Awards._ At the Effective Time, each share
underlying a Company Restricted Stock Award, shall become free of any
forfeiture restriction and converted into the right to receive, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, an amount in cash equal to
the Merger Consideration, less any required withholding Taxes imposed on the
recipient of such payment with respect to such payment.

(c) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Board
of Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee thereof administering the
Company Stock Plans) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions
(including adopting any plan amendments and authorizing the Companys entrance
into any necessary option termination agreements) as are required to
implement the provisions of _Sections 2.04(a)_ and _(b)_ and to terminate the
Company Stock Plans at the Effective Time.

 



5 Section 2.05. _Adjustments_ _._ If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares
of capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend thereon with a record date during such period, but excluding any
change in the number of outstanding Company Shares that results from any
exercise of Company Stock Options outstanding as of the date hereof, the
Merger Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement
shall be appropriately adjusted.

 

Section 2.06. _Withholding Rights_ _._ Each of Merger Subsidiary, the
Surviving Corporation, Parent, any of their Affiliates and the Exchange Agent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to _Article 2_ such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the
Code or any provision of any state, local or foreign Tax law. If Merger
Subsidiary, the Surviving Corporation, Parent, any Affiliate thereof or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts shall
be (a) paid over to the applicable Governmental Authority in accordance with
Applicable Law and (b) treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, any Affiliate thereof or the Exchange Agent, as the case
may be, made such deduction and withholding.

 

Section 2.07. _Lost Certificates_ _._ If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall pay, in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration to be paid in respect of the Company Shares formerly represented
by such Certificate, as contemplated under this _Article 2_.

ARTICLE 3

 

THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

 

Section 3.01. _Certificate of Incorporation_ _._ The certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended at the Effective Time as set
forth in _Exhibit C_ and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of
incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in accordance with
the terms thereof or as provided by Applicable Law (subject to  _Section
7.03(e)_).

Section 3.02. ___Bylaws_ _._ As of the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Subsidiary or the
Company, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated
to read the same as the Bylaws of Merger Subsidiary as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter changed or amended as provided
therein, by the certificate of

 



6  incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by Applicable Law (subject to

powers required to carry on its business as now conducted. The Company is duly

violation of, or default under, any Material Contract. To the Companys
knowledge, no party to any Material Contract is in material breach or
violation of, or default under, the terms of any Material Contract. Each
Material Contract is a valid and binding obligation of the Company or the
Subsidiary of the Company which is party thereto and, to the Companys
knowledge, of each other party thereto, and is in full force and effect except
as such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium and other similar Applicable Law affecting creditors rights
generally and by general principles of equity and except for such failures to
be valid and binding or to be in full force and effect that, individually or
in the aggregate, have not had and are not reasonably likely to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Complete and correct copies of each Material Contract in existence as of
the date hereof have been made available by the Company to Parent prior to the
date hereof.

 

Section 4.14. _Taxes_

(a) All material Tax Returns required to have been filed by each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries have been timely filed (taking into account
extensions of time to file), and each such Tax Return is true, correct and
complete in all material respects. All Taxes due and payable by Company or any
of its Subsidiaries (and shown on a filed Tax Return) have been paid. The

 



16 Company and each of its Subsidiaries have maintained all material records in
relation to Tax as they are required to maintain under Applicable Law.

(b) The material Tax obligations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the Company Balance Sheet Date are reserved for in accordance with GAAP in
the Company Balance Sheet and, to the extent applicable, on the balance sheet
of the relevant non-US Subsidiary in accordance with local laws. Since the
Company Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
has incurred any material liability for Taxes as a result of transactions
entered into outside the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice.

 

(c) There is no current, pending or, to the Companys knowledge, threatened,
action, audit, dispute, examination, investigation or claim in respect of
Taxes against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries have received a written claim from a Governmental
Authority in a jurisdiction where any of the Company or its Subsidiaries
does not file Tax Returns that it is or may be subject to taxation by that
jurisdiction. The Company and each of the Subsidiaries have not in the past
five years had a permanent establishment or a branch office in a jurisdiction
other than the jurisdiction in which it is organized. For the purposes of
this _Section 4.14(c),_ "permanent establishment" has the meaning ascribed to
it under any applicable Tax treaty.

 

(d) There are no Liens on any of the assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries with respect to Taxes other than Permitted Liens. 

(e) Subject to exceptions that would not be individually or in the aggregate
material, each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has withheld and timely
paid to the relevant Governmental Authority all Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid.

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is currently subject to a
waiver of any statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes or any
extension of time with respect to a material Tax assessment or deficiency.

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has agreed to make a
change in accounting method that reasonably could be expected to affect Taxes
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date.

 

(h) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been the "distributing
corporation" or the "controlled corporation" with respect to a transaction
intended to qualify under Section 355 of the Code within the five year period
ending as of the date of this Agreement.

(i) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries individually has, or in
aggregate have, an unrecaptured overall foreign loss in excess of $3,000,000
within the meaning of Section 904(f) of the Code.

(j) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has requested a private
letter ruling or similar advance ruling from any taxing authority. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound by any advance
pricing agreement or material closing agreement relating to Taxes with any
Governmental Authority.

 



17 (k) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
agreement the principal purpose of which is Tax sharing, allocation, or
indemnification other than agreements solely between the Company and any of
its Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has been a
member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined, unitary or similar group of
which such entity is not currently a member. Neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has or may be held to have any material liability for the
Taxes of any Person (other than the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries) under Treasury regulation section 1.1502-6, sections 73, 75 of
the German General Tax Act or any similar provision of state, local or foreign
Applicable Law or by reason of being a transferee or successor of such
Person. 

(l) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has participated in a
"listed transaction" within the meaning of the Treasury regulations under
Section 6011 of the Code.

(m) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all
material respects with all terms and conditions of any material Tax exemption,
Tax holiday, or other Tax reduction arrangement or Tax order that applies to
any of them, and no Tax exemption, Tax holiday, or Tax order that applies to
any of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries will be adversely affected by
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(n) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries have fully complied with its
obligations under any law relating to VAT. The Company and its Subsidiaries
make no supplies other than taxable supplies for the purposes of VAT and
obtain full credit for all input tax paid or suffered by them other than input
tax which is not available for input tax credit by virtue of the Value Added
Tax (Input Tax) Order 1992 (SI 1992/3222).

 

(o) All documents which are necessary to establish the title of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to any asset or to enforce any of their rights which
are required to be stamped or which are subject to a registration or transfer
Tax (whether as a condition to their validity, registrability or otherwise)
have been duly stamped or such registration or transfer Tax has been paid (as
applicable). No such document which is outside the United Kingdom would
attract stamp duty if brought into the United Kingdom.

dependents and/or beneficiaries) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
any present or future right to benefits or (ii) under which the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has any present or future liability (each, a " _Company
Benefit Plan_ "). " _Non-U.S. Plans_ " means all Company Benefit Plans
maintained outside of the United States primarily for the benefit of current
or former employees, officers, directors or consultants of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries working outside of the United States or who worked outside
of the United States and which are subject to the laws of any jurisdiction
outside of the United States. " _U.S. Plans_ " means all Company Benefit
Plans other than Non-U.S. Plans.

made available to Parent, to the extent applicable, a true and correct copy
of: (i) the most recent documents constituting the Company Benefit Plan
(including any amendments thereto); (ii) any related trust agreement; (iii)

issued by the Internal Revenue Service with respect to each such Company
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code; and
(vii) all material correspondence with any Governmental Authority relating to
any Company Benefit Plan since January 1, 2010.

(c) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate sponsors, maintains or
contributes to, has in the past six years sponsored, maintained or contributed
to, or has any current or contingent liability with respect to: (i) a plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA (including, without limitation, a Multiemployer
Plan); (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (within the meaning of Section 413 of
the Code); (iii) a "multiple employer welfare arrangement" (within the meaning
of Section 3(40) of ERISA); or (iv) a plan providing post-employment welfare
benefits, except as required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA
and Section 4980B of the Code.

(d) With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred and, to
the Companys knowledge, there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in
connection with which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could be subject
to any liability that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable Law.

 

(e) As of the date hereof, there are no pending, or, to the knowledge of
Company, threatened, claims by or on behalf of any Company Benefit Plan, by
any employee or beneficiary covered under any Company Benefit Plan or
otherwise involving any such Company Benefit Plan other than routine claims
for benefits and other than any claims that would not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. No

 



19  Company Benefit Plan is the subject of any pending (or to the Companys
knowledge, any threatened) investigation or audit by the Internal Revenue
Service, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation or any other Governmental Authority. There has been no non-exempt

the Code or Section 406 of ERISA involving the assets of any Company Benefit
Plan.

(f) Each U.S. Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code
has received a favorable determination or opinion letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that the form of such Company Benefit Plan
satisfies the requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code. Each Non-U.S. Plan
intended to be qualified for special tax treatment meets all requirements for
such treatment, except for such failures as would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.
If any Non-U.S. Plan is intended to be funded and/or book-reserved, then such
Non-U.S. Plan is funded and/or book-reserved, as appropriate and required by
Applicable Law, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions under Applicable
Law of the jurisdiction in which such Non-U.S. Plan is maintained.

(g) All Company Benefit Plans materially conform to, and have been
maintained, operated and administered in all material respects with their
respective terms and the requirements of ERISA, the Code and all other
Applicable Law. Except as contemplated by this Agreement, neither the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries or, to the Companys knowledge, any other
person or entity, has made any express or implied commitment, whether legally
enforceable or not, to modify, change, or terminate any Company Benefit Plan.

 

(h) Except for the accelerated vesting of the Company Stock Options and
Company Restricted Stock Awards that is to be effected pursuant to _Article
2_ , the execution of and performance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional or
subsequent events) result in any payment to or acceleration, vesting
or increase in the rights or benefits of any current or former service
provider of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

(i) All Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards and all other
awards granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans have been duly authorized
by the Board of Directors or a duly authorized committee thereof, including
approval of the exercise or purchase price and the other substantive terms of
any such awards. All Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock Awards
and all other awards granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans may be
cancelled pursuant to _Section 2.04_ without the consent of the holders of
such awards.

(j) With respect to each U.S. Plan maintained by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries which is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code), (i) such plan has been operated in
good faith compliance with Section 409A of the Code and the guidance
issued thereunder, (ii) such plan complies in form with Section 409A of the
Code and the guidance issued thereunder and (iii) the transaction contemplated
by this Agreement will not result in Section 409A of the Code imposing any 

 



20  adverse tax consequences to the participants in such plan (including the
inclusion in income of deferred amounts, or any additional tax pursuant to
Section 409A(a)(1)(B) of the Code).

towards, been connected or associated with (as those terms are used in the UK
Pensions Act 2004) or had any liability in respect of any defined benefit
pension plan.

(l) During the 12 month period prior to the Closing Date, neither the Company
nor any Subsidiary has been party to any relevant transfer as defined in the
UK Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 or
similar applicable local legislation (a " _Relevant Transfer_ ") and no
employee (or former employee) of the Company or any Subsidiary has transferred
to the Company under a Relevant Transfer who at any time prior to the Relevant
Transfer was a member of an occupational pension scheme, or was a member of a
scheme providing an interest in or option over shares where that scheme has
not been materially replicated by the Company or the Subsidiary.

modification is contemplated, and the commitment to provide the funding

efforts to obtain the Stockholder Approval, and the Company shall otherwise
comply with all Applicable Laws applicable to the Stockholder Meeting.

Company Proxy Statement in preliminary form, and each of the Company and
Parent shall, or shall cause their respective Affiliates to, prepare and,
after consultation with each other, file with the SEC all Company Disclosure
Documents that are required to be filed by such party in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby. The Company shall respond to SEC comments
as promptly as practicable and use its reasonable best efforts to have the
Company Proxy Statement cleared by the SEC as promptly as practicable after

party hereto may reasonably request in connection with the preparation and
filing with the SEC of the Company Proxy Statement and the other Company

counsel. The Company (i) shall as promptly as practicable after receipt

Proxy Statement or any other Company Disclosure Document (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) received from the SEC or its staff, (ii) shall provide
Parent and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review the Companys
proposed response to such comments, and (iii) shall include in the Companys

information relating to the Company, Parent, Merger Subsidiary or any of
their respective Affiliates, directors or officers should be discovered by the
Company or Parent, which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to
the Proxy Statement or any other Company Disclosure Document so that the
Proxy Statement or other Company Disclosure Document shall not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in light of the circumstances under which they are made, not
misleading, the party that discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party, and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by
Applicable Law, disseminated to the stockholders of the Company.

Section 6.03. _No Solicitation._  

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 6.03_, the Company and its
Subsidiaries shall, and the Company shall instruct and cause its and its
Subsidiaries Representatives to, cease immediately any existing discussions
or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal, other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. With respect to any Person or
"group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act) with whom
such discussions or negotiations have been terminated, the Company shall
instruct such Person or group to promptly return or destroy in accordance
with the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement any non-public
information furnished by or on behalf of the Company unless such Person or
group has already been so instructed.

 

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or, if
earlier, the termination of this Agreement, the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries not to, and shall cause its Representatives not to,
directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, seek or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information regarding the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries) or facilitate, any inquiries, proposals or offers
from any Person or "group" (within the meaning of Section 13(d)(3) of the
Exchange Act) (other than the Parent and its Subsidiaries) that constitute,
or could reasonably be expected to result in an

 



42  Acquisition Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations
(including by way of furnishing nonpublic information concerning the Company)
with any third party (other than Parent, Merger Subsidiary and their
Representatives and the Companys Representatives) relating to, or which could
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, or (iii) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, an Acquisition
Proposal or enter into any Contract or agreement in principle relating to an
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any Contract or agreement in principle
requiring the Company to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby or breach its obligations hereunder or
propose or agree to do any of the foregoing.

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 6.03_, following
the date of this Agreement but prior to the time when the Stockholder Approval
is received, if the Company or one of its Representatives receives an
Acquisition Proposal from any Person, which Acquisition Proposal was made or
renewed on or after the date of this Agreement but prior to the time when the
Stockholder Approval is received and that did not result from breach of
_Section 6.03(b)_, (i) the Company may contact and engage in discussions
with such Person solely for the purpose of clarifying such Acquisition
Proposal and any material terms and conditions thereof so as to determine
whether such Acquisition Proposal is, or could reasonably be expected to
result in, a Superior Proposal; or (ii) the Company or its Representatives
may, if the Board of Directors determines in good faith (after consultation
with its outside counsel and financial advisor) that failure to take
such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law and that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes, or is
reasonably expected to result in, a Superior Proposal, (A) furnish, pursuant
to a confidentiality agreement containing terms that are similar to and not
more favorable in the aggregate to the other party than the terms in the
Confidentiality Agreement, information with respect to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal; _provided_ that
the Company shall promptly provide to Parent any non-public information
concerning the Company or its Subsidiaries that is provided to any Person
given such access which was not previously provided to Parent or its
Representatives and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations regarding
such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(d) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after
receipt), notify Parent in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition
Proposal, any inquiries relating to an Acquisition Proposal or any request for
information from, or any negotiations sought to be initiated or continued
with, either the Company or its Representatives concerning an Acquisition
Proposal. The Companys notice shall include (i) a copy of any Acquisition
Proposal made in writing and other written materials provided by such Person
to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii), to the extent such
information is not contained in the written materials provided to Parent, a
written summary of the material terms of such Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or
request, including the identity of the Person or group of Persons making the
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry or request. The Company shall keep Parent
reasonably informed in all respects on a timely basis (and in any event no
later than within 48 hours of the occurrence of any significant changes,
developments, discussions or negotiations) of the status of any Acquisition
Proposal, inquiry or request (including the material terms and conditions
thereof and of any material modification thereto), and any material
developments, discussions and negotiations. None of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into any
agreement that would prohibit them from providing such information

 



43  to Parent. The Company shall not, and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
not to, terminate, waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant
permission or request under, any standstill or confidentiality agreement to
which it or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, use reasonable best efforts to enforce the
provisions of any such agreement; provided, however, that the Company may
permit a proposal to be made under a standstill agreement if it determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such
actions would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties under
Applicable Law. To the extent that the Company has entered into any
confidentiality agreement prior to the date hereof that would prevent the
Company from providing information to Parent that the Company would otherwise
be required to provide to Parent pursuant to the terms of this _Section
6.03(d)_, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain a waiver
of such confidentiality agreement to enable the Company to provide such
information to Parent in accordance with the terms of this _Section
6.03(d)_.

(e) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof,
shall (A) fail to make, withdraw, modify or qualify in a manner adverse to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary the Board Recommendation, or (B) approve or
recommend, or publicly propose to approve or recommend, to the stockholders of
the Company, an Acquisition Proposal, (C) if a tender offer or exchange offer
for shares of capital stock of the Company that constitutes an Acquisition
Proposal is commenced, fail to recommend against acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by the Company stockholders (including, for these
purposes, by taking no position with respect to the acceptance of such tender
offer or exchange offer by its stockholders, which shall constitute a failure
to recommend against acceptance of such tender offer or exchange offer)
within ten Business Days after commencement thereof, (D) approve, authorize or
permit or allow the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger or acquisition agreement or
any similar agreement or understanding with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal (other than an acceptable confidentiality agreement permitted under
_Section 6.03(c)_) or (E) resolve, propose to a third party or agree to take
any of the foregoing actions (any of the foregoing, an " _Adverse
Recommendation Change_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to
obtaining the Stockholder Approval, the Board of Directors may, (1) if the
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel and its financial advisor, that the failure to do so would be
inconsistent with directors fiduciary duties under Applicable Law, make an
Adverse Recommendation Change and (2) if the Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisor,
that a written Acquisition Proposal received by the Company in compliance with
_Section 6.03(c)_ constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Board of Directors
may, upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with _Section
10.01(d)(i)_, approve and enter into an agreement relating to such Superior
Proposal, but subject to the satisfaction of the following: (i) the Company
shall have provided prior written notice to Parent, at least four Business
Days in advance, of its or the Board of Directors intention to take such
actions, which notice shall specify the material terms of the Acquisition
Proposal received by the Company that constitutes a Superior Proposal,
including a copy of the relevant proposed transaction agreements with, and the
identity of, the party making the Acquisition Proposal; (ii) after providing
such notice and prior to taking such actions, the Company shall, and shall
cause its Representatives to, negotiate with Parent and Merger Subsidiary in
good faith (to the extent Parent and Merger Subsidiary desire to negotiate)
during such four Business Day period to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would permit the Board of Directors to

 



44  determine that the Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a Superior
Proposal; and (iii) the Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith
any changes to this Agreement that may be offered in writing by Parent by
11:59 PM Pacific Time on the fourth Business Day of such four Business Day
period in a manner that would form a binding contract (including the complete
form of definitive acquisition agreement executed on behalf of Parent and all
exhibits and other attachments thereto, and subject only to acceptance by the
Company by countersignature on behalf of the Company and those conditions set
forth therein) if accepted by the Company and shall have determined in
good faith after consultation with outside counsel and financial advisors
that the Acquisition Proposal received by the Company would continue to
constitute, or would result in, a Superior Proposal if such changes offered in
writing by Parent were given effect; _provided_ , _however_ , the Board of
Directors may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 6.03(e)_
(or Section 10.01(d)(i)) unless the Superior Proposal giving rise to the
Adverse Recommendation Change did not result from a breach by the Company of
this _Section 6.03_. In the event of any material revisions to the Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new written notice to
Parent pursuant to the foregoing clause (i) and to comply again with the
requirements of this _Section 6.03(e)_ with respect to such new written
notice.

 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, an " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
inquiry, offer or proposal, or any indication of interest in making an offer
or proposal, made by a Person or group at any time which is structured (i) to
permit such Person or group to acquire beneficial ownership of (A) 20% or more

20% of the Companys revenues or earnings on a consolidated basis are
attributable, or (B) 20% or more of the combined voting power of the shares of
Company Common Stock, (ii) as a tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in such Person or group beneficially owning 20% or
more of the combined voting power of the shares of Company Common Stock, (iv)
as a merger, share exchange, consolidation, business
combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (v) as any
combination of the foregoing types of transactions if the sum of percentage of
the consolidated assets, consolidated revenues or earnings and Company Common
Stock involved is more than 20%; in each case other than transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement, a " _Superior
Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that (x) is on
terms that the Board of Directors determines (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisor) are more favorable to the Companys
stockholders from a financial point of view, taking into account all of the
legal, financial (including the financing terms of such proposal), regulatory
and other aspects of such Acquisition Proposal (including the likelihood and
timing of consummation thereof) and this Agreement (including any changes in
the terms of this Agreement committed to by the Parent to the Company in
writing in response to such Acquisition Proposal or otherwise), and (y) which
the Board of Directors has determined in its good faith judgment
(after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisor
and after taking into account all legal, financial (including the financing
terms of such proposal), regulatory and other aspects of the proposal) is
reasonably likely to be consummated (if accepted), except that the references
to "20%" in the definition of "Acquisition Proposal" shall be deemed to be
references to "50%".

 



45 (g) Nothing contained in this _Section 6.03_ shall prohibit the Company
from taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by
Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act if, in the good faith
judgment of the Companys Board of Directors failure to so disclose would be
inconsistent with its obligations under Applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , any disclosure other than a "stop, look and listen" or similar
communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange
Act, an express rejection of any applicable Acquisition Proposal or an
express reaffirmation of its recommendation to its stockholders in favor of
the Merger shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 

Section 6.04. _Access to Information_

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of (x) the Effective Time and (y)
the date of termination of this Agreement, and subject to the Confidentiality
Agreement dated August 4, 2011 (as amended to the date hereof, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ ") between the Company and Parent, the Company
shall give to Parent and its Representatives reasonable access to the offices,
properties, books, records, Contracts, Governmental Authorizations,
documents, directors, officers and employees of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, _provided_ , that (i) any such access pursuant to this _Section
6.04_ shall be coordinated through the Company or its designated
Representatives, and (ii) Parent and its Representatives shall conduct any
such activities in such a manner as not to interfere unreasonably with the
business or operation of the Company or its Subsidiaries or otherwise cause
any unreasonable interference with the prompt and timely discharge by the
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries of their normal duties.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the Company may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that any Applicable Law or Contract requires the Company
to restrict or prohibit access to any such properties or information, or such
disclosure would, based on the advice of such partys counsel, result in a
waiver of attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine or any other
applicable privilege applicable to such information, it being understood that
the parties shall use reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be
provided in a manner that would not contravene any Applicable Law or result
in violation of applicable privilege. Parent agrees that it will not, and will
cause its Representatives not to, use any information obtained pursuant to
this _Section 6.04_ for any purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, all information obtained by Parent
pursuant to this _Section 6.04_ shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

Section 6.05. _FIRPTA Certificate_. The Company shall deliver to Parent on the
Closing Date, in the form attached hereto as  _Exhibit D_ , a certification
pursuant to the Treasury regulations under Sections 1445 and 897 of the Code
to the effect that the Company is not a United States real property holding
corporation.

 

Section 6.06. _Director Resignations_.

The Company shall deliver to Parent on the Closing Date, in a form reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, resignation letters of the members of the Board of
Directors, effective at or prior to the Effective Time.

the Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to), to the fullest extent
permitted under Applicable Law, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and
provide advancement of expenses to, each current and former director and
officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Person_
") against all losses, claims, damages, costs, expenses, liabilities or
judgments or amounts that are paid in settlement of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation based in whole or in part on
or arising in whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a
director, officer or employee of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company
prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior to, or at or
after, the Effective Time to the same extent as provided in their respective
certificate of incorporation or bylaws (or comparable organizational
documents) and any indemnification or other agreements of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement (copies of
which have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof). Copies of
such agreements shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time, and shall survive the Merger
and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms,
and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to comply with and honor the
foregoing obligations;  _provided_ that such obligations shall be subject to
any limitation imposed from time to time under Applicable Law.

Corporation to) maintain officers and directors liability insurance in
respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering

amount no less favorable in the aggregate than those of such policy in effect

existing insurance.

(c) Parent may fulfill its obligations under  _Section 7.03(b)_ by directing

date hereof), under the DGCL or any other Applicable Law or under

Subsidiaries as in effect on the date of this Agreement (copies of which have
been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof). For six years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall (and shall cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to) cause the certificate of incorporation and bylaws
(and other comparable governing documents) of the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to contain provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses and exculpation that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Persons as the indemnification, advancement of expenses and
exculpation provisions contained in the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws (or other comparable governing documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the date of this Agreement (copies of which
have been made available to Parent prior to the date hereof), and such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who were
covered by such provisions, except as required by Applicable Law. The rights
of each Indemnified Person under this  _Section 7.03_ shall survive
consummation of the Merger and are intended to benefit, and shall be
enforceable by, each Indemnified Person.

provide, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide, employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who become employees of the Surviving
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (" _Continuing Employees_ ") with
compensation and benefits that are, in the aggregate,
substantially comparable to the compensation and benefits being provided to
Company employees immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than equity
incentive awards).

(b) Continuing Employees shall receive service credit for all purposes,
including eligibility to participate and vesting (but not for accrual purposes
under any defined benefit pension plan), under any benefit plan of the
Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries under which such Continuing
Employees may be eligible to participate on or after the Effective Time, to
the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under comparable Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time; _provided_ , that such crediting of service shall not operate to
duplicate any benefit or the funding of any such benefit.

 

(c) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and any successor thereto to honor
the Companys and its Subsidiaries obligations under the plans and agreements
identified in _Section 7.05(c)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, in
accordance with their respective terms as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

(d) With respect to any benefit plan of the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries that is a welfare benefit plan, program or arrangement and in
which a Continuing Employee may be eligible to participate on or after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or it shall cause the Surviving Corporation and
its Subsidiaries to, (i) waive, or use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its insurance carrier to waive, any pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting period requirements, if
any, with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
each Continuing Employee under such benefit plan to the same extent waived or
satisfied under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such Continuing
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (ii)
provide credit to each Continuing Employee (and his/her beneficiaries) for any
co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such Continuing
Employee (or his/her beneficiaries) under the comparable Company Benefit Plan
during the relevant plan year in which the Continuing Employee is transferred
from such Company Benefit Plan to the comparable plan of the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliate, up to and including the effective time of such
transfer.

 

(e) Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors, or an appropriate
committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution
consistent with the interpretive guidance of the SEC so that the disposition
by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered person of the
Company for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder (" _Section 16_ ") of Company Common Stock or
Company Stock Options (or Company Common Stock acquired upon the vesting of
any Company stock based awards) pursuant to this Agreement and the Merger
shall be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16.

 



49 (f) No provision of this _Section 7.05_ or any other provision in this
Agreement shall create any third party beneficiary or other rights in any
employee or former employee (or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) of the
Company or any of its Affiliates in respect of continued employment (or
resumption of employment) with Parent or the Surviving Corporation, or any of
their Affiliates, and no provision of this _Section 7.05_ or any other
provision in this Agreement shall create any such rights in any such
individuals in respect of any benefits that may be provided, directly or
indirectly, under any Company Benefit Plan or any plan or benefit arrangement
that may be established by Parent or any of its Affiliates. Nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted to establish, promise to establish or amend
any "employee benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA.
Subject to applicable Law, no provision of this Agreement shall constitute a
limitation on rights to amend, modify or terminate, either before or
after Closing, any Company Benefit Plan of the Company or any of its
Affiliates.

applicable Foreign Competition Law and take all other actions necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act or any applicable Foreign Competition Law as soon as practicable.

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall (i) promptly notify each other party
hereto of any written or oral communication to that party or its Affiliates

other party to review in advance any

 



50  proposed written communication to any Governmental Authority, in each case
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) keep
the other party reasonably informed of any substantive meeting or discussion
with any Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or
inquiry concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(iii) subject to all applicable privileges, including the attorney-client
privilege, furnish each other party with copies of all correspondence,
filings, and communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance
thereof) between them and their Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority
or members of their respective staffs, on the other hand, concerning this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Company shall provide Parent the opportunity
to participate in the defense of any Proceeding against the Company and/or its
directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will
obtain the prior written consent of Parent prior to settling or satisfying
any such Proceeding (which consent shall not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Agreement
shall require Parent or any of its Affiliates or Subsidiaries to (i) agree to
or to effect any divesture or hold-separate order, or enter into any license

proceeding initiated by a Governmental Authority or by any other party.

(e) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take the action

as practicable after the date hereof. The parties agree that the failure of
the Company to achieve an outcome satisfactory to Parent with respect to the
matters set on _Section 8.01(e_) of the Company Disclosure Schedule (after

for (i) delaying the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this

Section 8.02. _Certain Filings_ _._ The Company and Parent shall cooperate
with one another (i) in connection with the preparation of the Company

material contracts, in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) in taking such actions or making any
such filings, furnishing information required in connection therewith or with
the Company Disclosure Documents and seeking timely to obtain any such
actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

be issued by any party without the prior consent of the Company and Parent
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned),
except as such release or announcement may be required by Applicable Law, any
rule or regulation of Nasdaq or as permitted by _Section 6.03_, in which
case the party required to make the release or announcement will, to the
extent practicable, promptly inform the other parties hereto in writing in

Parent with copies of Company Disclosure Documents prior to filing with the
SEC and give consideration to comments provided by the Parent to the Company.

 

Section 8.04. _Notices of Certain Events_ _._ Each of the Company and Parent
shall promptly notify the other party of (a) the occurrence of any event
whose occurrence would be reasonably likely to cause either (i) any condition
set forth in _Article 9_ to not be satisfied or (ii) any changes or events
having, or that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, (b) any written notice or other
communication from any Person alleging that the consent or approval of such
Person is or may be required in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement or that such transactions otherwise may violate the rights
of or confer remedies upon such Person; or (c) any written notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 8.05. _Financing; Cooperation with Financing._

 

(a) Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things reasonably
necessary to arrange the Financing as promptly as practicable following the
date of this Agreement and to consummate the Financing on or prior to the
Closing Date. Such actions shall include the following: (i) maintaining in
effect the Commitment Letter, provided that Parent may replace or amend the
Commitment Letter so long as such replacement or amendment would not adversely
impact or delay in any material respect the ability of Parent and Merger
Subsidiary to consummate the Merger or the Financing (it being specified that
no such amendment or replacement would (A) materially expand upon the
conditions precedent to the Financing set forth in the Commitment Letter or
(B) provide for terms and conditions (including any "flex" provisions) that
are, in the aggregate, materially less favorable to Parent and the Company);
(ii) participation by Parent in, and assistance with, the preparation of
rating agency presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iii)
satisfying on a timely basis all conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter
that are within the control of Parent or any of its Affiliates and complying
with its obligations thereunder and not taking or failing to take any action
that would reasonably be expected to prevent or impede or delay the
availability of the Financing; and (iv) negotiating, executing and delivering
Financing Documents that reflect the terms contained in the Commitment
Letter (including any "market flex" provisions related thereto) or on other
terms acceptable to Parent and the Financing Sources that would not adversely
impact or delay in any material respect the ability of Parent to consummate
the Merger or the Financing. Parent shall give the Company prompt

 



52  notice of any breach or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letter or
the Financing Documents or any condition not likely to be satisfied, in each
case, of which Parent becomes aware or any waiver, amendment or modification
of the Commitment Letter or the Financing Documents; _provided_ , that in no
event will Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information that is
subject to any applicable legal privileges (including the attorney-client
privilege). Without limiting Parents other obligations under this _Section
8.05(a)_, if a Financing Failure Event occurs Parent shall (i) immediately
notify the Company of such Financing Failure Event and the reasons therefor,
(ii) in consultation with the Company, use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain alternative financing from alternative financing sources, on terms
(including structure, covenants and pricing) not materially less beneficial
in the aggregate to Parent, with lenders reasonably satisfactory to Parent in
an amount sufficient to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event,
and (iii) obtain, and when obtained, provide the Company with a copy of a new
financing commitment that provides for such alternative financing. Parent
shall keep the Company reasonably informed on a current basis and in
reasonable detail of the status of its effort to arrange the Financing and
shall provide to the Company copies of all material agreements related to the
Financing (excluding fee letters and engagement letters, except to the extent
that such documents contain any conditions to funding, "flex" provisions or
other substantive provisions (excluding provisions related solely to fees and
economic terms agreed to by the parties) regarding the terms and conditions of
the Financing). In the event that Parent commences an enforcement action to
enforce its rights under the Commitment Letter or the Financing Documents
and/or causes the Financing Sources to fund the Financing (any such action, a
" _Financing Action_ "), Parent shall (x) keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of the Financing Action and (y) at the request of the
Company, shall make Parents employees and Representatives (other than any of
its investment bankers, financial advisors or Financing Sources) reasonably
available to discuss the status of, and material developments with respect to,
the Financing Action. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, nothing contained in this Agreement shall require, and in no
event shall the commercially reasonable efforts of Parent or Merger Sub be
deemed or construed to require, either Parent or Merger Subsidiary to
threaten, commence or pursue litigation, arbitration or other adversarial
proceedings against any Financing Source.

(b) The Company agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide such
assistance (and to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its
Subsidiaries and its and their respective Representatives to provide such
assistance) with the Financing as is reasonably requested by Parent or the
Financing Sources. Such assistance shall include the following: (i)
participation in, and assistance with, the Marketing Efforts related to the
Financing; (ii) participation by senior management of the Company in, and
assistance with, the preparation of a reasonable number of rating agency
presentations and meetings with rating agencies; (iii) timely delivery to
Parent and the Financing Sources of the Financing Information by the dates set
forth in the Commitment Letter; (iv) participation by senior management of
the Company in the negotiation, execution and delivery of the Financing
Documents; (v) taking such actions as are reasonably requested by Parent or
any Financing Source to facilitate the satisfaction on a timely basis of all
conditions precedent to obtaining the Financing; (vi) taking all actions as
may be required or reasonably requested by Parent or any Financing Source in
connection with the repayment of the Existing Debt; (vii) causing its
independent auditors to cooperate with the Financing, including by providing
the Specified Auditor Assistance; (viii) taking such actions as

 



53  may be required to permit at least $45,000,000 (less the cost of the premium
of the Prepaid Tail Policy and less up to $2,500,000 of the Companys other
out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger and paid prior to the Closing Date) of cash and cash
equivalents of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be made available
(including, if necessary, by repatriation to the United States (in a manner
determined in consultation with Parent)) to finance, in part, the Merger on
the Closing Date; (ix) taking such actions as may be required to permit any
cash and marketable securities of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
made available to finance, in part, the Merger on the Closing Date; (x) using
its commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Financing benefits from
the existing lending relationships of the Company and its Subsidiaries; and
(xi) the Company shall file such reports under the securities laws as may be
customary or required for transactions of the type contemplated by this
Agreement and the Commitment Letters or reasonably requested by Parent;
_provided_ that, until the Closing Date occurs, neither the Company nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall (1) be required to pay any commitment or other
similar fee, (2) have any liability or any obligation under any credit
agreement or any related document or any other agreement or document related
to the Financing (or alternative financing that Parent may raise in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) or (3) be required to
incur any other liability in connection with the Financing (or any
alternative financing that Parent may raise in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) unless reimbursed or indemnified
by Parent to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company. The Company will
provide to Parent and the Financing Sources such information as may be
necessary so that the Financing Information and Marketing Material (in each
case, to the extent provided by the Company) are complete and correct in all
material respects and does not and will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements contained therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
such statements are made, not misleading. The Company hereby consents to the
use of all of its and its Subsidiaries logos in connection with the
Financing. Notwithstanding any other provision set forth herein or in any
other agreement between the Company and Parent (or its Affiliates), the
Company agrees that Parent and its Affiliates may share non-public or
confidential information regarding the Company and its businesses with the
Financing Sources, and that Parent, its Affiliates and the Financing Sources
may share such information with potential financing sources in connection
with any marketing efforts (including any syndication) in connection with the
Financing; _provided_ that (I) all non-public or other confidential
information provided by the Company or any of its Representatives pursuant to
this _Section 8.05_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and Merger Subsidiary shall be
permitted to disclose such information to potential syndicate members during
syndication, subject to customary confidentiality undertakings by such
potential syndicate members, and (II) the Company shall be permitted a
reasonable period to comment on any documents or other information circulated
to potential financing sources that contain or are based upon any such
nonpublic or other confidential information. Parent (A) shall promptly, upon
request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out of pocket
costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives in connection with the
cooperation of the Company and its Subsidiaries and their Representatives
contemplated by this _Section 8.05_ and (B) shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives
from and against any and all losses, damages, claims, costs or expenses
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the
Financing and any information (other than information provided solely by or on
behalf of the Company) used in connection therewith.

 



54 (c) Parent shall take all action necessary to enforce the obligations of
Guarantor under the Equity Commitment Letter, subject to the terms and
conditions thereof.

execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger
Subsidiary, any deeds, bills of sale, filings in relation to Intellectual
Property, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of the Company or Merger Subsidiary, any other actions and things to

Corporation of the Company Shares from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the
Company Shares under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the
Effective Time.

and non-appealable that makes consummation of the Merger illegal or otherwise
prohibited, or enjoins the Company or Parent from consummating the Merger;

of its obligations or abided by any of its covenants required to be performed
or abided by it under this Agreement or any of the Companys representations
and warranties are or become untrue or incorrect (without regard
to materiality qualifiers contained therein) which failure to perform or to
be true and correct, (A) would give rise to the failure of a condition set
forth in _Section 9.02(a)_ or _Section 9.02(b)_ and (B) is
either incurable, or if curable is not cured by the Company by the earlier of
(x) 30 days following receipt by the Company of written notice of such breach
or failure to perform and (y) the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Parent is not then in material breach of this Agreement; or

(iii) if a Company Material Adverse Effect shall have occurred and be
continuing and if curable has not been cured by the Company within 30 days

event from Parent.

Directors of the Company authorizes the Company to enter into a binding
definitive agreement in respect of a Superior Proposal in compliance with
_Section 6.03_; _provided_ , that the Company shall have paid any amounts due
pursuant to _Section 10.02_ hereof in accordance with the terms, and at the
times, specified therein; and _provided_   _further_ , that

 



58  in the event of such termination, the Company substantially concurrently

Proposal;

 

(ii) Parent or Merger Subsidiary shall have failed to perform in any material
respects any of its obligations or abided by any of its covenants required to
be performed or abided by it under this Agreement or any of Parents or Merger
Subsidiarys representations and warranties are or become untrue or incorrect
(without regard to materiality qualifiers contained therein) which failure to
perform or to be true and correct, (A) would give rise to the failure of a
condition set forth in _Section 9.03(a)_ or _Section 9.03(b)_ and (B) is
either incurable, or if curable, is not cured by Parent by the earlier of (x)
30 days following receipt by Parent of written notice of such breach or
failure to perform and (y) the End Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
Company is not then in material breach of this Agreement; or

(iii) (A) the conditions set forth in _Section 9.01_ and _Section
9.02_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied
by actions taken at the Closing, _provided_ that each such condition is then
capable of being satisfied at a Closing on such date) have been satisfied and
remain satisfied, (B) all of the conditions set forth in _Section 9.03_ have
been satisfied (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be
satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, each of which is then capable of
being satisfied at a Closing on such date, and other than by virtue of Parent
and Merger Subsidiary failing to effect the Closing) or the Company has

10.01(d)(iii)_ if the Company is then in breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement hereunder that would result in the Financing
being unavailable.

 

The party desiring to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.01_ (other than pursuant to _Section 10.01(a)_) shall give written notice
of such termination to each other party hereto.

Section 10.02. _Effect of Termination_. 

(a) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01_,
written notice thereof shall be given to the other party or parties,
specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which such termination is made,
and this Agreement shall forthwith become void and of no effect without
liability of any party (or any stockholder or Representative of such party)
to each other party hereto, except with respect to _Section 6.04(b)_, this
_Section 10.02_, and _Article 11_ ; _provided_ , that no such termination
shall relieve any party from liability for any damages resulting from fraud
or a Willful Breach of this Agreement. As used herein, " _Willful Breach_ "

 



59  means a material breach of any representation, warranty or covenant or other
agreement set forth in this Agreement that is a consequence of any act or
failure to act by the other party with the actual knowledge that the taking
of such act or failure to take such act would cause a breach of this
Agreement.

(b) If this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section
10.01(c)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) within two Business Days following the occurrence
of such termination a fee in an amount equal to $11,000,000 (" _Company
Termination Fee_ ").

(c) If (A) an Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or
disclosed and not terminated or withdrawn prior to the termination of this
Agreement (or, in the event of termination pursuant to _Section
10.01(b)(iii)_, not terminated or withdrawn at least five Business Days prior
to the Stockholder Meeting), (B) this Agreement is terminated by either Parent
or the Company, as applicable, pursuant to _Sections 10.01(b)(i)_ ,
_10.01(b)(iii)_ or _10.01(c)(ii)_ (with regard to  _Section 10.01(c)(ii)_,
solely with respect to the failure of the Company to perform any of its
covenants or obligations under this Agreement), and (C) within 12 months
following the date of such termination, the Company enters into a Contract
providing for the implementation of an Acquisition Proposal or consummates an
Acquisition Proposal, then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer
of immediately available funds) the Company Termination Fee on or prior to the
date on which the Company enters into such Contract or consummates such
Acquisition Proposal, as applicable. For purposes of the foregoing clauses (A)
and (C) only, references in the definition of the term "Acquisition Proposal"
to the figure "20%" will be deemed to be replaced by the figure "50%".

(d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section
10.01(d)(i)_, then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) the Company Termination Fee concurrently with
such termination.

 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated by either party pursuant to _Section
10.01(b)(iii)_ or by Parent pursuant to  _Section 10.01(c)(ii)_ (with
respect to the failure of the Company to perform its obligations under
_Section 6.02),_ then the Company shall pay to Parent (by wire transfer of
immediately available funds) the aggregate amount of all reasonable and
documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including all attorneys fees,
accountants fees, financial advisory fees and filing fees) actually incurred
by or on behalf of Parent on or prior to the date of such termination in
connection with the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and
otherwise in connection with the Merger up to a maximum amount of $2,900,000
in the aggregate (the " _Parent Expenses_ "). Payment of the Parent Expenses
shall be made within three Business Days after Parent provides the Company
with appropriate documentation of such fees and expenses. No amount shall be
payable by Company to Parent pursuant to this _Section 10.02(e)_ if a
Company Termination Fee has been paid to Parent as a result of the
termination of this Agreement prior to or contemporaneously with the time when
any payment under this _Section 10.02(e)_ would be due in connection with
such termination. 

(f) If this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to (i) _Section
10.01(d)(ii)_, because of a breach of _Section 5.06_ or the failure of
Parent to perform or abide by any of covenants in _Section 8.05_, and at the
time of such termination there is no state of facts or

 



60  circumstances that would reasonably be expected to cause the conditions in
_Section 9.01_, _Section 9.02(a)_, _Section 9.02(b)_ or _Section 9.02(d)_
not to be satisfied by the End Date, or (ii) _Section 10.01(d)(iii)_, then
Parent shall pay to the Company (by wire transfer of immediately available
funds) within two Business Days following the occurrence of such termination a
fee in an amount equal to $20,000,000 (" _Parent Termination Fee_ ").

(g) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
10.02_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and that, without these agreements, no party would enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if a party fails to pay any amount due to the other party
pursuant to this _Section 10.02_, when due, the non-paying party shall pay
the costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) in
connection with any action taken to collect payment (including
the prosecution of any lawsuit or other legal action), together with interest
on the unpaid amount at the prime rate as published in The Wall Street Journal
from the date such amount was first payable to the date it is paid. The
parties agree that in no event shall the fees payable pursuant to this
_Section 10.02_ shall be payable on more than one occasion.

(h) The parties agree and understand that payment of the Parent Termination
shall constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Company, and that payment of the Company Termination Fee (and,
if the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section 10.02(c)_,
any Parent Expenses theretofore payable) shall constitute liquidated damages
in a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Subsidiary, in
each case, for the respective efforts and resources expended and the
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.01(d)(ii)_ or
_Section 10.01(d)(iii)_ under circumstances where the Parent Termination Fee
is payable under _Section 10.02(f)_, the Companys receipt of the Parent
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Related
Parties against the Parent Related Parties for any losses or damages suffered
as a result of any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement or the failure of the Merger to be consummated. In the event of
fraud or a Willful Breach by Parent or Merger Subsidiary, the Company shall be
entitled to seek damages against Parent or Merger Subsidiary as set forth in
_Section 10.02(a)_, subject to the limitation in the next sentence. In no
event, whether or not this Agreement shall have been terminated, shall the
Company Related Parties be entitled to monetary damages from the Parent
Related Parties in excess of $20,000,000 in the aggregate, inclusive of the
Parent Termination Fee (if payable), for all losses and damages arising from
or in connection with breaches of this Agreement by Parent or Merger
Subsidiary or otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the
Financing).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Parent or Merger
Subsidiary fail to effect the Closing for any or no reason or otherwise breach
this Agreement or fail to perform hereunder (in any case, whether willfully,
intentionally, 

 



61  unintentionally or otherwise and whether or not the result of a Willful
Breach), then except for an order of specific performance as and only to the
extent expressly permitted by  _Section 11.12_, the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Company Related Parties (whether at law, in equity, in contract,
in tort or otherwise) against the Parent Related Parties for any breach, loss
or damage shall be for the Company to terminate this Agreement as and only to
the extent provided in _Section 10.01(d)_ and receive payment of the Parent
Termination Fee, if then payable pursuant to _Section 10.02(f)_, or other
amounts, if any, referenced in  _Section 10.02(h)(i)_. Upon payment of the
Parent Termination Fee, if applicable, or such other amounts, no Person shall
have any rights or claims against Parent, Merger Subsidiary or the Guarantor
under this Agreement, the Limited Guaranty, the Commitment Letter, or
otherwise, whether at law or equity, in contract in tort or otherwise, and no
Parent Related Party shall have any further liability relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (including the
Merger and the Financing), and the Company agrees to cause any action or
proceeding pending in connection with this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the Merger and the Financing) against Parent
or any member of the Parent Related Parties to be dismissed with prejudice
promptly, and in any event within five Business Days thereafter. In no event
shall the Company seek or permit to be sought any losses from, or otherwise
bring any action or proceeding against, any of the Parent Related Parties in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger and the Financing), other than an action or proceeding
to recover payment of the Parent Termination Fee or other amounts, if any,
referenced in _Section 10.02(h)(i)_, or for specific performance as set forth
in _Section 11.12_. Nothing in this _Section 10.02(h)(ii)_ shall in any way
expand or be deemed or construed to expand the circumstances in which Parent
or any other member of the Parent Related Parties may be liable under this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger
or the Financing).

 

(iii) It is acknowledged and agreed that, except for the payment by Parent of
the Parent Termination Fee (if payable) or other amounts referenced in
_Section 10.02(h)(i)_, none of Parent nor any other member of the Parent
Related Parties shall have any liability for any losses to the Company or any
other Company Related Party in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby (including the Merger or the Financing), and
in no event shall Parent or the other Parent Related Parties be liable for or
obligated to pay consequential, special, multiple, punitive or
exemplary damages including damages arising from loss of profits, business
opportunities or goodwill in respect of any breach or failure to comply with
this Agreement or in respect of any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(including the Merger or the Financing). While the Company may pursue both a
grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 11.12_ and the
payment of the Parent Termination Fee (if payable) or other amounts referenced
in _Section 10.02(h)(i)_, under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance and any
money damages, including all or any portion of the Parent Termination Fee.

 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in the event
that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 10.1(c)_ or _Section
10.1(d)(i)_ under circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is due and
payable under _Section_

 



62   _10.02_ , Parents right to terminate and receive the Company Termination
Fee (and, if the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to _Section
10.02(c)_, any Parent Expenses theretofore payable) shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of Parent or Merger Subsidiary against the Company and its
stockholders, Affiliates and Representatives for the loss or damage suffered
as a result of the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement contained in this Agreement by the Company and the failure of the
transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated, and upon payment of such
amount, none of the Company Related Parties or their respective
Representatives shall have any further liability or obligation relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby. In no event shall the Company or the other Company Related Parties be
liable for or obligated to pay consequential, special, multiple, punitive or
exemplary damages including damages arising from loss of profits, business
opportunities or goodwill in respect of any breach or failure to comply with
this Agreement or in respect of any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(v) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, no Company
Related Party shall (x) have any rights or claims against any of the Financing
Sources in connection with this Agreement, the Financing or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise (and all such rights and claims are hereby waived by the
Company Related Parties) and (y) commence or support any action or proceeding
against any Financing Source in connection with this Agreement, the
Financing or the transaction contemplated hereby and thereby; provided that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section 10.02(h)_ shall in
any way limit or modify the rights and obligations of Parent or Merger
Subsidiary under this Agreement or any Financing Sources obligations to
Parent or Merger Subsidiary under the Commitment Letter.
