          (b) APPOINTMENT OF MARKETING AGENT. Prior to Closing, a person

reasonable best efforts to effect the sale of the debt portion of the Parent
OBSAs for cash on or promptly after the Effective Time in accordance with the

<PAGE>


effect the Merger. Immediately after the Effective Time and prior to any such
sale, the Nominee will take all necessary action to detach the warrants from
such Parent OBSAs, such that only the debt portion of such Parent OBSAs will be
sold. Parent shall take all reasonably necessary action to permit, expedite and
facilitate such sale, whether through the public market or a private placement,
including without limitation, as directed by the Marketing Agent (i) submitting
to Euronext a listing application covering the debt portion of the Parent OBSAs
and obtaining their admission to trading, (ii) assisting with roadshows
customary for an offering of this type or other marketing efforts, (iii)
cooperating with due diligence requests from the purchasers and (iv) entering
into customary agreements and indemnities in connection therewith (to the extent
customary in the French market with respect to secondary offerings of bonds).
Parent shall execute prior to the Effective Time an agreement with the Marketing
Agent providing for such obligations of Parent. Prior to the time of any sale of
the debt portion of the Parent OBSAs at the direction of the Marketing Agent,
the right to receive the Net Cash Proceeds shall be subject to reasonable
transfer restrictions to be agreed upon by the Company and Parent prior to the
Effective Time.

          (d) DISTRIBUTION OF PROCEEDS AND WARRANTS. The Nominee shall (i)
immediately after the Effective Time transfer to the Exchange Agent for deposit
in the Class A Exchange Fund and the Class B Exchange Fund, as applicable, in
accordance with Section 2.01(a), the warrants detached from the Parent OBSAs for
distribution as set forth in Section 2.05(b), and (ii) immediately after the
closing of the sale of the debt portion of the Parent OBSAs, distribute the
proceeds from the sale of the debt portion of the Parent OBSAs, together with
any interest payments or other distributions made with respect to the Parent
OBSAs since the Effective Time, net of any costs, expenses or sale commissions
or underwriting fees as follows: (x) an amount equal (after conversion into U.S.
dollars at the then-prevailing euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate) to the aggregate
Cash Payment payable under Section 2.08 (plus any interest costs incurred by the
Surviving Corporation to fund the payments required by Section 2.08 between the
date of such payment and the date on which such payment is made to the Parent
pursuant to this Section 2.02(d)) shall be paid to Parent and (y) the remaining
cash proceeds (the "NET CASH PROCEEDS") shall be transferred to the Exchange
Agent for deposit in the Class A Exchange Fund and the Class B Exchange Fund, as
applicable in accordance with Section 2.01(a), for distribution as set forth in
Section 2.05(b).

          SECTION 2.03 SEPARATION OF LEGAL TITLE AND USUFRUCT WITH RESPECT TO
CERTAIN SHARES. (a) Prior to Closing, a person selected by the Company and
reasonably acceptable to Parent shall be appointed as nominee (the "SPECIAL
NOMINEE") to perform the functions described in this Section 2.03. The
definitive terms governing the responsibilities of the Special Nominee will be
determined by the Company consistent with this Section 2.03 and will be set
forth in an agreement (the "SPECIAL NOMINEE Agreement"). The Special Nominee
Agreement shall contain customary provisions providing for payment of a fee to
the Special Nominee, customary indemnification and hold harmless provisions in
favor of the Special Nominee and otherwise be on terms satisfactory to the
Company. At the Effective Time, all Parent Ordinary Shares referenced in Section
2.01(a)(i)(B) will be issued by Parent and delivered by Parent LLC to the
Special Nominee, which shall act for the benefit of and on behalf of the former
holders of Class A Common Stock, including with respect to the holding of the
usufruct for their benefit as described below.


                                       5

<PAGE>


          (b) On the Closing Date, the Special Nominee will convey to Dentsu,
pursuant to conveyance instruments as agreed between the Special Nominee and
Dentsu, bare legal title (NUE PROPRIETE) to the Parent Ordinary Shares
referenced in Section 2.01(a)(i)(B) for a two-year period, with automatic
reversion of the NUE PROPRIETE to the holder of the usufruct interest in such
shares at the expiration of such two-year period. Such conveyance instruments
will result in Dentsu, for such two-year period, being the registered holder of
such Parent Ordinary Shares on the books and records of Parent and having the
right to exercise all voting rights attached thereto at all meetings of Parent
shareholders. The conveyance instruments shall contain all provisions that are
necessary or desirable to ensure that all economic interests in such shares
shall be enjoyed exclusively by the holder of the usufruct interest in such
shares. Such conveyance instruments shall further provide that in the event that
any holder of the usufruct exercises in whole or in part its preferential
subscription rights to subscribe to newly issued Parent Ordinary Shares, the NUE
PROPRIETE thereof shall automatically be transferred to Dentsu, with automatic
reversion to the usufruct holder at the end of the two-year period following the
Closing Date and all other provisions governing the respective rights of the
usufruct holders and the holder of the NUE PROPRIETE that apply to the Parent
Ordinary Shares referenced in Section 2.01(a)(i)(B) shall apply MUTATIS MUTANDIS
to such new shares. Except as may be provided in the Special Nominee Agreement,
the usufruct interest in such shares will be retained by the Special Nominee for
the benefit of former holders of Class A Common Stock.

          SECTION 2.04 DISSOLUTION OF VOTING TRUST. As of the date hereof, all
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock are held of record by voting trustees
(the "VOTING TRUSTEES") pursuant to the Amended and Restated Voting Trust
Agreement dated as of January 31, 2000 and amended and restated as of April 18,
2001 (the "VOTING TRUST AGREEMENT"). Immediately prior to the Effective Time,
the Voting Trust Agreement shall be terminated and the related trust (the
"VOTING TRUST") dissolved, such that at the Effective Time the former holders of
trust certificates are reflected on the books and records of the Company as
record holders of uncertificated shares of Class A Common Stock.

          SECTION 2.05 EXCHANGE OF SHARES. (a) EXCHANGE FUNDS. (i) At the
Effective Time, for the benefit of holders of Class A Common Stock converted in
accordance with Section 2.01(a)(i), Parent shall cause Parent LLC to deposit
with a bank or trust company selected by Parent and reasonably satisfactory to
the Company (the "EXCHANGE AGENT") the Parent Ordinary Shares (other than shares
delivered under Section 2.03) and the Parent ORAs to be received by the holders
of Class A Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(i) (such securities,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto and the Net
Cash Proceeds and warrants deposited pursuant to Section 2.02(d), being
hereinafter referred to as the "CLASS A EXCHANGE FUND").

               (ii) At the Effective Time, for the benefit of holders of Class B
Common Stock converted in accordance with Section 2.01(a)(ii), Parent shall
cause Parent LLC to deposit with the Exchange Agent the Parent Ordinary Shares
(other than shares delivered under Section 2.03) and the Parent ORAs to be
received by the holders of Class B Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.01(a)(ii)
(such securities, together with any dividends or distributions with respect
thereto and the Net Cash Proceeds and warrants deposited pursuant to Section
2.02(d), being hereinafter referred to as the "CLASS B EXCHANGE FUND"; the Class
A Exchange

                                       6

<PAGE>

Fund and the Class B Exchange Fund are collectively referred to herein as the
"EXCHANGE FUNDS").

          (b) EXCHANGE PROCEDURES. Except as set forth in Section 2.05(i), as
promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall
deliver to each holder of shares of Class A Common Stock, as reflected in the
books and records of the Company at the Effective Time, the Merger Consideration
in the Class A Exchange Fund, together with cash in lieu of any fractional
security to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(e) and any
dividends or other distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 2.05(c). As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to Dentsu the Merger Consideration in the Class B
Exchange Fund, together with cash in lieu of any fractional security to which
such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(e) and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(c). In
the event of a transfer of Shares which is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be delivered to a
transferee if all documents required to evidence and effect the transfer are
presented to the Exchange Agent, accompanied by evidence that any applicable
stock transfer taxes have been paid.

          (c) DISTRIBUTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UNEXCHANGED SHARES. No dividends,
interest payments or other distributions declared or paid after the Effective
Time with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ORAs with a record date
after the Effective Time shall be paid to any former holder of Shares with
respect to Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ORAs represented thereby, until the
Merger Consideration shall be delivered to such holder by the Exchange Agent.
Subject to the effect of escheat, tax or other applicable Laws (as defined in
Section 3.04(a)), following such delivery, there shall be paid to the holder of
Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ORAs, without interest, (i) at the time of such
delivery, the amount of dividends or other distributions payable in respect of
such Parent Ordinary Shares or Parent ORAs with a record date after the
Effective Time and a payment date on or prior to the date of such delivery and
(ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends, interest payments
or other distributions, with a record date after the Effective Time but a
payment date occurring after delivery, payable with respect to such Parent
Ordinary Shares or Parent ORAs; provided, however, that Parent Ordinary Shares
issued in connection with the Merger shall not be entitled to the normal annual
cash dividend declared in 2002 related to Parent's 2001 fiscal year.

          (d) NO FURTHER RIGHTS IN COMPANY COMMON STOCK. The Merger
Consideration shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to any Shares.

          (e) NO FRACTIONAL PARENT ORDINARY SHARES, PARENT ORAS OR PARENT
WARRANTS. (i) No fractional Parent Ordinary Share, Parent ORA or Parent warrant
(after aggregating all fractional Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent ORA or Parent
warrants to be received by a particular holder) shall be issued, and such
fractional Parent Ordinary Share, Parent ORA or Parent warrant will not entitle
the owner thereof to any rights of a holder thereof. Each holder of Shares
otherwise entitled to receive a fractional Parent Ordinary Share, Parent ORA or
Parent warrant will be entitled to receive in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 2.05(e) a cash payment in lieu of that fractional Parent Ordinary
Share, Parent ORA or Parent warrant.

                                       7

               (ii) With respect to a fractional Parent Ordinary Share, such
cash-in-lieu payment shall represent the holder's proportionate interest in the
net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent, on behalf of all holders
otherwise entitled to fractional Parent Ordinary Shares, of the fractional
Parent Ordinary Shares which would otherwise be issued pursuant to the Merger
(the "EXCESS SHARES"). The sale of the Excess Shares by the Exchange Agent, as
agent for the holders of Shares, shall be executed through Euronext Paris SA
("EURONEXT") as soon as practicable after the Effective Time at the then
prevailing market prices and the proceeds of such sale shall be converted from
Euros into U.S. Dollars at the then prevailing exchange rates. Until the net
proceeds of any such sale shall have been distributed to the holders of Shares,
the Exchange Agent shall hold such proceeds in trust for such holders.

                (iii) The Surviving Corporation shall pay all commissions,
transfer taxes, foreign exchange fees, and other out-of-pocket expenses and the
Exchange Agent's compensation and expenses in connection with such sale or sales
of Parent Ordinary Shares pursuant to this Section 2.05(e). The Exchange Agent
shall determine the portion of such net proceeds to which each holder of Shares
shall be entitled, if any, by multiplying the amount of the aggregate net
proceeds by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the fractional
Parent Ordinary Share to which such holder of Shares is entitled and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional Parent Ordinary
Shares to which all holders of Shares are entitled. As soon as practicable after
the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of Shares
with respect to any fractional Parent Ordinary Shares, the Exchange Agent shall
promptly pay such amounts to such holders of Shares subject to and in accordance
with this Section 2.05(e).

              (iv) With respect to fractional Parent ORAs and Parent warrants,
each holder of a fractional Parent ORA or a fractional Parent warrant shall be
paid an amount in cash (rounded down to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, equal to the product of (i) such fractional Parent ORA or fractional
Parent warrant, as the case may be, multiplied by (ii) the fair market value of
the Parent ORA and Parent warrant as determined in good faith by the Board of
Directors of the Company at the Effective Time expressed in U.S. dollars and
using the same methodology as used by the Board of Directors of the Company
under Section 2.08(a). As promptly as practicable after the determination of the
amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional Parent ORAs and
Parent warrants, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall
deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent
to forward payments to such holders of fractional Parent ORAs and Parent
warrants subject to and in accordance with the terms of Sections 2.05(a) and
(b).

          (f) TERMINATION OF EXCHANGE FUNDS. Any portion of the Exchange Funds
which remains unclaimed by former holders of Shares one year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, to be held in trust for former
holders of Shares, and any such former holders of Shares shall thereafter look
only to Parent for the Merger Consideration and any dividends, interest payments
or other distributions with respect to Parent Ordinary Shares and Parent ORAs to
which they are entitled pursuant to Section 2.05(c). Any portion of the Exchange
Funds remaining unclaimed by such former holders as of a date which is
immediately prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any government entity shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any claims or
interest of any person previously entitled thereto.

                                       8

<PAGE>

          (g) NO LIABILITY. To the extent permitted by applicable Law (as
defined in Section 3.04(a)), neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall
be liable to any holder of Shares for any portion of the Merger Consideration
(or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or cash required by Law to
be surrendered to a public official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat
or similar Law.

          (h) WITHHOLDING RIGHTS. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares or Company Stock
Options, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of
Shares or Company Stock Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be.

          (i) DISSENTING SHARES. Notwithstanding Section 2.01, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with the DGCL (collectively,
the "DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into a right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, any such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such Shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent,
neither the Company nor the Surviving Corporation shall make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands. The Exchange Agent
shall withhold the Merger Consideration for each Dissenting Share and, upon
demand, shall promptly return to Parent LLC the Merger Consideration made
available to the Exchange Agent by Parent LLC pursuant to Section 2.05(a) to pay
for Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected. The amount any holder
of Class A Common Stock is entitled to receive in an appraisal proceeding is set
forth in Section 6.6 of each holder's 2000 Stock Purchase Agreement.

          SECTION 2.06 STOCK TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares thereafter on the records of the Company.
From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Shares outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with respect to such
Shares, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement or by Law.

          SECTION 2.07 ADJUSTMENTS. Without duplication of any required
adjustments under French Law, if after the date of this Agreement and prior to
the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of capital stock of the
Company or Parent shall occur, including by reason of any reclassification,
recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or readjustment of
shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during such period, the
Class A Consideration and the Class B Consideration and any other amounts
payable pursuant to

                                       9

<PAGE>

this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted to provide the holders of Shares
the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

          SECTION 2.08 COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS. (a) Each option to purchase Shares
(a "COMPANY STOCK OPTION") that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time pursuant to the Company's 2000 Long-Term Equity Incentive Plan
and the 2001 California Stock Option Plan (collectively, the "COMPANY STOCK
OPTION PLANS"), by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of
the holder thereof, shall be cancelled (and any Company stock appreciation right
that was granted in tandem with a Company Stock Option shall also be cancelled)
immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall, subject to Section 2.08(c),
entitle the holder thereof, in cancellation and settlement therefor, to a
payment, if any, in cash by the Company (less any applicable withholding taxes)
equal to the product of (i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Stock Option and (ii) the excess, if any, of the fair
market value of the Class A Consideration at the Effective Time over the
exercise price per share of Company Common Stock under the applicable Company
Stock Option (the "CASH PAYMENT"). For purposes of this Section 2.08, the fair
market value of the Class A Consideration shall be expressed in U.S. dollars and
determined in good faith by the Board of Directors of the Company pursuant to
its authority as administrator of the Company Stock Option Plans.

          (b) Notwithstanding anything in Section 2.08(a) to the contrary,
optionees jointly selected by Parent and the Company shall, subject to the
consent of such optionees, be paid the Cash Payment over a set period of time
and on terms to be determined. The Company shall deliver to Parent prior to the
Effective Time a true and complete list of the Company Stock Options that remain
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall take all necessary action to terminate the
Company Stock Option Plans, and any other plan, program or arrangement providing
for the issuance or grant of any other interest (including phantom interest) in
the capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary, in each case effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time, except for Sections 6(e)(vi) and 6(f)
of the 2001 California Stock Option Plan and Section 6(f) of the 2000 Long-Term
Equity Incentive Plan, which shall survive in their entirety and shall continue
to apply to the former option holders, except that instead of applying
exclusively to the "Option Gain" (as defined in the Company Stock Option Plans),
the sections shall apply to the Option Gain and the Cash Payments (and solely
for purposes of interpreting such sections, any previously paid Cash Payment
shall be treated as Option Gain, and any Cash Payment due in the future will be
treated as if it were an outstanding Company Stock Option), and any such
payments shall be forfeited in the event that a former option holder engages in
the activities prohibited by such sections. The Company and Parent agree that
the Cash Payments are the sole payments or consideration that will be made or
provided with respect to or in relation to the Company Stock Options.

          (c) The Cash Payments shall be subject to the provisions of Section
6.15(e).

          SECTION 2.09 PARENT ORAS AND PARENT OBSAS. (i) The Parent ORAs to be
issued pursuant to the Merger shall have the terms set forth in the CONTRAT
D'EMISSION governing such Parent ORAs in substantially the form attached as
EXHIBIT C-1 (the "ORA ISSUANCE CONTRACT"), an English term sheet for which is
attached as EXHIBIT C-2. (ii) The Parent OBSAs to be issued pursuant to the
Merger shall have the terms set forth in the CONTRAT D'EMISSION governing such
parent OBSAs in substantially the form attached as EXHIBIT D-1 (the "OBSA

                                       10

<PAGE>

ISSUANCE CONTRACT"), an English term sheet for which is attached as EXHIBIT D-2.
In the case of conflict, the applicable English term sheet shall govern.

          SECTION 2.10 DENTSU PAYMENT. It is agreed and understood that neither
Parent nor the Company shall directly or indirectly be required to, nor shall
they, provide any funds or other property (other than the conversion of Dentsu's
shares of Class B Common Stock into Class B Consideration (as defined in the
Bcom3 Merger Agreement) pursuant to the Bcom3 Merger and the issuance of the
Class B Consideration to Dentsu pursuant to the Merger in exchange for its
shares of Class B Common Stock) to Dentsu in connection with the Merger,
reimburse Dentsu in cash or other property for the payment of the cash
consideration required to be paid by Dentsu in the Bcom3 Merger or otherwise
assist Dentsu in financing or funding such payment.

                                  ARTICLE III

                  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

           Except as disclosed in the Company SEC Reports (as defined in Section
3.06(a)) or as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by the Company to
Parent and Merger Sub concurrently with the execution of this Agreement (the
"COMPANY DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") and making reference to the particular section of
this Agreement to which exception is being taken, the Company hereby represents
and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub that:

          SECTION 3.01 ORGANIZATION AND QUALIFICATION; SUBSIDIARIES. Each of the
Company and each subsidiary of the Company (each such subsidiary a "COMPANY
SUBSIDIARY", and collectively the "COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES") is a corporation or
other entity duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization and has all
requisite corporate or other power and authority to own, lease and operate its
properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except
where the failures to be so organized, existing or in good standing or to have
such corporate or other power, and authority have not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do
business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of
the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its business
makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be
so qualified or licensed and in good standing that have not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. The term "COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means any
change in or effect on the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
that is materially adverse to the business, assets, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries taken as a
whole, except for any such change or effect resulting from or arising out of (i)
changes in circumstances or conditions affecting the advertising industry in
general, (ii) changes in general United States or global economic or business
conditions or financial markets or (iii) the announcement of this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby. The Company has heretofore made available
to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Amended and Restated Certificate of
Incorporation and the Amended and Restated By-Laws of the

                                       11

<PAGE>

Company. Such Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation and Amended and
Restated By-Laws are in full force and effect.

          SECTION 3.02 CAPITALIZATION. The authorized capital stock of the
Company consists of 50,000,000 shares of capital stock, consisting of (a)
40,000,000 shares of Class A Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share and (b)
10,000,000 shares of Class B Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share. As of
March 5, 2002, (i) 15,289,804 shares of Class A Common Stock and 4,284,873
shares of Class B Common Stock were issued and outstanding, all of which are
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable, (ii) no shares of Company Common
Stock were held in the treasury of the Company or by the Company Subsidiaries,
and (iii) 1,846,660 shares were reserved for future issuance pursuant to the
Company Stock Options. As of March 5, 2002, Company Stock Options to acquire
1,742,796 shares of Class A Common Stock were issued and outstanding. All
outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully
paid and nonassessable. Except as set forth in this Section 3.02 and for changes
since March 5, 2002 resulting from the exercise of Company Stock Options
outstanding on such date, there are no outstanding shares of capital stock or
voting securities of the Company, and there are no options, warrants or other
subscription rights, preemptive or similar rights, agreements, arrangements or
commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the Company or any Company
Subsidiary to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock, voting
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or
voting securities of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or obligating the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such
option, warrant, subscription or other right, convertible security, agreement,
arrangement or commitment. All shares of Company Common Stock subject to
issuance as aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in
the instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of Company Common Stock or any capital stock of any
Company Subsidiary, except as provided in stock purchase agreements entered into
between the Company and each shareholder substantially in the form included as
an exhibit in the Company's registration statement on Form 10, filed with the
SEC (as defined in Section 3.06(a)) on April 30, 2001 and in stock purchase
agreements entered into between the Company and holders of Company Stock
Options. Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Company Subsidiary is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such
share owned by the Company or another Company Subsidiary is free and clear of
any security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first
refusal, agreements, limitations on the Company's or such other Company
Subsidiary's voting rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature
whatsoever, except where the failure to own such shares free and clear would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.03 AUTHORITY RELATIVE TO THIS AGREEMENT. The Company has all
necessary corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement,
and, subject to obtaining the necessary approvals of the Company's stockholders,
to perform its obligations hereunder and to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the Merger and

Agreement or to consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (other than, with respect to the Merger, the approval of this
Agreement by the holders of a majority of then outstanding Shares, and the
filing and recordation of appropriate merger documents as required by the DGCL).
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the Company
and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by Parent, Merger
Sub and Parent LLC, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.

          SECTION 3.04 NO CONFLICT; REQUIRED FILINGS AND CONSENTS. (a) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and the
performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, (i) conflict with or
violate the Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation or Amended and
Restated By-Laws of the Company or any equivalent organizational documents of
any Company Subsidiary, (ii) assuming that all consents, approvals,
authorizations and other actions described in Section 3.04(b) have been obtained

breach of or constitute a default (or an event which with notice or lapse of
time or both would become a default) under, or give to others any right of
termination, amendment, acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a lien or other encumbrance on any property or asset of the Company
or any Company Subsidiary pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or
obligation binding upon the Company or any Company Subsidiary, except, (x) with
respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences that have not had, and could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect, and that could not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (y)
with respect to clause (iii), for any such conflicts, violations, breaches,
defaults or other occurrences arising under or out of (A) agreements the loss of
the net income from which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Company Material Adverse Effect or (B) agreements the Company has the right or
ability to terminate without cause with less than six months' notice.

          (b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do
not, and the performance of this Agreement by the Company will not, require any
consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or notification
to, any domestic or foreign governmental or regulatory authority ("GOVERNMENTAL
ENTITY"), except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (together with the rules and regulations

                                       13

consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect, and could
not reasonably be expected to prevent or materially delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

          SECTION 3.05 COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary is in conflict with, or in default or violation of, any Law
applicable to the Company or any Company Subsidiary or by which any property or
asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound or affected, except for
any such conflicts, defaults or violations that have not had, and could not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect.

          SECTION 3.06 SEC FILINGS; FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. (a) The Company has
filed all forms, reports and documents required to be filed by it with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") since April 30, 2001 through the

respective dates they were filed (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior
to the date hereof, on the date of such filing), (i) the Company SEC Reports

date of this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time will be prepared, in all
material respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act or
the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) none of the Company SEC Reports
contained, nor will any forms, reports and documents filed after the date of
this Agreement and prior to the Effective Time contain, any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No Company Subsidiary
is required to file any form, report or other document with the SEC.

          (b) Each of the consolidated financial statements (including, in each
case, any notes thereto) contained in the Company SEC Reports and in any form,
report or document filed after the date of this Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time was, or will be, as the case may be, prepared in accordance with

10-Q of the SEC) and each presented or will present fairly, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company and the
consolidated Company Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and their
consolidated results of operations for the respective periods indicated therein,

subject to non-material reclassifications, and the Company's consolidated income

The Company 2001 Financial Statements will not be materially different from the
corresponding items included in the audited financial statements of the Company
to be included in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended

          SECTION 3.07 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES OR EVENTS. Since April 30,
2001, except as contemplated by or as disclosed in this Agreement, the Company
and the Company Subsidiaries have conducted their businesses only in the
ordinary course and in a manner consistent with past practice and, since such
date, there has not been (a) any event, occurrence, development or state of
circumstances or facts that, either individually or in the aggregate, has had,

Company, threatened against the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, before any court,
arbitrator or Governmental Entity, domestic or foreign, which has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary nor any
property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is subject to any
continuing order of, or consent decree, settlement agreement or other similar
written agreement with, any Governmental Entity, or any order, writ, judgment,

is required, (v) the most recent actuarial report or valuation relating to a
Company Benefit Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA and (vi) the most recent
determination letter, if any, issued by the IRS with respect to any Company
Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code. Schedule
3.09(a) sets forth a complete list of all material Company Benefit Plans. Except
as specifically provided in the foregoing documents delivered to Parent, there
are no amendments to any material Company Benefit Plan that have been adopted or
approved nor has the Company or any Company Subsidiary undertaken to make any
such amendments or to adopt or approve any new material Company Benefit Plan.

          (b) With respect to each Company Benefit Plan which is subject to
Title IV of ERISA, (i) the present value of accrued benefits under such Company
Benefit Plan, based upon the actuarial assumptions used for funding purposes in
the most recent actuarial report prepared by such Company Benefit Plan's actuary
with respect to such Company Benefit Plan, did not, as of its latest valuation
date, exceed the then current value of the assets of such Company Benefit Plan
allocable to such accrued benefits, and to the Company's knowledge, no events
have occurred that would change such calculations as of the date hereof, (ii) no
"reportable event" (within the meaning of Section 4043 of ERISA) has occurred
with respect to any Company Benefit Plan for which the 30-day notice requirement
has not been waived and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement will not result in the occurrence of any such reportable event,
except where such reportable event would not have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, (iii) all premiums to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the
"PBGC") have been timely paid in full, (iv) no liability (other than for
premiums to the PBGC) under Title IV of ERISA has been or is expected to be
incurred by the Company or any Company Subsidiary, (v) the PBGC has not
instituted proceedings to terminate any such Company Benefit Plan and, to the
Company's knowledge, no condition exists that presents a risk that such
proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds under Section
4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a trustee to
administer, any such Company Benefit Plan, and (vi) no condition exists which
would subject the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any fine under Section
4071 of ERISA, except where such condition would not have a Company Material
Adverse Effect. No Company Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as such term
is defined in section 3(37) of ERISA).

          (c) With respect to the Company Benefit Plans, no event has occurred,
and there exists no condition or set of circumstances, in connection with which
the Company or any Company Subsidiary could reasonably be expected to be subject
to any actual or contingent liability under the terms of such Company Benefit
Plans, ERISA, the Code or any other applicable law which has had, or could
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company Benefit Plans has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with applicable laws and
administrative or governmental rules and regulations, including, but not limited
to, ERISA and the Code, except where a violation of any such law, rule or
regulation would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the Company
Benefit Plans intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of
the Code has received a favorable determination letter as to such qualification
from the IRS, and no event has occurred, either by reason of any action or
failure to act, and no condition exists which would cause the loss of any such
qualification, except where such loss of qualification would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All contributions or other amounts payable by the
Company or any Company

                                       16

<PAGE>

Subsidiary with respect to each Company Benefit Plan in respect of current or
prior plan years have been paid or accrued in accordance with GAAP and Section
412 of the Code.

          (d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is a party to any
collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to persons
employed by the Company or any Company Subsidiary and no collective bargaining
agreement is being negotiated by the Company or any Company Subsidiary. During
the past three years, neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has
experienced any work stoppage or other labor difficulty, and as of the date of
this Agreement, there is no effort by or on behalf of any labor union to
organize any persons employed by the Company and there is no labor dispute,
strike or work stoppage against the Company or any Company Subsidiary pending or
threatened in writing, except where such dispute, strike or work stoppage has
not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
none of the Company, any Company Subsidiary, or their respective representatives
or employees, has committed any unfair labor practices in connection with the
operation of the respective businesses of the Company or any Company Subsidiary,
and there is no charge or complaint against the Company or any Company
Subsidiary by the National Labor Relations Board or any comparable state agency
pending or threatened in writing, except where such unfair labor practice,
charge or complaint has not had, and could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

          (e) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have no liability for
life, health, medical or other welfare benefits to former directors, officers,
employees or consultants or beneficiaries or dependents thereof, except for
health continuation coverage as required by Section 4980B of the Code or Part 6
of Title I of ERISA and arrangements provided to individuals at a cost that is
not material to the Company. No condition exists that would prevent the Company
or any Company Subsidiary from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan
providing for health, medical or life insurance benefits in respect of any
active employee, director, officer, or consultant of the Company or any Company
Subsidiary other than limitations imposed under the terms of a collective
bargaining agreement.

          (f) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
shareholder approval, or the consummation, of the transactions contemplated
hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with any other event) result in,
cause the accelerated vesting, funding or delivery of, or increase the amount or
value of, any payment or benefit to any director, officer, employee or
consultant of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or result in any limitation
on the right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to amend, merge, terminate
or receive a reversion of assets from any Company Benefit Plan or related trust.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property, or in the form of benefits) by the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment" within
the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

          (g) None of the Company and any Company Subsidiary nor any other
person, including any fiduciary, has engaged in any "prohibited transaction" (as
defined in Section 4975

                                       17

<PAGE>

of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA), which could reasonably be expected to
subject any of the Company Benefit Plans or their related trusts, the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any person that the Company or any Company Subsidiary
has an obligation to indemnify, to any material tax or penalty imposed under
Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

          (h) There are no material pending or threatened claims (other than
claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations which have
been asserted or instituted, and, to the Company's knowledge, no set of
circumstances exists which may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit,
against the Company Benefit Plans, or any fiduciaries thereof, with respect to
their duties to the Company Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts
under any of the Company Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to the
PBGC, the Department of Treasury, the Department of Labor, any Multiemployer
Plan, any Company Benefit Plan, any participant in a Company Benefit Plan, or
any other party.

          (i) Each Company Benefit Plan that is subject to or governed by the
law of any jurisdiction other than the United States or any State or
Commonwealth of the United States (each, a "COMPANY FOREIGN BENEFIT PLAN"), has
been maintained in material compliance with its terms and conditions and in
material compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and all statutory
and regulatory laws that are applicable to such Company Foreign Benefit Plan
(including, without limitation, establishing book reserves in accordance with
normal accounting practices and qualifying for special tax treatment if such
treatment was intended), except that would not, individually or in the
aggregate, be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
disclosed on Schedule 3.09(i), no material Company Foreign Benefit Plan is a
defined benefit pension plan.

          (j) Each of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries is in compliance
with all applicable Laws and collective bargaining agreements respecting
employment and employment practices, terms and conditions of employment, wages
(including withholding) and hours and occupational safety and health, except as
could not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

          SECTION 3.10 CONTRACTS. Except as disclosed in the Company SEC
Reports, there is no contract or agreement that is material to the financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is in violation
of or in default under (nor does there exist any condition which upon the
passage of time or the giving of notice would cause such a violation of or
default under) any loan or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture or
lease, or any other contract, agreement, arrangement or understanding to which
it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets is bound, except
for violations or defaults that have not had, and could not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary is party to any agreement
restricting the right of the Company or any Company Subsidiary to compete with
another person or restricting the conduct of the business of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary in any geographical area, not including exclusivity or
similar agreements that are customary in the advertising industry. Except as
disclosed in the Company SEC Documents, the

                                       18

<PAGE>

Company is not a party to any contract, understanding, arrangement, letter
agreement, letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar arrangement
with Dentsu.

          SECTION 3.11 TRADEMARKS, PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS. Except as would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries own or possess adequate licenses or other
valid rights to use all patents, patent rights, trademarks, trademark rights,
trade names, trade dress, trade name rights, copyrights, service marks, trade
secrets, applications for trademarks and for service marks, know-how and other
proprietary rights and information used or held for use in connection with the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as currently conducted, and
no assertion or claim has been made in writing challenging the validity of any
of the foregoing which would have a Company Material Adverse Effect. The conduct
of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as currently
conducted does not conflict in any way with any patent, patent right, license,
trademark, trademark right, trade dress, trade name, trade name right, service
mark or copyright of any third party that has had, or could reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect.

          SECTION 3.12 CLIENT RELATIONS; MEDIA BUYING. (a) As of the date
hereof, to the Company's knowledge, except as would not reasonably be expected,
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no
material client of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has advised
the Company or such Company Subsidiary orally or in writing that it is (x)
terminating or considering terminating the handling of its business by the
Company or such Company Subsidiary as a whole or in any substantial part or (y)
planning to reduce its future spending with the Company or such Company
Subsidiary in any manner which was not reflected in the 2002 revenue budget of
the Company.

          (b) The Company is not a party to any long-term media-buying
agreements material to the business of the Company.

          SECTION 3.13 KEY MANAGERS. As of the date hereof, to the Company's
knowledge, except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, none of the key account
managers of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries has advised the
Company or such Company Subsidiary orally or in writing that he or she is
terminating or considering terminating his or her employment with the Company or
such Company Subsidiary.

          SECTION 3.14 TAXES. (a) Except for such matters that would not have,
and could not reasonably be expected to have, a Company Material Adverse Effect,
(i) the Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries have timely filed all
returns and reports required to be filed by them with any taxing authority with
respect to Taxes (as defined below), all such returns and reports are complete
and accurate and all Taxes shown to be due on such returns have been timely
paid, (ii) all Taxes (whether or not shown on any Tax return) owed by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary and required to have been paid have been

has established an adequate reserve for such Taxes, (iii) there are no pending
proceedings by any taxing authority for the assessment or collection of Taxes
against the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries and (iv) the Company and
each

                                       19

statements for any accrued Taxes (or Taxes otherwise due) that have not been
paid. As used in this Agreement, "TAXES" shall mean any and all taxes, fees,
levies, duties, tariffs, imposts and other charges of any kind (together with
any and all interest, penalties, additions to tax and additional amounts imposed
with respect thereto) imposed by any government or taxing authority, including,
without limitation: taxes or other charges on or with respect to income,

similar charges.

          (b) Leo Burnett Company, Inc. was classified as an "S corporation"
within the meaning of Section 1361 of the Code for all periods from January 1,
1987 through December 31, 1998 (and for any other period, if any, as to which it
reported as an "S corporation") for US federal income tax purposes and during
such periods validly elected to be classified as an "S corporation" in each
state where it filed a Tax return on such basis. Leo Burnett Company, Inc. and

(other than Leo Burnett Company, Inc. and its subsidiaries) has ever filed a Tax
return reporting that such corporation was classified as an "S corporation" or a
"qualified subchapter S subsidiary" within the meaning of Section 1361 of the
Code.

          (c) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has constituted
either a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" within the
meaning of Section 355(a)(1)(A) of the Code in a distribution of stock intended
to qualify for tax-free treatment under Section 355 of the Code (x) in the two
years prior to the date of this Agreement (or will constitute such a corporation
in the two years prior to the Closing Date) or (y) which otherwise constitutes
part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions" within the meaning of
Section 355(e) of the Code in conjunction with the Merger.

          (d) The Company and its Subsidiaries have not made any payments, are
not obligated to make any payments, and are not a party to any agreements that
under any circumstances could obligate any of them to make any payments that
would constitute compensation in excess of the limitation set forth in Section
162(m) of the Code.

          SECTION 3.15 VOTE REQUIRED. The only vote of the holders of any class
or series of capital stock of the Company necessary to approve this Agreement,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is the
affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock, voting as one class in favor of the approval of this
Agreement. Pursuant to the Voting Trust Agreement, each holder of record of
trust certificates of the Voting Trust has the right to direct the Voting
Trustees in the voting on the Merger of shares of Class A Common Stock
attributable to such holder, and the Voting Trustees, as record holders of all
outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock, shall solicit such

                                       20

prevent or impede the Merger from constituting a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

          SECTION 3.17 OPINION OF FINANCIAL ADVISOR. The Company has received
the opinion, to be confirmed in writing, of Morgan Stanley & Co. Incorporated

fair to such holders from a financial point of view, a copy of which opinion
will be delivered to Parent promptly after the date of this Agreement.

          SECTION 3.18 BROKERS. No broker, finder or investment banker (other

             REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND MERGER SUB

           Except as disclosed in the publicly available Parent Reports filed
with the Agencies or as set forth in the Disclosure Schedule delivered by Parent
and Merger Sub to the Company concurrently with the execution of this Agreement
(the "PARENT DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE") and making reference to the particular
subsection of this Agreement to which exception is being taken, Parent and
Merger Sub hereby jointly and severally represent and warrant to the Company

good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization and has all requisite corporate or other power and authority to
own, lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now
being conducted, except where the failures to be so organized, existing or in
good standing or to have such corporate or other power and authority have not
had, and could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of Parent
and the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign
corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where
the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of
its business makes qualification or licensing necessary, except for such
failures to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing that have not had,
and could not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,
a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The term "PARENT MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT"
means any change in or effect on the business of Parent and the Parent
Subsidiaries that is materially adverse to the



                                       21

<PAGE>

business, assets, financial condition or results of operations of Parent and the

resulting from or arising out of (i) changes in circumstances or conditions
affecting the advertising industry in general, (ii) changes in general United

the announcement of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Shares were held in the treasury of Parent or owned by Parent Subsidiaries. As
of March 5, 2002, Parent had outstanding stock options under stock option plans,
programs and arrangements of Parent and the Parent Subsidiaries (the "PARENT

set forth in this Section 4.02 and for changes since March 5, 2002 resulting
from the exercise of Parent Stock Options outstanding on such date which were
granted pursuant to Parent Stock Option Plans, there are no outstanding shares
of capital stock or voting securities of the Company, and there are no options,
warrants or other subscription rights, preemptive or similar rights agreements,
arrangements or commitments of any character relating to the issued or unissued
capital stock of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary or obligating Parent or any
Parent Subsidiary to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital stock, voting
securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or

Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to grant, extend or enter into any such option,
warrant, subscription or other right, convertible security, agreement,
arrangement or commitment. All Parent Ordinary Shares subject to issuance as
aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions specified in the
instruments pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no outstanding
obligations of Parent or any Parent Subsidiary to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any Parent Ordinary Shares or any capital stock of any Parent
Subsidiary. Each outstanding share of capital stock of each Parent Subsidiary is
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and each such
share owned by Parent or another Parent Subsidiary is free and clear of all
security interests, liens, claims, pledges, options, rights of first refusal,
agreements, limitations on Parent's or such other Parent Subsidiary's voting
rights, charges and other encumbrances of any nature whatsoever, except where
failure to own such shares free and clear would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Parent Material Adverse Effect. The authorized capital stock
of Merger Sub consists of 100 shares of common stock, par value $.01

                                       22

which are owned by Parent. Each of the Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent ORAs and

Parent Ordinary Shares when issued upon redemption of Parent ORAs or exercise of
Parent warrants, shall be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, will provide its holders with the same
rights as the rights of the holders of securities of the same category.

          (b) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
Parent and the Company will use reasonable best efforts to obtain a no-action
letter from the SEC to permit registration of the Parent OBSAs on a registration
statement on Form F-4 without compliance with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939
(the "TRUST INDENTURE ACT"). If such no-action letter is granted, Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC a registration statement on Form F-4 for the
registration under the Securities Act of the Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent
OBSAs and Parent ORAs to be issued pursuant to the Merger. If such no-action
letter is not granted, then at the option of the Company either (i) if permitted
under applicable Law, the offer and sale of Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent OBSAs
and Parent ORAs will not be registered under the Securities Act, but shall be
made in a private placement in reliance upon the exemption from registration
provided by Regulation D promulgated thereunder or (ii) Parent shall prepare and
file a registration statement on Form F-4 for the registration under the
Securities Act of Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent OBSAs and Parent ORAs, and the
form and terms of the Parent OBSAs shall be modified as necessary to comply with
the Trust Indenture Act.

          (c) In the event a registration statement on Form F-4 (together with
all amendments thereto, the "REGISTRATION STATEMENT") is filed, (i) each of
Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Registration Statement to become effective as promptly as practicable, (ii)
prior to the effective date of the Registration Statement, Parent shall take all
or any action required under any applicable U.S. federal or state and non-U.S.
securities laws in connection with the issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares,
Parent ORAs and Parent OBSAs

                                       33

<PAGE>

pursuant to the Merger and (iii) the Company shall furnish all information
concerning itself as Parent may reasonably request in connection with such
actions and the preparation of the Registration Statement.

          (d) In the event of a private placement, (i) Parent shall take all or
any action required under any applicable U.S. federal or state and non-U.S.
securities laws to permit the issuance of Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent ORAs
and Parent OBSAs pursuant to the Merger in accordance with such laws without
registration under the Securities Act and (ii) if at any time after the Closing
any former holder of Shares (other than any such holder who is an affiliate of
Parent at such time) proposes to resell, in a manner consistent with the terms
of EXHIBIT A, Parent Ordinary Shares, Parent ORAs or the warrant portion of the
Parent OBSAs outside the United States but, in the opinion of counsel to such
holder, cannot do so in reliance on Regulation S or any other exemption from
registration under the Securities Act, Parent shall register such securities
pursuant to the Securities Act to permit such person to resell such securities.

          (e) As promptly as practicable after the execution of this Agreement,
(i) Parent shall prepare, file, publish, make available and/or mail to Parent
Shareholders, as applicable, the resolutions related to the Parent Proposals,
the RAPPORT DU DIRECTOIRE ET DU CONSEIL DE SURVEILLANCE A L'ASSEMBLEE, the
RAPPORTS DES COMMISSAIRES and the NOTE D'OPERATION (together with any amendments
thereof or supplements thereto, the "PARENT PROXY STATEMENT" and, together with
the Company Proxy Statement, the "PROXY STATEMENTS") relating to the meeting of
Parent's shareholders (the "PARENT SHAREHOLDERS' MEETING" and, together with the
Company Stockholders' Meeting, the "SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS") to be held to
consider approval of the Parent Proposals (as defined in Section 6.02); and (ii)
Parent shall prepare and file with the COB all filings required by COB
regulations (the "OTHER PARENT FILINGS") in connection with the Parent
Shareholders' Meeting to be held to consider approval of the Parent Proposals.
The Company shall promptly furnish all information concerning the Company as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with such actions and the
preparation of the Parent Proxy Statement and the Other Parent Filings. The
Company and its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on the Registration Statement, the Parent Proxy Statement and the Other
Parent Filings prior to them being filed with the applicable agency.

          (f) The Company Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of
the Board of Directors of the Company to the shareholders of the Company in
favor of approval of this Agreement; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Board of
Directors of the Company may, at any time prior to the Effective Time, withdraw,
modify or change any such recommendation to the extent that the Board of
Directors of the Company determines in good faith after consultation with
independent legal counsel that the failure to so withdraw, modify or change its
recommendation would cause the Board of Directors of the Company to breach its
fiduciary duties to the Company's shareholders under applicable Law.

          (g) The Parent Proxy Statement shall include the recommendation of the
Supervisory Board and the Management Board of Parent to the shareholders of
Parent in favor of the Parent Proposals; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Supervisory
Board or the Management Board of Parent may, at any time prior to the Effective
Time, withdraw, modify or change any such recommendation to the extent that the
Supervisory Board or the Management Board of Parent determines in good faith
after consultation with independent legal counsel that the failure to so

                                       34

<PAGE>

withdraw, modify or change its recommendation would cause the Supervisory Board
or the Management Board of Parent to breach its fiduciary duties to Parent's
shareholders under applicable Law.

          (h) No amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement or the
Registration Statement will be made by the Company or Parent without the
approval of the other party (such approval not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed). Parent and the Company each will advise the other, promptly after they
receive notice thereof, of the time when the Registration Statement has become
effective or any supplement or amendment has been filed, of the issuance of any
stop order, of the suspension of the qualification of Parent Ordinary Shares,
Parent ORAs or Parent OBSAs issuable in connection with the Merger for offering
or sale in any jurisdiction, or of any request by the SEC for amendment of the
Registration Statement or the Company Proxy Statement or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information.

Meeting and (iv) the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material

Effective Time, any event or circumstance relating to Parent or any Parent
Subsidiary, or their respective officers or directors, should be discovered by
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or a supplement to the
Registration Statement or the Company Proxy Statement, Parent shall promptly
inform the Company. All documents that Parent is responsible for filing with the
SEC in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will comply as to form and substance in all material aspects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.

Meeting, and (iv) the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or fail to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading. The information supplied by the
Company for inclusion in the Parent Proxy Statement shall not, at (i) the time
the Parent Proxy Statement (or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto) is
first mailed to the stockholders of Parent, and (ii) the time of the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting, and the information supplied by the Company for inclusion
in the Other Parent Filings at the time such Other Parent Filings are filed with
the COB shall not, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or fail to

circumstance relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary, or their
respective officers or directors,

                                       35

<PAGE>

should be discovered by the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or
a supplement to the Registration Statement, the Proxy Statements or the Other
Parent Filings, the Company shall promptly inform Parent. All documents that the
Company is responsible for filing with the SEC in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement will comply as to form and
substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder and the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder.

          SECTION 6.02 SHAREHOLDERS' MEETINGS. The Company shall call and hold

stockholders proxies in favor of, the approval of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Parent shall call and hold the

number of members of the Supervisory Board of Parent by two, who shall be

STATUTS to provide that the respective holders of the usufruct and NUE PROPRIETE
interests in the Parent Ordinary Shares are free to allocate the voting rights
between themselves and shall notify Parent of the same (collectively, the
"PARENT PROPOSALS"). Parent and the Company shall take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of shareholders required by
French law or the DGCL, as applicable, to obtain such approvals, except to the
extent that the Board of Directors of the Company or the Management Board or the
Supervisory Board of Parent, as the case may be, determines in good faith after
consultation with independent legal counsel that doing so would cause the Board
of Directors of the Company, or the Management Board or the Supervisory Board of
Parent, as the case may be, to breach its fiduciary duties to such party's
shareholders under applicable Law. The Company shall call and hold the Company
Stockholders' Meeting for the purpose of considering approval of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby regardless of whether the exception in
the immediately preceding sentence applies or the proviso in Section 6.01(f)
applies, and Parent shall call and hold the Parent Shareholders' Meeting for the

          SECTION 6.03 ACCESS TO INFORMATION; CONFIDENTIALITY. (a) Except as
required pursuant to any confidentiality agreement or similar agreement or
arrangement to which Parent or the Company or any of their respective

their respective subsidiaries to): (i) provide to the other (and its officers,
directors, employees, accountants, consultants, legal counsel, agents and other
representatives, collectively, "REPRESENTATIVES") access at reasonable times
upon prior notice to the officers, employees, agents, properties, offices and
other facilities of the other and its subsidiaries and to the books and records
thereof and (ii) furnish promptly such information concerning the business,
properties, contracts, assets, liabilities, personnel and other aspects of the
other party and its subsidiaries as the other party or its Representatives may
reasonably request.

<PAGE>

          (b) Subject to Section 6.04(d), Parent and the Company shall comply
with, and shall cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of

Parent.

          SECTION 6.04 NO SOLICITATION OF TRANSACTIONS. (a) Parent will not,
directly or indirectly, and Parent will instruct its officers, directors,
employees, subsidiaries, agents or advisors or other representatives (including,
without limitation, any investment banker, attorney or accountant retained by
it), not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing nonpublic information), or knowingly facilitate,
any inquiries or the making of any proposal or offer (including, without

such action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing contained in this Section 6.04
shall prohibit Parent from furnishing information to, or entering into
discussions or negotiations with, any person in connection with an unsolicited
(from the date of this Agreement) proposal for a Competing Transaction involving
Parent, if, and only to the extent that, (i) the Supervisory Board or the
Management Board of Parent, after consultation with independent legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such action is required for the Supervisory Board
or the Management Board of Parent to comply with its fiduciary duties to its
shareholders imposed by applicable Law and (ii) prior to furnishing such
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person,
(x) Parent obtains from such person an executed confidentiality agreement on
terms no less favorable to Parent than those contained in the Confidentiality
Agreement and (y) Parent notifies the Company immediately of inquiries,
proposals or offers received, any information requested, or discussions or
negotiations sought to be initiated or continued, indicating, in connection with
such notice, the name of such person and the terms and conditions of any

Company Subsidiary, to take any such action; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing
contained in this Section 6.04 shall prohibit the Company from furnishing
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, any person in
connection with an unsolicited (from the date of this Agreement) proposal for a
Competing Transaction involving the Company, if, and only to the extent that,
(i) the Board of Directors of the Company, after consultation with independent
legal counsel, determines in good faith that such action is required for the
Board of Directors of the Company to comply with its fiduciary duties to its
shareholders imposed by applicable Law and (ii) prior to furnishing such
information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such person,
(x) the Company obtains from such person an executed confidentiality agreement
on terms no less favorable to the Company than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement and (y) the Company notifies Parent immediately of

obligations of Dentsu to the Company which the Company deems reasonably
necessary to consummate the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of
Directors of the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 or 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to any Competing Transaction.

          (c) A "COMPETING TRANSACTION" means any of the following involving
Parent or the Company, as the case may be (other than the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement): (i) a merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination or other similar transaction; (ii) any sale,
lease, exchange, transfer or other disposition of 25% or more of the assets of
such party and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (iii) the acquisition of

such party; or (iv) a tender offer or exchange offer by a person as a result of
which such person would become the beneficial owner of 25% or more of the
outstanding voting securities of such party. For purposes of this Section 6.04,
the term "BENEFICIAL OWNER" shall have the meaning ascribed to it in Rule 13d-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

          (d) This Section 6.04 supersedes Section 10 of each of the
Confidentiality Agreements, which Section 10 shall have no further force or
effect as of the date hereof.

          SECTION 6.05 DIRECTORS' AND OFFICERS' INDEMNIFICATION AND INSURANCE.
(a) The By-Laws of the Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions regarding
directors' and officers' indemnification and insurance reasonably satisfactory
to the Company which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that
would affect adversely the rights thereunder of individuals who at or at any
time prior to the Effective Time were directors, officers, employees,
fiduciaries or agents of the Company.

                                       38

<PAGE>

          (b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable Law and regardless of whether the Merger
becomes effective, indemnify and hold harmless, and, after the Effective Time,
Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, indemnify and hold harmless, each present and former
director or officer of the Company and each Company Subsidiary and each such
person who served at the request of the Company or any Company Subsidiary as a
director, officer, trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another
corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee
benefit plan or enterprise (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") against all
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and settlement amounts paid in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising
before or after the Effective Time), whether civil, administrative or
investigative, arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission in their
capacities as officers or directors, in each case occurring before the Effective
Time (including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Without
limiting the foregoing, in the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, (i) the Company or Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as
the case may be, shall pay the fees and expenses of counsel selected by any
Indemnified Party, which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Company
or to Parent and the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, promptly after
statements therefor are received (unless the Surviving Corporation shall elect
to defend such action) and (ii) the Company and Parent and the Surviving
Corporation shall cooperate in the defense of any such matter, PROVIDED,
HOWEVER, that none of the Company, Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall be
liable for any settlement effected without its written consent (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

          (c) For a period of six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause to be maintained in effect the current directors' and officers' liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company (provided that Parent may
substitute therefor policies reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Parties
of at least the same coverage containing terms and conditions which are no less
advantageous) with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred
prior to the Effective Time; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that in no event shall Parent be
required to expend pursuant to this Section 6.05(c) more than an amount per year
equal to 250% of current annual premiums paid by the Company for such insurance
(which premiums the Company represents and warrants to be approximately $440,000
per year in the aggregate), and if the annual premium for such insurance at any
time during such period shall exceed 250% of such rate, Parent shall provide
such coverage as shall then be available at an annual premium equal to 250% of
such rate.

          (d) This Section 6.05 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on the Surviving Corporation and its
respective successors and assigns. In the event Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or
(ii) transfers all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person,
then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors
and assigns of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, honor the indemnification obligations set forth in this Section 6.05. The
rights of each of the Indemnified Parties under this Section 6.05 shall be in
addition to

                                       39

<PAGE>

any rights such person may have under the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or under Delaware Law or any
other applicable laws or under any agreement of any Indemnified Party with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

          SECTION 6.06 OBLIGATIONS OF MERGER SUB AND PARENT LLC. Parent shall
take all action necessary to cause Merger Sub and Parent LLC to perform their
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement.

          SECTION 6.07 COMPANY AFFILIATES. No later than 30 days after the date
of this Agreement, the Company shall deliver to Parent a list of names and
addresses of those persons who were, in the Company's reasonable judgment, on
such date, affiliates (within the meaning of Rule 145 of the rules and
regulations promulgated under the Securities Act) of the Company. The Company
shall provide Parent with such information and documents as Parent shall
reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such list. The Company shall use
its reasonable best efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Parent, prior
to the Effective Time, an affiliate letter in the form customarily obtained from
such affiliates for purposes of Rule 145, executed by each of the affiliates of
the Company identified in the foregoing list and any person who shall, to the
knowledge of the Company, have become an affiliate of the Company subsequent to
the delivery of such list.

subject to the conditions hereof, each of the parties hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action and do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable law or otherwise to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) obtain from
Governmental Entities any consents, licenses, permits, waivers, approvals,
authorizations, rulings or orders required to be obtained or made by Parent or
the Company or any of their subsidiaries in connection with the authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (in the case of any such
application for a ruling from the Internal Revenue Service, such application
shall be made jointly by Parent and the Company) and (iii) make all necessary
filings, and thereafter make any other submissions requested by any Governmental
Entities in connection with such filings, with respect to this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement required under
(A) the Exchange Act and the Securities Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder and any other applicable federal or state securities laws, (B) the
HSR Act and (C) any other applicable Law; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT Parent shall
not be obligated to agree to material restrictions on the conduct of its
business following the Effective Time or to divest any of its material assets or
material assets of any of its affiliates, or the Company or any of its
affiliates. The parties hereto shall cooperate with each other in connection
with the making of all such filings, including by providing copies of all such
documents to the nonfiling party and its advisors prior to filing and, if
requested, by accepting all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
in connection therewith. The parties may, as each deems advisable and necessary,
reasonably designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other
under this Section as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient unless express permission is obtained in
advance from the source of

the materials or its legal counsel.

          SECTION 6.09 PLAN OF REORGANIZATION; TAX TREATMENT. (a) This Agreement
is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g). Each party hereto shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. Each party hereto shall use
its reasonable best efforts to cause the delivery of the opinions referred to in
Sections 7.02(d) and 7.03(c) and the delivery of representations substantially

          (b) The parties agree to report the Parent ORAs as stock for U.S.
federal income tax purposes unless otherwise required by a "determination"
within the meaning of Section 1313(a) of the Code or by law, PROVIDED that the
holders thereof report the Parent ORAs as stock for such purposes.

          (c) For United States federal income tax purposes, the parties agree
to report the Parent OBSAs as two separate instruments with the debt component
treated as indebtedness and the warrant component treated as a zero principal
amount security, unless otherwise required by a determination within the meaning
of Section 1313(a) of the Code or by law, PROVIDED that the holders thereof so
treat the Parent OBSAs for United States federal income tax purposes.

          SECTION 6.10 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The initial press release relating

each other before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statements with respect to this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that are in the aggregate no less
favorable than those provided to such persons pursuant to the Company Benefit

equity-based compensation or benefits). Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall recognize (or cause to be recognized) service with the Company and the

similar Parent Benefit Plans with respect to the same periods of service.

          (b) The cost of the Company's Annual Incentive Plan (the "INCENTIVE
PLAN") has been included in the Company's 2002 budget, which has been provided
to Parent prior to the date hereof. From and after the Effective Time until
December 31, 2002, Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
maintain the Incentive Plan in accordance with its terms and conditions for all
eligible employees who participate in the Incentive Plan immediately prior to

March 15, 2003.

          (c) Following the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall use reasonable efforts to cooperate to adopt or maintain stock option

selected Company employees who are key employees and who continue employment
with Parent or one of its Subsidiaries. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent and
the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to determine the number of Parent
Ordinary Shares underlying options that will be granted under such plans for the
benefit of such selected Company employees.

          (d) Parent and the Company hereby agree that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall not constitute a "Hostile Change in

Receipts, including with respect to distribution of voting materials, currency

that the custodian shall not have legal, beneficial, equitable or other
ownership of the Parent Ordinary Shares.

or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation

earlier of the termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms or the
Effective Time, Parent and the Company determine in their reasonable judgment
that consummation of the Merger on the terms contemplated by this Agreement
would not permit delivery of the opinions contemplated by Sections 7.02(c) or
7.03(c), Parent and the Company agree to negotiate in good faith adjustments to
this Agreement to address such matters in a manner that would substantially
preserve the economic benefits of this transaction for Parent and the

the satisfaction or waiver (where permissible) of the following additional
conditions:

          (a) the representations and warranties of the Company contained in
this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the Effective Time as though made
on and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an
earlier date, in which case as of such date), except where the failure to be so

Material Adverse Effect, and Parent shall have received a certificate of the
Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial Officer of the Company to such
effect;

          (b) the Company shall have performed or complied with all agreements

& Ellis, counsel to the Company, dated as of the date hereof and as of the
Closing Date, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to Parent and the
Company, to the effect that, for United States federal income tax purposes: (i)
the limitations on each transferee's ownership rights set forth in the 2000
Stock Purchase Agreements between the Company and the holders of Class A Common
Stock (the "2000 STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENTS") constitute "nonlapse restrictions"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.83-3(h), (ii) each person
who has entered into a 2000 Stock Purchase Agreement with the Company owns the
Class A Common Stock covered by such person's 2000 Stock Purchase Agreement (and
owned such stock as of the date of this Agreement), and (iii) such stock was
"transferred" to such person prior to the date of this Agreement and such stock

in the hands of such person (and became so prior to the date of this Agreement),

thereunder.

          SECTION 7.03 CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY. The
obligations of the Company to consummate the Merger are subject to the

Sub contained in this Agreement shall be true and correct as of the Effective
Time as though made on and as of the Effective Time (except to the extent
expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date), except
where failure to be so true and correct (without giving effect to any
qualification as to "materiality" or "Parent Material Adverse Effect" set forth
therein) would not have or could not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and the
Company shall have received a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer or
Chief Financial Officer of Parent to such effect;

          (b) Parent and Merger Sub shall have performed or complied with all
agreements and covenants required by this Agreement to be performed or complied
with by it on or prior to the Effective Time, except where the failure to so
comply would not have or could not reasonably be expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, and the Company shall
have received a certificate of the Chief Executive Officer or Chief Financial
Officer of Parent to that effect; and

          (c) the Company shall have received the opinion of Kirkland & Ellis,
special tax counsel to the Company, dated as of the Closing Date, based upon
facts, representations and assumptions set forth in or referred to in such
opinion, to the effect that for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (i) the Merger
will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code and (ii) each transfer of property to Parent by a stockholder of the
Company pursuant to the Merger will not be subject to Section 367(a)(1) of the
Code. In rendering such opinion, Kirkland & Ellis may require and shall be
entitled to rely upon representations, rulings and opinions of Parent, the
Company or others including representations substantially in the form of
EXHIBITS E AND F, respectively. The opinion set forth in clause (ii) above may
assume that any stockholder who is a "five-percent transferee shareholder"
within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(ii) will file
the agreement described in Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(1)(iii)(B).

                                                                       EXHIBIT A

                          AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

         AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of March 7, 2002 among Bcom3
Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"), Boston Three Corporation, a
Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company ("MERGER
SUB"), and Dentsu Inc., a company organized under the laws of Japan ("DENTSU").

         WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the
Company, Publicis Groupe S.A., Philadelphia Merger Corp. and Philadelphia Merger
LLC ("PUBLICIS MERGER SUB") are entering into an Agreement and Plan of Merger
dated as of the date hereof (the "PUBLICIS MERGER AGREEMENT"), pursuant to
which, immediately following consummation of the Merger (as defined below)
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company will merge with and into Publicis
Merger Sub (the "PUBLICIS MERGER");

         WHEREAS, the purpose of the Merger is to effect a pro rata purchase of
shares of Class A Common Stock (as defined below) by Dentsu from the holders
thereof, followed by a recapitalization of the common stock of the Company.

         NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:

                                    ARTICLE 1
                                   THE MERGER

         Section 1.01. The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall
be merged (the "MERGER") with and into the Company in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware ("DELAWARE LAW"), whereupon the
separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION").

         (b) As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent
permitted hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and
Merger Sub will file a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of
State and make all other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in
connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the
"EFFECTIVE TIME") as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware
Secretary of State (or at such later time as may be specified in the certificate
of merger).

         (c) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all
of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company
and Merger Sub, all as provided under Delaware Law.


                                       1

<PAGE>


         Section 1.02. Conversion of Shares. At the Effective Time,

         (a) except as otherwise provided in 1.02(c) or Section 1.03(d), each
share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"CLASS A COMMON STOCK") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and shall be converted into the right to receive (i) an
amount in cash equal to the Aggregate Cash (as defined below) divided by the
total number of shares of Class A Common Stock then outstanding, which cash
shall be paid directly from Dentsu as provided in Section 1.03(b) and (ii)
0.813619 shares of Class A Common Stock (together, the "CLASS A CONSIDERATION");

         (b) except as otherwise provided in 1.02(c) or Section 1.03(d), each
share of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the
"CLASS B COMMON STOCK") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be cancelled and shall be converted into the right to receive 1.665067
shares of Class B Common Stock (the "CLASS B CONSIDERATION");

         (c) each share of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock held by
the Company as treasury stock immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

         (d) each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, and
no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

         The shares of Class A Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and the shares of Class B Common Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time are referred to herein collectively as the "SHARES".
The Class A Consideration and the Class B Consideration are referred to herein
collectively as the "MERGER CONSIDERATION".

         Section 1.03. Delivery of Merger Consideration. Except as set forth in
Section 1.03(d), immediately after the Effective Time, the Company shall take
all necessary action to reflect on the books and records of the Company the
conversion of Shares provided for in Section 1.02, such that each person who
held Shares immediately prior to the Effective Time will be reflected in such
books and records as the record holder of the number of shares (including
fractional shares, if any) of Class A Common Stock or Class B Common Stock to
which such person is entitled by virtue of the Merger.

         (b) Prior to the Effective Time, a paying agent shall be appointed (the
"PAYING AGENT") for the purpose of paying the cash portion of the Class A
Consideration. Dentsu hereby agrees, for its own benefit and the benefit of the
holders of Shares and not for the benefit of Publicis or the Company, to pay
$498,702,393 (the "AGGREGATE CASH") to the Paying Agent immediately after the
Effective Time. It is agreed and understood that neither Publicis nor the


                                       2

<PAGE>

Company shall directly or indirectly be required to, nor shall they, reimburse
Dentsu in cash or other property for the payment of the Aggregate Cash or
otherwise assist Dentsu in financing or funding such payment.

         (c) Except as set forth in Section 1.03(d), as promptly as practicable
after the Effective Time, the Paying Agent shall deliver to each holder of
Shares of Class A Common Stock, as reflected in the books and records of the
Company at the Effective Time, such holder's applicable cash portion of the
Class A Consideration. The Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the cash otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of
Shares, such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares in respect of which such
deduction and withholding was made.

         (d) Notwithstanding Section 1.02, Shares outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the
Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such
Shares in accordance with the Delaware Law (collectively, the "DISSENTING
SHARES") shall not be converted into a right to receive the applicable Merger
Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or otherwise loses
its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to
perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such Shares shall be treated
as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right to receive
the applicable Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration shall be withheld
for each Dissenting Share. The amount any holder of Class A Common Stock is
entitled to receive in an appraisal proceeding is set forth in Section 6.6 of
each holder's 2000 Stock Purchase Agreement with the Company.

         Section 1.04. Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of shares, or any stock dividend thereon with a record date during
such period, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted; provided
that no additional cash shall be payable by Dentsu pursuant to any such
adjustment.

                                   ARTICLE 2
                            THE SURVIVING CORPORATION

         Section 2.01. Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate of
incorporation of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be the

                                       3
<PAGE>

certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable law.

         Section 2.02. Bylaws. The bylaws of the Company in effect at the
Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in
accordance with applicable law.

         Section 2.03. Directors And Officers. From and after the Effective
Time, until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance
with applicable law, (i) the directors of the Company at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of the
Company at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                            CONDITIONS TO THE MERGER

         Section 3.01. Conditions to Obligations of Each Party. The obligations
of the Company, Merger Sub and Dentsu to consummate the Merger are subject to
the satisfaction of the following conditions:

         (a) this Agreement shall have been approved and adopted by the
stockholders of the Company and Merger Sub in accordance with Delaware Law;

         (b) satisfaction or, if permissible, waiver by the applicable party of
all conditions set forth in Article VII of the Publicis Merger Agreement (other
than the condition relating to the completion of the Merger contemplated by this
Agreement); and

         (c) no governmental entity or court of competent jurisdiction shall
have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any law, rule,
regulation, decree, executive order or award which is then in effect and has the
effect of making the Merger illegal or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the
Merger.

         Section 3.02. Conditions To Obligations Of Dentsu. The obligations of
Dentsu to consummate the Merger are subject to the satisfaction of the following
conditions:

         (a) the Company shall have provided to Dentsu or Publicis a certificate
meeting the requirements of Treas. Reg. Sections 1.1445-2(c)(3) and 1.897-2(h)
to the effect that the shares of the Company disposed of by Dentsu in the
transactions contemplated by the Publicis Merger Agreement do not constitute a
United States real property interest within the meaning of Section 897(c)(1)(A)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended; and

                                       4

<PAGE>


         (b) none of the conditions set forth in Article VII of the Publicis
Merger Agreement shall have been waived by the Company without the consent of
Dentsu (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

                                   ARTICLE 4
                       MATTERS RELATING TO PUBLICIS MERGER

         Section 4.01. Investment Agreement. The Company and Dentsu agree that
the Investment Agreement between Dentsu and the Company dated as of March 14,
2000 shall terminate immediately after the effective time of the Publicis
Merger.

         Section 4.02. Ownership Statement. Dentsu shall, if it is able to do
so, deliver to Publicis and the Company an ownership statement, dated as of the
Closing Date (as defined in the Publicis Merger Agreement), satisfying the
requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(i) (provided that
the "related" person statement required by Treasury Regulation Section
1.367(a)-3(c)(5)(i)(C)(2) may be made to Dentsu's best knowledge), in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Publicis and the Company.

         Section 4.03. Notices Under Publicis Merger Agreement. The Company
agrees to promptly forward to Dentsu a copy of any notices given to Publicis or
Publicis Merger Sub pursuant to Section 9.02 of the Publicis Merger Agreement
and to provide a copy of any notices it receives from Publicis or Publicis
Merger Sub pursuant to Section 9.02 of the Publicis Merger Agreement.

         Section 4.04. Amendment To Publicis Merger Agreement. The Company will
not amend any provision of the Publicis Merger Agreement without the prior
written consent of Dentsu (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, it being acknowledged that the refusal to consent to any amendment that
would in the good faith opinion of Dentsu's accountants jeopardize Dentsu's
ability to equity account, without the payment of any additional sum of money,
for its investment in Publicis after the Publicis Merger will be per se
reasonable).

         Section 4.05. Company Proxy Statement. Dentsu and its counsel shall be
given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Company Proxy
Statement (as defined in the Publicis Merger Agreement) prior to its being filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         Section 4.06. "Bare Legal Title" Matters.

         (a) Pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Publicis Merger Agreement, Dentsu
will receive bare legal title (nue propriete) to certain Parent Ordinary Shares
in the Publicis Merger for a two-year period after the closing of the Publicis
Merger.

                                       5

<PAGE>


Dentsu shall not transfer such bare legal title in such shares to any person or
entity during such two-year period.

         (b) The transfer of bare legal title to such shares to Dentsu will be
effected pursuant to conveyancing instruments between Dentsu and the Special
Nominee. Dentsu agrees that such instruments will contain all provisions that
are necessary or desirable to ensure that all economic interests in such shares
shall be enjoyed exclusively by the holder of the usufruct interest in such
shares (or such holder's successors or assigns) at all times during such
two-year period. Section 4.07 . Capital Stock Outstanding. As of March 5, 2002,

                                  TERMINATION

         Section 5.01. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the
Merger may be abandoned at any time prior to the Effective Time (notwithstanding

Company, Merger Sub or Dentsu if and at such time as the Publicis Merger
Agreement has terminated in accordance with its terms.

         Section 5.02. Effect of Termination. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to Section 4.01, this Agreement shall become void and of no effect
without liability of any party (or any stockholder, director, officer, employee,
agent, consultant or representative of such party) to the other party hereto.
The provisions of this Section 4.02 shall survive any termination hereof
pursuant to Section 4.01.

            ORDERLY MARKETING TERM SHEET FOR PARENT ORDINARY SHARES,
                         PARENT ORA AND PARENT WARRANTS
                         ------------------------------

------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------
LOCK-UP:     |_|   25% of Common Stock and usufructs relating to the Common
                   Stock to be released from the lock-up at the end of 6-, 12-,
                   18- and 24-month periods after closing of the transaction.

             |_|   The lock-up will apply to both shares and "usufructs" (i.e.,
                   economic interests in shares). The usufructs will be
                   allocated entirely to the last of the four 6-month periods
                   described above.


             |_|   25% of ORA and Warrants to be released from the lock-up at
                   the end of 30-, 36-, 42- and 48-month periods after the
                   closing of the transaction.


             |_|   The 25% lock-up release relates to a percentage of the total
                   amount of Common Stock, ORA and Warrants (together
                   "Securities"), not necessarily the percentage of Securities
                   owned by each individual holder provided that the allocation
                   methodology shall be determined by the Company prior to
                   closing.


             |_|   If Parent so elects in its sole discretion, more than 25% of
                   the Securities may be released in any six month period, and
                   in such case, the remaining lock-up release amounts will be
                   measured on a cumulative basis (For example, if 30% is
                   released in the first period, only 20% will be released in
                   the second period).

             |_|   Any Securities released from such lock-ups will be freely
                   transferable, except that any intended sales of such
                   Securities by the Former Target Shareholders on the public
                   market shall be subject to the following provisions.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Former      |_|   Either a trust, depository agent, or specified individuals
 Target            (e.g. largest shareholders of the Company) (the "Polling
 Shareholder       Agent") will poll the former Company shareholders ("Former
 POLLING:          Target Shareholders") each month as to their liquidity
                   requests, commencing in the month prior to the expiration of
                   the first six-month lock-up period (each, a "Poll"). The
                   Polling Agent will report the results of the Poll to Parent.

            |_|    The Poll will relate to the number of Securities, if any,
                   each Former Target Shareholder wishes to sell during the
                   ensuing month. In the case of an organized sale, Former
                   Target

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                   Shareholders will specify the price range at which he/she
                   will authorize the sale.

            |_|    If Former Target Shareholders desire to sell any previously
                   released shares between Polls, they may contact the Polling
                   Agent and such request will be granted subject to maintaining
                   an orderly distribution as described below in "Direct Release
                   of Securities" and "Sale Amount and Method".

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RIGHT OF    |_|    Parent has for 5 days a right of first refusal, in whole
FIRST REFUSAL/     or in part, to purchase ORA and/or Warrants from the Former
OFFER ON ORA       Target Shareholders at the market price of the Warrants and
AND WARRANTS:      or the ORAs at the time the right  of first refusal is
                   exercised. No right of first refusal shall be available where
                   there is no market for the Securities. If there is no market
                   for these securities, Parent has the right of first offer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIRECT      |_|    If the total number of shares requested to be sold in any
RELEASE OF         one-month period by a Poll represents less than 1.4 million
SECURITIES:        shares of Common Stock (the "Direct Release Threshold"), then
                   the Securities may be sold on the public markets or otherwise
                   without any further restrictions under this Orderly Marketing
                   Agreement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SALE        |_|    In the event the amount of Securities requested to be sold
AMOUNT AND         exceeds the Direct Release Threshold, Lazard and Morgan
METHOD:            Stanley, or such other investment banks as Parent and the
                   Former Target Shareholders may agree, will work together to
                   evaluate the market conditions for the sale of the
                   Securities, and determine the appropriate method for sale and
                   the appropriate amount of Securities to be sold (but the
                   amount to be sold shall not be less than 1.4 million).

            |_|    If the requested amount of Securities to be sold exceeds the
                   actual amount sold (which is never less than 1.4 million
                   shares), the proceeds from the Securities sold will be
                   distributed pro rata amongst the Former Target Shareholders
                   who have requested a sale of their Securities, and the excess
                   amount will be pushed back to the next Poll Date in a
                   priority position for sale at that time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<PAGE>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FINAL       |_|    Six months after the final expiration of its applicable
EXPIRATION:        lock-up period, any unsold Securities will
                   be fully released from this Orderly Marketing Agreement and
                   will be freely transferable whether on the public market or
                   otherwise by the Former Target Shareholders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FEES AND    |_|    All fees and expenses associated with the sale of the
EXPENSES:          Securities will be paid by the Former Target Shareholders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UNDERWRITER |_|    Former Target Shareholders will agree to appoint as
SELECTION:         managing/lead underwriter of any offering such person as is
                   selected by Parent in its sole discretion. The Former Target
                   Shareholders will bear the fees and expenses of such
                   underwriter. The underwriter will act on behalf of the Former
                   Target Shareholders.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DIVIDENDS;  |_|    The Former Target Shareholders shall have the right to
VOTING RIGHTS      receive all dividends and coupon payments on the Securities
                   and to exercise voting rights of the Securities. The lock-up
                   shall not affect those rights.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BLACK-OUT   |_|    In the event of a material corporate event, Parent can
PERIOD:            postpone an underwritten offering for a period of no longer
                   than 60 days, but this Black-out Period shall only apply to
                   the sale of shares in excess of the Direct Release Threshold.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXCLUSIONS: |_|    Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time after the Closing
                   Former Target Shareholders shall be permitted to transfer
                   their Securities (i) by way of gift or other transfer for
                   estate planning purposes; (ii) by way of gift to a charitable
                   organization; (iii) to any other Former Target Shareholders
                   for value or by gift; and (iv) to a bank or financial
                   institution as collateral, by pledge or otherwise; provided
                   that, in the case of clauses (i) through (iv), the transferee
                   agrees in writing to be bound by the terms and conditions of
                   transfer set forth above and agrees explicitly not to enter
                   into hedging transactions with respect to Parent's common
                   stock.
