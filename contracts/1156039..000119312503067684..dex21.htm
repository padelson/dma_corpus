"), among Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation (" _Purchaser_ "), Anthem
Holding Corp., an Indiana corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of
Purchaser (" _Merger Sub_ "), and WellPoint Health Networks Inc., a
Delaware corporation (" _Company_ ").



WITNESSETH: 



WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors (as defined in Section 8.13(d))
of Purchaser and Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of each
corporation and its shareholders and stockholders, respectively, that
Purchaser and Company engage in a business combination in order to advance
the long-term strategic business interests of Purchaser and Company;



WHEREAS, the combination of Purchaser and Company shall be effected by the
terms of this Agreement through a merger as outlined below;



WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the respective Boards of Directors of
Purchaser, Merger Sub and Company have adopted or approved this Agreement,
pursuant to which Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement (the "
_Merger_ "), with each share of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Company ("
_Company Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3) (other than (i) Company Treasury
Shares (as defined in Section 1.8(a)), (ii) shares of Company Common Stock
owned by Purchaser or Merger Sub, (iii) shares of Company Common Stock that
are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") who shall not have
voted in favor of the Merger and who shall have properly demanded in writing
appraisal for such shares (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") pursuant to Section 262
of the Delaware General Corporation Law (" _DGCL_ ") and (iv) Subsidiary Held
Stock (as defined in Section 1.8(d)) being converted into the right to receive
(i) $23.80 cash, without interest, and (ii) one share of common stock, par
value $0.01 per share, of Purchaser (" _Purchaser Common Stock_ ");



WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the Board of Directors of Purchaser has
adopted and approved resolutions to amend the (i) articles of incorporation
of Purchaser and (ii) bylaws of Purchaser, in each case such amendments to be
effective as of the Effective Time;



WHEREAS, for federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the
Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder and that this Agreement shall
constitute a plan of reorganization within the meaning of Sections 354 and 361
of the Code; and



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the parties hereto agree
as follows:  ARTICLE I

THE MERGER



 1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, and in accordance with the DGCL and the Indiana Business
Corporation Law (" _IBCL_ "), Company shall be merged with and into Merger
Sub at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3). Upon consummation of
the Merger, the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease and Merger
Sub shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ").



 1.2. _Closing_. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, the closing of
the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Closing_ ") will take place on the second Business Day (as defined in
Section 8.13(e)) after the satisfaction or waiver (subject to applicable law)
of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than any such conditions
which by their terms cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall
be required to be so satisfied or waived (subject to applicable law) on the
Closing Date), unless another time or date is agreed to in writing by the
parties hereto (the actual time and date of the Closing being referred to
herein as the " _Closing Date_ "). The Closing shall be held at the offices
of Baker and Daniels, 300 North Meridian Street, Suite 2700, Indianapolis,
Indiana, unless another place is agreed to in writing by the parties hereto.



 1.3. _Effective Time_. At the Closing, the parties shall file a certificate
of merger and articles of merger (together, the " _Articles of Merger_ ") in
such form as is required by and executed in accordance with the respective
relevant provisions of the DGCL and the IBCL. The Merger shall become
effective at such time the Articles of Merger are duly filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the Secretary of State of
the State of Indiana, as applicable, or at such subsequent time as Purchaser
and Company shall agree and as shall be specified in each of the Articles of
Merger (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "
_Effective Time_ ").



 1.4. _Effects of the Merger_. At and after the Effective Time, the Merger
will have the effects set forth in the DGCL and the IBCL. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all
the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger
Sub shall be vested in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall be the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



 1.5. _Articles of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time and without any
further action on the part of Company or Merger Sub, the articles of
incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation,
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable law.



 1.6. _Bylaws_. At the Effective Time and without any further action on the
part of Company and Merger Sub, the bylaws of Merger Sub shall be the bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter changed or amended or repealed
as provided therein, in the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or by applicable law.



 

2  1.7. _Directors and Officers of Surviving Corporation_. The directors of
Merger Sub as of the Effective Time shall serve as directors of the Surviving
Corporation until the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or
otherwise ceasing to be a director or until their respective successors are
duly elected or appointed and qualified. The persons designated by the Board
of Directors of Merger Sub prior to the Effective Time shall serve as the
officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their death,
resignation or removal or otherwise ceasing to be an officer or until their
respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified.



 1.8. _Effect on Capital Stock_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock:



(a) All shares of Company Common Stock that are held by Company as treasury
stock (the " _Company Treasury Shares_ ") or by Purchaser or Merger Sub shall
be canceled and shall cease to exist and no cash, Purchaser Common Stock or
other consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 



(b) Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Company Treasury Shares, (ii)
shares of Company Common Stock owned by Purchaser or Merger Sub, (iii)
Dissenting Shares and (iv) Subsidiary Held Stock) shall be converted at
the Effective Time into the right to receive (x) $23.80 in cash, without
interest (the " _Cash Consideration_ "), and (y) one share of Purchaser Common
Stock (the " _Stock Consideration_ " and, together with the
Cash Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "). Upon such conversion,
all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and
shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each Company
Certificate (as defined in Section 1.10) shall thereafter represent the right
to receive the Merger Consideration, cash for fractional shares in accordance
with Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section
2.3 upon the surrender of the Company Certificate in accordance with the
terms hereof. Any Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the payments set forth in Section 1.9.



(c) Each share of common stock, par value $0.01, of Merger Sub outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain outstanding and
unchanged following the Effective Time as shares of the Surviving Corporation.



(d) Each share of Company Common Stock held by a Subsidiary of Company or a
Subsidiary (other than Merger Sub) of Purchaser (" _Subsidiary Held Stock_ ")
shall be converted into the right to receive a number of shares of Purchaser
Common Stock equal to the product of one multiplied by the Option Exchange
Ratio (as defined in Section 1.11) (" _Subsidiary Stock Consideration_ ") and
no Cash Consideration. Upon such conversion, all such shares of Subsidiary
Held Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled
and shall cease to exist, and each certificate which immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented any such shares of Subsidiary Held Stock ("
_Subsidiary Held Certificate_ ") shall thereafter represent the right to
receive the Subsidiary Stock Consideration and cash for fractional shares in
accordance with Section 2.5 upon the surrender of such certificate in
accordance with the terms hereof.



 

3  1.9. _Dissenter s Rights_. No Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to
the Merger Consideration or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock or any dividends or other distributions pursuant to this Article
I unless and until the holder thereof shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost such holders right to appraisal of such
shares of Company Common Stock held by such holder under Section 262 of the
DGCL, and any Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the
payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to shares of Company
Common Stock owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. If any Person (as defined
in Section 8.13(l)) who otherwise would be deemed a Dissenting Stockholder
shall have failed to properly perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost the right to dissent with respect to any shares of Company Common Stock,
such shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be treated as though such
shares of Company Common Stock had been converted into the right to receive
the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.8 hereof. Company shall give
Purchaser (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, attempted
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to
applicable law received by Company relating to stockholders rights of
appraisal and (ii) the opportunity to participate in and direct
all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demands for
appraisal under the DGCL. Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld),
voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisals of
Dissenting Shares, offer to settle or settle any such demands or approve any
withdrawal of any such demands.



 1.10. _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall appoint
EquiServe Trust Company, N.A., or another bank or trust company reasonably
satisfactory to Company, as exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging certificates which immediately prior to the Effective
Time evidenced shares of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ")
for the Merger Consideration. 



 1.11. _Company Stock Options and Other Stock Awards_.



(a) Purchaser and Company shall take all action reasonably necessary so that
each employee or director stock option exercisable for shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Company Stock Options_ ") outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time
into an option to purchase a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock (a "
_Converted Option_ ") equal to the product of the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option multiplied by the Option
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that any fractional share resulting from
such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. The "
_Option Exchange Ratio_ " shall mean the sum of (i) one plus (ii) a fraction
the numerator of which is 23.80 and the denominator of which is the closing
trading price of Purchaser Common Stock on the New York Stock Exchange Inc.
(" _NYSE_ "), as reported in the Wall Street Journal, Eastern Edition (or such
other source as the parties shall agree in writing), on the Business Day prior
to the Effective Time. The terms and conditions of the Converted Options
shall otherwise remain the same as the terms and conditions of the Company
Stock Options (including the existing "option reload" feature), except that
the exercise price per share of each Converted Option shall equal the
exercise price per share of such Company Stock Option divided by the Option
Exchange Ratio; _provided_ that such exercise price shall be rounded to the
nearest whole cent. Notwithstanding the



 

4 foregoing, each Company Stock Option which is intended to be an "incentive
stock option" (as defined under Section 422 of the Code) shall be adjusted in
accordance with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code.



(b) All shares of restricted Company Common Stock (the " _Company Restricted
Stock Awards_ ") held by employees or directors of the Company or its
Subsidiaries and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
treated in the same manner as all other shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time pursuant to Section 1.8
of this Agreement (the " _Converted Restricted Stock Awards_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Merger Consideration received by each holder in exchange
for the holders Company Restricted Stock Awards pursuant to Section 1.8 of
this Agreement shall be subject to the terms and conditions (including vesting
schedules) applicable to such Company Restricted Stock Awards under the plan
and award agreements pursuant to which such Company Restricted Stock Awards
were granted as in effect prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _further_
, _however_ , that the per-share Cash Consideration portion of such Merger
Consideration shall be held by the Surviving Corporation in accounts for such
persons until vested, and invested as directed by the employee or director
among the investment options available from time to time under the WellPoint
Comprehensive Executive Non-Qualified Retirement Plan or WellPoint Board of
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan, as applicable.



For purposes hereof, the Company Restricted Stock Awards, together with all
other awards of shares of Company Common Stock subject to vesting or future
issuance under any Company Stock Plan, including without limitation restricted
stock units and deferred stock awards (but not including Company Stock
Options or the Company ESPP), shall be referred to as the " _Other Stock
Awards_."



(c) Purchaser and Company shall take all action reasonably necessary so that
all Other Stock Awards other than Company Restricted Stock Awards held by
employees or directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be converted automatically at the Effective Time into
a right or award with respect to a number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock
(a " _Converted Other Stock Award_ ") equal to the product of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Other Stock Award multiplied by
the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_ , that any fractional shares resulting
from such multiplication shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. The
terms and conditions of the Converted Other Stock Award shall otherwise remain
the same as the terms and conditions (including vesting schedules) applicable
to the Other Stock Awards under the plan and award agreements pursuant to
which such Other Stock Awards were granted as in effect immediately prior to
the Effective Time.



(d) Purchaser shall, as of the Effective Time, assume the obligations of
Company under all plans and agreements pursuant to which a Company Stock
Option or Other Stock Award has been issued (the " _Company Stock Plans_ ")
and shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for issuance a
sufficient number of shares of Purchaser Common Stock for delivery upon
exercise of the Converted Options or future issuance under the Converted Other
Stock Awards. Purchaser shall use its reasonable



 

5 best efforts to cause the registration of the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
subject to the Converted Options, Converted Other Stock Awards or Converted
Restricted Stock Awards to become effective as part of a registration
statement on Form S-8 or Form S-3 as the case may be, or any successor or
other appropriate forms, with respect to the shares of Purchaser Common Stock
subject to the Converted Options, Converted Other Stock Awards or Converted
Restricted Stock Awards no later than the Effective Time; and, thereafter,
Purchaser shall deliver to holders of Converted Options, Converted
Other Stock Awards or Converted Restricted Stock Awards any applicable
prospectus and shall maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
or registration statements, including the current status of any related
prospectus, for so long as the Converted Options, Converted Other Stock
Awards or Converted Restricted Stock Awards remain outstanding.



(e) Purchaser and Company shall take all such steps within their control as
may be required to cause the transactions contemplated by this Section 1.11
and any other deemed dispositions of Company equity securities (including
derivative securities) or deemed acquisitions of Purchaser equity securities
(including derivative securities) in connection with this Agreement by
each individual who (i) is a director or officer of Company or (ii) at the
Effective Time will become a director or officer of Purchaser, to become
exempt from liability under Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (as amended and including all rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the " _Exchange Act_ ") pursuant to Rule 16b-3 thereunder.



(f) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall deliver
or cause to be delivered to each holder of Converted Options, Converted Other
Stock Awards or Converted Restricted Stock Awards an appropriate notice
setting forth such holders rights pursuant to any Company Stock Plans, after
giving effect to the transactions hereunder.



 1.12. _Certain Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the
Effective Time, the outstanding Purchaser Common Stock or Company Common Stock
shall have been changed into a different number of shares or different class
by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock split, split-up,
combination or exchange of shares or a stock dividend or dividend payable in
any other securities shall be declared with a record date within such period,
or any similar event shall have occurred, the Merger Consideration,
Subsidiary Stock Consideration and the Option Exchange Ratio shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Company Common Stock,
Company Stock Options and Other Stock Awards the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

or a Former Company Director or a director otherwise elected or nominated to
Purchasers Board of Directors by the Former Company Directors as set forth

be able to serve or not stand or be standing for reelection (for whatever

of the Board of Directors of Purchaser and any executive committee of the

Purchaser, of the executive committee of the Board of Directors of Purchaser,
of any other committees of the Board of Directors of Purchaser and as a
director of the Foundation (as defined in Section 5.17) and any other
foundations controlled, directly or indirectly, by Purchaser at the end of the
Chairmanship Period. Upon the earlier of (A) Leonard D. Schaeffers
resignation, retirement, removal or inability to serve as non-executive
Chairman of the Board of Purchaser or as a member of the Board of Directors of
Purchaser and (B) the end of the Chairmanship Period, unless the Purchaser
Board of Directors decides otherwise by an affirmative vote of not less than

Purchaser shall be appointed Chairman of the Board of Purchaser by
the Purchaser Board of Directors.



(b)  _Officers_. Larry C. Glasscock shall be President and Chief Executive

(i) _Medicare Part A Claims Processing_. From and after the Effective Time,
the national headquarters for the Medicare Part A claims processing business

provision).

the symbol under which the Purchaser Common Stock is listed on the NYSE to
change to WLP on the Business Day following the Effective Time.

 1.14. _Alternative Structure_. With the consent of Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld), in lieu of Company being merged with and
into Merger Sub as contemplated by Section 1.1 hereof, Purchaser shall have
the right to elect by written notice given to Company, and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, to cause the "Merger"
to be a merger of Company with and into an Indiana single member
limited liability company directly and wholly owned by Purchaser and
disregarded as a separate entity for federal tax purposes, at the Effective
Time, in which case, such limited liability



 

9 company shall be the "Merger Sub" for purposes of this Agreement and following
the "Merger", the separate corporate existence of Company shall cease and the
Merger Sub shall continue as the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ that (i)
such change shall not materially delay the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby in any respect and (ii) such change shall
not affect the Merger Consideration to be received by the stockholders of

stockholders or, with respect to Section 5.7, materially prejudice any third
party beneficiary thereof or in any other way affect the corporate governance

 ARTICLE II

EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES



 2.1. _Exchange Fund_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Purchaser shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, (i) certificates representing the Purchaser Common
Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.8 (or otherwise shall make shares of
Purchaser Common Stock available for such issuance) and (ii) cash sufficient
to pay the aggregate Cash Consideration to be paid in the Merger, cash
for fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.5 and any dividends or
other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Purchaser shall make available to
the Exchange Agent, from time to time as needed, additional cash sufficient to
pay cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.5 and any
dividends and other distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. Any cash and
certificates of Purchaser Common Stock deposited with the Exchange Agent (or
shares of Purchaser Common Stock otherwise made available to the Exchange
Agent pursuant to this Section 2.1) shall hereinafter be referred to as the "
_Exchange Fund_."



 2.2. _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly, but in any event within ten Business
Days after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall cause the Exchange Agent to
mail to each holder of record of a Company Certificate (i) a letter of
transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of
loss and title to the Company Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Company Certificates to the Exchange Agent, and which letter shall be in
customary form and (ii) instructions for effecting the surrender of such
Company Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Company Certificate to the Exchange Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Company Certificate shall be entitled to
receive in exchange therefor (A) the number of shares of Purchaser Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.8 (which
shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a physical certificate is
requested) and (B) a check in the amount of the aggregate Cash
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
1.8 and for the cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of this Article II, including cash in lieu of any fractional shares
of Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and dividends and other
distributions pursuant to Section 2.3. No interest will be paid or will accrue
on the Cash



 

10 Consideration or on any cash payable pursuant to Section 2.3 or Section 2.5.
In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not
registered in the transfer records of Company, the proper number of shares of
Purchaser Common Stock (which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form
unless a physical certificate is requested) and a check in the amount of the
aggregate Cash Consideration that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to Section 1.8, the cash in lieu of any fractional shares of
Purchaser Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or other
distributions to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.3, may
be issued and paid with respect to such Company Common Stock to such a
transferee if the Company Certificate representing such shares of Company
Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any
applicable stock transfer taxes have been paid.



2.3. _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions declared or made with respect to shares of Purchaser Common
Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Company Certificate with respect to the shares of
Purchaser Common Stock that such holder would be entitled to receive upon
surrender of such Company Certificate until such holder shall surrender such
Company Certificate in accordance with Section 2.2. Subject to the effect of
applicable laws, following surrender of any such Company Certificate, there
shall be paid to such holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock issuable in
exchange therefor, without interest, (a) promptly after the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date prior
to such surrender payable with respect to such shares of Purchaser Common
Stock and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time but prior
to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such surrender payable
with respect to such shares of Purchaser Common Stock.



2.4. _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock or Subsidiary Held
Stock_. All shares of Purchaser Common Stock issued and cash paid
upon conversion of shares of Company Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock in
accordance with the terms of Article I and this Article II (including any cash
paid pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.5) shall be deemed to have been issued or
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company
Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock. Until surrendered as contemplated by
this Article II, each Company Certificate or Subsidiary Held Certificate shall
be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration or the Subsidiary Stock
Consideration (and any cash to be paid pursuant to Section 2.3 or 2.5), or the
right to the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL pursuant to Section
1.9, as applicable.



2.5. _No Fractional Shares of Purchaser Common Stock_.



(a) No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Purchaser
Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued upon the
surrender for exchange of Company Certificates and such fractional share
interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to have any rights of
a shareholder of Purchaser or a holder of shares of Purchaser Common Stock.



 

11 (b) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock or Subsidiary Held Stock exchanged pursuant to
the Merger who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a
share of Purchaser Common Stock (after taking into account all Company
Certificates and Subsidiary Held Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the
product of (i) such fractional part of a share of Purchaser Common Stock
multiplied by (ii) the closing price for a share of Purchaser Common Stock on
the NYSE Composite Transactions Tape on the date of the Effective Time or, if
such date is not a Business Day, the Business Day immediately before the date
on which the Effective Time occurs. As promptly as practicable after the
determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders of
fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Purchaser, and
Purchaser shall cause the Surviving Corporation to deposit such amount with
the Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to
such holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the
terms hereof.



 2.6. _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Certificates twelve months
after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Purchaser or otherwise on the
instruction of Purchaser and any holders of the Company Certificates who have
not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to
the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser for the Merger Consideration
with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented
thereby to which such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 1.8 and Section
2.2, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which
such holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or
distributions with respect to shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.



 2.7. _No Liability_. None of Purchaser, Merger Sub, Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of
any Merger Consideration from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public
official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
law.



 2.8. _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Purchaser on a daily basis,
or as otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and the Exchange Agent. Any interest
and other income resulting from such investments shall promptly be paid to
Purchaser, or as otherwise agreed to by Purchaser and the Exchange Agent.



 2.9. _Lost Certificates_. If any Company Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Company Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond
in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Company Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Purchaser



 

12 Common Stock, and unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Purchaser
Common Stock deliverable in respect thereof, in each case, pursuant to this
Agreement.



 2.10. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Purchaser
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common
Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and Treasury
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Corporation or Purchaser, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or Purchaser, as the case
may be, and such amounts shall be delivered by the Surviving Corporation or
Purchaser, as the case may be, to the applicable taxing authority.



 2.11. _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers
and managers of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and
deliver, in the name and on behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect
or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all
right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or
assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of,
or in connection with, the Merger.



 2.12. _Stock Transfer Books_. The stock transfer books of Company shall be
closed immediately upon the Effective Time and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock thereafter on the
records of Company. On or after the Effective Time, any Company Certificate
presented to the Exchange Agent or Purchaser for any reason shall be converted
into the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented thereby, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Purchaser Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled
pursuant to Section 2.5 and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to Section 2.3.



 ARTICLE III

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES



 3.1. _Representations and Warranties of Purchaser_. Purchaser represents and
warrants to Company as follows:



(a) _Organization, Standing and Power; Subsidiaries_.



(i) Each of Purchaser and each of its Subsidiaries (as defined in Section
8.13(n)) is a corporation or other Person duly organized, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of its respective jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization, has the requisite power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as now being
conducted, except where the failure to be so organized, existing and in good
standing or to have such power and authority would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the



 

13 aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.13(i)) on
Purchaser, and is duly qualified and in good standing to do business in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of its business or the ownership or leasing
of its properties makes such qualification necessary, other than in such
jurisdictions where the failure so to qualify or to be in good standing would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. The copies of the articles of
incorporation and bylaws of Purchaser and its material Subsidiaries which
were previously furnished or made available to Company are true, complete and
correct copies of such documents as in effect on the date of this Agreement.



(ii) Except as set forth in Section 3.1(a) of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule delivered by Purchaser to Company prior to the execution of this
Agreement (each section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered
representation and warranty or covenant to the extent specified therein and
any other representation and warranty to which its relevance is reasonably
apparent) (the " _Purchaser Disclosure Schedule_ "), all the outstanding
shares of capital stock of, or other equity interests in, each of its
Subsidiaries have been validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable and
are owned directly or indirectly by Purchaser, free and clear of all Liens
and free of any other restriction (including any restriction on the right to
vote, sell or otherwise dispose of such capital stock or other ownership
interests). Except as explicitly set forth in the Purchaser SEC Reports (as
defined in Section 3.1(d)(i)) or in Section 3.1(a) of the Purchaser Disclosure
Schedule, neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries directly or indirectly
owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into or
exchangeable or exercisable for, any corporation, partnership, joint venture
or other business association or entity, that is or would reasonably be
expected to be material to Purchaser and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.



(b) _Capital Structure_. 



(i) The authorized capital stock of Purchaser consists of (i) 900,000,000
shares of Purchaser Common Stock, of which 138,212,614 shares were outstanding
as of October 20, 2003 and (ii) 100,000,000 shares of Preferred Stock, without
par value, none of which are outstanding. Except for Purchaser Common Stock
issued upon exercise of Purchaser Stock Options, no shares of Purchaser Common
Stock have been issued between October 20, 2003 and the date hereof. All
issued and outstanding shares of the capital stock of Purchaser are duly

procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the

the statutorily required reserves or reserves above those reflected in the
most recent balance sheet (other than increases consistent with past
experience resulting from increases in enrollment with respect to services
provided by Purchaser or its Subsidiaries). The risk-based capital of each

the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and any related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC and the NYSE, and the statements contained in any such certifications
are complete and correct.



(ii) Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and procedures
(as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act); such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
material information relating to Company required to be disclosed in Companys
Exchange Act Reports, including its consolidated Subsidiaries, is made known
to Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial officer
by others within those entities, particularly during the periods in which the
periodic reports required under the Exchange Act are being prepared; and, to

timely alerting Companys principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer to material information required to be included in
Companys periodic reports required under the Exchange Act.



(iii) Company is, or will timely be, in compliance, in all material respects,
with all current and proposed listing and corporate governance requirements of

insurance company or health maintenance organization or similar entity (the "
_Company State Agencies_ ") for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and

Company or such Subsidiaries, as applicable, as of the date and for the
periods indicated therein and have been prepared, or will be prepared, in all
material respects, in accordance with applicable statutory
accounting principles consistently applied throughout the periods indicated,
except as may be reflected therein or in the notes thereto, or the statutory

in enrollment with respect to services provided by Company or its
Subsidiaries). The risk-based capital of each insurance and health
maintenance organization Subsidiary of Company is now, and immediately prior

 ARTICLE V

ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS



 5.1. _Preparation of Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement; Stockholders/
Shareholders Meetings_.



(a) Promptly following the date of this Agreement, Purchaser and Company shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Joint Proxy Statement, and Purchaser shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Form S-4, in which the Joint Proxy Statement
will be included as a prospectus. Each of Purchaser and Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective under the
Securities Act as promptly as practicable after such filing. Each of Purchaser
and Company will use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Joint Proxy
Statement to be mailed to its shareholders and stockholders, respectively, as
promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act. Purchaser shall also take any action (other than qualifying to
do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not now so qualified) required
to be taken under any applicable state securities law in connection with the
Share Issuance, and Company shall furnish all information concerning Company
and the holders of Company Common Stock and rights to acquire Company Common
Stock pursuant to the Company Stock Plans as may be reasonably required in
connection with any such action. Each of Purchaser and Company shall furnish
all information concerning itself and its Subsidiaries to the other as may be
reasonably requested in connection with any such action and the preparation,
filing and distribution of the Form S-4 and the preparation, filing and
distribution of the Joint Proxy Statement. Purchaser and Company each agrees,
as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or
to be supplied by it or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the Form S-4 will, at the time the Form S-4 becomes effective
under the Securities Act, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement and any
amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date of mailing to shareholders
or stockholders, as applicable, and at the times of the meetings of
shareholders or stockholders of Purchaser and Company, as applicable, to be
held in connection with the Share Issuance and Articles Amendment or the
Merger, as applicable, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading. Each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and Company agrees
to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Form S-4 or
the Joint Proxy Statement that shall have become false or misleading.
Purchaser and Company will cause the Form S-4 and the Joint Proxy Statement
to comply as to form in all material respects with the applicable provisions
of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.



 

59 (b) Company, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, subject to and in
accordance with its certificate of incorporation and bylaws, promptly and
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable following
the date upon which the Form S-4 becomes effective a meeting of the holders of
Company Common Stock (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") for the purpose
of voting to adopt this Agreement, and except as otherwise provided in the
following sentence, (i) shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the
stockholders of Company (the " _Company Recommendation_ ") and include in the
Joint Proxy Statement such Company Recommendation, (ii) shall use its
reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain such adoption and (iii) shall
not withdraw, amend or modify (or publicly propose to or publicly state that
it intends to withdraw, amend or modify) in any manner adverse to Purchaser
such recommendation (collectively, a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ ").
In the event that prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company
stockholders, the Board of Directors of Company determines in good faith by
resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside counsel that such
action is reasonably likely to be required in order for the directors to
comply with their respective fiduciary duties under Delaware law, the Board of
Directors of Company may effect a Change in Company Recommendation; _provided_
, _however_ , that if the Change in Company Recommendation is in respect of
an Alternative Transaction, the Board of Directors of Company may effect a
Change in Company Recommendation only if Company shall have complied in all
material respects with the applicable provisions of Section 5.5 with respect
thereto and if the Board of Directors of Company has determined in good faith
that such Alternative Transaction is a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,
_further_ , _however_ , that before effecting a Change in Company
Recommendation, it gives Purchaser five business days prior written notice
of its intention to do so (unless at the time such notice is otherwise
required to be given there are less than five business days prior to the
Company Stockholders Meeting, in which case Company shall provide as much
notice as is reasonably practicable) and during such time, Company, if
requested by Purchaser, shall have engaged in good faith negotiations to amend
this Agreement (including by making its officers and its financial and legal
advisors reasonably available to negotiate) such that the Board of Directors
of Company may continue to recommend the adoption of this Agreement. The
parties agree that nothing in this Section 5.1(b) shall in any way limit or
otherwise affect Purchasers right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(c) at such time as the requirements of such subsection have been
met. Any such Change in Company Recommendation shall not (x) change the
approval of this Agreement or any other approval of the Board of Directors of
Company in any respect that would have the effect of causing any state
(including Delaware) corporate takeover statute or other similar statute to be
applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, or
(y) change the obligation of Company to present this Agreement for adoption at
the Company Stockholders Meeting on the earliest practicable date after the
Form S-4 becomes effective. Notwithstanding any Change in
Company Recommendation, if this Agreement is not otherwise terminated by
either Company or Purchaser in accordance with the terms hereof, this
Agreement shall be submitted to the stockholders of Company at the Company
Stockholders Meeting for the purpose of voting on adopting this Agreement,
and nothing contained herein, including any rights of Company to take certain
actions pursuant to Section 5.5, shall be deemed to relieve Company of such
obligation. Nothing



 

60 contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Company from taking and disclosing
to its stockholders a position contemplated by complying with Rule 14a-9,
Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making
disclosure of the fact that a proposal for an Alternative Transaction (as
defined in Section 8.13(a)) has been made, the identity of the party making
the proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Form S-4 or the
Joint Proxy Statement, to the extent disclosure of such facts, identity or
terms is advisable under applicable law (and the disclosure of such facts, by
itself, shall not be deemed a Change in Company Recommendation or a withdrawal
or adverse modification or amendment of its approval of this Agreement).



(c) Purchaser, acting through its Board of Directors, shall, subject to and in
accordance with its articles of incorporation and bylaws, promptly and duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold as soon as practicable following the
date on which the Form S-4 becomes effective, a meeting of the holders of
Purchaser Common Stock (the " _Purchaser Shareholders Meeting_ ") for the
purpose of voting to approve the Share Issuance and the Articles Amendment.
Purchaser shall recommend such approval to its shareholders (the " _Purchaser
Recommendation_ ") and use its reasonable best efforts to solicit and obtain
such approval. The Board of Directors of Purchaser shall not withhold,
withdraw, amend or modify in any manner adverse to Company its recommendation
referred to in the preceding sentence (or announce publicly its intention to
do so). Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit Purchaser from
making any factual disclosure regarding this Agreement, the parties hereto, or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby, if such disclosure is advisable
under applicable law (and the disclosure of such information, by itself,
shall not be deemed a withholding, withdrawal or adverse modification or
amendment of its approval or recommendation to its shareholders of the Share
Issuance and the Articles Amendment).



(d) During the term of this Agreement, Company shall not take any actions to
exempt any Person other than Purchaser and Merger Sub from the threshold
restrictions on Company Common Stock ownership or any other antitakeover
provision in Companys certificate of incorporation, or make any state
takeover statute (including any Delaware state takeover statute) or similar
statute inapplicable to any Alternative Transaction.



(e) During the term of this Agreement, Purchaser shall not take any actions to
exempt any Person from the threshold restrictions on Purchaser Common Stock
ownership or any other antitakeover provision in Purchasers articles of
incorporation, or make any state takeover statute (including any Indiana state
takeover statute) or similar statute inapplicable to any Alternative
Transaction.



(f) Purchaser and Company shall endeavor to hold the Purchaser Shareholders
Meeting and the Company Stockholders Meeting as closely together in time as
practicable and, to the extent possible, on the same date.



 

61 5.2. _ Accountants Letters_.



(a) Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered
to Company a letter from Purchasers independent public accountants, dated (i)
the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective, and (ii) the Closing
Date, in each case addressed to Company and its Board of Directors, in form
and substance customary for comfort letters delivered by independent public
accountants in connection with registration statements similar to the
Form S-4.



(b) Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause to be delivered to
Purchaser a letter from Companys independent public accountants, dated (i)
the date on which the Form S-4 shall become effective, and (ii) the Closing
Date, in each case addressed to Purchaser and its Board of Directors, in form

S-4.



5.3. _ Access to Information_. Upon reasonable notice, each party shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford to the officers, employees,
accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other representatives of
the other party reasonable access during normal business hours, during the
period prior to the Effective Time, to such of its properties, books,
contracts, commitments, records, officers and employees as the other party may
reasonably request and, during such period, such party shall (and shall cause
its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other party (a) a copy of each
report, schedule, registration statement and other document filed, published,
announced or received by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of Federal or state securities laws, as applicable (other than documents which
such party is not permitted to disclose under applicable law), and (b)
consistent with its legal obligations, all other information concerning it
and its business, properties and personnel as such other party may reasonably
request; _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may restrict the foregoing
access to the extent that any law, treaty, rule or regulation of
any Governmental Entity applicable to such party requires such party or its
Subsidiaries to restrict access to any properties or information. The parties
will hold any such information that is non-public in confidence to the extent
required by, and in accordance with, the provisions of the Confidentiality
Agreement, dated October 8, 2003, between Purchaser and Company (the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or
in the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary, any party to this Agreement
(and any employee, representative, or other agent of any party to this
Agreement) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any
kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or other tax
analyses) that are provided to it relating to such tax treatment and tax
structure; _provided_ , _however_ , that the preceding sentence shall not
permit any party (or any employee, representative or other agent thereof) to
disclose any information (i) that is not relevant to an understanding of the
U.S. federal income tax treatment of any transaction contemplated by
this Agreement, including the identity of Purchaser or Company (or their
employees, representatives or agents) or other information that could lead any
person to determine such identity or (ii) to the extent required to be kept
confidential to comply with any applicable federal or state securities laws.
Any investigation by Purchaser or Company shall not affect the representations
and warranties of Company or Purchaser, respectively.



 

62 5.4. _ Reasonable Best Efforts_.



(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each party will use
its reasonable best efforts to prepare and file as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary applications, notices, petitions,
filings, tax ruling requests and other documents and to obtain as promptly as
practicable all consents, waivers, licenses, orders, registrations, approvals,
permits, tax rulings and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained
from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Upon the
terms and subject to the conditions hereof, each party will use its reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, to do, or cause to
be done, all things reasonably necessary to satisfy the conditions to Closing
set forth herein and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Company and Purchaser shall provide the other
party with the opportunity to participate in any meeting or substantive
telephone call with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigations or other inquiry in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby.



(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, each party hereto
agrees to make an appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form
pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby
as promptly as practicable after the date hereof and to supply as promptly as
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of Purchaser and Company shall
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing or
submission and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry under the
HSR Act.



(c) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, the parties agree
that Purchaser and Company shall each make as promptly as practicable such
filings as are required in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby. Purchaser and Company agree that Purchaser shall make the
"Form A" and other regulatory filings to be made with the domiciliary
insurance regulator of each Subsidiary of Company that is an insurance company
or health maintenance organization, the substance of which shall be reasonably
agreed between Purchaser and Company and shall, in consultation with
Company, coordinate the conduct of any hearing or hearings required in
connection with such filings. Purchaser and Company shall, as promptly as
practicable after receipt thereof, provide each other with copies of any
written comments and advise the other party of any oral comments with respect
to the Form A or other regulatory filing from each applicable Governmental
Entity. Purchaser and Company shall have the right to participate in any
meetings or telephone conferences in which the substance of the Form A and
other regulatory filings is discussed. Purchaser and Company will reasonably
cooperate with regard to all other regulatory notice filings or approval
requests necessary or desirable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to applicable law relating to the
sharing of information, Purchaser and Company, as the case may be, shall
submit all such filings, requests and hearing testimony, witness lists and
other similar materials relating to any hearing to the other for its review
prior to filing the substance of each of the foregoing shall be reasonably
agreed between Purchaser and Company.



 

63 (d) Nothing contained in this Section 5.4 shall be construed as requiring
Purchaser or Company to agree to any terms or conditions that would impose
(i) any limitations on Purchasers or Companys ownership or operation of all
or any portion of their respective, or any of their respective Subsidiaries,
businesses or assets, or to compel Purchaser or Company to dispose of or hold
separate all or any portion of their respective, or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, businesses or assets, (ii) any limitations on the ability of
Purchaser to acquire or hold or to exercise full rights of ownership of the
Company Common Stock, (iii) any obligations on Purchaser or any of its
Subsidiaries or Company or any of its Subsidiaries to maintain facilities,
operations, places of business, employment levels, products or businesses or
(iv) any other obligation, restriction, limitation, qualification or other
conditions, which, in the case of any such term or condition described in
clauses (i) through (iv) above, would be, individually or in the
aggregate with all other such terms and conditions, (A) reasonably likely to
have a material and adverse effect on Purchaser and its Subsidiaries, taken as
a whole, (B) reasonably likely to have a material and adverse effect on
Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) reasonably likely to
(1) have a material and adverse effect on the expected pro forma financial
statements of Purchaser following consummation of the Merger as agreed by
Purchaser and Company prior to the date hereof and (2) be materially
different in character, degree or scope from terms or conditions generally
imposed in connection with such consents, waivers, licenses, orders,
registrations, approvals, permits, tax rulings or authorizations (a "
_Burdensome Term or Condition_ "). Neither Purchaser nor Company shall agree
to any terms or conditions described in clauses (i) through (iv) above without
the prior written consent of the other party.



 5.5. _No Solicitation of Transactions_. Each of Purchaser and Company agrees
that, during the term of this Agreement, it shall not, and shall cause its
respective Subsidiaries and its and its respective Subsidiaries directors,
officers, employees, agents and representatives (including any investment
banker, attorney or accountant retained by it or any of its respective
Subsidiaries) not to, directly or indirectly, solicit, initiate, encourage or
facilitate, or furnish or disclose non-public information in furtherance of,
any inquiries or the making of any proposal with respect to any Alternative
Transaction, or negotiate, explore or otherwise engage in discussions with any
Person (other than Purchaser, Merger Sub, Company or their respective
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives) with respect to
any Alternative Transaction, or approve, endorse, recommend or authorize any
Alternative Transaction, or enter into any agreement, arrangement or
understanding with respect to any Alternative Transaction or requiring it to
abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ that, at any time prior to the
adoption of this Agreement by Companys stockholders, Company may furnish
information to, and negotiate or otherwise engage in discussions with, any
party who delivers a bona fide written proposal for an
Alternative Transaction which was not solicited or encouraged after the date
of this Agreement, if and so long as the Board of Directors of Company
determines in good faith by resolution duly adopted after consultation with
its outside legal counsel that providing such information or engaging in such
negotiations or discussions is reasonably likely to be required in order for
the directors to comply with their respective fiduciary duties under Delaware
law and determines in good faith that such a proposal is, or is reasonably
likely to lead to, a Superior Proposal. Company shall notify Purchaser
promptly (but in any event within 24 hours) of such inquiries,  



 

64 proposals or offers received by, or any such discussions or negotiations
sought to be initiated or continued with, any of its representatives,
indicating the name of such Person and providing to Purchaser a summary of the
material terms of such proposal or offer for an Alternative Transaction. Prior
to providing any information or data to, or entering into any negotiations or
discussions with, any Person, or making any such recommendation, in connection
with a proposal or offer for an Alternative Transaction, Company shall receive
from such Person an executed confidentiality agreement containing terms
and provisions at least as restrictive as those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement (which shall not preclude discussions or
negotiations relating to the proposal or offer from such Person and which
shall not contain any exclusivity provision or other term that would
restrict, in any manner, Companys ability to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement). Company agrees that it will keep Purchaser
informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material terms of any such
proposals or offers and the status of any material developments in respect of
any such discussions or negotiations and that it will deliver to Purchaser a
summary of any material changes to any such proposals or offers and all
nonpublic information being furnished to such Person. Purchaser agrees that
it will keep Company informed, on a prompt basis, of the status and material
terms of any proposals or offers for an Alternative Transaction in respect of
Purchaser and that it will deliver to Company a summary of any material
changes to any such proposals or offers. Company and Purchaser each agree that
it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing activities,
discussions or negotiations with any Third Parties conducted prior to the
date of this Agreement with respect to any Alternative Transaction and will
not terminate, amend, modify or waive any provision of any confidentiality or
standstill agreement to which it is a party and shall enforce, to the fullest
extent permitted under applicable law, the provisions of any such agreement,
including, but not limited to, by obtaining injunctions to prevent any
breaches of such agreements and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions thereof in any court having jurisdiction. It is understood that
participation by Company or its directors, officers, employees, advisors or
other representatives in discussions or negotiations in compliance with the
provisions of this Section 5.5 shall not be deemed "solicitations" for
purposes of this Section and an Alternative Transaction proposal if initially
unsolicited in compliance with this Section 5.5 shall continue to be deemed an
unsolicited Alternative Transaction proposal notwithstanding changes in such
Alternative Transaction proposal as a result of such discussions or
negotiations.



 5.6. _Employee Benefits Matters_.



(a) _Continuation of Benefits_. From the Effective Time until December 31,
2005, the Surviving Corporation shall provide compensation and benefits to the
current and former employees of Company and its Subsidiaries (other than

are subject to a collective bargaining agreement) that are in the aggregate no
less favorable than those provided to the current and former employees of
Company and its Subsidiaries as of the Effective Time, subject to any changes
made following the Effective Time in order to integrate Cobalt employees into
the Company Plans.



(b) _Pre-Existing Limitations; Service Credit_. With respect to any Benefit
Plans in which any employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries first become
eligible to participate, on or after the Effective Time (the " _New Company
Plans_ "), Purchaser shall: (A) waive all pre-existing conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to  



 

65 participation and coverage requirements applicable to employees of the Company
or its Subsidiaries under any health and welfare New Company Plans in which
such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, and
deductibles, coinsurance or maximum out-of-pocket payments made by such
employees during the applicable plan year in which such employee first
participates in the applicable New Company Plan occurs shall reduce the amount
of deductibles, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket payments under the New
Company Plans; _provided_ that, for purposes of deductibles, coinsurance and
out-of-pocket payments, such employee was enrolled under the Benefit Plans of
Company immediately prior to the effective time of coverage in the New Company
Plans, and (B) recognize service of present or former employees of Company or
its Subsidiaries (or otherwise credited by Company or its Subsidiaries)
accrued prior to the Effective Time for purposes of eligibility to participate
and vesting credit (and levels of benefits) in any New Company Plan in which
such employees may be eligible to participate after the Effective Time, to
the extent such service would have been taken into account under the
applicable Company Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event
shall any credit be given to the extent it would result in the duplication of
benefits for the same period of service.



(c) _Company Plans_. From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser shall and
shall cause its affiliates (including its Subsidiaries and the Surviving
Corporation) to honor all Company Plans in accordance with their terms as in
effect immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or
termination thereof that may be permitted by such terms.



(d) _Employee Stock Purchase Plan_. Company shall take all action to the
extent necessary (including amending the Company ESPP) such that the Company
ESPP will terminate immediately prior to the Effective Time and all
participants will automatically exercise their purchase rights immediately
prior to the termination of the plan. Purchaser shall take all action to the
extent necessary (including amending the Purchaser ESPP) such that the
employees of Company or its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time who
become employees of Purchaser or one of its Subsidiaries after the Effective
Time shall be eligible to participate in the Purchaser ESPP no later than the
beginning of the second quarterly cycle which begins after the Effective Time.



(e) _Annual Bonuses for Fiscal Year in which Effective Time Occurs_. On or
prior to the Effective Time, Company shall use reasonable best efforts to
clarify certain of the Company Benefit Plans in the manner described in
Section 5.6(e) of the Company Disclosure Schedule.

(a) For six years after the Effective Time Purchaser shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, (i) indemnify and hold harmless the present and
former directors, officers and employees of Company and its Subsidiaries (the
" _Indemnified Persons_ ") for any costs and expenses, judgments, fines,
losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative, by reason of the fact that such Indemnified



 

66 Person was an officer, director or employee of Company or its Subsidiaries in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including those related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby), and shall advance expenses in respect thereof, in each case to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law and (ii) purchase as of the
Effective Time a tail policy to the current policy of directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by Company
which tail policy shall be effective for a period from the Effective Time
through and including the date six years after the Closing Date with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, and which tail policy shall contain substantially the same
coverage and amounts as, and contain terms and conditions no less
advantageous than, in the aggregate, the coverage currently provided by such
current policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall Purchaser be
required to expend, for the entire tail policy, in excess of 900% of the
annual premium currently paid by Company for its current policy of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance as set
forth on Section 5.7(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule; and, _provided_ ,
_further_ that, if the premium of such insurance coverage exceeds such amount,
Purchaser after consultation with Company shall be obligated to obtain a
policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such
amount.



(b) Any Indemnified Person wishing to claim indemnification under paragraph
(a) of this Section 5.7, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Purchaser and the Surviving
Corporation thereof, but the failure to so notify shall not relieve the
Surviving Corporation of any liability it may have to such Indemnified Person
if such failure does not materially prejudice the indemnifying party. In the
event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether
arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Purchaser or the Surviving
Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and neither
Purchaser nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to such Indemnified
Persons for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expense
subsequently incurred by such Indemnified Persons in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Purchaser or the Surviving Corporation elects
not to assume such defense or counsel or the Indemnified Persons advise that
there are issues which raise conflicts of interest between Purchaser or the
Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Persons, the Indemnified Persons may
retain counsel satisfactory to them, and Purchaser shall and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel
for the Indemnified Persons promptly as statements therefor are received;
_provided_ , _however_ , the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph (c) to pay for only one firm of counsel for all
Indemnified Persons in any jurisdiction, (ii) the Indemnified Persons will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) neither Purchaser nor
the Surviving Corporation shall be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld);
and _provided_ , _further_ , that neither Purchaser nor the
Surviving Corporation shall have any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Person if and when a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately
determine, and such determination shall have become final, that the
indemnification of such Indemnified Person in the manner contemplated hereby
is prohibited by applicable law.



 

67 (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before, at or after the
Effective Time) is made against any Indemnified Persons on or prior to the
sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the provisions of this Section 5.7
shall continue in effect until the final disposition of such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation.



(d) The covenants contained in this Section 5.7 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Persons and

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any

succeed to the obligations set forth in this Section 5.7.



 5.8. _Notification of Certain Matters_. Company shall use reasonable
commercial efforts to give prompt notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall use
reasonable commercial efforts to give prompt notice to Company, to the extent
that either acquires actual knowledge of (i) the occurrence or non-occurrence

likely to cause any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate and (ii) any failure of Purchaser, Merger Sub or
Company, as the case may be, to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition
or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this Section 5.8
shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice.



 

 5.9. _Public Announcements_. Purchaser and Company shall develop a joint
communications plan and each party shall (i) ensure that all press releases
and other public statements and communications (including any communications
that would require a filing under Rule 425, Rule 165 and Rule 166 of the
Securities Act or Rule 14a-12 of the Exchange Act) with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be consistent with
such joint communications plan and (ii) unless otherwise required by
applicable law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any securities exchange, consult with each other for a reasonable
time before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public
statement or communication (including any communication that would require a
filing under Rule 425, Rule 165 and Rule 166 of the Securities Act or Rule
14a-12 of the Exchange Act), and mutually agree upon any such press release
or any such public statement or communication, with respect to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition to the foregoing, except
to the extent disclosed in the Joint Proxy Statement in accordance with

such list shall be updated as necessary to reflect changes from the date
thereof until the Effective Time. Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause each person identified on such list to deliver to
Purchaser, on or before the date of mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement, a
written agreement substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C hereto (an "
_Affiliate Agreement_ ").



 5.12. _Transition Team_. Promptly following execution of this Agreement, the
parties shall establish a transition planning team (the " _Transition Team_ ")

successful combination of the operations of Purchaser and Company. Subject to
applicable law, the Transition Team shall be responsible for developing, and
monitoring the development of, and deliverables due under, an action plan for
the combination of the businesses.



 5.13. _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. The parties hereto shall use
their commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger to be treated as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and shall not
knowingly take or fail to take any action which action or failure to act would
prevent (a) the qualification of the Merger as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code or (b) the receipt of the opinions of
tax counsel in such form and upon such matters as described in Section 6.2(c)
and Section 6.3(c). Unless required by law, each of Purchaser, Merger Sub and
Company shall not file any Tax Return or take any position inconsistent with
the treatment of the Merger as a reorganization described in Section 368(a)

Agreement, the Merger, or any other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, grant such approvals and take such actions as are necessary to
ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated hereby and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.



 5.15. _Other Obligations_. (i) Prior to the Closing, Company shall

business consistent with the past practice of such Subsidiary _plus_

to be distributed without the approval or consent of any applicable regulatory
authorities.

Company, the Purchaser   Common Stock received by me in connection with the Merger may be disposed of
by me only (i) pursuant to an effective registration under the Securities
Act, (ii) in conformity with the provisions of Rule 145 promulgated by the
Commission under the Securities Act (as such rule may hereafter be amended
from time to time), (iii) in reliance upon an exemption from registration
that is available under the Securities Act or (iv) after receipt of an opinion
of counsel reasonably acceptable to Purchaser, or under a no-action or
interpretative letter obtained from the Commission, stating that such sale,
transfer or other disposition will not violate or is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Securities Act.



I also understand that instructions will be given to Purchasers transfer
agent with respect to the Purchaser Common Stock to be received by
me pursuant to the Merger and that there will be placed on the certificates
representing such shares of Purchaser Common Stock, or any substitutes
therefor, a legend stating in substance as follows:



"THE SECURITIES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN
A TRANSACTION TO WHICH RULE 145 PROMULGATED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933,
AS AMENDED, APPLIES AND MAY ONLY BE SOLD OR OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF RULE 145 OR PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION
STATEMENT UNDER THAT ACT OR  _AN_ EXEMPTION FROM SUCH REGISTRATION."



It is understood and agreed that the legend set forth above shall be removed
at no cost to me upon surrender of certificates bearing such legend by
delivery of substitute certificates without such legend if (i) one year shall
have elapsed from the date that I received Purchaser Common Stock in the
Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then applicable to me, (ii)
two years shall have elapsed from the date that I received Purchaser Common
Stock in the Merger and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then applicable
to me or (iii) I have delivered to Purchaser an opinion of counsel, in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Purchaser, or a no-action or
interpretative letter obtained from the Commission, to the effect that such
legend is not required for purposes of the Securities Act.



I further understand and agree that Purchaser is under no obligation to
register the sale, transfer or other disposition of Purchaser Common Stock by
me or on my behalf under the Securities Act.



Neither execution of this letter nor any provisions set forth herein
should be construed as an admission on my part that I am an "affiliate" of
the Company as described in the first paragraph of this letter, or a waiver of
any right I may have to object to any claim that I am such an affiliate on or
after the date of this letter. By Purchasers acceptance of this letter, Purchaser hereby agrees with me
that, for a period of two years after the Effective Time, it shall use its
reasonable efforts to (i) file, on a timely basis, all reports and data
required to be filed with the Commission by it pursuant to Section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and (ii) furnish to me upon
request a written statement as to whether Purchaser has complied with such
reporting requirements during the 12 months preceding any proposed sale of
Purchaser Common Stock by me under Rule 145.



This letter agreement constitutes the complete understanding
between Purchaser and me concerning the subject matter hereof. Any notice
required to be sent to either party hereunder shall be sent by registered or
certified mail, return receipt requested, using the addresses set forth herein
or such other address as shall be furnished in writing by the parties. This
letter agreement shall be governed by, and construed and interpreted in
accordance with, the laws of the State of Indiana. If you are in agreement with the foregoing, please so indicate by signing
below and returning a copy of this letter to me, at which time this letter
shall become a binding agreement between us.
