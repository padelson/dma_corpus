Material Contract, except such challenges which, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Purchaser. Neither Purchaser nor any of its Subsidiaries, and to the Knowledge of Purchaser, as
of the date hereof, none of the other parties thereto, has violated any provision of, or committed or failed to perform any act which (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) would constitute a default under the provisions of, any Purchaser
