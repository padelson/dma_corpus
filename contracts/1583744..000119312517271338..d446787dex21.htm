the Lightfoot Entities or the holder of any securities of any of them:

 

(a) _Conversion of Common Units (Other Than the Sponsor Units)_. Each issued
and outstanding Common Unit (other than the Sponsor Units) as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time will (i) be converted into the right to receive
the Public Merger Consideration, (ii) no longer be outstanding, (iii)

(c) _Limited Partner Interests of the Surviving Entity_. The limited liability
company interests in Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to

pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ and _Section_ __ _ 2.1(b)_. At the
Effective Time, the books and records of the Surviving Entity will be revised
to reflect the admission of Parent as the sole Limited Partner of the
Surviving Entity and the simultaneous cancellation of all other limited
partner interests in MLP (as the Surviving Entity).

 

(d) _Cancellation of MLP-Owned Units and Parent-Owned Units_. Any
Partnership Interests that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time
by MLP or any Subsidiary of MLP, and any Partnership Interests owned

(e)  _General Partner Interest Unaffected_. The General Partner Interest
issued and outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time will be

Section 2.2 _Exchange of Book-Entry Units_.

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall appoint a
paying agent reasonably acceptable to MLP (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the
purpose of exchanging Common Units held of record in book-entry form (" _Book-
Entry Units_ ") for the Merger Consideration. Subject to  _Section_ __ _
2.2(c)_, as soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent
will send, or will cause the Paying Agent to send, to each holder of Book-
Entry Units (other than The Depository Trust Company (the " _DTC_ ")) as

 



4  of the Effective Time (and, to the extent commercially practicable, Parent
will, or will cause the Paying Agent to, make available for collection by
hand, during customary business hours commencing immediately after the
Effective Time, if so elected by a holder of Book-Entry Units), a letter of
transmittal in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to each of the
Parties (each such letter, a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") to be used for
surrender of Book-Entry Units pursuant to this _Article II_.

(b)  _Deposit_. At or prior to the Closing, Parent will deposit or cause to
be deposited with the Paying Agent, for the benefit of the Unitholders, an
amount of cash in U.S. dollars equal to the sum of the aggregate Public Merger
Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)_ _plus_ the
aggregate Sponsor Merger Consideration to be paid pursuant to _Section_ __ _
2.1(b)_, payable upon due surrender of the Book-Entry Units pursuant to
the provisions of this _Article II_. All cash deposited with the Paying Agent
is referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_." The Paying Agent will, pursuant to
irrevocable instructions delivered by Parent at or prior to the Effective
Time, deliver the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to
this _Article II_ out of the Exchange Fund. The Paying Agent will invest the
Exchange Fund as directed by Parent; _provided_ that no such investment or
losses thereon will affect the Merger Consideration payable to Unitholders
entitled to receive such Merger Consideration and Parent will promptly cause
to be provided additional funds to the Paying Agent for the benefit of
Unitholders entitled to receive such Merger Consideration in the amount of
any such losses. Any interest and other income resulting from such investment
will be the sole and exclusive property of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent
designated by Parent, and no part of such earnings will accrue to the benefit
of Unitholders.

(c) _Exchange_.

 

(i) Each holder of Book-Entry Units other than DTC, upon surrender thereof by
delivery of a Letter of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in
accordance with the terms of such Letter of Transmittal, and such other
documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, will be entitled
to receive in exchange for each surrendered Book-Entry Unit a cash
amount equal to the Merger Consideration (after giving effect to any required
Tax withholdings as provided in _Section_ __ _ 2.5_). DTC, upon surrender of
its Book-Entry Units in accordance with the customary surrender procedures of
DTC and the Paying Agent, will be entitled to receive in exchange for each
surrendered Book-Entry Unit a cash amount equal to the Merger Consideration.
Each Book-Entry Unit surrendered pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.2(c)_ will
be cancelled.

(ii) The Merger Consideration will be paid to (A) the holders of Book-Entry
Units other than DTC, as promptly as practicable after receipt by the Paying
Agent of the Letter of Transmittal in respect thereof, by mail or wire
transfer of immediately available funds and (B) DTC, as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 



5 (iii) Payment of the Merger Consideration with respect to Book-Entry Units
will only be made to the Person in whose name such Book-Entry Units are
registered. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due
surrender of Book-Entry Units. Until surrendered and paid as contemplated
hereby, each Book-Entry Unit will be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration in cash
as contemplated by this Agreement. The Merger Consideration paid upon
surrender of such Book-Entry Units will be deemed to have been paid in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Book-Entry Units.

(iv) No Person beneficially owning Common Units through DTC will be required
to deliver a Letter of Transmittal to receive the Merger Consideration that
such holder is entitled to receive through DTC. Any such Person will receive
its Merger Consideration in accordance with the customary payment procedures
of DTC following the Effective Time.

(d) _No Further Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there will be
no further registration on the books of MLP of transfers of Common Units. From
and after the Effective Time, the Unitholders as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Units, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement.

(e) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund that
remains unclaimed by the Unitholders on the first anniversary of the Effective
Time will be returned to Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by
Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not exchanged its
Common Units for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 2.2_ prior to that time will thereafter look only to Parent for delivery
of the Merger Consideration in respect of such holders Common Units.
Any Merger Consideration remaining unclaimed by Unitholders immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to, or become property
of, any Governmental Authority will, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, become the property of Parent or an Affiliate of Parent designated by
Parent, free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person previously
entitled thereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub,
MLP, MLP GP or any of their respective Affiliates will be liable to any
Unitholder for any Merger Consideration duly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property Laws.

 

Section 2.3 _Treatment of Phantom Units_ _and Incentive Distribution Rights_.

 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,

immediately prior to the Effective Time shall (i) be canceled and converted
into the right to receive from Parent (through MLP GP) the Phantom Unit
Consideration, (ii) no longer be outstanding and (iii) cease to exist. As a
condition to the receipt of the Phantom Unit Consideration, each holder of

6 (b) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
at the Effective Time, each Unvested Phantom Unit that is outstanding as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be amended and converted into
the right to receive the following: (i) the regular vesting schedule of each
Phantom Unit shall be amended to provide that 50% of such Unvested Phantom
Units vest on the six (6) month anniversary of the Closing, with the remaining
50% of such Unvested Phantom Units vesting on the twelve (12) month
anniversary of the Closing, with each such Unvested Phantom Unit subject to
the same forfeiture and acceleration provisions in effect prior to such
amendment, and (ii) on the date such Unvested Phantom Unit would vest and be
settled in accordance with the applicable terms and conditions of each
Unvested Phantom Unit (as amended pursuant to (i) above), each Unvested
Phantom Unit shall be paid the Phantom Unit Consideration; _provided_ that
such amendment and payment does not trigger Taxes under Section 409A of the
Code. Following the payment of the Phantom Unit Consideration with respect to
any Unvested Phantom Unit, such Unvested Phantom Unit shall no longer be
outstanding and shall cease to exist. As a condition to the receipt of the
Phantom Unit Consideration, each holder of Unvested Phantom Units will be
required to execute and deliver the Phantom Unitholder Acknowledgement on or
within five Business Days of the vesting of such Unvested Phantom Unit.

 

(c) Parent will cause MLP GP to pay the Phantom Unit Consideration (i) to any
holder of Vested Phantom Units who executes and delivers to MLP GP a Phantom
Unitholder Acknowledgement on or prior to the Closing, as promptly as
practicable (but in no event later than three Business Days) following the
Closing Date and (ii) to any holder of Unvested Phantom Units who executes
and delivers to MLP GP a Phantom Unitholder Acknowledgement in accordance with
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_ after the Closing, in accordance with the applicable
terms and conditions of such Unvested Phantom Units. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any Phantom Unit Consideration. The Phantom Unit Consideration
paid will be paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the Phantom
Units formerly outstanding.

 

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, MLP and MLP GP, including the MLP GP Board
and any committee thereof, shall take all action necessary, if any, under the
MLP Equity Plans to permit and effect the cancellation and conversion of
Vested Phantom Units as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.3(a)_ and the
amendment and conversion of Unvested Phantom Units as contemplated by
_Section_ __ _ 2.3(b)_.

immediately prior to the Effective Time, which are owned by MLP GP, shall be
automatically cancelled at the Closing and shall cease to exist, and no
consideration shall be delivered in respect thereof.

 

Section 2.4 _Distributions_.

 

(a) The MLP Entities, including the MLP GP Board and any applicable committee
thereof, have adopted and approved the incorporation of _Annex I_ of the MLP
Disclosure Letter into MLPs distribution policy. The MLP Entities shall not
take any action, including any amendment or modification of MLPs distribution
policy, that prohibits or restricts, or limits the ability of, any MLP Entity
from complying with the terms and conditions of _Annex I_ of the MLP
Disclosure Letter.

 



7 (b) From the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time, the MLP
Entities and the Lightfoot Entities will declare and make any distribution
permitted under _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ in accordance with and subject to the
limitations of _Annex I_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter.

 

Section 2.5 _Withholding Taxes_. Each of Parent, MLP, MLP GP, Merger Sub, any
Affiliate of Parent that has been designated by Parent pursuant to this
_Article II_ , and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement, including to a
Unitholder or a holder of Phantom Units, such amounts as are required to
be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder, or under any provision of applicable
state, local or non-U.S. Tax Law. The MLP Entities shall cooperate with
Parent in coordinating the deduction and withholding of any Taxes required to
be deducted and withheld by any MLP Group Entity under applicable Tax Law,
including payroll Taxes relating to payments made in respect of Phantom Units.
To the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Tax
authority, such withheld amounts will be treated for the purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person, including the former Unitholder
or former holder of Phantom Units, as applicable, in respect of whom such
withholding was made.

 

Section 2.6 _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section_
__ _ 6.2_ and _6.3_ or other applicable prohibitions in this Agreement), if
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number of
outstanding Common Units have been changed into a different number of units
or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any unit
dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, split-up,
unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar transaction, the
Merger Consideration will be equitably adjusted to proportionately reflect the
effect of such unit dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, split-up, unit distribution, combination, exchange of units or similar
transaction and to provide the Unitholders and holders of Phantom Units the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.

are or will be available with respect to the Transactions.

Each of the MLP Group Entities has all requisite partnership, corporate,
limited liability company power or other applicable power, as applicable, and
authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as currently conducted, except where the failure to have
such power or authority would not, and would not reasonably be expected
to, individually or in the aggregate, result in an MLP Material Adverse
Effect.

(b) Each of the MLP Group Entities is duly licensed or qualified to do
business and is in good standing (with respect to jurisdictions that recognize
that concept) in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business
conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and assets
owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except
where the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing has not had
and would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

 



9 (c) MLP has made available to Parent true and complete copies of its
certificate of limited partnership and the MLP Partnership Agreement (the "
_MLP Charter_ _Documents_ "), and true and complete copies of the comparable
organizational documents of each of its Subsidiaries and MLP GP and of Gulf

MLP Partnership Agreement). No Common Units, Phantom Units or other Equity

in an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 3.6 _MLP SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) Since July 29, 2013, all MLP SEC Documents (except for the Proxy
Statement, which is addressed in  _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)_) have been timely
filed or furnished to the SEC in accordance with the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. All MLP SEC Documents (i) complied in
all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the NYSE and (ii) as of its filing date in the case of any
Exchange Act report and as of its effective date in the case of any
Securities Act filing, or if amended, supplemented or superseded, as finally
amended, supplemented or superseded prior to the date of this Agreement, did
not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. MLP has made available to Parent true and complete
copies of all material correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and
any MLP Group Entity, on the other hand, occurring since July 29, 2013, other
than any thereof that is publicly available on the SECs website. There are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect
to the MLP SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of the MLP, no MLP SEC Document is
the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation. None of MLPs Subsidiaries
or MLP GP is required to file periodic reports with the SEC pursuant to the
Exchange Act.

(b) The historical consolidated financial statements of MLP included in the
MLP SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date of
the last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of MLP and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations, cash flows and changes in partners capital for the
periods then ended (subject, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to
normal and immaterial year-end audit adjustments).

 

(c) MLP has established and maintains internal controls over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined
in Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act). Such disclosure
controls and procedures are designed to ensure that material
information relating to MLP and its consolidated Subsidiaries required to be
disclosed by MLP in the MLP SEC Documents under the

 



13  Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the MLP GPs principal
executive officer and its principal financial officer (the " _Principal
Officers_ ") to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Such
disclosure controls and procedures are effective to ensure that information
required to be disclosed by MLP in the MLP SEC Documents under the Exchange
Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods
specified in SEC rules and forms. The Principal Officers have disclosed, based
on their most recent evaluation, to MLPs auditors and the audit committee of
the MLP GP Board (i) all significant deficiencies in the design or operation
of internal controls which could adversely affect MLPs ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial data and have identified for MLPs
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (ii) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in MLPs internal controls. The Principal Officers have
made all certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Exchange
Act with respect to the MLP SEC Documents, and the statements contained in
such certifications were complete and correct when made. The management of the
MLP has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of MLPs internal
control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of
Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2016,
and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the
Knowledge of the MLP Entities, as of the date of this Agreement there are no
facts or circumstances that would prevent the Principal Officers from giving
the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the rules and
regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act,
without qualification, when next due. MLP is in compliance in all material
respects with all effective provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and, to the
Knowledge of the MLP Entities, no employee of the MLP Group Entities has
provided or is providing information to any law enforcement agency regarding
the commission or possible commission of any crime or the violation or
possible violation of any applicable legal requirements of the type described
in Section 806 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act by any MLP Group Entity. No MLP
Group Entity nor, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, any of their
respective Representatives has received any substantive complaint, allegation,
assertion or claim, whether written or oral, that an MLP Group Entity has
engaged in questionable accounting or auditing practices. No current or former
attorney representing any MLP Group Entity has reported evidence of a material
violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or similar violation
by the MLP Group Entities or any of their respective managers, officers,
directors, employees or agents, to the current MLP GP Board or any committee
thereof or to any current manager, director or executive officer of the MLP
Entities.

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Sections 3.6(a)_ through _3.6(c)_
, (i) PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not resigned or been dismissed as
independent public accountant of MLP as a result of or in connection with any
disagreement with MLP on a matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure or auditing scope or procedure, (ii) no
executive officer of MLP GP has failed in any respect to make, without
qualification, the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or
906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any form, report or schedule
filed by MLP with the SEC since July 29, 2013 and (iii) no enforcement action
has been initiated or, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, threatened in
writing against MLP by the SEC relating to disclosures contained in any MLP
SEC Document.

 



14 (e) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the consolidated
balance sheet of MLP and its Subsidiaries as of December 31, 2016 (the "
_Balance Sheet Date_ ") (including the notes thereto) included in the MLP SEC
Documents filed by MLP and publicly available prior to the date of this
Agreement, and as updated on the consolidated balance sheet of MLP and its
Subsidiaries as of the most recent quarter (including the notes thereto)
included in the MLP SEC Documents filed by MLP and publicly available prior to
the date of this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
since the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business (x) that have
been paid, or are not yet due and payable or are being contested in good
faith, in each case for which adequate reserves have been established in
accordance with GAAP or (y) that are described in _Section_ __ _ 3.6(e)_ of
the MLP Disclosure Letter and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred
under or in accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the
Transactions, neither MLP nor any of its Subsidiaries has any liabilities or
obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or contingent), that would
be required to be reflected or reserved against on a consolidated balance
sheet of MLP prepared in accordance with GAAP or the notes thereto in order
for such balance sheet to fairly and completely present MLPs financial
position in all material respects.

 

(f) Neither MLP nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any Contract
to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet partnership or any
similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any transaction or
relationship between or among MLP and any of its Subsidiaries, on the one
hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate, including any structured finance,
special purpose or limited purpose entity or Person, on the other hand, or any
"off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K
of the SEC)), where the purpose of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any
material transaction involving, or material liabilities of, MLP in MLPs
published financial statements or any MLP SEC Documents.

Section 3.7 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_.

 

(a) Since the Balance Sheet Date and except to the extent arising out of or
resulting from any change, event, effect, occurrence, state of facts or
developments that may arise after the date hereof and that are listed in
_Section_ __ _ 3.7(a)_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter, there have not been any
changes, events, effects, occurrences, states of facts or developments that,
individually or in the aggregate with all other changes, events, effects,
occurrences, states of facts or developments, have had or would reasonably be
expected to have an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) From the Balance Sheet Date through the date of this Agreement, (i) except
for this Agreement and the Transactions, the MLP Group Entities have carried
on and operated their respective businesses in all material respects in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and (ii) no MLP
Group Entity has taken any action that, if taken after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the Effective Time without the prior written consent of
Parent, would constitute a breach of _Sections 6.3(a)_ , _(c)_ , _(d)_ , _(h)_
, _(i)_ , _(k)_ , _(l)_ , _(m)_ , _(n)_  or _(o)_.

 



15 Section 3.8 _Legal Proceedings_. No Proceeding is pending or, to the Knowledge
of the MLP Entities, is threatened, against or affecting any MLP Group Entity
or their respective assets (including by virtue of indemnification or
otherwise), or any director, manager, officer or employee (in his or her
capacity as such) of any MLP Group Entity that (a) would, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to result in an MLP Material Adverse
Effect or (b) as of the date of this Agreement, challenges the validity or
propriety of any of the Transactions or otherwise seeks to prevent or
materially delay consummation of any of the Transactions or performance by the
MLP Entities of any of their respective material obligations under this
Agreement. None of the MLP Group Entities is a party to, and none of the MLP
Group Entities or their respective assets are subject to the provisions of,
any Orders of, or promulgated or issued by or with (or settlement or consent
Contract subject to), any Governmental Authority that, individually or in the
aggregate, (i) has resulted, or would reasonably be expected to result, in an
MLP Material Adverse Effect or (ii) challenges the validity or propriety of
the Transactions or otherwise seeks to prevent or materially delay
consummation of the Transactions or performance by the MLP Entities of any of
their respective material obligations under this Agreement.

Section 3.9  _Compliance with Laws; Permits_.

(a) _Compliance with Laws_. None of the MLP Group Entities has been, or is,
in conflict with, in default under or in violation of any Law applicable to
any MLP Group Entity or by which any property or asset of the MLP Group
Entities is bound or affected, in each case, that would reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to result in an MLP Material
Adverse Effect. Since the date of formation of MLP, no written notice, written
charge, written allegation or written assertion has been received by the MLP
Group Entities or, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, threatened against
any MLP Group Entity alleging any actual or potential violation of or non-
compliance with any of the foregoing other than any thereof, individually or
in the aggregate, that has not had or would not reasonably be expected to
have an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

(b) _Permits_. The MLP Group Entities are in possession of all Permits
necessary for the MLP Group Entities to own, lease and operate their
properties and assets or to lawfully carry on their businesses as they are now
being conducted, except where the failure to be in possession of such Permits
would not, and would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, result in an MLP Material Adverse Effect. All such Permits are in
full force and effect, except where the failure to be in full force and
effect would not have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material
Adverse Effect. Each of the MLP Group Entities is not, and since the date of
formation of MLP have not been, in violation or breach of, or default under,
any such Permit, except where such violation, breach or default would not
have, individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect. No
suspension, modification, revocation or cancellation of any of such Permits is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, threatened, nor, to the
Knowledge of the MLP Entities, do reasonable grounds exist for any such
action, except for any such suspension, modification, revocation or
cancellation that would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to result in an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

 



16 Section 3.10 _Prohibited Payments_.

 

(a) None of the MLP Group Entities, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives or any other Person acting on its behalf (including any
distributor, agent, sales intermediary or other third party), has, since the
date of formation of MLP, (i) taken any action in violation of any applicable
Anti-corruption Laws or (ii) paid, offered, promised to pay, or authorized
the payment of, or will, directly or indirectly, pay, offer or promise to pay,
or authorize payment of, any monies or any other thing of value to any
Government Official (including employees of government-owned or controlled
entities), any political Party or candidate for political office or to any
other Person (collectively, a " _Proscribed Recipient_ "): (A) for the purpose
of (1) influencing any act or decision of such Proscribed Recipient, (2)

of the lawful duty of such Proscribed Recipient, or to use his, her or its
influence with a Governmental Authority to affect or influence any act or
decision of such Governmental Authority, (3) assisting the MLP Group Entities
or any of their respective Representatives in obtaining or retaining business
for or with, or directing business to, any Person, (4) securing any improper
advantage or (5) inducing such Proscribed Recipient to influence or affect
any act or decision of any Governmental Authority or (B) in a manner which
would constitute or have the purpose or effect of public or commercial
bribery, acceptance of, or acquiescence in extortion, kickbacks or other
unlawful or improper means of obtaining business or any improper advantage.
The MLP Group Entities have at all times been in compliance in all material
respects with the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the "
_FCPA_ "). No MLP Group Entity has received any communication from a
Governmental Authority that alleges that any MLP Group Entity, or any
Representative (as defined below) thereof, is or may be in material violation
of, or has, or may have, any unresolved material liability under, any Anti-
corruption Laws.

(b) Neither the MLP Group Entities nor, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities,
any of their respective employees (in the context of their employment) has
been convicted of violating any Anti-corruption Laws or subjected to any
Proceeding by a Governmental Authority for potential corruption, fraud or
violation of any applicable Anti-corruption Laws.

Section 3.11 _Export Controls_.

 

(a) No MLP Group Entity, nor, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, any of
their respective Representatives (in each case, acting in their capacities as

boycott Laws, of the United States or any other jurisdiction, including: The
Arms Export Control Act (22 U.S.C. § 2278), the Export Administration Act (50

Specially Designated Nationals List). No export or import Permits, license
exceptions or other Consents are required to operate the business of the MLP
Group Entities as currently conducted.

establish, support or maintain any business relationships with, or contracted
to sell, supply, distribute or otherwise provide any goods or services to, any
Governmental Authority within, and any Person organized or domiciled in

violation of, or is being or, since the date of formation of MLP has been,
charged by any Governmental Authority with, or to the Knowledge of the MLP
Entities, investigated for, a violation of any Antitrust Law applicable to
any MLP Group Entity. To the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, no investigation
or review by any Governmental Authority under any Antitrust Law with respect

investigation or review, except in connection with the transactions provided
for herein.

and complete list of all material MLP Benefit Plans.

determination letters from the IRS with respect to any of the MLP Benefit
Plans, (iii) all summary plan descriptions, summaries of material
modifications, annual reports, and summary annual reports with respect to any

(d) No dispute, arbitration or other Proceeding is pending or, to the
Knowledge of the MLP Entities, threatened (i) with respect to any MLP Benefit

Service to be exempt from Tax under the provisions of Section 501(a) of the
Code, and to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, no fact or event has occurred
since the date of any such determination that would reasonably be expected to

Entities, no MLP Group Entity, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates

they would reasonably be expected to be subject (either directly or
indirectly) to a material liability for either a civil penalty assessed
pursuant to Section 502(i) of ERISA or a Tax imposed by Section 4975 of the
Code. No MLP Group Entity maintains or contributes to or is required to

Entity required by applicable Law or any MLP Benefit Plan have been made or
properly accrued in all material respects under any such plan to any fund,
trust or account established thereunder or in connection therewith by the due
date thereof.

 

(g) The consummation of the Transactions will not, either alone or in
combination with another event, (i) entitle any current or former employee,
individual, consultant or officer of an MLP Group Entity to any severance pay,
retention bonuses or any similar payment other than pursuant to the change of
control agreements listed in  _Section_ __ _ 3.14(g)_ of the MLP Disclosure
Letter (the " _Change of Control Agreements_ "), (ii) accelerate the time of
payment, vesting, or funding, or increase the amount of any compensation due
any such employee, individual, consultant or officer other than the
accelerated vesting of the outstanding Phantom Units issued pursuant to the
MLP LTIP and (iii) result in any forgiveness of indebtedness or obligation to
fund benefits with respect to any such employee, individual, consultant or
officer. No amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of property) as a result of any of the Transactions by any employee,
manager, officer or director of any MLP Group Entity or any of its Affiliates
who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.280G-1) under any employment, severance or termination
Contract, other compensation Contract or MLP Benefit Plan currently in effect
would reasonably be expected to be characterized as an "excess parachute
payment" (as such term is defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the Code). No
manager, director, officer, employee or other service provider of any MLP
Group Entity is entitled to a gross up, make whole or other similar payment as
a result of the imposition of Taxes under Section 280G, Section 4999 or
Section 409A of the Code pursuant to any Contract with any MLP Group Entity.

(h) Each MLP Benefit Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan"
within the meaning of Section 409A(d)(1) of the Code and any award thereunder,
in each case, that is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section
409A of the Code, complies in form and operation with Section 409A such that
no additional tax would be due in respect of any such arrangement, except as
would not reasonably be expected to result in an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

 

(i) No MLP Benefit Plan is subject to the Laws of any Governmental Authority
other than those of the United States.

 

(j) With respect to each group health plan benefiting any current or former
employee of an MLP Entity or any ERISA Affiliate that is subject to Section
4980B of the Code, each MLP Entity and each ERISA Affiliate has complied with
the continuation coverage requirements of Section 4980B of the Code and Part 6
of Subtitle B of Title I of ERISA, except for any noncompliance which would
not reasonably be expected to result in an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

 



22 (k) No MLP Benefit Plan is or at any time was funded through a
"welfare benefit fund" as defined in Section 419(e) of the Code, and no
benefits under any MLP Benefit Plan are or at any time have been provided
through a voluntary employees beneficiary association (within the meaning of
subsection 501(c)(9) of the Code) or a supplemental unemployment benefit plan
(within the meaning of Section 501(c)(17) of the Code).

 

(l) No MLP Group Entity has agreed or committed (i) to institute any plan,
program or other agreement for the benefit of employees or former employees
of an MLP Group Entity, which, if in effect on the date of this Agreement

the date of this Agreement, or (ii) except as required by the terms of the
MLP Benefit Plans or applicable Law, to make any amendments to any of the MLP
Benefit Plans.

Entities, no such investigation is in progress. There is no (and, during
the two-year period preceding the date of this Agreement, has not been any)
(i) strike or lockout with respect to any employees of any MLP Group Entity,
(ii) to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, union organizing effort pending or
threatened against any MLP Group Entity, (iii) except as would not reasonably
be expected to result in an MLP Material Adverse Effect, unfair labor practice
or labor dispute with respect to any employees of any MLP Group Entity, (iv)

under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Act of 1988 as a result of any
action taken by any MLP Group Entity which remains outstanding and
unsatisfied. Each MLP Group Entity is, and during the two-year period
preceding the date of this Agreement has been, in compliance with all
applicable Laws in respect of employment and employment practices, terms and
conditions of employment, wages and hours and occupational safety and health

transported or arranged for the transport of Hazardous Materials, including to
any off-site location, or exposed any Person to Hazardous Materials, in each
case so as to give rise to any current or future liabilities of any MLP Group
Entity under Environmental Laws or Environmental Permits other than any
liability that has not had, or would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, an MLP Material Adverse Effect.

(c) None of the MLP Group Entities have entered into or agreed to any consent
order, decree or Contract, or are subject to or have received any notice of

Letter, there are no Liens, notices or Proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of the MLP Entities, threatened regarding any actual or potential
liability under, violation of, or non-compliance with, any Environmental Law

_Rights-of-Way_ ") as are necessary to conduct its business in the manner
described in the MLP SEC Documents, except for such Rights-of-Way the absence
of which would not, individually or in the aggregate, result in an MLP
Material Adverse Effect. Each such Right-of-Way is valid and enforceable,
except to the extent that enforceability thereof may be limited by the

thereby and all rights necessary thereunder for the current operation of the
businesses of the MLP Group Entities, except where the failure of any such
Right-of-Way to be valid or enforceable or to grant the rights purported to

Entities has fulfilled and performed all its material obligations with
respect to such Rights-of-Way and, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, no
event has occurred that allows, or after notice or lapse of time would allow,

businesses of the MLP Group Entities as presently conducted (collectively, the
" _MLP Group Intellectual Property_ ") free and clear of all Liens except for
Permitted Liens and except where the failure to own or have the right to use
such Intellectual Property would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to have an MLP Material Adverse Effect. To the
Knowledge of the MLP Entities, the use of the MLP Group Intellectual Property
by the MLP Group Entities in the operation of the business of the MLP Group
Entities as presently conducted does not infringe upon or misappropriate any
Intellectual Property of any other Person, except for such matters that would
not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have an MLP
Material Adverse Effect.

has taken any action or failed to take any action which (with or without
notice or the lapse of time or both) would constitute such a breach or default
or permit termination or modification of any of the Insurance Policies, (c)
the MLP Group Entities have not received any notice of termination or
cancellation with respect to any Insurance Policy or, since January 1, 2014,
denial of coverage with respect to any material claim made thereunder and (d)

fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Parent
Entities makes any representation or warranty with respect to any information
provided by or on behalf of the MLP Group Entities, the Lightfoot Entities or
their respective Representatives in writing specifically for incorporation by
reference in the Transaction Filings.

 



36 Section 5.8 _F_ _inancing_.

 

(a) Each of the Parent Entities acknowledges and agrees that it is not a
condition to the Closing or to any of its other obligations under this
Agreement that Parent obtain financing for, or related to, any of the
Transactions. Parent has delivered to MLP a true and complete copy of (i) a
fully executed debt commitment letter (together with any term sheet relating
thereto) dated as of the date of this Agreement (as amended or replaced, the "
_Debt Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the financial institutions
party thereto (together with any other agents or entities that have committed
to provide or arrange or otherwise entered into agreements in connection with
the Debt Financing or other financings in connection with the Transactions and
the parties to any joinder agreements, indentures or credit agreements
entered pursuant thereto or related thereto, and together with their
respective Affiliates and their and their respective Affiliates
Representatives and their respective successors and assigns, but excluding
Parent, Parent GP, Holdings, Merger Sub, the Equity Financing Sources and the
Guarantors, collectively, the " _Debt Financing Sources_ " and each, a " _Debt
Financing Source_ ") have committed, subject to the terms and conditions set
forth therein, to lend the amounts set forth therein for the purposes set
forth therein (the " _Debt Financing_ "), and (ii) a fully executed equity
commitment letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement (as amended or
replaced, the " _Equity Commitment Letter_ " and together with the Debt
Commitment Letter, the " _Commitment Letters_ "), providing for equity
financing for the transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Equity Financing_ "
and together with the Debt Financing, the " _Financing_ ") by the
counterparties named therein (the " _Equity Financing Sources_ " and together
with the Debt Financing Sources, the " _Financing Sources_ "). Parent has
also delivered to MLP true and complete copies of any fee letter entered into
in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter (any such fee letter, a " _Fee
Letter_ "), except that the numerical fees, pricing and other commercially
sensitive numbers and provisions specified in any such Fee Letter (including
any provisions relating to "flex" terms or similar concepts) that would not
adversely affect the aggregate amount, availability or conditionality of the
Debt Financing may have been redacted.

(b) Assuming the conditions to the obligation of the Parent Entities to
consummate the Merger have been satisfied or waived and the Financing is
funded in accordance with the Commitment Letters, at the Effective Time,
Holdings and Merger Sub will have available to them sources of immediately
available funds to consummate the Transactions and to pay all amounts
required to be paid in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger Consideration, any Debt that must be repaid in
connection with the Merger and all required financing fees and expenses
and other expenses, in each case, that are required to be paid at Closing.

(c) As of the date hereof, each Commitment Letter is in full force and effect
and has not been withdrawn, rescinded or terminated or otherwise amended,
supplemented or modified in any respect (including by any reduction of the
commitments of the Financing Sources thereunder), and, as of the date hereof,
none of the Financing

 



37  Sources has notified any of the Parent Entities of its intention to rescind,
terminate or reduce the commitments under a Commitment Letter or not to
provide the Financing on the Closing Date. Each Commitment Letter, in the
form delivered to MLP prior to the execution of this Agreement, is a valid and
binding obligation of Parent and enforceable against it in accordance with its
terms, and, to the Knowledge of Parent as of the date of this Agreement, is a
valid and binding obligation against each Financing Source and enforceable
against each Financing Source in accordance with its terms. As of the date of
this Agreement, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of
time or both, could constitute a default or breach on the part of any of the
Parent Entities or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any Financing Source under any
term of any Commitment Letter or otherwise result in the failure of any
condition to the Financing or any portion of the Financing contemplated
thereby to be unavailable at the Closing. Assuming the conditions to the
obligation of the Parent Entities to consummate the Merger have been satisfied
or waived, none of the Parent Entities has reason to believe that it or any
Financing Source would be unable to satisfy on a timely basis any term or
condition of any Commitment Letter required to be satisfied by such Person.
Each of the Parent Entities has fully paid any and all commitment fees or
other fees required by the Commitment Letters to be paid on or before the date
of this Agreement. Parent acknowledges and agrees that there are no conditions
precedent or other contingencies related to the funding of the full amount of
the Financing immediately prior to the Closing, other than as expressly set
forth in the Commitment Letters, and, other than the Fee Letters, there are no
side letters, understandings or other agreements that affect the amount,
conditionality or availability of the Financing.

Section 5.9 _Brokers and Finders_. Except for Barclays Bank PLC and Credit
Suisse AG, the fees and expenses of which will be borne by Parent, none of
the Parent Entities or any of their respective Subsidiaries, has employed any
broker or finder, or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees,
commissions or finders fees payable by any of the Parent Entities or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in connection with the Transactions based on
Contracts made by or on behalf of any Parent Entity.

 

Section 5.10 _Limited Guarantee_. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, Parent has delivered to the MLP Entities and the Lightfoot
Entities a limited guarantee, dated the date hereof, of Warburg Pincus Private
Equity (EandP) XI-A, L.P. and Warburg Pincus Energy (EandP)-A, L.P. (each, a "
_Guarantor_ "), guaranteeing certain of Parents obligations hereunder,
subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein (the " _Limited
Guarantee_ "). The Limited Guarantee is valid and in full force and effect
and constitutes the valid and binding obligation of each of the Guarantors,
enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability may be
limited by the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

Section 5.11 _Acknowledgement by Parent_. Except for (a) the representations
and warranties made in this Agreement and (b) the representations and
warranties made (i) in any Letter of Transmittal, (ii) in connection with any
payment of Merger Consideration through DTC, (iii) in any Phantom Unitholder
Acknowledgement, (iv) in the Support Agreement or (v) in any certificate
required to be delivered under _Section_ __ _ 6.17_, none of the MLP
Entities, the Lightfoot Entities or any other Person is making or has made,
and none of the Parent Entities is relying on, or has relied on, any other
representations or warranties, either express or implied,

 



38  with respect to the Transactions or MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities
or their respective businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, financial
condition, results of operations, future operating or financial results,
estimates, projections, forecasts, plans or prospects (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, plans or prospects), or on the accuracy or completeness of
any information regarding the MLP Entities or the Lightfoot Entities or their
respective Subsidiaries or any other material furnished or provided to the
Parent Entities or made available to the Parent Entities in any "data
rooms," "virtual data rooms," management presentations or in any other form,
in expectation of, or in connection with, this Agreement or the Transactions.

relating to any of the MLP Entities or any of the Parent Entities or any of
their respective Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by
MLP, Parent or Parent GP that should be set forth in an amendment or
supplement to the Proxy Statement so that such documents would not include any

44 Section 6.4 _No Solicitation or Withdrawal of Recommendation_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation_.

 

(i) Except as set forth in _Sections 6.4(a)(ii)_ and _6.4(a)(iii)_ , the MLP
Entities and the Lightfoot Entities agree for themselves that neither they
nor any of their Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective officers, managers
or directors (including the MLP GP Board) shall, and that they shall instruct
and cause their respective controlled Affiliates, and use their reasonable
best efforts to cause their respective non-controlled Affiliates and
Representatives (collectively, the " _MLP Non-Solicit Parties_"), not to,
directly or indirectly:

(A) initiate, solicit, knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage any
inquiries or discussions regarding, or the making or submission of, any
proposal, request or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected
to lead to, any Alternative Proposal;

 

(B) approve, endorse, recommend or enter into any Contract or agreement in
principle, whether written or oral, with any Person (other than Parent and

entering into a confidentiality and standstill agreement as described in
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)(iii)_) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ");

(C) terminate, amend, release, modify, or fail to enforce any provision of, or
grant any permission, waiver or request under, any standstill,
confidentiality or similar Contract entered into by one or more of the MLP
Group Entities in respect of or in contemplation of an Alternative Proposal
(other than to the extent the GP Conflicts Committee determines in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
failure to take any such actions under this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)(i)(C)_
would constitute a breach of its duties under the MLP Partnership Agreement,
including any duty to act in the best interests of MLP or the Public
Unitholders thereunder);

 

(D) conduct, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions
or negotiations regarding any Alternative Proposal;

(E) furnish any non-public information relating to any of the MLP
Group Entities, or afford access to the books or records or Representatives
of any of the MLP Group Entities, to any third party that, to the Knowledge of
the MLP Entities, after consultation with its Representatives, is reasonably
likely to make, or has made, an Alternative Proposal;

(F) take any action to make the provisions of any Takeover Laws inapplicable
to any transactions contemplated by any Alternative Proposal; or

 



45 (G) resolve or publicly propose or announce to do any of the foregoing.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and subject to
the conditions in  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)(iii)_ and solely in response to a
Bona Fide Alternative Proposal made on or after the date of this Agreement and
prior to obtaining MLP Unitholder Approval, the MLP Non-Solicit Parties may,
with respect to the Person that has made such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal:

 

(A) in response to a request therefor by such Person, provide information or
afford access to the books and records or Representatives of any of the MLP
Group Entities; and

(B) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with such Person
(and its Representatives) with respect to such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal.
For the avoidance of doubt, the discussions and negotiations with such Person
(or its Representatives) shall include discussions and negotiations of all
of the Transactions (i.e., not only the Merger or GP Equity Transfer), and
the appropriate MLP Non-Solicit Parties shall be entitled to participate in
such discussions or negotiations.

 

(iii) The MLP Entities may not take the actions described in _Section_ __ _
6.4(a)(ii)_ unless, prior to taking any such action:

(A) the MLP Entities have (1) received from such Person an executed
confidentiality and standstill agreement on terms that are no less
restrictive than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (and
compliant with the last sentence of _Section_ __ _ 6.4(g)_) and (2) disclosed
to Parent GP (and, if applicable, substantially contemporaneously provided
copies of) any non-public information to be provided to such Person and any
books or records to which such Person will be afforded access, in each case,
to the extent not previously provided to Parent GP;

(B) the MLP Entities have delivered to Parent GP written notice prior
to taking any such action (1) stating that the MLP GP Board intends to take
such action, (2) stating that the GP Conflicts Committee has made the
determination set forth in _Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)(iii)(C)_ and (3) including
an unredacted copy of such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal (including any
materials relating to such Persons proposed equity and debt financing, if
any) and an executed copy of the confidentiality agreement described in 
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(a)(iii)(A)_; and

(C) the GP Conflicts Committee has determined in good faith,
after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that such
Bona Fide Alternative Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or is
reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal and that failure to take
such action would constitute a breach of its duties under the MLP Partnership
Agreement, including any duty to act in the best interests of MLP or the
Public Unitholders thereunder.

 



46 (b) _No Withdrawal of Recommendation_. Except as set forth in  _Section_ __ _
6.4(c)_, no MLP Non-Solicit Party shall:

(i) withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, Parent GP or
Merger Sub, the Board Recommendation;

(ii) fail to announce publicly, within 10 Business Days after a tender offer
or exchange offer relating to any securities of MLP has been commenced, that
the MLP GP Board recommends rejection of such tender or exchange offer;

 

(iii) fail to include the Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement
distributed to the Unitholders in connection with the Transactions;

(iv) make any other public statement that is inconsistent with the Board
Recommendation;

 

(v) approve, adopt or recommend any Alternative Proposal; or

 

(vi) resolve or publicly propose to do any of the foregoing (any such
prohibited action described in _clause 6.4(b)(i)_  through this _clause
6.4(b)(vi)_ being referred to as a " _Withdrawal of Recommendation_ ");

_provided_ that the making of any determination of the MLP GP Board (or any
committee thereof) to provide, or the provision of, a Superior Proposal Notice
or an Intervening Event Notice in compliance with the terms of this Agreement
shall not, in and of itself, be deemed a Withdrawal of Recommendation.

(c) _Certain Permitted Withdrawals of Recommendation_. Subject to  _Section_
__ _ 6.4(d)_, at any time prior to obtaining MLP Unitholder Approval, the GP
Conflicts Committee may effect, or cause the MLP Entities to effect, as the
case may be, a Withdrawal of Recommendation if: (i) the GP Conflicts
Committee determines that (A) after complying with _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)(i)_,
a Bona Fide Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal or (B) after
complying with  _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)(ii)_, an Intervening Event has
occurred and is continuing and (ii) the GP Conflicts Committee determines in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors,
that approving the Merger would constitute a breach of its duties under the
MLP Partnership Agreement, including any duty to act in the best interests of
MLP or the Public Unitholders thereunder.

 

(d) _Procedure Prior to Withdrawal of Recommendation_.

 

(i) _Superior Proposal_. The GP Conflicts Committee shall be entitled to
effect, or cause the MLP Entities to effect, a Withdrawal of Recommendation
in connection with a Superior Proposal (to the extent permitted under
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_), only if (A) the GP Conflicts Committee shall have
delivered to 

 



47  Parent GP a written notice (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") (1) stating
that the GP Conflicts Committee intends to take such actions pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_, (2) stating that the GP Conflicts Committee has made
the determinations set forth in _Sections 6.4(c)(i)(A)_ and _6.4(c)(ii)_ and
(3) including an unredacted copy of such Superior Proposal and proposed an
unredacted form of any Alternative Acquisition Agreement related to such
Superior Proposal (including any materials relating to such Persons proposed
equity and debt financing, if any) and (B) the Negotiation Period shall have
expired and the Superior Proposal remains a Superior Proposal at the end of
the Negotiation Period. During the four Business Day period commencing on the
date of Parent GPs receipt of such Superior Proposal Notice (such period, as
may be extended pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)(i)_, the "
_Negotiation Period_ "), the MLP Entities shall engage, and shall cause their
Representatives to be available for the purpose of engaging, in good faith
negotiations with Parent GP (to the extent Parent GP desires to negotiate)
regarding an amendment of this Agreement so that the Alternative Proposal that
is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a Superior
Proposal. Each time the financial or other material terms or conditions of
such Bona Fide Alternative Proposal (or terms or conditions related thereto,
such as the proposed equity and debt financing) are amended or modified, the
MLP Entities shall be required to deliver to Parent GP a new Superior
Proposal Notice (including, as attachments thereto, amended forms of the
written Alternative Acquisition Agreements relating to such Bona Fide
Alternative Proposal) and the Negotiation Period shall be extended by an
additional two Business Days from the date of Parents receipt of such new
Superior Proposal Notice.

(ii)  _Intervening Event_. The GP Conflicts Committee shall be entitled to
effect, or cause the MLP Entities to effect, a Withdrawal of Recommendation in
connection with, an Intervening Event (to the extent permitted under 
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_), only if (A) the GP Conflicts Committee shall have
delivered to Parent GP prior to obtaining MLP Unitholder Approval a written
notice (an " _Intervening Event Notice_ ") (1) stating that the GP Conflicts
Committee intends to take such actions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_,
(2) stating that the GP Conflicts Committee has made the determinations set
forth in _Sections 6.4(c)(i)(B)_ and _6.4(c)(ii)_ and (3) including a
summary, in all material respects, of the Intervening Event and (B) the
Intervening Event Negotiation Period shall have expired. During the four
Business Day period commencing on the date of Parents receipt of
such Intervening Event Notice (such period, as may be extended pursuant to
this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)(ii)_, the " _Intervening Event Negotiation Period_
"), the MLP Entities shall engage, and shall cause their Representatives to
be available for the purpose of engaging, in good faith negotiations with
Parent GP (to the extent Parent GP desires to negotiate) regarding an
amendment of this Agreement so that the GP Conflicts Committee would no longer
be permitted to take such actions pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.4(c)_. Each
time there is a material change to the facts or circumstances relating to the
Intervening Event, the MLP Entities shall be required to deliver to Parent GP
a new Intervening Event Notice (including, as attachments thereto, a summary
of the changes to the facts and circumstances relating to the Intervening
Event) and the Intervening Event Negotiation Period shall be extended by an
additional two Business Days from the date of Parents receipt of such new
Intervening Event Notice.

 



48 (e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this  _Section_ __ _
6.4_ shall be deemed to prohibit the MLP Entities from complying with their
required disclosure obligations under applicable Law with regard to an
Alternative Proposal or an Intervening Event; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that
none of MLP, MLP GP or the MLP GP Board (or any committee thereof) shall
effect any Withdrawal of Recommendation, except in accordance with _Section_
__ _ 6.4(c)_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.4(d)_; and _provided_ , _further_ , that
in no event shall any (i) "Stop-Look-and-Listen" communication contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (ii) public announcement or other
public disclosure regarding any Alternative Proposal or Intervening Event that
is required by applicable Law or the rules of any stock exchange on which the
Common Units are then listed, and which does not expressly effect a Withdrawal
of Recommendation, be deemed to be a Withdrawal of Recommendation or to
violate this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_. Disclosure of the type described in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.4(e)_ (other than the type described in the second proviso
of the foregoing sentence) that is not an express rejection of any Alternative
Proposal or an express confirmation that the Board Recommendation remains in
effect shall be deemed to be a Withdrawal of Recommendation.

(f) _Existing Discussions_. The MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities shall
instruct, and shall cause their respective controlled Affiliates, Subsidiaries
and their respective officers, managers and directors, and shall use their
reasonable best efforts to instruct and cause their respective non-controlled
Affiliates and Representatives and their respective officers, managers and
directors, to immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with, or any solicitation or intentional assistance or
encouragement of, any Person with respect to any Alternative Proposal (or that
could reasonably be expected to lead to or result in an Alternative Proposal)
which are ongoing as of the date of this Agreement and request that any such
Person promptly return and destroy (and confirm destruction of) all
confidential information concerning the MLP Group Entities. The MLP Entities
and the Lightfoot Entities shall take the necessary steps to promptly inform,
on the date of this Agreement, the individuals or entities referred to in the
preceding sentence of this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(f)_.

 

(g) _Notice_. Without limiting anything in this _Section_ __ _ 6.4_, the MLP
Entities shall promptly (and, in any event, within 36 hours) notify Parent GP
orally and in writing if any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to an
Alternative Proposal or requests for non-public information relating to
any of the MLP Group Entities (other than requests for information in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice and unrelated to an
Alternative Proposal) are received by, or any discussions or negotiations with
respect to an Alternative Proposal are sought to be initiated or continued
with, any of the MLP Group Entities or the Lightfoot Entities or any of their
respective Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the
name of such Person and the material terms and conditions of such
discussions, proposals, offers or requests, and including in the written
version of such notice, an unredacted copy of any written (including via
electronic transmission) proposals, offers or requests, in each case,
including any amendments or modifications thereto. The MLP Entities shall
promptly (and, in any

 



49  event, within 36 hours after any amendment or modification of, or
development with respect to, any such, proposal, offer, request or Alternative
Proposal, or at the reasonable request of Parent GP) notify Parent GP orally
and in writing of the status of any such inquiries, proposals, offers or
requests, including any material developments, notifications, amendments or
modifications thereto and furnish to Parent GP copies of any
written inquiries, correspondence and draft documentation in connection with
such discussions, proposals, offers or requests. The MLP Entities and the
Lightfoot Entities shall not, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries
and Representatives not to, enter into any Contract that would prohibit them
from providing the information required to be provided to Parent GP pursuant
to this _Section_ __ _ 6.4(g)_.

 

Section 6.5 _Regulatory, Financing and Other Authorizations_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Parent Entities, the MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities will cooperate

advisable under this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make
effective the Transactions as soon as practicable, including by (i) filing the

and Other Governmental Consents, and the termination or expiration, as
applicable, of approvals or waiting periods required under all applicable
Antitrust Laws in order to consummate the Transactions, (iii) cooperating with
each other in connection with any review of, inquiry into, investigation of,
or challenge to the Transactions under any Antitrust Law by a Governmental
Authority and all activities with respect to any requests that may be made by,
or any actions, Consents or undertakings that may be sought by or from, any
Governmental Authority in respect of Antitrust Consents and Other Governmental
Consents, including determining the manner in which to contest or otherwise
respond, by litigation or otherwise, to objections to, or Proceedings
challenging, the consummation of the Transactions and (iv) offering, accepting
or agreeing, or committing to agree to a Divestiture Condition with respect to
any businesses or assets acquired after the date hereof in order to
obtain any Antitrust Consent or Other Governmental Consent, in each case with
such Divestiture Condition contingent upon the occurrence of the Closing;
_provided_ that nothing in this Agreement will require any of the Parent
Entities, the MLP Entities, the Lightfoot Entities or any of their respective
Affiliates to offer, accept or agree, or commit to agree, to, a Divestiture
Condition with respect to any businesses or assets owned as of the date hereof
in order to obtain any Antitrust Consent or Other Governmental Consent; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that none of the MLP Entities or the Lightfoot
Entities will, without Parent GPs prior written consent, offer, accept or
agree, or commit to agree, to, any Divestiture Condition. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.5_ will limit any applicable rights a Party may have to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_ in a case where
_Section_ __ _ 8.1_ permits such termination. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Parties will act reasonably and as promptly as
practicable. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Parent Entities will have the absolute right (but not the obligation) to
contest, at their

 



50  cost and expense, any challenge to this Agreement by any Governmental
Authority, including contesting through a Proceeding initiated by the U.S.
Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission to enjoin any of the
Transactions, _provided_ that (i) such actions do not prevent the Closing from
occurring on or before the Outside Date and (ii) the Parent Entities afford
the MLP Entities, the Lightfoot Entities and their respective Representatives
an opportunity to participate in all associated Proceedings, _provided_ that
the Parent Entities will retain final discretion and authority with respect to
such litigation.

 

(b) _Financing_.

 

(i) Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done all things necessary to
arrange, obtain and consummate the Financing on the terms and conditions
described in the Commitment Letters (including the exercise of so-called
"flex" provisions in the related fee letter) as promptly as practicable
(taking into account the timing of the Marketing Period), including using
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in full force and effect the
Commitment Letters until consummation of the Transactions (except that Parent
may agree to any modification or amendment of the Commitment Letters solely as
permitted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)(iii)_) and to negotiate and
execute definitive agreements with respect to the Financing on the terms
contained in the Commitment Letters (including any "flex" provisions
applicable thereto) or on terms that are no less favorable, in any material
respect, to Parent than the terms contained in the Commitment Letters
(including any "flex" provisions applicable thereto), in each case which
terms shall not in any adverse respect change, expand or impose new conditions
to the funding of the Financing at the Closing or reduce the aggregate amount
of the Financing available to be funded on the Closing Date or materially
affect the timing of the Closing Date (the " _Financing Agreements_ "), (ii)
satisfy on a timely basis (taking into account the timing of the Marketing
Period) all conditions in the Commitment Letters and such Financing
Agreements which are in their control and to consummate the Financing at or
prior to the Closing, (iii) enforce their rights under the Commitment Letters
and the Financing Agreements including by taking enforcement action to cause
the Financing Sources, lenders and other Persons committing to provide the
Financing to comply with their obligations under the Commitment Letters and
the Financing Agreements and to fund such Financing at Closing;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be required to take any such enforcement
action unless all conditions precedent set forth in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_ and
_Section_ __ _ 7.2_ have been satisfied (other than those conditions that,
by their nature, are to be satisfied at the Closing) and (iv) comply with
their obligations in all material respects under the Commitment Letters and
the Financing Agreements. Parent shall keep the MLP Entities and the
Lightfoot Entities reasonably informed with respect to any material
developments concerning the status of the Financing. Parent shall provide the
MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities, upon reasonable request, with copies
of any primary material Financing Agreements and such other material
information and documentation regarding the Financing as shall be reasonably
necessary to allow the MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities to monitor the
progress of such financing activities.

 



51 (ii) Parent shall promptly (and in any event no later than three (3) Business
Days after becoming aware thereof) notify the MLP Entities and the Lightfoot
Entities in writing (i) of any material breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default)
by any party to the Commitment Letters or Financing Agreements of which the
Parent Entities become aware, (ii) of the receipt by the Parent Entities or
any of their controlled Affiliates or Representatives of any written notice
or other written communication from any Financing Source, any lender or any
other Person with respect to any (A) actual, threatened or alleged breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to the Commitment Letters or
any Financing Agreement (including any proposal by any Financing Source,
lender or other Person to withdraw, terminate or reduce the amount of the
Financing below the amount contemplated by the Commitment Letters) or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to the
Commitment Letters or any Financing Agreement (other than ordinary course
negotiations), (iii) if for any reason Parent believe in good faith that it
will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the Financing on the terms
contemplated by the Commitment Letters or the Financing Agreements and (iv) of
the termination or expiration of the Commitment Letters or any Financing
Agreement. As soon as reasonably practicable, after the MLP Entities or the
Lightfoot Entities deliver to Parent a written request, Parent shall provide
any information reasonably requested by the MLP Entities or the Lightfoot
Entities relating to any of the circumstances referred to in this _Section_
__ _ 6.5(b)(ii)_.

(iii) Parent shall not permit or consent to any amendment, supplement,
modification or waiver to be made to the Commitment Letters if such amendment,
supplement, modification or waiver would (A) change, expand or impose new
conditions precedent to the funding of the Financing from those set forth
therein on the date hereof, (B) materially delay the funding of the Financing
thereunder or reasonably be expected to materially impair, delay or prevent
the availability of all or a portion of the Financing or the consummation of
the Transaction, (C) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing (including

Financing (except as set forth in any flex provisions existing on the date
hereof)) unless additional sources are then made available to finance such
increase in fees or original issue discount or (D) otherwise adversely affect
the ability of the Parent Entities to consummate the Transactions or
materially delay the timing of the Closing (collectively, the " _Restricted
Commitment Letter Amendments_ ") (except that subject to the limitations set
forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)(iii)_, Parent may replace, modify,
supplement or amend the Commitment Letters to add lenders, lead arrangers,
bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities that have not executed the
Commitment Letters as of the date hereof, so long as such replacement,
modification, supplement or amendment would not result in the occurrence of a
Restricted Commitment Letter Amendment). For purposes of this Agreement,
references to the " _Commitment Letters_ " shall include such documents as
permitted or required by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(b)(iii)_ to be amended,
modified or waived, in each case from and after such amendment, modification

52 (c) _Alternative Financing_.

 

(i) In the event that any portion of the aggregate amount of the Debt
Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated by the
Debt Commitment Letter, other than as a result of a termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parent shall (i) promptly notify the
MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities of such unavailability and, to
the knowledge of Parent, the reason therefor and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such
event, any alternative financing arrangement, including from alternative
sources, on terms no less favorable to Parent than the terms of the Debt
Commitment Letter and in an amount sufficient to enable the Transactions to be
consummated (such arrangement, an " _Alternative Financing_ "; in such event,
the terms "Debt Commitment Letter" and "Commitment Letters" shall be deemed
to refer to such new commitment letters entered into in connection with such
Alternative Financing and the terms "Debt Financing" and "Financing" shall
be deemed to refer to the Alternative Financing contemplated thereby).

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
nothing contained in this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ shall require, and in no event
shall the reasonable best efforts of Parent be deemed or construed to require
Parent to pay fees or interest rates (taken as a whole) applicable to the
Debt Financing in excess, other than by a de minimis amount, of those
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment Letter (including the market
flex provisions), or agree to market flex terms (taken as a whole)
less favorable, other than in a de minimis respect, to Parent or the Company
than such corresponding market flex term contained in or contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitment Letter (in either case, whether to secure waiver of
any conditions contained therein or otherwise).

(iii) In the event the Debt Commitment Letter is replaced in accordance with
_clause (i)_ above, Parent shall provide the MLP Entities and the Lightfoot
Entities executed copies of the material documentation relating to any
replacement commitment (including any fee letter with respect thereto,
redacted in customary form). 

(d) _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to the Closing, the MLP Entities shall, and
shall cause their respective officers, employees, advisors and other

reasonably requested by Parent GP), to consummate the Debt Financing or the
Alternative Financing at the time the Debt Financing or the Alternative
Financing is to be consummated; (iii) reasonably assisting Parent, Parent GP,
Holdings and the Debt Financing Sources in the preparation prior to
commencement of the Marketing Period of (A) offering documents, private
placement memoranda, bank information memoranda, prospectuses and similar
documents required in connection with the Debt Financing or the Alternative
Financing and (B) materials for rating agency presentations; (iv) reasonably

MLPs legal counsel in connection with any legal opinions that such legal
counsel may be required to deliver in connection with the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing; (v) assisting in the preparation of and executing and
delivering any necessary pledge and security documents (including all

requested by Parent GP; and (x) providing Parent, Parent GP and Holdings with
all documentation and other information with respect to MLP and its

at least eight Business Days prior to the Closing Date and that is required in
connection with the Debt Financing and Alternative Financing by regulatory
authorities under applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the Patriot Act, in each case no later than
three Business Days prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the MLP Entities shall not be required to provide any cooperation or
assistance under this _Section_ __ _ 6.5_ to the extent doing so would (i)
unreasonably interfere with the ongoing business or operations of MLP or any
of its Subsidiaries, (ii) require MLP or any of its Subsidiaries to take any
action that would conflict with or violate any law or subject any director,
manager, officer or employee of MLP or any of its Subsidiaries to any actual
personal liability, (iii) require providing access to or disclose information
that MLP reasonably determines could jeopardize any attorney client privilege
of, or conflict with any confidentiality requirements (not created in

require any of the MLP Group Entities to take any action that would reasonably
be expected to result in 

 



54  a breach of any Contract or subject it to actual or potential liability, to

reimbursed by Parent) or incur any other liability of any kind or provide or

require MLP GP Board in place prior to Closing to enter into any resolutions
or take similar action. MLP hereby consents to the use of its logos and
logos of its Subsidiaries in connection with the Debt Financing or
Alternative Financing. Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
MLP Entities and their respective Representatives from and against any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys
fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties suffered or incurred and amounts
paid by any of them in connection with the Debt Financing or Alternative
Financing, including any action taken in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
6.5(d)_ and any information utilized in connection therewith (other than
historical financial information relating to the MLP and its Subsidiaries
provided in writing by the MLP or its Subsidiaries expressly for use in
connection with the Debt Financing or Alternative Financing) or except to the
extent such losses result from actual fraud of any of the MLP Entities or
their respective Representatives. Parent shall, promptly upon request by MLP,
reimburse the MLP Entities for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
costs (including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the MLP Entities in
connection with this _Section_ __ _ 6.5(d)_.

(e) _Information_. Subject to applicable Law, each Party will, upon request
by the any other Party, furnish the other with all information concerning
itself, its Subsidiaries, directors, officers, members, managers, general
partners and stockholders and such other matters as may be necessary

made by or on behalf of any Party to any Governmental Authority or other
Person in connection with the Parties respective obligations under 
_Section_ __ _ 6.5(a)_.

(f) _Fees and Other Costs of Governmental Consents_. Each of the Parties will
be responsible for its own respective fees, costs and expenses, including
costs and expenses of any necessary experts or consultants, incurred by such
Party, as applicable, in connection with any review of, inquiry into,

Parent will be responsible for paying the filing fee under the HSR Act and any
filing fee associated with any other applicable Antitrust Laws.

 

(g) _Notification Requirements_. Each Party will promptly notify the other
Parties of any communication it or any of its Affiliates receives from any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement; _provided_ that such notice must be delivered within 36 hours if
the communication is a Divestiture Request. The Parties will coordinate and
cooperate fully with each other in exchanging such information and providing
such assistance as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with
the foregoing. The Parties will provide each other with copies of all
filings and all material correspondence or communications between them or any
of their

 



55  Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or members
of its staff, on the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the
Transactions. The Parties will use reasonable best efforts to share
information protected from disclosure under the attorney-client privilege,
work product doctrine, joint defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant
to this section so as to preserve any applicable privilege.

Agreement (including  _Section_ __ _ 6.5(f)_), each of the Parties will

reasonably agreed upon by Parent GP and MLP GP. Parent GP and MLP GP will not,
and each of the foregoing will cause its Representatives not to, issue any
public announcements or make other public disclosures regarding this Agreement
or the Transactions, without the prior written approval of the Parties; _
provided_, _ however_, that a Party or its Representatives may issue a public
announcement or other public disclosures required by Law or the rules of
any stock exchange upon which such Partys or its parent entitys capital
stock is traded, _ provided_ such Party affords the other Parties a
reasonable opportunity to first review the content of the proposed disclosure
and provide reasonable and timely comment regarding same; _ provided_, _
however_, that this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ shall not be deemed to restrict in
any manner MLPs ability to communicate with its employees and that MLP shall
not be required by this _Section_ __ _ 6.6_ to consult with any other Party
with respect to a public announcement in connection with the receipt and
existence of a Bona Fide Alternative Proposal and matters related thereto or
a Withdrawal of Recommendation, subject to the obligations set forth in _
Section_ __ _ 6.4_.

 

Section 6.7 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information, each of the MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities

requested by Parent (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),

respective Representatives to be located at the offices and facilities of the
MLP Group Entities at such times as Parent GP may reasonably request, (iv) use
reasonable best efforts to furnish or produce information related to the
financial or Tax records of the MLP Group Entities if reasonably requested by
Parent GP (which, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 6.7_, will be deemed to
be furnished or produced upon MLP entering into an engagement with its regular
external advisors to furnish such information to Parent GP) and (v)
reasonably cooperate with Parent GP and its Representatives with respect to
communications to, and to organize and facilitate meetings with, customers,
suppliers and other key business relations of the MLP Group Entities as
Parent GP may reasonably request; _provided, however_ , that such access shall
be provided on a basis that minimizes the disruption to the operations of the
MLP Entities and in no event shall include invasive sampling or testing of
the Environment; and _provided further_ , that the foregoing will not require
the MLP Entities (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information,
that in the reasonable judgement of the MLP Entities (after consultation with
its outside legal counsel) would (A) result in the disclosure of any trade
secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to
confidentiality if the MLP Entities have used reasonable best efforts
to obtain the Consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure or
(B) result in a violation of any Antitrust Laws, (ii) to disclose any
privileged information of the MLP Group Entities to the extent such disclosure
would result in the loss of such privilege (in each case, it being agreed
that the MLP Entities shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is
withholding such access or information and thereafter the MLP Entities shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to cause such access or
information, as applicable, to be provided, or made available, in a manner
that would not reasonably be expected to cause such a disclosure, violation or
waiver) or (iii) to disclose any information relating to the MLP Entities
consideration of the Transactions, including the minutes of the GP Conflicts
Committee.

(b) The MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities will furnish promptly to the
Parent Entities, and the Parent Entities will furnish promptly to the MLP

with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning their and
their respective Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as the
Parent Entities or the MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities, as the case
may be, may reasonably request;  _provided_ , _however_ , that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein and notwithstanding any right
to information under Law (to the extent such right under Law can be waived),
except as specifically provided in  _Section_ __ _ 6.18(d)_, none of the MLP
Group Entities, the Lightfoot Entities or their respective Affiliates or
holders of their Equity Interests shall have the right at any time to examine
the Tax Returns, Tax work papers, financial statements or books and records
of the Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates for any purpose.

 



57 (c) Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the

Affiliates shall provide Parent and Parent GP access to the personnel, books,

relating to any of the MLP Group Entities to the extent reasonably necessary
to enable Parent and Parent GP to prepare financial statements of the MLP
Group Entities in such form and covering such periods as may be required by
any applicable securities Laws to be filed with the SEC. Furthermore, the
Lightfoot Entities and their Affiliates shall use their commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the independent public accountants of the MLP
Group Entities to provide any consent necessary to the filing of such
financial statements with the SEC and to provide such customary representation
letters as are necessary in connection therewith. All of the financial
statements, reports, opinions and related activities to be prepared, provided,
delivered, made available or undertaken pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.7(d)_ shall be prepared, provided, delivered, made available and undertaken
at the sole cost and expense of Parent.

(e) For a period of three years following the Closing, the Lightfoot Entities
and their Affiliates shall retain all books, records, information and
documents in possession of the Lightfoot Entities and their Affiliates that
are necessary to prepare and audit financial statements with respect to the

except to the extent originals or copies thereof are transferred to Parent and
Parent GP in connection with Closing.

 

(f) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
6.7_ will modify any of the representations and warranties of the Parties.

Section 6.8 _Notification of Certain Matters_. The MLP Entities and
the Lightfoot Entities will give prompt notice to Parent GP, and Parent GP
will give prompt notice to the MLP Entities and the Lightfoot Entities, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such Party (or its Subsidiaries,
Affiliates or Representatives) from any Governmental Authority in connection
with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that the obtaining or making
of Consent from or with such Person is or may be required in connection with
the Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure
of such Party to obtain such Consent is reasonably likely to be material to
any of the Parties, (b) the discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the
occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of
which, would result in the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to
the Closing in _Article VII_ and (c) any material failure of such Party to
comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it hereby which would result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in  _Article VII_ ; _provided_ ,
_however_ ,

 



58  that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall
not cure any breach of representation, warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies
available hereunder to the Party receiving such notice; _provided_ , _further_
, that in the case of _clauses (b)_ and _(c)_ , the failure to comply with
this  _Section_ __ _ 6.8_ shall not result in the failure to be satisfied of
any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VII_ , or give rise to any
right to terminate this Agreement under _Article VIII_ , if the
underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself
give rise to such failure or right.

Section 6.9 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless to the fullest extent permitted under
Applicable Law each Indemnified Person against all liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses (including attorneys fees), interest,
awards, judgments, fines, penalties suffered or incurred and amounts paid in
settlement in connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation arising out of or pertaining to acts or omissions, or alleged
acts or omissions, by any Indemnified Person in such Indemnified Persons
capacity as such, whether commenced, asserted or claimed before or after the
Effective Time to the extent such Indemnified Person would be entitled to be
indemnified in respect of liabilities for such acts or omissions under the MLP
GP LLC Agreement or the MLP Partnership Agreement (or in the comparable
governing documents of any Subsidiary of MLP) or under applicable Law. In the
event of any Proceeding in respect of any act or omission by an Indemnified
Person that is subject to indemnification pursuant to the immediately
preceding sentence, (i) Parent and the Surviving Entity shall pay, as
incurred, the fees and expenses of counsel selected by the Indemnified Person,
which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to Parent and the Surviving
Entity, in advance of the final disposition of any such Proceeding to the
fullest extent permitted by Applicable Law and, if required, upon receipt of
any undertaking required by Applicable Law to repay the amounts so advanced
to the extent it is ultimately determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to indemnification, and (ii) Parent and the Surviving Entity will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter; provided, however, Parent and
the Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
their written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), and provided further, that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not
be obligated pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.9(a)_ to pay the fees and
disbursements of more than one counsel for all Indemnified Persons in any
single Proceeding, unless, in the good faith judgment of any of the
Indemnified Persons, there is or may be a conflict of interests between two
or more of such Indemnified Persons, in which case there may be separate
counsel for each similarly situated group.

 

(b) All rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time now existing in favor of any Indemnified Person as provided in the MLP GP
LLC Agreement, the MLP Partnership Agreement (or in the comparable governing
documents of any Subsidiary of MLP) or under applicable Law, shall continue
in full force and effect in accordance with their terms from and after the
Effective Time, irrespective of any subsequent amendment, modification or
revocation thereof.

 



59 (c) Prior to the Effective Time, the MLP Entities will purchase a single-
premium pre-paid "tail policy" for a period of six years from the Closing Date
with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior
to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed
by Indemnified Persons in their capacity as such and having coverage terms,
benefits, levels of coverage (including limits, self-insured retentions and
deductibles) and other terms and conditions which are in the aggregate
not less advantageous to the Indemnified Persons as those in effect under the
director and officer insurance policies of the MLP Group Entities on the date
of this Agreement; _provided_ that neither the Parent Entities nor any MLP
Entity shall be required to expend in the aggregate for such six year period
more than 300% of the last annual premiums paid prior to the date of this
Agreement to maintain or procure such director and officer insurance policies
of the MLP Group Entities and will purchase the maximum amount of coverage
that can be obtained for that amount if the coverage described in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.9(c)_ would cost in excess of that amount.

 

(d) The rights of any Indemnified Person under this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ will
be in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
MLP Charter Documents or the DRULPA. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _
6.9_ will survive the Closing Date for a period of six years and are expressly
intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons and their respective
heirs, successors, assigns, executors and administrators; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification set
forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 6.9_ are asserted or made within such six-year
period, all rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims
will continue until disposition of all such claims. If Parent, Parent GP, the
Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other Person,
then, in each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, Parent GP or the Surviving
Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent, Parent
GP and the Surviving Entity set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.9_.

Section 6.10 _Transaction Litigation_. The MLP Entities and the Lightfoot
Entities will give the Parent Entities prompt notice of any Proceeding
commenced or, to the Knowledge of the MLP Entities, threatened, against any of
them or their respective directors, officers, managers, partners
or Affiliates relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (collectively, "
_Transaction Litigation_ ") and shall keep the Parent Entities informed on a
substantially current basis with respect to the status thereof (including
by promptly furnishing to Parent GP and its Representatives such information
relating to such Proceeding as may be reasonably requested). The MLP Entities
and the Lightfoot Entities shall consult with the Parent Entities regarding
the defense or settlement of any Transaction Litigation and shall not
compromise, settle, come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise,
settle or come to an arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or
consent to the same, without the prior written consent of Parent GP (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). In
connection with any Transaction Litigation and the Parties performance of
their obligations under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.10_, the Parties shall enter
into a customary common interest or joint defense agreement or implement such
other techniques as reasonably required to preserve any attorney-client
privilege or other applicable legal privilege; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the MLP Entities shall not

 



60  be required to provide information if doing so, in the opinion of such MLP
Entitys legal counsel, would cause the loss of any attorney-client privilege
or other applicable legal privilege;  _provided_ , that, if any information
is withheld pursuant to the foregoing proviso, the MLP Entities shall inform
Parent GP as to the general nature of what is being withheld and the Parties
shall use reasonable best efforts to enable the MLP Entities to provide such
information without causing the loss of any attorney-client or other
applicable legal privilege.

 

Section 6.11 _Cooperation Regarding MLP Debt_. If requested by Parent GP at
any time after the date hereof, the MLP Entities shall, and shall cause MLPs
Subsidiaries to, reasonably cooperate with, and use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist, the Parent Entities in taking all actions necessary to,
contemporaneously with the Closing and on behalf of MLP and its Subsidiaries,
(a) repay or cause to be repaid all Indebtedness, liabilities and other
obligations outstanding under the Existing MLP Credit Facility or secured by
the collateral therefor with the proceeds of the Financing, (b) terminate
or cause to be terminated all commitments of the lenders to lend under the
Existing MLP Credit Facility and (c) terminate or release or cause to be
terminated and released any and all guarantees of, and Liens securing, such
Indebtedness, liabilities and obligations, in each case, including obtaining
customary payoff letters and causing the filing of any UCC-3 termination
statements, mortgage releases or similar documents evidencing termination or
release of such Liens. The Parties shall, and the MLP Entities shall cause the
other MLP Group Entities to, reasonably cooperate with the other Parties in
the preparation, execution, delivery and filing of the necessary and
appropriate documentation in connection with any actions reasonably requested
by Parent GP pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.11_.

 

Section 6.12 _Fees and Expenses_. Parent or its designee shall pay all charges
and expenses of the Paying Agent in connection with the provisions set forth
in _Article II_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ of the MLP Disclosure
Letter, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Transactions
including all legal, accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other
fees and expenses of third Parties incurred by a Party in connection with the
negotiation and effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
the Transactions, will be the obligation of the respective Party incurring
such fees and expenses.

(a) _Compensation; Benefit Plans_.

 

(i) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date (or until April 30,
2019, with respect to those Employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement with the Petroleum Trades Employees Union, an affiliate of Atlantic
Independent Union, affiliated with teamsters Local #312), Parent GP shall (or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to) (A) provide to each employee of the
Surviving Entity, its Subsidiaries and MLP GP (collectively, the " _Employees_
") a base salary or hourly wage that is no less than the base salary or hourly
wage provided to such Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date
and (B) continue in effect the hourly pay practices that are applicable to the
Employees as of the Closing Date and are set forth on _Section_ __ _
6.13(a)(i)_ of the MLP Disclosure Letter.

 



61 (ii) For a period of 12 months following the Closing Date (or until April 30,
2019, with respect to those Employees covered by a collective bargaining
agreement with the Petroleum Trades Employees Union, an affiliate of Atlantic
Independent Union, affiliated with teamsters Local #312), Parent GP shall (or
shall cause one of its Affiliates to) provide each Employee with employee
benefits (including, health, welfare and retirement benefits, but expressly
excluding fringe benefits, equity-based incentives, defined benefit pension

compensation plan benefits) that are no less favorable, in the aggregate, to
those provided to such Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(b) _Continuation of Benefit Plans_. For purposes of eligibility,
participation, benefit accruals and vesting (but not benefit accruals under
defined benefit pension plans) under Parent Benefit Plans providing employee
benefits to Employees after the Closing Date, each Employee shall be credited
with his or her years of service with the MLP Group Entities (and
their predecessors) prior to the Closing Date to the same extent as such
Employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for such service
under MLP Benefit Plans, except to the extent providing such credit would
result in any duplication of benefits. In addition, Parent GP shall (or shall
cause an Affiliate of Parent GP to) use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause (i) each Employee to be immediately eligible to participate, without any
waiting time, in any and all Parent Benefit Plans to the extent such Employee
would have been then-eligible to participate in a comparable MLP Benefit Plan;
(ii) each Parent Benefit Plan providing medical, dental, hospital,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any employee, to waive all pre-existing
condition exclusions and actively at work requirements (to the extent
permissible under any applicable insurance contracts) of such Parent Benefit
Plan for such Employee and his or her covered dependents (except to the
extent that such exclusions or requirements applied to the Employee under
comparable MLP Benefit Plans); and (iii) any deductibles and other eligible
expenses (including co-payments) incurred by such Employee and/or his or her
covered dependents during the plan year ending on the Closing Date to be
credited for purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum
out-of-pocket requirements applicable to such Employee and his or her covered
dependents for the applicable plan year of each comparable Parent Benefit Plan
(to the extent such credit would have been given under comparable MLP Benefit

Disclosure Letter or (B) at Parents request, any Contract that is not

obligations thereunder from and after the Closing.

 



65 Section 6.20 _GP Conflicts Committee_. Prior to the earlier of the Closing and

agreements contained in this  _Section_ __ _ 8.2_ are an integral part of
the Merger and the other Transactions, and that, without these agreements, no
Party would enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if MLP or Parent, as
applicable, fails to promptly pay any amount due under this _Section_ __ _
8.2_, and, in order to obtain such payment, the payee Party commences a
Proceeding that results in an Order against the payor Party, the payor Party
shall pay to the payee Party the costs and expenses (including attorneys
fees and expenses) in connection with such Proceeding and shall pay interest
on the amount payable pursuant to such Order, compounded quarterly, at the

or incidental damages or damages based on a multiple of earnings or similar

hereby and thereby (including for any breach by any of the Parent Entities,
the Financing Sources or the Guarantors), the termination of this Agreement,
the failure to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or
any Proceeding under applicable Laws arising out of any such breach,

transactions contemplated hereby or any claims or actions under applicable
Laws arising out of any such breach, termination or failure, other than from
any of the Parent Entities to the extent expressly provided for in this
Agreement and from the applicable Parent Related Party to the extent
expressly provided for in the Limited Guarantee or the Commitment Letters, as
applicable.

 



76 (iii) For the avoidance of doubt, (A) under no circumstances shall
the aggregate amount of damages payable by the MLP Entities or their officers
or directors in respect of breaches under this Agreement or any claim arising
out of or related to this Agreement exceed the $24,616,491 (the " _MLP

(and the termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and
the abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such
termination, and none of the Parent Entities or their respective Affiliates
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any Proceeding against the MLP Entities

 _MISCELLANEOUS_

 

Section 9.1 _No Survival, Etc._ Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, the representations, warranties and agreements of each Party
hereto will remain operative and in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any other Party hereto, whether prior to
or after the execution of this Agreement. The representations, warranties
and agreements in this Agreement will terminate at the Effective Time or,
except as otherwise provided in _Section_ __ _ 8.2_, upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.1_, as the case may be, except
that (x) the agreements set forth in _Articles II_ and _IX_ and _Sections 6.9_
, _6.12_ , _Section_ __ _ 6.13_, _Section_ __ _ 6.14_ and _6.18_ and any
other agreement in this Agreement that contemplates performance after the
Effective Time will survive the Effective Time and (y) those set forth in
_Sections 6.7(c)_ , _6.12_ and _8.2_ , and this _Article IX_ will survive
termination of this Agreement. The Confidentiality Agreement will (i) survive
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms and (ii) terminate
as of the Effective Time.

 

Section 9.2 _Amendment or Modification_. At any time prior to the Effective
Time, this Agreement may be amended or modified in any and all respects,
whether before or after receipt of the MLP Unitholder Approval, only by
written agreement of the Parties, by action taken or authorized by the MLP GP
Board, the GP Conflicts Committee and Parent GP; _provided_ , _however_
, that following approval of the Merger by the Unitholders, there will be no
amendment or change to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law would
require further approval by the Unitholders without such approval; _provided_
, _further_ , that this _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, _Section_ __ _ 9.7_, _Section_
__ _ 9.8_ and _Section_ __ _ 9.13_ (and any other provision of this

delay by any MLP Entity or any Parent Entity in exercising any
right hereunder will operate as a waiver thereof nor will any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a Party
hereto to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in addition to any approvals required by MLP or MLP GPs governing
documents or under this Agreement or any Transaction Document, any

or the MLP GP Board to (x) terminate this Agreement pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 8.1_ or (y) enforce this Agreement (including pursuant to _Section_ __ _

the GP Conflicts Committee, and such action shall not require approval of the
Unitholders.

Section 9.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the Parties without the
prior written consent of the other Parties, except that (a) Parent, Parent GP,
Holdings and Merger Sub may assign, in their respective sole discretion, any
or all of their respective rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement (i) to one or more Affiliates of such Party, or (ii) to any of their
financing sources as collateral security, but no such assignment will relieve
Parent, Parent GP, Holdings or Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder,
and (b) MLP may assign, in its sole discretion, its right to receive the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to  _Section_ __ _ 8.2(c)_ to one or more of
its Subsidiaries, but no such assignment will relieve MLP of any of its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Any purported
assignment not permitted under this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_ will be null and
void.

 

Section 9.5 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together will constitute one and the same agreement) and will become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Parties.

 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement, the Joliet Purchase Agreement,
the Gulf LNG Purchase Agreement, the MLP Disclosure Letter, the Transition
Services Agreement and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire

holders of Phantom Units to receive the Phantom Unit Consideration, this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than
the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder, including the right to rely
upon the representations and warranties set forth herein. Notwithstanding the
foregoing and anything in this Agreement to the contrary, _Section_ __ _
9.1_,  _Section_ __ _ 9.2_, _Section_ __ _ 9.7_, _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ and
_Section_ __ _ 9.13_ are intended for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, the Debt Financing Sources. The representations and
warranties in this Agreement are the product of negotiations among the Parties
and are for the sole benefit of the Parties. Any inaccuracies in such
representations and warranties are subject to waiver by the Parties
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the Parties of risks associated with particular matters regardless of
the Knowledge of any of the Parties, and consequently, may not accurately
characterize actual facts or circumstances.

 



79 Section 9.8 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial_.

 

(a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with
this Agreement or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) will be
governed by, and construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of
Delaware applicable to Contracts executed in and to be performed entirely
within that State.

 

(b) By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably agrees
that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns,
will be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery
and any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if
the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a
particular matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware).
Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such
Proceeding for itself and in respect of its property, generally and
unconditionally, to the personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and
agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of
the Transactions in any court other than the aforesaid courts. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense,
counterclaim or otherwise, in any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement or
the Transactions, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the failure
to serve in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, (ii) any claim that it
or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such court or
from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through service of
notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of
judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the Proceeding in
such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y) the venue of such
Proceeding is improper or (z) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof,
may not be enforced in or by such courts. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, each of the Parties (on behalf of themselves and,
with respect to MLP, on behalf of the MLP Related Parties) agrees: (a) that it
will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against the Debt Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the Transactions,
including the Merger and the Debt Financing, including any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the Debt Commitment Letter or the performance
thereof, in any forum other than federal and New York state courts located in
the Borough of Manhattan within the City of New York; and (b) that, except as
specifically set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter, all claims or causes of
action (whether at law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) against
any of the Debt Financing Sources in any way relating to the Debt Commitment
Letter or the performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby,
shall be exclusively governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
internal laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to principles or
rules of conflict of laws to the extent such principles or rules would
require or permit the application of laws of another jurisdiction.

 



80 (c) EACH PARTY (INCLUDING EACH MLP RELATED PARTY) ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES
THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT
OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS
AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, INCLUDING ANY ACTION, PROCEEDING
OR COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST ANY DEBT FINANCING SOURCE. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT
MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND (IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 9.8(c)_.

Section 9.9 _Specific Enforcement_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that irreparable damage would occur and that the Parties
would not have any adequate remedy at law in the event that any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their
specific terms or were otherwise breached, and it is accordingly agreed that
the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in accordance with this _Section_
__ _ 9.9_ in the Delaware Court of Chancery or any federal court sitting in
the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy to which
they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the Parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance or other
equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that (x) any Party has an
adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each Party further agrees
that no Party will be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar
instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy
referred to in this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_, and each Party irrevocably waives
any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any
such bond or similar instrument. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances shall the Parent Entities, on the one hand, and the MLP Group
Entities and the Lightfoot Entities, on the other hand, be permitted or
entitled to receive both a grant of specific performance in accordance with
this _Section_ __ _ 9.9_ and the MLP Termination Fee or the Parent
Termination Fee, as applicable, in respect of the same underlying claim. 

 



81 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and
without limiting the generality of _Section_ __ _ 9.9(a)_ with respect to
obligations not specifically addressed in this _Section_ __ _ 9(b)_, it is
explicitly agreed that MLP and MLP GP shall be entitled to seek
specific performance of the Parent Entities obligation to cause the Equity
Financing to be funded and to consummate the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including to effect the Closing in accordance
with  _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, on the terms and subject to the conditions in
this Agreement, if, and only if, (i) all conditions in _Section_ __ _ 7.1_
and _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (other than such conditions as, by their nature, are
to be satisfied by the delivery of documents or the taking of any other action
at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction (or waiver) of such conditions
at the Closing) have been satisfied at the time when the Closing would have
occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be funded, (ii) Parent
fails to complete the Closing by the date the Closing is required to have
occurred pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.3_, (iii) the Debt Financing Sources
have confirmed in writing that the Debt Financing has been funded or will be
funded at the Closing on the terms, and subject to the conditions, set forth
in the Debt Commitment Letter if the Equity Financing is funded at the
Closing, (iv) MLP has irrevocably confirmed in a written notice to Parent GP
that if specific performance or other equitable remedies are granted and the
Equity Financing and Debt Financing are funded (on the terms set forth
therein), then the Closing will occur on the terms contemplated by this
Agreement, and (v) MLP GP shall have delivered to Parent GP a Closing Failure
Notice and the five Business Day period following the delivery of such Closing
Failure Notice shall have expired. For the avoidance of doubt, under no
circumstances will MLP GP (collectively with all of its Affiliates) be
entitled to both a grant of specific performance or other equitable remedies
of the sort described in the preceding sentence and any monetary damages,
including all or any portion of Parent Termination Fee, the Parent Expense

TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT

 

This TRANSITION SERVICES AGREEMENT (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of []
(the " _Effective Date_ "), by and between Arc Logistics Partners LP, a
Delaware limited partnership (the " _Partnership_ "), and Lightfoot Capital
Partners GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (" _Provider_ "). The
Partnership and Provider are each referred to herein individually as " _Party_
" and collectively as the " _Parties_." Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to such
terms in the Merger Agreement (as defined below).

RECITALS

 

WHEREAS, pursuant to that certain Purchase Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated
as of August 29, 2017, by and among the Partnership, Provider, Zenith Energy
U.S. Logistics Holdings, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company ("
_Holdings_ "), Zenith Energy U.S., L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and
the other parties thereto (as amended or supplemented, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "): (a) Holdings acquired 100% of the membership interests of Arc
Logistics GP LLC, a Delaware limited liability company and the general partner
of the Partnership, from Provider; and (b) the Partnership merged with and
into a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings, with the Partnership surviving, so
that the Partnership became a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings
(collectively, the " _Transactions_ "); and

 

WHEREAS, to assist with the Partnerships operations for a specified period of
time following consummation of the Transactions, the Parties desire to enter
into this Agreement, pursuant to which, from and after the Effective Date,
Provider will endeavor to make available to the Partnership and its affiliates
the Transition Services (as defined below), subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Agreement.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, agreements and covenants
contained herein, and other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are acknowledged and in reliance upon the mutual
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement, the Parties agree
as follows:

 

1\. Transition Services. Commencing on the Effective Date until the expiration
of the Term (as defined below), and subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement (including earlier termination of such Transition Service in
accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2_ below), Provider will endeavor to make
available to the Partnership and its affiliates the services described in
_Schedule A_ of this Agreement (each such service being referred to
individually as a " _Transition Service_ ", and all such services being
referred to collectively as the " _Transition Services_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any individual who is an employee of Provider or any of its
affiliates as of the date hereof (each, a " _Current Employee_ ") may, at his
or her choice, leave the employment of the Provider, in which case the
Provider shall be under no obligation to replace such Current Employee or to
induce any such Current Employee to remain in the employment of the Provider
(it being understood that no affiliate of Provider shall induce any Employee
to leave the employment of the Provider prior to the expiration of the Term
(as defined below)). At the end of the Term, the Partnership shall assume each
Transition Service and Providers obligations hereunder shall terminate
without notice to, or action by, any Party. 2\. Term; Termination of Transition Services. The term of this Agreement
will commence on the Effective Date and, subject to earlier termination as
provided in this _Section_ __ _ 2_, will continue until April 30, 2018 (the "
_Initial_ _Term_ "); _provided_ , that the Partnership shall have the right
to elect to extend the term of this Agreement for up to three consecutive
additional 30-day periods (each, a " _Renewal Term_ " and collectively, the "
_Renewal Terms_ ") by providing written notice of such election to Provider
not less than five days prior to the expiration of the Initial Term or such
Renewal Term, as applicable. The Initial Term and the Renewal Term(s)
(if any) are collectively referred to as the " _Term_." The Partnership may
terminate any one or more of the specific Transition Services (in part or in
its entirety) contemplated hereby by giving Provider at least three days
prior written notice to that effect in the manner provided in this Agreement
(and such termination shall not affect any other remaining Transition Services
to the Partnership). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, the termination or expiration of this Agreement will not affect
either Partys respective rights or obligations that are vested pursuant to
this Agreement as of the effective date of such termination or expiration
(including rights or obligations with respect to payment and remedies for
breach of this Agreement). In addition, the following provisions of this
Agreement will survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement:
_Sections_ _1_ and _3_ through _1_ _7_.

 

3\. Standard of Performance. In providing the Transition Services to the
Partnership, Provider will perform the Transition Services as contemplated
hereby in a good, workmanlike and professional manner with at least the same
priority as Provider accords its own operations. Furthermore, Provider, in
providing Transition Services, will comply with all applicable Laws.

 

4\. Compensation; Invoicing.

 

a. During the Term, the Partnership shall (i) pay Provider a fee of (A)
$31,000 per month during the Initial Term (pro-rated for any partial months),
_provided_ that, effective as of the date that either the Financial Provider
or Accounting Provider is no longer employed by Provider, such fee shall be
reduced to $15,500 per month (pro-rated for any partial months); _provided_
_further_ , that effective as of the date that neither the Financial Provider
nor the Accounting Provider is employed by Provider, such fee shall be
reduced to $0, and (B) $81,000 during each Renewal Term (if applicable) (pro-
rated for any partial months), ___provided_ that, effective as of the date
that either the Financial Provider or Accounting Provider is no longer
employed by Provider, such fee shall be reduced to $40,500 per month (pro-
rated for any partial months); _provided_ _further_ , that effective as of the
date that neither the Financial Provider nor the Accounting Provider is
employed by Provider, such fee shall be reduced to $0 (each of (A) or (B), a "
_Monthly Fee_ "), plus (ii) reimburse Provider for any and all
reasonable, documented, out-of-pocket costs, fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the provision of the Transition Services in accordance with
this Agreement (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "); _provided_ , _however_ ,
Provider shall not be entitled to any reimbursement for any costs, fees and
expenses incurred by Provider for the employment of personnel by Provider and
any other overhead costs incurred by Provider (including any salary,
benefits, bonuses or other compensation related thereto) in respect of the
provision of the Transition Services. Promptly following the end of each
calendar month, Provider will invoice the Partnership for the Expense
Reimbursement and the applicable Monthly Fee. All invoices for the Expense
Reimbursement shall contain a description of, and documentation supporting the
incurrence of, the costs, fees and expenses 

 



2  included therein, a calculation of the amounts due and such other
information and supporting documentation reasonably required by the
Partnership in order to substantiate the Expense Reimbursement. The
Partnership shall pay all undisputed amounts set forth on any such invoice
with respect to the Expense Reimbursement and the Monthly Fee within thirty
days following the date of receipt of such invoice.

 

i. From the Effective Date until one year after the expiration of the Term or
termination of this Agreement, whichever occurs earlier, the Partnership or
its designee, upon prior written notice to Provider, shall have the right, at
the Partnerships sole cost and expense, to conduct not more than one audit of
the books and records of Provider or its affiliates insofar as they pertain
to the Expense Reimbursement in respect of the Transition Services for the
purpose of determining the accuracy of Providers invoices provided to the
Partnership, to object to the amounts set forth therein, and to an adjustment
of those amounts if an error is finally determined to have occurred.

ii. If the Partnership, in good faith, disputes any portion of any
amount payable by it to Provider in respect of the Expense Reimbursement
pursuant to this Agreement, then the Partnership shall notify Provider of such
dispute on or before the due date for the applicable invoice and may withhold
payment for the disputed portion until the dispute is resolved. Any dispute
that is not resolved after good faith discussions between the Parties with
respect thereto shall be subject to _Section_ _s 8_ and _9_.

 

b. The amounts set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 4_ constitute the entire cost
to the Partnership for the Transition Services rendered by Provider under
this Agreement.

5\. Independent Contractor Status. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, for all purposes of this Agreement, Provider
will be and act as an independent contractor of the Partnership. Nothing
contained in this Agreement will be construed to imply or constitute a
partnership, joint venture, principal-agent or employer-employee relationship
between Provider and the Partnership. Provider will not, and will have no
power to, create any obligation, express or implied, on behalf of the
Partnership. The Partnership is contracting with Provider for the Transition
Services and Provider reserves the right to determine the method, manner and
means by which the Transition Services will be performed consistent with the
requirements of this Agreement; _provided_ that with respect to any
Transition Services that are similar to services that were provided by
Providers employees or Current Employee prior to the Effective Date, Provider
shall cause such Transition Services to be provided by such Current Employees
so long as they remain employed by Provider and shall not engage any third
parties to provide such Transition Services without the prior written consent
of the Partnership (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed). Except as otherwise expressly agreed in writing by the
Partnership, Provider will furnish all labor, materials, equipment, insurance,
supplies, training and/or other goods and services necessary for the
performance of Providers obligations under this Agreement. Provider agrees
to pay all applicable taxes on the Expense Reimbursement paid to it pursuant
to _Section_ __ _ 4_. Provider agrees that Provider (including, without
limitation, its personnel) will not be, and will not claim to be, eligible to
participate in, or receive benefits under, any employee benefit plans,
arrangements or policies of the Partnership including, but not limited to, any
plan, arrangement or policy providing bonus, vacation, stock options, stock
purchase, sick leave, disability, health or life

 



3  insurance, 401(k), retirement, profit sharing or similar benefits for the
Partnerships employees (collectively, " _Benefit Plans_ "). If Provider or
any of its personnel is later determined to have been a common-law employee
or employee of the Partnership for any purpose, Provider and its personnel
nevertheless will not be entitled to participate or receive benefits under
any Benefit Plan. Provider acknowledges that no insurance whatsoever,
including workers compensation insurance, has been or will be obtained by the
Partnership on Providers behalf.

 

6\. Confidentiality.

a. For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Confidential Information_ "
means, with respect to the Partnership, all information or materials obtained
or received by Provider from, through, by or on behalf of the Partnership
or its affiliates in connection with this Agreement. Provider agrees that the
Confidential Information is confidential trade secret information of the
Partnership or of third parties, and following the receipt of any Confidential
Information, Provider will maintain the Confidential Information in strict
confidence and not use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as
expressly set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6_.

 

b. Provider may use the Confidential Information only to the limited extent
necessary to perform the Transition Services under this Agreement for the
benefit of the Partnership and for no other purpose, commercial or otherwise.
Provider may not disclose the Confidential Information to any third party
without the prior written consent of the Partnership; _provided_ , that
Provider may disclose the Confidential Information to its personnel, who need
to know such information in order to assist Provider in the performance of the
Transition Services for the benefit of the Partnership, each of whom must be
bound by confidentiality obligations no less restrictive than those set forth
in this Agreement with respect to the Confidential Information. Provider
agrees to use the same degree of care to prevent any unauthorized use or
disclosure of the Confidential Information as it uses to protect its own
confidential information of like importance, but in no event will Provider use
less than reasonable care.

c. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality and nonuse will not apply to
any information or materials to the extent such information or materials (i)
are or subsequently become generally and readily available to the public
without breach of this Agreement; (ii) were or subsequently are rightfully
obtained by Provider from a third party who had the right to disclose the same
without obligations of confidentiality or nonuse; or (iii) were independently
developed by Provider. The foregoing obligations of confidentiality will not
prohibit Provider from disclosing any information or materials to the extent
that Provider is required to do so by governmental or judicial order,
_provided_ , that, to the extent legally permissible and reasonably
practicable, Provider gives the Partnership prior written notice of such order
and the opportunity to limit such disclosure and complies with any protective
order (or equivalent) imposed on such disclosure.

 

d. Provider will immediately notify the Partnership of any unauthorized use or
disclosure of Confidential Information by its personnel of which it becomes
aware. Provider agrees to return to the Partnership, or to destroy (and, if
requested by the Partnership, to confirm such destruction in writing to the
Partnership), all materials containing or embodying any Confidential
Information, regardless of the media and regardless of by whom prepared,
within five days after demand therefor by the Partnership or, in any event,
within five days after termination or expiration of this Agreement.

 



4 e. The obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 6_ shall terminate two years
after the date of the termination of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no termination of this Agreement shall release any obligations,
liabilities, rights and remedies of the Parties arising out of a breach of, or
failure to comply with this Agreement by such Party occurring prior to such
termination.

7\. Indemnity.

 

a. The Partnership assumes sole responsibility for and hereby agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Provider, its affiliates and its and
their respective directors, officers, owners, employees, agents,
representatives, contractors, subcontractors, successors and assigns
(collectively, " _Provider Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and
all claims, causes of action, losses, demands, costs, expenses, penalties or
liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees (collectively, " _Losses_ ")
arising out of or resulting from the performance of (or failure to perform)
the Transition Services pursuant to this Agreement, including, without
limitation, for (i) the gross negligence or the intentional or willful
misconduct of any of the Partnership Indemnified Persons (as defined below),
(ii) personal injury, death or bodily harm or damage or destruction of
physical property of any kind of any of the Partnership Indemnified Persons or
(iii) the intentional breach of this Agreement by the Partnership Indemnified
Persons, in each case, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LOSSES ARE THE RESULT OF OR
CAUSED BY THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER
FAULT OF ANY OF PROVIDER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, _EXCEPT_ TO THE EXTENT SUCH
LOSSES RESULT FROM (X) THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR THE INTENTIONAL OR WILLFUL
MISCONDUCT OF ANY OF PROVIDER INDEMNIFIED PERSONS OR (Y) THE INTENTIONAL
BREACH OF THIS AGREEMENT BY ANY PROVIDER INDEMNIFIED PERSON. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, any Provider Indemnified Person entitled to
receive indemnification under this _Section_ __ _ 7(a)_ shall act in good
faith and use its reasonable efforts to mitigate the amount of any Losses for
which it seeks indemnification, including making a good faith effort to
recover from insurers under applicable insurance policies and from other
Persons who may be liable so as to reduce the amount of any Losses hereunder.
If the amount of any Losses at any time subsequent to the making of an
indemnity payment in respect thereof, is reduced by recovery, settlement or
otherwise under or pursuant to any insurance coverage, or pursuant to any
claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other Person, the
amount of such reduction, less any costs, or expenses incurred in connection
therewith, will promptly be repaid by the Provider Indemnified Persons to the
Partnership.

b. Subject to  _Section_ __ _ 8_, Provider assumes sole responsibility for
and hereby agrees to indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the
Partnership, its affiliates, and its and their respective directors, officers,
owners, employees, controlling persons, agents, representatives, contractors,
subcontractors, successors and assigns (collectively, " _Partnership
Indemnified Persons_ ") from and against any and all Losses arising out of or
resulting from (i) the gross negligence or the intentional or willful
misconduct of any of Provider Indemnified Persons or (ii) the intentional
breach of this Agreement by Provider Indemnified Persons, in each 

 



5  case, arising out of, resulting from or in any way incident to or in
connection with the performance of (or failure to perform) the Transition
Services pursuant to this Agreement, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER SUCH LOSSES ARE
THE RESULT OF OR CAUSED BY THE SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY OR OTHER FAULT OF ANY OF PARTNERSHIP INDEMNIFIED PERSONS, EXCEPT TO
THE EXTENT SUCH LOSSES RESULT FROM THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR THE INTENTIONAL OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT OF ANY OF PARTNERSHIP INDEMNIFIED PERSONS.

8\. Limitations on Liability. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in no event shall Providers aggregate liability under this Agreement
as of any date exceed the aggregate amount of all Expense Reimbursement plus
each Monthly Fee received by Provider as of such date (collectively, the "
_Received Amounts_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that for the purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 8_, the aggregate amount of Received Amounts as of any such
date shall at all times be deemed to be an amount not less than $100,000.
EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO CLAIMS BY A THIRD PARTY, IN NO EVENT WILL A PARTY BE
LIABLE TO ANY OTHER PARTY WITH RESPECT TO ANY MATTER ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, UNDER ANY EQUITY, COMMON LAW, TORT, CONTRACT,
ESTOPPEL, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY OR OTHER THEORY, FOR ANY CONSEQUENTIAL,
SPECIAL, PUNITIVE OR INDIRECT DAMAGES (INCLUDING ANY DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
LOSS OF SALES, BUSINESS, PROFITS, USE, DATA, OPPORTUNITY, ECONOMIC ADVANTAGE
OR GOODWILL), EVEN IF THE REMEDIES PROVIDED FOR IN THIS AGREEMENT FAIL OF
THEIR ESSENTIAL PURPOSE AND EVEN IF THE HARMING PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF ANY OF THE FOREGOING DAMAGES.

 

9\. Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial

 

a. This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement) will be governed by, and
construed in accordance with, the Laws of the State of Delaware applicable to
Contracts executed in and to be performed entirely within that State.

 

b. By execution and delivery of this Agreement, each Party irrevocably agrees
that any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and
obligations arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any
judgment in respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising
hereunder brought by the other Party hereto or its successors or assigns, will
be brought and determined exclusively in the Delaware Court of Chancery and
any state appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (or, if the
Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, any state or federal court within the State of Delaware). Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such Proceeding for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement in any court other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably

 



6  waives, and agrees not to assert as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in
any Proceeding with respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
9(b)_, (ii) any claim that it or its property is exempt or immune from the
jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such
courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment,
attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of judgment or
otherwise) and (iii) to the fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law,
any claim that (x) the Proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient
forum, (y) the venue of such Proceeding is improper or (z) this Agreement, or
the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts.

c. EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT
MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR
INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT CONTEMPLATED HEREBY
OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE,
AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE,
THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO
ENFORCE EITHER OF SUCH WAIVERS, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVERS, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVERS VOLUNTARILY, AND
(IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 9(C)_.

10\. Severability. The provisions of this Agreement will be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision will not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application of such provision to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision will be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far
as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances will not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor will such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application of such provision, in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

11\. Delays. Any delay or inability of a Party in complying with the terms
hereof (other than the Partnerships payment obligations under _Section_ __ _
4(a)_) arising from unforeseeable causes beyond the control and without the
fault or negligence of that Party, including but not restricted to, acts of
God, acts of public enemy, acts of the government in either sovereign or
contractual capacity, fires, floods, or strikes (but not including delays of
subcontractors or suppliers), shall excuse any delay in the performance of
that Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that the 

 



7  Party failing to perform uses all reasonable diligence to remedy such
failure as promptly as practicable and gives immediate written notice to the
other of any delay, whether excusable as set forth above or otherwise, and
shall fully inform the other Party of the nature of the delay and the expected
duration and consequences thereof.

 

12\. Headings. The headings of the sections of this Agreement have been

exercise of any other right, power, or remedy, and (by way of example but not
of limitation) the grant of any injunctive relief shall not preclude or limit
the right to any monetary relief.

 

15\. Binding Effect; Assignment; Third-Party Beneficiaries. Neither this
Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations hereunder will be
assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the
Parties without the prior written consent of the other Party. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this _Section_
__ _ 15_ will be null and void. Except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7_
with respect to Persons entitled to indemnification thereunder, nothing in
this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person.

 

16\. Counterpart Execution. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which will be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together will constitute one and the same agreement) and will become effective
when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the Parties and
delivered to the other Party.

 

17\. Non-Recourse. Any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of, or
related to this Agreement may only be brought against Persons that are
expressly named as Parties, and then only with respect to the specific
obligations set forth herein. No former, current or future direct or indirect
equityholders, controlling Persons, stockholders, directors, officers,
employees, members, managers, agents, trustees, affiliates, general or limited

_Section_ __ _ 15_) or of any former, current 

 



9  or future direct or indirect equityholder, controlling Person, stockholder,
director, officer, employee, member, manager, agent, trustee, affiliate,
general or limited partner or assignee of any of the foregoing (collectively,

or obligation for any of the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements, obligations or liabilities of any Party under this Agreement or
for any Proceeding based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereunder (including the breach, termination or failure to
consummate any of the transactions contemplated hereunder), in each case
whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of
any assessment, by any legal or equitable Proceeding, by virtue of any
