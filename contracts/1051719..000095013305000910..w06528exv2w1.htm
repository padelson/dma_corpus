<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">Shares shall be deemed to have been converted as of the Effective Time into, and to
have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger Consideration as provided
in Section&nbsp;2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent
shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with
respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without the
prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the foregoing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;SECTION 2.02. <U>Exchange of Certificates.</U> (a) <U>Paying Agent.</U> Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably satisfactory to the Company
to act as paying agent (the &#147;<U>Paying Agent</U>&#148;) for the payment of the Merger Consideration
upon surrender of Certificates. Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement in form and
substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to
the Paying Agent at the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common
Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c) (such
cash being hereinafter referred to as the &#147;<U>Exchange Fund</U>&#148;).



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) <U>Exchange Procedure.</U> As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or
certificates (the &#147;<U>Certificates</U>&#148;) that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c), (i)&nbsp;a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other
provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii)&nbsp;instructions for use in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender
of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal,
duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the
holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash
into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.01(c) and certain dividends and other distributions in
respect of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section&nbsp;2.02(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common
Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a
person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to
a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of
Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section&nbsp;2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent
only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration and certain dividends or
other distributions in accordance with Section

Certificate.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) <U>No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock.</U> The Merger Consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this Article&nbsp;II upon surrender of any Certificate shall be
deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company
Common Stock, <U>subject</U>, <U>however</U>, to the Surviving Corporation&#146;s obligation to pay
any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that
may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at
the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common
Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason,
they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article&nbsp;II.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) <U>Termination of Exchange Fund.</U> Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains
undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 12&nbsp;months after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore
complied with this Article&nbsp;II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for
Merger Consideration.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) <U>No Liability.</U> None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund properly
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Law.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) <U>Investment of Exchange Fund.</U> The Parent may cause the Paying Agent to invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. In no case, however, shall
any such investment or any such payment of interest delay the receipt by holders of Certificates of
the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders&#146; rights hereunder.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g) <U>Lost Certificates.</U> If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon
the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen
or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable
amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect thereto, without interest.

domestic or foreign) tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the
appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the shares of Company Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

Plan or materially increase the costs relating thereto or require security under Section&nbsp;307 of
ERISA. Each Company Pension Plan has complied since its inception, or has been timely amended to
comply, with the requirements of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001.
All Company Benefit Plans required or permitted to have been approved by any non-U.S. Governmental
Entity have been so approved, no such approval has been revoked (nor, to the knowledge of the

(including any obligations to advance funds for expenses) the current or former directors or
officers of the Company (each, an &#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) for acts or omissions by such

less advantageous) with respect to claims arising from or related to facts or events which occurred
at or before the Effective Time; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that Parent shall not be

300% of the most recent annual premium paid prior to the date of this Agreement (such 300% amount,

be obtained at an annual premium in excess of the Maximum Premium, Parent shall maintain the most
advantageous policies of directors&#146; and officers&#146; insurance obtainable for an annual premium equal
to the Maximum Premium. The Company represents to Parent that the Maximum Premium is $3,181,908.
