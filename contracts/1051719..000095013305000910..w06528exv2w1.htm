 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER dated as of March 6, 2005, among BAE SYSTEMS NORTH AMERICA INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), UTE ACQUISITION COMPANY INC., a Delaware corporation (" _Sub_ ") and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent, and UNITED DEFENSE INDUSTRIES, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ ").   

 WHEREAS the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved Parents acquisition of the Company on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;    

 WHEREAS the respective boards of directors of Parent, Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the merger of Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Company Common Stock_ ") not owned by Parent, Sub or the Company or any of their respective subsidiaries shall be converted into the right to receive $75.00 in cash; and    

 WHEREAS Parent, Sub and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger.    

 NOW, THEREFORE, the parties hereto agree as follows:    

ARTICLE I    

 _The Merger_     

 SECTION 1.01. _The Merger._ On the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ "), Sub shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of Sub shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). At the election of Parent, any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Parent may be substituted for Sub as a constituent corporation in the Merger. In such event, the parties shall execute an appropriate amendment to this Agreement in order to reflect the foregoing.    

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019 at 10:00 a.m. on the second business day following the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted by Law, waiver by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof) of all the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than any condition that by its nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing, but subject to satisfaction of any such condition), or at such other place, time and date as shall be agreed in writing between Parent and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that if all the conditions set forth     ##### 

  

     

 2   

in Article VII shall not have been satisfied (or, to the extent permitted by
Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits thereof) on such
second business day, then the Closing will take place on the first business
day on which all such conditions shall have been satisfied (or, to the extent
permitted by Law, waived by the party or parties entitled to the benefits
thereof). The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this
Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."    

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Prior to the Closing, the parties shall prepare, and on the Closing Date or as soon as practicable thereafter shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a certificate of merger or other appropriate documents (in any such case, the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings or recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such time as the Certificate of Merger is duly filed with such Secretary of State, or at such other time as Parent and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger (the time the Merger becomes effective being the " _Effective Time_ ").    

 SECTION 1.04. _Effects._ The Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 259 of the DGCL.    

 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be amended at the Effective Time to read in the form of Exhibit A, and, as so amended, such certificate of incorporation shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.    

 (b) The Bylaws of Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.    

 SECTION 1.06. _Directors._ The directors of Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be.    

 SECTION 1.07. _Officers._ The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation, until the earlier of their resignation or removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified, as the case may be.     #####

ARTICLE II    

 _Effect on the Capital Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange of Certificates_     

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of Sub:     

 (a) _Capital Stock of Sub._ Each issued and outstanding share of capital stock of Sub shall be converted into and become one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.    

 (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is owned by the Company, Parent, Sub or by any of their respective wholly owned subsidiaries shall automatically be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered or deliverable in exchange therefor.    

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ (1) Subject to Sections 2.01(b) and 2.01(d), each issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive $75.00 in cash.

and to have become exchangeable solely for the right to receive, Merger
Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall serve prompt
notice to Parent of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of any
shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to

Parent will enter into a paying agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company. Parent shall provide, or cause to be provided to the Paying Agent at the Effective Time, cash necessary to pay for the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c) (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").    

 (b) _Exchange Procedure._ As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock that were converted into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.01(c), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Certificate for cancelation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Certificate shall have been converted pursuant to Section 2.01(c) and certain dividends and other distributions in respect of Company Common Stock in accordance with Section 2.02(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration and certain dividends or other distributions in accordance with Section     ##### 

  

     

 5   

2.02(c). No interest shall be paid or accrue on the cash payable upon
surrender of any Certificate.    

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II upon surrender of any Certificate shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time, and after the Effective Time there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.    

 (d) _Termination of Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of Company Common Stock who has not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of its claim for Merger Consideration.    

 (e) _No Liability._ None of Parent, Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund properly delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.    

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Parent may cause the Paying Agent to invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by Parent, on a daily basis. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to Parent. In no case, however, shall any such investment or any such payment of interest delay the receipt by holders of Certificates of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders rights hereunder.    

 (g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will pay in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration with respect thereto, without interest.    

 (h) _Withholding Rights._ Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any holder of Company Common Stock pursuant to this Agreement such      ##### 

  

     

 6   

amounts as may be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of any supranational, national,
federal, state, provincial, local or municipal (whether domestic or foreign)
tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to
the appropriate taxing authority by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common
Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, as applicable.

Recommendation Change or (ii) solely in response to a Superior Proposal that
did not result from a breach of this Section 5.02, cause the Company (x) to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) and (y) immediately

containing the terms of a Superior Proposal; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that

written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board
intends to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.01(f) and

any material amendment to the financial terms or other terms of any Superior
Proposal shall require a new written notice by the Company and (y) no such
termination of this Agreement by the Company may be made until two business

of no force or effect, unless the Company shall have complied with all
applicable requirements of Section 6.07(b) (including the payment of
the Termination Fee in accordance with the requirements thereof) in
connection with such Superior Proposal. In determining whether to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or to terminate this Agreement as described in
this Section 5.02(b), the Company Board shall take into account any changes
to the financial and other terms of this Agreement proposed by Parent in
