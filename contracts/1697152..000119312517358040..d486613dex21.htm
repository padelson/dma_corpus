Parent&#146;s public stockholders (including overallotment shares acquired by Parent&#146;s underwriters) (the &#147;<B><I>Public Stockholders</I></B>&#148;) and that, except as otherwise described in the IPO Prospectus, Parent may disburse monies

the Company further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and enforceable against the Company and each of its Affiliates under applicable Law. To the extent the Company or any of its Affiliates commences any action or proceeding
based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of any matter relating to the Parent or its Representatives, which proceeding seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the Parent or its Representatives, the Company hereby
