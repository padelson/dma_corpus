within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a);

WHEREAS, the Parent on or about the date hereof has obtained commitments from
certain investors for a private placement of Parent Common Shares (as defined

WHEREAS, certain capitalized terms used herein are defined in _Article XII_
hereof.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises set forth above, which are
incorporated in this Agreement as if fully set forth below, and the
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement, and intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties hereto agree
as follows:

 

ARTICLE I

_MERGERS_  

1.1 _Mergers_.

(a)  _The First Merger_. At the Effective Time, and subject to and upon the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the applicable
provisions of the DGCL, Merger Sub I and the Company shall consummate the
First Merger, pursuant to which Merger Sub I shall be merged with and into
the Company, following which the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub I
shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation. The
Company, as the surviving corporation after the First Merger, is hereinafter
sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Corporation_ " (provided, that
references to the Company for periods after the Effective Time until the
Second Effective Time shall include the Surviving Corporation).

(b) _The Second Merger_. At the Second Effective Time, and subject to and upon
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DLLCA, the Surviving Corporation shall be merged
with and into Merger Sub II, and the separate existence of the Surviving
Corporation shall cease and Merger Sub II will continue as the surviving
entity. Merger Sub II, as the surviving entity after the Second Merger, is
hereinafter sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Entity_ " (provided,
that references to the Company or the Surviving Corporation for periods after
the Second Effective Time shall include the Surviving Entity).

1.2 _Effective Time_. The Parties hereto shall cause the First Merger to be
consummated by filing a certificate of merger for the merger of Merger Sub I
with and into the Company (the " _Certificate of First Merger_ ") with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the DGCL (the time of such filing, or the later effective time
of the merger as specified in the Certificate of Merger, being the "
_Effective Time_ "). As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, but
no later than one (1) Business Day following the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Second Merger to be consummated by filing a certificate of merger
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _Certificate of
Second Merger_ " and together with the Certificate of First Merger, the "
_Certificates of Merger_ "), in accordance with the relevant provisions of the
DGCL and the Delaware Limited Liability Company Act (the " _DLLCA_ ") (the
time of such filing, or the later effective time of the Second Merger as
specified in the Certificate of Second Merger, being the " _Second
Effective Time_ ").

1.3 _Effect of the Mergers_.

 

(a) At the Effective Time, the effect of the First Merger shall be as provided
in this Agreement, the Certificate of First Merger and the applicable
provisions of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities, duties and obligations
of Merger Sub I and the Company shall become the property, rights,
privileges, agreements, powers and franchises, debts, Liabilities, duties and
obligations of the Surviving Corporation, which shall include the assumption
by the Surviving Corporation of any and all agreements, covenants, duties and
obligations of Merger Sub I and the Company set forth in this Agreement to be
performed after the Effective Time.

 

(b) At the Second Effective Time, the effect of the Second Merger shall be as
provided in this Agreement, the Certificate of Second Merger and the
applicable provisions of the DLLCA. Without limiting the

 



2  generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Second Effective
Time, all the property, rights, privileges, agreements, powers and franchises,
debts, Liabilities, duties and obligations of Merger Sub II and the Surviving
Corporation shall become the property, rights, privileges, agreements, powers
and franchises, debts, Liabilities, duties and obligations of the Surviving
Entity, which shall include the assumption by the Surviving Entity of any and
all agreements, covenants, duties and obligations of Merger Sub II and the
Surviving Corporation set forth in this Agreement to be performed after the
Second Effective Time.

 

1.4 _Tax Treatment_.

(a) For U.S. federal and applicable state and local income tax purposes, the
Mergers together are intended to constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The Parties adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations and will take no action
(and will not fail to take any action) that would reasonably be expected to
cause the Mergers to fail to qualify as a reorganization.

(b) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement, the allocation of Total
Consideration as among cash and Parent Common Shares allocable to Company
Securityholders shall be adjusted, by decreasing the cash portion and
correspondingly increasing the portion of Total Consideration paid in Parent
Common Shares, if and to the extent necessary to assure that the Company
Securityholders receive sufficient Parent Common Shares such that, when
aggregated with Parent Common Shares previously paid as Total Consideration to
the Company Securityholders (if any), the amount of Parent Common Shares is
not less than the minimum amount of Parent Common Shares necessary to satisfy
the requirements for qualification as a reorganization under Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code.

 

1.5 _Organizational Documents_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Company as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall cease and the certificate of incorporation and by-laws
of Merger Sub I as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be
the charter documents of the Surviving Corporation. At the Second
Effective Time, the certificate of formation and operating agreement of
Merger Sub II as in effect immediately prior to the Second Effective Time
shall be the certificate of formation and operating agreement of the Surviving
Entity until thereafter amended in accordance with its terms and as provided
by applicable Law, except that the name of the Surviving Entity in such
certificate of formation and operating agreement shall be amended to be "C1
Investment LLC".

 

1.6 _Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation Entity_. Immediately
after the Effective Time, the board of directors and executive officers of
the Surviving Corporation shall be the board of directors and executive
officers of the Parent after giving effect to _Section 6.17_. Immediately
after the Second Effective Time, the executive officers of the Surviving
Entity shall be the executive officers of the Parent after giving effect to
_Section 6.17_.

1.7 _Merger Consideration_. Subject to and upon the terms and conditions of
this Agreement:

(a) The aggregate consideration to be paid to the Company Securityholders at
the Closing (subject to adjustment in accordance with _Section 1.12_)
pursuant to the Mergers (the " _Merger Consideration_ ") shall be equal to an
amount equal to (i) the Enterprise Value, minus (ii) the Closing
Indebtedness, plus (iii) the Closing Cash, plus (iv) the Net Acquisition
Amount, if any (which such amount of Merger Consideration, for the avoidance
of doubt, includes the Deferred PIPE Closing Amount to be paid after the
Closing for the Deferred Payment in accordance with _Section 1.7(e)_ below).
Additionally, the Company Securityholders will have the contingent right to
receive the Earnout Payments (together with the Merger Consideration, the "
_Total Consideration_ ") after the Closing in accordance with _Article II_
below.

(b) Subject to the application of _Section 1.4(b)_, the Merger Consideration
will be paid in the form of: (i) cash from the Parent and/or the Target
Companies (the " _Cash Consideration_ ") in an amount equal to (A) the total
cash and cash equivalents of Parent, including funds from the PIPE Investment
and the remaining funds in the Trust Account, after giving effect to the
completion of the Redemption (but for the avoidance of doubt before 

 



3  giving effect to the payment of Transaction Expenses or Sponsor Loans paid
at or in connection with the Closing in accordance with _Section 6.18)_ (the
amount in this clause (A), the " _Parent Cash_ "), plus (B) the Permitted
Closing Cash, minus (C) Twenty-Five Million U.S. Dollars ($25,000,000); (ii) a
number of Parent Common Shares, valued at the Redemption Price per share,
equal to (A) the Merger Consideration, minus (B) the Cash Consideration,
minus (C) the Deferred PIPE Closing Amount (the " _Stock Consideration_ ");
and (iii) a deferred payment equal to the Deferred PIPE Closing Amount (the "
_Deferred Payment_ ") to be paid upon the consummation of the Deferred PIPE
Closing in accordance with _Section 1.7(e)_ below.

 

(c) Each Company Securityholder shall be entitled to receive such Company
Securityholders respective Pro Rata Share of the Cash Consideration, the
Stock Consideration, the Deferred Payment, the Earnout Cash Payments and the
Earnout Stock Payments. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, solely for purposes of calculating each
Company Securityholders Pro Rata Share of the Merger Consideration or any
component thereof, including the Cash Consideration, the Stock Consideration
and the Deferred Payment (but for the avoidance of doubt, not the aggregate
Merger Consideration, or any component thereof, payable by the Parent), the
aggregate exercise price of all issued and outstanding Company Options as of
the Effective Time shall be added to the Merger Consideration.

 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 1.7_, the Merger
Consideration is subject to any post-Closing adjustments to the Merger
Consideration pursuant to _Section 1.12_ or adjustments pursuant to _Section
1.13_.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Parties acknowledge and agree that a portion of the Merger Consideration equal
to the Deferred PIPE Closing Amount is being deferred at the Closing and will
not be paid until the Deferred PIPE Closing is consummated in accordance with
the Deferred PIPE Closing Agreement. Within three (3) Business Days after the
consummation of the Deferred PIPE Closing, the Parent will pay the Deferred
PIPE Closing Amount in cash to the Company Securityholders as the Deferred
Payment hereunder. In the event that the PIPE Investor for the Deferred PIPE
Closing defaults on the Deferred PIPE Closing Agreement and does not
consummate the Deferred PIPE Closing in accordance with the terms thereof,
and such default continues for a period of five (5) Business Days thereafter,
the Parent shall, in lieu of the cash payment for the Deferred Payment
hereunder and in satisfaction of its obligations with respect to the Deferred
Payment, instead issue to the Company Securityholders the Parent Common
Shares that the Parent was otherwise required to issue to the PIPE Investor at
the Deferred PIPE Closing under the Deferred PIPE Closing Agreement if such
PIPE Investor had closed thereunder in accordance with the terms thereof.

(f) Notwithstanding the foregoing in this _Section 1.7_, in the event that
it is reasonably expected by the Parties that immediately after the Closing,
the Company Securityholders in the aggregate would fail to own at least 50.1%
of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the Parent, the Seller
Representative shall (in its sole discretion) have the option at any time
prior to the Closing to increase the amount of Stock Consideration and
decrease the amount of Cash Consideration (proportionately so as to maintain
the aggregate Merger Consideration as determined pursuant to _Section
1.7(b)_) to be delivered by the Parent to the Company Securityholders at the
Closing pursuant to this _Section 1.7_, in such amounts so that it is
reasonably expected by the Parties that immediately after the Closing, the
Company Securityholders in the aggregate would own at least 50.1% of the
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Parent.

 

1.8 _Effect of First Merger on Company Securities_. At the Effective Time, by
virtue of the First Merger and without any action on the part of any Party or
any Company Securityholder or the holders of any shares of capital stock of
the Parent or Merger Sub I:

(a)  _Company Stock_. Subject to clause (b) below, all shares of Company
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether
vested or unvested, will be cancelled and automatically deemed for all
purposes to represent the right to receive the Total Consideration, with each
Company Stockholder being entitled to receiving its Pro Rata Share of the
Closing Consideration (and thereafter the Deferred Payment, any additional
Parent Common Shares pursuant to  _Section 1.12_ and any Earnout Payments in
accordance with this

 



4  Agreement), without interest, upon surrender of their stock certificates
representing Company Stock (the " _Company Certificates_ ") (or a Lost
Certificate Affidavit) and delivery of the other Transmittal Documents
required under _Section 1.10_. As of the Effective Time, each Company
Stockholder shall cease to have any other rights in and to the Company or the
Surviving Corporation or Surviving Entity (other than the rights set forth in
_Section 1.13_ below).

(b) _Treasury Stock_. Notwithstanding clause (a) above or any other provision
of this Agreement to the contrary, at the Effective Time, if there are any
Company Securities that are owned by the Company as treasury shares or any
Company Securities owned by any direct or indirect Subsidiary of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, such Company Securities
shall be canceled and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof or
payment therefor.

 

(c) _Dissenting Shares_. Each of the Dissenting Shares issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be cancelled and cease to exist
in accordance with _Section 1.13_ and shall thereafter represent only the
right to receive the applicable payments set forth in _Section 1.13_.

 

(d) _Company Convertible Securities_.

 

(i) Each outstanding Company Convertible Security (other than Company
Options), (A) if not exercised or converted prior to such time, shall be
cancelled, retired and terminated and cease to represent a right to acquire,
be exchanged for or convert into shares of Company Stock or (B) if exercised
prior to such time, shall have the resulting shares of capital stock of
the Company issued upon such exercise treated as outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company, and such holders shall be considered Company
Stockholders for purposes of this Agreement. The Company shall, prior to the
Effective Time, take all actions as are necessary in order to effectuate the
actions contemplated by this _Section 1.8(d)_ and to ensure that no holder of
any Company Convertible Securities (other than Company Options) shall have any
rights from and after the Effective Time with respect to such Company
Convertible Securities; provided that such actions shall expressly be
conditioned upon the consummation of the Mergers and shall be of no force or
effect if this Agreement is terminated.

 

(ii) Each outstanding Company Option that is unvested as of the Effective Time
shall become fully vested and exercisable as of the Effective Time (each such
Company Option subject to such accelerated vesting, an " _Accelerated Option_
"). Each Company Option that is outstanding and unexercised as of the
Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive, with respect to
each share of Company Stock subject to such Company Option, and without
interest, (A) an amount of Merger Consideration equal to the Pro Rata Share of
the Merger Consideration applicable to such share of Company Stock subject to
such Company Option _minus_ the per-share exercise price of such Company
Option (for the avoidance of doubt, with the Merger Consideration determined
in accordance with Section 1.7(c)), which such amount of Merger Consideration
shall be payable (or issuable) in the forms and at the times set forth in
this Agreement as if the holder of such Company Option was a Company
Stockholder; and (B) the Pro Rata Share of Earnout Payments applicable to such
share of Company Stock subject to such Company Option, which Earnout Payments
shall be payable (or issuable) in the forms and at the times set forth in this
Agreement as if the holder of such Company Option was a Company Stockholder;
_provided, however,_ that in order to receive an installment of applicable
Pro Rata Share of the Earnout Payments associated with an Accelerated Option,
the holder of such Accelerated Option must be an employee, director or
consultant of Parent or the Surviving Entity or their respective Subsidiaries
at the time such installment is paid or issued, and must deliver a duly
executed Option Cancellation Agreement prior to the Closing accepting the
treatment of such Accelerated Option as set forth in this Agreement. All
consideration pursuant to this _Section 1.8(d)(ii)_ shall be processed
through Parents or the Surviving Corporations payroll system, and shall be
paid in accordance with standard payroll practices and subject to any required
withholding for applicable Taxes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
consideration will be payable or issuance with respect to a Company Option
unless the holder of such Company Option has made arrangements for payment of
withholding taxes with respect to such consideration, including payment of
additional cash to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, if the Cash
Consideration paid on a particular date is insufficient to provide for the
withholding with respect to such consideration.

 



5 1.9 _Effect of First Merger on Merger Sub I Stock; Effect of Second Merger on
Merger Sub II Membership Interests and Surviving Corporation Stock_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the First Merger and without any
action on the part of any Party or any Company Securityholder or the holders
of any shares of capital stock of the Parent or Merger Sub I, each Merger Sub
I Common Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
converted into an 

 



6  equal number of shares of common stock of the Surviving Corporation, with
the same rights, powers and privileges as the shares so converted and shall
constitute the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

(b) At the Second Effective Time, by virtue of the Second Merger and without
any action on the part of any Party or any Company Securityholder or the
holders of any shares of capital stock of the Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or Merger Sub II: (i) each share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation outstanding immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall
be canceled and shall cease to exist without any conversion thereof or payment
therefor; and (ii) each membership interest of Merger Sub II outstanding
immediately prior to the Second Effective Time shall be converted into a
membership interest of the Surviving Entity, with the rights as set forth in
the operating agreement of the Surviving Entity, and shall constitute the only
outstanding membership interests of the Surviving Entity.

 

1.10 _Surrender of Company Securities and Disbursement of Merger
Consideration_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 1.13_ and the provisions of this _Section 1.10_, at
the Effective Time, the Parent shall deliver, or cause to be delivered to the
Company Securityholders (the " _Closing Consideration_ "): (i) the Estimated
Cash Consideration and (ii) the Estimated Stock Consideration, with each
Company Securityholder receiving its Pro Rata Share of such Closing

Transmittal at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date to the
Company and the Parent.

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall send to each Company
Securityholder a letter of transmittal for use in such exchange in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (a " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") (which shall
specify that the delivery of share certificates in respect of the Stock
Consideration shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Company Certificates to the Company (or a Lost
Certificate Affidavit) for use in such exchange. The Estimated Stock
Consideration shall be delivered via book entry issuance.

(c) Each Company Securityholder shall be entitled to receive its Pro Rata
Share of the Closing Consideration in respect of the Company Stock represented
by the Company Certificate(s) (excluding any Company Securities described in
_Sections 1.8(b)_ or _1.8(c)_ ), as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, but subject to the prior delivery to the Company (with copies
to the Parent) of the following items (collectively, the " _Transmittal
Documents_ "): (i) for the Company Stockholders, the Company Certificate(s)
for its Company Stock (or a Lost Certificate Affidavit), together with a
properly completed and duly executed Letter of Transmittal and such other
documents as may be reasonably requested by the Company or the Parent, (ii) a
duly executed counterpart to the lock-up agreement with the Parent, effective
as of the Effective Time, substantially in the form attached as _Exhibit C_

holding shares of Company Class A Common Stock immediately prior to the
Effective Time, a duly executed counterpart to the Registration Rights
Agreement and (iv) for holders of Company Options (including vested Company
Options), a duly executed option cancellation agreement, effective as of the
Effective Time, in a form to be reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the
Company (each, an " _Option Cancellation Agreement_ "). Until so surrendered
and/or submitted (as applicable), each Company Security shall represent after
the Effective Time for all purposes only the right to receive the portion of
the Total Consideration attributable to such Company Security.

 

(d) If any portion of the Total Consideration is to be delivered or issued to
a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Company
Certificate is registered immediately prior to the Effective Time, it shall be
a condition to such delivery that (i) the transfer of such Company Stock shall
have been permitted in accordance with the terms of the
Companys Organizational Documents and the Companys Stockholders Agreement,
each as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, (ii) such Company
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form
for transfer and (iii) the recipient such

 



7  portion of the Total Consideration, or the Person in whose name such portion
of the Total Consideration is delivered or issued, shall have already executed
and delivered counterparts to the Lock-Up Agreement, Registration Rights
Agreement, if applicable, the Option Cancellation Agreement, if applicable,
and such other Transmittal Documents as are reasonably deemed necessary by the
Company or the Parent and (iv) the Person requesting such delivery shall pay
to the Parent any transfer or other Taxes required as a result of such
delivery to a Person other than the registered holder of such Company
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Company and the Parent
that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in the event
that any Company Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, in
lieu of delivery of a Company Certificate to the Company, the Company
Stockholder may instead deliver to the Company an affidavit of lost
certificate and indemnity of loss in form and substance reasonably acceptable
to the Parent and the Company (a " _Lost Certificate Affidavit_ "), which at
the reasonable discretion of the Parent may include a requirement that the
owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Certificate deliver a bond in
such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against the Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to the
shares of Company Stock represented by the Company Certificates alleged to
have been lost, stolen or destroyed. Any Lost Certificate Affidavit properly
delivered in accordance with this _Section 1.10(e)_ shall be treated as a
Company Certificate for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

(f) Any holders of Company Convertible Securities who have properly exercised
or converted their Company Convertible Securities into Company Stock prior to
the Effective Time but have not yet received Company Certificates in respect
thereof may in lieu of a Company Certificate deliver to the Company their
certificate or other instrument for the Company Convertible Securities and
other evidence that they have properly and timely exercised or converted
their Company Convertible Securities, along with a Lost Certificate Affidavit
and the other Transmittal Documents.

 

(g) After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Company Stock. If, after the Effective Time,
Company Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Parent, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the applicable portion of the
Total Consideration provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set
forth in this  _Section 1.10_. No dividends or other distributions declared
or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Parent Common Shares
with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any
Company Certificates that have not yet been surrendered with respect to the
Parent Common Shares to be issued upon surrender thereof until the holders of
record of such Company Certificates shall surrender such certificates (or
provide a Lost Certificate Affidavit in lieu thereof) and provide the other
Transmittal Documents. Subject to applicable Law, following surrender of any
such Company Certificates (or delivery of a Lost Certificate Affidavit in lieu
thereof) and delivery of the other Transmittal Documents, Parent shall
promptly deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, the
certificates representing the Parent Common Shares issued in exchange therefor
and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date
after the Effective Time theretofore paid with respect to such Parent Common
Shares.

(h) All securities issued upon the surrender and cancellation of Company
Stock in accordance with the terms hereof, together with the right of the
holder thereof to receive such holders Pro Rata Share of each of the Closing
Consideration, the Deferred Payment, any additional Parent Common Shares
pursuant to _Section 1.12_ and any Earnout Payments, in each case, with
respect to such Company Stock, shall be deemed to have been issued in full
satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such Company Stock. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained herein, none of the Surviving Corporation,
the Parent or any Party hereto shall be liable to any Person for any amount
properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no fraction of
a Parent Common Share will be issued by virtue of the First Merger or the
transactions contemplated hereby, and each Person who would otherwise be
entitled to a fraction of a Parent Common Share (after aggregating all
fractional Parent Common

 



8  Shares that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall instead have
the number of Parent Common Shares issued to such Person rounded up in the
aggregate to the nearest whole Parent Common Share.

1.11 _Closing Calculations_.

 

(a) Not later than the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the Closing Date,
the Company shall deliver to the Parent a statement certified by the
Companys chief financial officer (the " _Estimated Company Statement_ ")
setting forth (i) an estimated consolidated balance sheet of the
Target Companies as of the Reference Time, prepared in good faith and in
accordance with the Accounting Principles, (ii) a good faith estimate, with
reasonably detailed calculation of the Permitted Closing Cash as of the
Closing (the " _Estimated Permitted Closing Cash_ ") and (iii) a good faith
estimate, with reasonably detailed calculations, of (A) the Closing
Indebtedness (the " _Estimated Closing Indebtedness_ "), (B) the Closing Cash
(the " _Estimated Closing Cash_ ") and (C) the Net Acquisition Amount (the "
_Estimated Net Acquisition Amount_ "), and the resulting estimated amount of
the Merger Consideration as of the Closing (the " _Estimated Merger
Consideration_ "); _provided_ , that the Company will consider in good faith
Parents comments to the Estimated Company Statement, and if any adjustments
are made to the Estimated Company Statement prior to the Closing, such
adjusted Estimated Company Statement shall thereafter become the Estimated
Company Statement for all purposes of this Agreement. The Estimated Company
Statement and the determinations contained therein shall be prepared in
accordance with the Accounting Principles and otherwise in accordance with
this Agreement.

(b) On the Business Day prior to the Closing Date, the Parent shall deliver
to the Company a statement certified by the Parents chief executive officer
(the " _Estimated Parent Statement_ ") setting forth a good faith estimate,
with reasonably detailed calculations, of (i) the Parent Cash as of the
Closing (the " _Estimated Parent Cash_ "), and (ii) the resulting estimates of
the Cash Consideration (the " _Estimated Cash Consideration_ "), Stock
Consideration (the " _Estimated Stock Consideration_ ") and Closing
Consideration based on the Estimated Parent Cash set forth in the Estimated
Parent Statement and the Estimated Merger Consideration, Estimated Closing
Cash and the Estimated Permitted Closing Cash set forth in the Estimated
Company Statement; _provided_ , that, the Parent will consider in good faith
the Companys comments to the Estimated Parent Statement, and if any
adjustments are made to the Estimated Parent Statement prior to the Closing,
such adjusted Estimated Parent Statement shall thereafter become the Estimated
Parent Statement for all purposes of this Agreement.

 

1.12 _Final Post-Closing Adjustments and Calculations_.

 

(a) Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the disinterested
independent directors of the Board of Directors of Parent, acting by majority
approval of such directors (the " _Parent Representative_ "), shall deliver to
the Seller Representative a statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth a good faith calculation of the Closing Indebtedness, the Closing Cash,
the Net Acquisition Amount and the resulting amount of Merger Consideration.
The Closing Statement shall be prepared, and the Closing Indebtedness, the
Closing Cash, the Net Acquisition Amount and the resulting
Merger Consideration shall be determined in accordance with the Accounting
Principles and otherwise in accordance with this Agreement. The Parent, the
Surviving Corporation and the Seller Representative shall, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to, cooperate with the Parent Representative
and its Representatives in the preparation of the Closing Statement, as
reasonably requested by the Parent Representative and its Representatives,
including providing reasonable access to the books, records, files,
facilities and personnel of the Target Companies. After delivery of the
Closing Statement, the Seller Representative and its Representatives shall be
permitted reasonable access at reasonable times to review the
Surviving Corporations and its Subsidiaries books, records and any work
papers to the extent such books, records and work papers are related to the
preparation of the Closing Statement. The Seller Representative and its
Representatives may make inquiries of the Parent Representative, the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives regarding questions concerning or disagreements with the
Closing Statement arising in the course of their review thereof, and the
Parent Representative, the Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall each use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
such Representative to cooperate with and respond to such inquiries. If the
Seller Representative has any objections to the Closing Statement, the Seller
Representative shall deliver to the Parent Representative a statement setting

 



9  forth its objections thereto (in reasonable detail) (an " _Objection
Statement_ "). If an Objection Statement is not delivered to the Parent
Representative within thirty (30) days following the date of delivery of the
Closing Statement, the Closing Statement, all determinations set forth
therein, and the resulting Final Merger Consideration set forth therein, shall
be final, binding and non-appealable by the Parties. If an Objection
Statement is delivered within such thirty (30) day period, the Seller
Representative and the Parent Representative shall negotiate in good faith to
resolve any such objections for a period of twenty (20) days thereafter. If
the Seller Representative and the Parent Representative do not reach a final
resolution within such twenty (20) day period, then upon the written request
of either the Parent Representative or the Seller Representative, the Parties
will refer the dispute to the Independent Expert for final resolution of the
dispute in accordance with _Section 1.12(b)_. The Parties acknowledge that
any information provided pursuant to this _Section 1.12_ will be subject to
the confidentiality obligations of _Section 6.14_.

(b) If a dispute with respect to the Closing Statement is submitted in
accordance with this _Section 1.12_ to the Independent Expert for final
resolution, the Parties will follow the procedures set forth in this _Section
1.12(b)_. Each of the Seller Representative and the Parent Representative
agrees to execute, if requested by the Independent Expert, a reasonable
engagement letter with respect to the determination to be made by the
Independent Expert. All fees and expenses of the Independent Expert will be
borne by the Parent. The Independent Expert will determine only those issues
still in dispute as of the Independent Expert Notice Date and the Independent
Experts determination will be based solely upon and consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The determination by the Independent Expert
will be based solely on presentations with respect to such disputed items by
the Parent Representative and the Seller Representative to the Independent
Expert and not on the Independent Experts independent review; provided, that
such presentations will be deemed to include any work papers, records,
accounts or similar materials delivered to the Independent Expert by the
Parent Representative or the Seller Representative in connection with such
presentations and any materials delivered to the Independent Expert in
response to requests by the Independent Expert. With respect to any disputed
item, the Independent Experts calculations shall be no greater than
the highest amount calculated with respect to such item by the Parent
Representative or the Seller Representative, as the case may be, and no lower
than the lowest amount calculated with respect to such item by the Parent
Representative or the Seller Representative, as the case may be. Each of the
Seller Representative and the Parent Representative will use their reasonable
efforts to make their respective presentations as promptly as practicable
following submission to the Independent Expert of the disputed items, and
each such Party will be entitled, as part of its presentation, to respond to
the presentation of the other Party and any questions and requests of the
Independent Expert. In deciding any matter, the Independent Expert will
be bound by the provisions of this Agreement, including this _Section 1.12_.
It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Independent Expert procedures
and the activities of the Independent Expert in connection herewith are not
(and should not be considered to be or treated as) an arbitration proceeding
or similar arbitral process and that no formal arbitration rules should be
followed (including rules with respect to procedures and discovery). The
Seller Representative and the Parent Representative will request that the
Independent Experts determination be made within forty-five (45) days after
its engagement, or as soon thereafter as possible, will be set forth in a
written statement delivered to the Parent Representative and the Seller
Representative and will be final, conclusive, non-appealable and binding for
all purposes hereunder (other than for Fraud or manifest error). The final
amount of the Merger Consideration as determined either pursuant to  _Section
1.12(a)_ or this _Section 1.12(b)_ is referred to herein as the " _Final
Merger Consideration_ ".

 

(c) For purposes hereof, the term " _Adjustment Amount_ " shall mean (x) the
Final Merger Consideration as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 1.12_, less (y) the Estimated Merger Consideration; provided, that,
in the event that the absolute value of the Adjustment Amount is less than Two
Million U.S. Dollars ($2,000,000), the Adjustment Amount shall be equal to
zero dollars ($0.00). If the Adjustment Amount is a positive number, then
within five (5) Business Days after the determination of the Final Merger
Consideration, the Parent shall issue to the Company Securityholders an
additional number of Parent Common Shares equal to the Adjustment Amount, with
each Parent Common Share valued at the Redemption Price (but subject to
_Section 1.10(i)_), with each Company Securityholder receiving its Pro Rata
Share of such additional Parent Common Shares. If the Adjustment Amount is a
negative amount, then within five (5) Business Days after the

 



10  determination of the Final Merger Consideration, the Company Securityholder,
based on each Company Securityholders Pro Rata Share, shall deliver to the
Parent a number of Parent Common Shares equal to the absolute value of the
Adjustment Amount, with each such Parent Common Share valued at the Redemption
Price. If any Company Securityholder fails to deliver their Parent Common
Shares to the Parent as required by this  _Section 1.12(c)_, then, at the
sole discretion of the Parent Representative and without limiting any other
rights of the Parent under this Agreement or any Ancillary Document or at law
or equity, the Parent Representative on behalf of the Parent may offset the
full amount to which the Parent is entitled, in whole or in part, by reducing
the amount of any payment or other obligation due to such Company
Securityholder pursuant to this Agreement or any Ancillary Document, including
any Earnout Payment. Additionally, each Company Securityholder in the Letter
of Transmittal shall appoint and authorize the Parent Representative as their
attorney-in-fact to transfer to Parent any Parent Common Shares as required by
this  _Section 1.12(c)_, and the Parent Representative may transfer such
equity and cancel the stock certificates for such equity on the Parents books
and records.

 

1.13 _Appraisal and Dissenter s Rights_. No Company Stockholder who has
validly exercised its appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL (a
" _Dissenting Stockholder_ ") with respect to its Company Stock (such shares,
" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall be entitled to receive any portion of the Total
Consideration with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting
Stockholder unless and until such Dissenting Stockholder shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost its appraisal rights under the DGCL. Each
Dissenting Stockholder shall be entitled to receive only the payment
resulting from the procedure set forth in Section 262 of the DGCL with respect
to the Dissenting Shares owned by such Dissenting Stockholder. The Company
shall give the Parent and the Parent Representative (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Laws that are received by the
Company relating to any Dissenting Stockholders rights of appraisal and (ii)
the opportunity to direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demand for appraisal under the DGCL. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of the Parent and the Parent Representative, voluntarily
make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal, offer to settle
or settle any such demands or approve any withdrawal of any such demands.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Dissenting Stockholders shall have no rights to any portion of the Total
Consideration with respect to any Dissenting Shares.

1.14 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the
purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation following the
First Merger and the Surviving Entity following the Second Merger with full
right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and the Merger Subs, the officers and
directors or members (as applicable) of the Company and the Merger Subs
are fully authorized in the name of their respective corporations or
otherwise to take, and will take, all such lawful and necessary action, so
long as such action is not inconsistent with this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE II _EARNOUT_

 

2.1 _Earnout Payments_.

(a) After the Closing, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
the Company Securityholders shall have the contingent right to receive
additional consideration from the Parent based on the performance of the
Parent if the requirements as set forth in this _Article II_ are achieved. In
the event that (i) EBITDA (measured at any applicable Measurement Date
occurring within calendar year 2018 and using the Measurement Methodologies)
exceeds One Hundred Forty-Four Million U.S. Dollars ($144,000,000) (the "
_2018 Target_ "), (ii) EBITDA (measured at any applicable Measurement Date
occurring within calendar year 2019 and using the Measurement Methodologies )
exceeds One Hundred Fifty-Five Million U.S. Dollars ($155,000,000) (the "
_2019 Target_ "), or (iii) EBITDA (measured at any applicable Measurement Date
occurring within calendar year 2020 using the Measurement Methodologies)
exceeds One Hundred Sixty-Five Million U.S. Dollars ($165,000,000) (the "
_2020 Target_ " and together with the 2018 Target and 2019 Target, the "
_Earnout Targets_ " and each of calendar years 2018, 2019 and 2020 an "
_Earnout Year_ "), in each case, at any time during the period beginning

 



11  on and including the Closing Date and ending on and including December 31,
2020 (the " _Earnout Period_ "), then for each Earnout Target that is achieved
as of a given Measurement Date, the Company Securityholders shall receive
additional consideration (in accordance with their respective Pro Rata Shares)
from the Parent (a " _Regular Earnout Payment_ ") of (A) Three Million Three
Hundred Thousand (3,300,000) Parent Common Shares (which shall be equitably
adjusted for stock splits, stock dividends, combinations, recapitalizations
and the like after the Closing) (an " _Earnout Stock Payment_ ") and (B) cash
in an amount equal to Thirty-Three Million U.S. Dollars ($33,000,000) (an "
_Earnout Cash Payment_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, the Company
Securityholders shall have the right to receive no more than three Regular
Earnout Payments during the Earnout Period, and the aggregate sum of all
Earnout Stock Payments and Earnout Cash Payments payable hereunder (assuming
all three Earnout Targets are achieved during the Earnout Period), shall be a
maximum of 9,900,000 Parent Common Shares and $99,000,000, respectively.

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that at the time that payment
of an Earnout Cash Payment is due pursuant to _Section 2.1(g)_, such Earnout
Cash Payment is an amount the payment of which would exceed either (A) the
amount of cash available to Parent (including by means of distribution from
its Subsidiaries) that is permitted to be distributed and paid (as applicable)
without breaching the terms of any agreement related to Indebtedness of Parent
or its Subsidiaries at the time such payment is due, including but not limited
to the Loan Agreements (such amount, the " _Permitted Agreement Payment
Amount_ "), or (B) the amount payable by Parent and its Subsidiaries without
causing the ratio of Indebtedness of Parent and its Subsidiaries (on
a consolidated basis) to EBITDA (as measured on the applicable Measurement
Date with respect to such Earnout Payment using the Measurement Methodologies,
and assuming full payment of the Earnout Cash Payment) to exceed 4.5 to 1
(such amount, the " _Permitted Leverage Payment Amount_ ," and the lesser of
(1) the Permitted Agreement Payment Amount and (2) the Permitted Leverage
Payment Amount, the " _Permitted Cash Payment_ "), then, with respect to the
portion of the Earnout Cash Payment in excess of the Permitted Cash Payment
(such portion, the " _Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall_ "), the Seller
Representative will (in its sole discretion and subject to  _Section 2.2_),
either (i) direct Parent to deliver to the Company Securityholders a number of
additional Parent Common Shares with a value equal to the Earnout Cash Payment
Shortfall, valued based on the Parent Share Price measured on the applicable
Measurement Date (provided, that, for any Measurement Date occurring prior to
the twenty-first (21st) Trading Day after and including the Closing Date, the
twenty (20) Trading Day period set forth in the definition of Parent Share
Price shall be shortened to that number of Trading Days beginning on and
including the Closing Date and ending on and including the Exchange Date) with
respect to such Earnout Payment (the " _Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall Parent
Shares_ "); or (ii) provide notice to Parent that it elects to defer payment
of the Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall until the following Measurement Date. In
the event that the Seller Representative elects to defer payment of the
Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall pursuant to subsection (ii) of the preceding
sentence, the Seller Representative shall have the option on each succeeding
Measurement Date until the end of the Earnout Period to elect to be paid the
applicable Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall Parent Shares in full satisfaction
of the Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall or to continue to defer payment of the
Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall by providing notice to Parent of such
election, subject to the determination of the maximum amount of the Permitted
Cash Payment as described above in _Section 2.1(b)_. At the end of the
Earnout Period, in the event that the Parent has not paid an Earnout Cash
Payment Shortfall to the Company Securityholders, such Earnout Cash Payment
Shortfall shall automatically be converted into a right for the Company
Securityholders to receive Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall Parent Shares
(without any further action upon the part of the Seller Representative).

(c) In the event that the applicable Earnout Target is not achieved for any
Earnout Year, the Company Securityholders shall not be entitled to receive
any Regular Earnout Payment for such Earnout Year; _provided_ , that in the
event that (i) the 2018 Target is not achieved for the 2018 calendar year, but
the 2019 Target is achieved for the 2019 calendar year or the 2020 Target is
achieved for the 2020 calendar year, or (ii) the 2019 Target is not achieved
for the 2019 calendar year, but the 2020 Target is achieved for the 2020
calendar year, then in either case, upon payment of the Regular Earnout
Payment for the Earnout Years in which the applicable Earnout Target is
achieved, the Parent shall also pay the Regular Earnout Payment for the prior
Earnout Years in which the Earnout Target was not achieved (and where no
Regular Earnout Payment was previously paid for

 



12  such Earnout Year) (a " _Catchup Earnout Payment_ "), with the amount of the
applicable Earnout Stock Payment and Earnout Cash Payment for such Catchup
Earnout Payment subject to the determination of the maximum amount of the
Permitted Cash Payment as described above in _Section 2.1(b)_.

(d) In the event that the EBITDA (as measured using the Measurement
Methodologies) on any Measurement Date occurring within (i) the 2018 calendar
year is in excess of the Earnout Target for a subsequent Earnout Year, then
the Earnout Target for such subsequent Earnout Year shall also be deemed to
have been achieved for such subsequent Earnout Year and the payment of the
Regular Earnout Payment for such subsequent year shall be accelerated and paid
by the Parent at the same time that the Regular Earnout Payment for the 2018
calendar year is paid or (ii) 2019 calendar year is in excess of the 2020
Target, then the 2020 Target for the 2020 calendar year shall also be deemed
to have been achieved for the 2020 calendar year and the payment of the
Regular Earnout Payment for the 2020 calendar year shall be accelerated and
paid by the Parent at the same time that the Regular Earnout Payment for the
2019 calendar year is paid (any such accelerated Regular Earnout Payment
hereunder, an " _Accelerated Earnout Payment_ "); provided, that the amount
of the applicable Earnout Stock Payment and Earnout Cash Payment for such
Accelerated Earnout Payment shall be subject to the determination of the
maximum amount of the Permitted Cash Payment as described above in _Section
2.1(b)_.

(e) In the event that after the Closing and during the Earnout Period there
is a Change of Control, then any Regular Earnout Payments that have not
previously been paid by Parent (whether or not previously earned) shall be
deemed earned (and the applicable Earnout Target achieved) and due by Parent
to the Company Securityholders upon such Change of Control (a " _Change of
Control Earnout Payment_ " and together with any Catchup Earnout Payment,
Accelerated Earnout Payment and Regular Earnout Payment, the "
_Earnout Payments_ "); _provided_ , that the amount of the applicable Earnout
Stock Payment and Earnout Cash Payment for such Change of Control Earnout
Payment shall be subject to the determination of Permitted Cash Payment as
described above in _Section 2.1(b)_. For purposes hereof, a " _Change of
Control_ " means the occurrence, in a single transaction or as the result of a
series of related transactions, of one or more of the following events: (i)
a merger, consolidation, reorganization or similar business combination
transaction involving the Parent in which the holders of all of the
outstanding equity interests of the Parent immediately prior to the
consummation of such transaction do not directly or indirectly (including
through Affiliates) own beneficially or of record immediately upon the
consummation of such transaction outstanding equity interests that represent a
majority of the combined outstanding voting securities of the surviving
entity in such transaction or of a parent of the surviving entity in such
transaction; (ii) a transaction in which a majority of the Parents voting
securities are transferred to any Person, or any two or more Persons acting as
a group, and all Affiliates of such Person or Persons (each, a " _Group_ "),
that were not directly or indirectly (including through Affiliates),
beneficially or of record, equity holders of Parent prior to the consummation
of such transaction (other than as a result of a sale of equity interests in
a secondary transaction by a single Company Stockholder that is not otherwise
approved by the disinterested independent directors of the board of directors
of Parent); (iii) the consummation of the sale of all or substantially all of
the assets of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, to any Group,
other than such a sale to a Group in which the equity holders of the Parent,
directly or indirectly (including through Affiliates), beneficially or of
record, own a majority of the combined voting securities; or (iv) during any
period of two consecutive years, the Continuing Directors cease to constitute
at least a majority of the Post-Closing Parent Board (for purposes of this
definition, the term " _Continuing Directors_ " means the directors still in
office who either were directors at the beginning of the two-year period or
who were directors elected to the Post-Closing Parent Board and whose
election or nomination was approved by the nominating committee of the Post-
Closing Parent Board or, if there is no nominating committee, whose election
or nomination was approved by a vote of at least a majority of the directors
then still in office who were directors at the beginning of the two-year
period or whose election to the Post-Closing Parent Board was previously so
approved).

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, (i) failure to qualify for a Regular Earnout
Payment in any Earnout Year during the Earnout Period shall not prevent the
Company Securityholders from being able to collectively receive (A) a Regular
Earnout Payment in a subsequent Earnout Year during the Earnout Period, (B) a
Catchup Earnout Payment in respect of such previous Earnout Year or (C) a
Change of Control Earnout Payment in respect of

 



13  such previous Earnout Year, and (ii) the Company Securityholders, whether
due to a Catchup Earnout Payment, Accelerated Earnout Payment, Change of
Control Earnout Payment or otherwise, shall not be entitled to receive more
than one Earnout Payment attributable to each Earnout Year.

(g) If for any Earnout Year there is a final determination in accordance with
_Section 2.2_ that the Company Securityholders are entitled to receive an
Earnout Payment for such Earnout Year (or a Catchup Earnout Payment or Change
of Control Earnout Payment for a prior Earnout Year), then such Earnout
Payment will be due upon such final determination and the Parent will make
such payment within ten (10) Business Days thereafter.

 

2.2 _Earnout Procedures_. As soon as practicable (but in any event within five
(5) days) after the filing of the Companys quarterly financial statements on
SEC Form 10-Q for the fiscal quarter ending on the applicable Measurement Date
or, the annual financial statements on SEC Form 10-K (which, in each case, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be adjusted to reflect any pro forma
adjustments pursuant to the calculation of "Consolidated EBITDA" (including
all "add-backs" and adjustments provided therein) (but subject to the
Measurement Methodologies) set forth in the Term Loan Agreement (as amended
and supplemented through the date hereof)) for the fiscal year ending on the
applicable Measurement Date, the Parents Chief Financial Officer (the " _CFO_
") will prepare and deliver to the Parent Representative and Seller
Representative a written statement (each, an " _Earnout Statement_ ") that
sets forth the CFOs determination in accordance with the terms of this
Article II of the EBITDA (measured as of the Measurement Date and using the
Measurement Methodologies) for such Earnout Year based on the financial
statements included in such Form 10-Q or Form 10-K (which, in each case, for
the avoidance of doubt, shall be adjusted to reflect any pro forma adjustments
pursuant to the calculation of "Consolidated EBITDA" (including all "add-
backs" and adjustments provided therein) (but subject to the Measurement
Methodologies) set forth in the Term Loan Agreement (as amended and
supplemented through the date hereof)), and whether the Company
Securityholders are entitled to receive a Regular Earnout Payment for such
Earnout Year and any Catchup Earnout Payment for a prior Earnout Year or an
Accelerated Earnout Payment for a subsequent Earnout Year, and the amount of
such Earnout Payment that constitutes an Earnout Cash Payment Shortfall based
on the information available at such time; _provided_ , _that_ , with respect
to any Earnout Statement delivered for any Measurement Date within the first
three (3) fiscal quarters of 2018, (i) EBITDA for each of the second and third
fiscal quarters of 2017 will be based, in the first instance, on the Companys
consolidated reviewed financial statement for fiscal year 2017 if available
as of the applicable Measurement Date), or if such audited financial
statements are not yet available as of the applicable Measurement Date, then,
in the second instance, on the financial statements included in the
Registration Statement (which, in each case, for the avoidance of doubt,
shall be adjusted to reflect any pro forma adjustments pursuant to the
calculation of "Consolidated EBITDA" (including all "add-backs" and
adjustments provided therein) (but subject to the Measurement Methodologies)
set forth in the Term Loan Agreement (as amended and supplemented through the
date hereof)), and (ii) EBITDA for the fourth quarter of 2017 will be based,
in the first instance on the Companys audited financial statements for
fiscal year 2017 (if available as of the applicable Measurement Date), or if
such audited financial statements are not yet available as of the applicable
Measurement Date, then, in the second instance, on the Companys reviewed
financial statement for the fourth fiscal quarter of 2017 (which, in each
case, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be adjusted to reflect any pro forma
adjustments pursuant to the calculation of "Consolidated EBITDA" (including
all "add-backs" and adjustments provided therein) (but subject to the
Measurement Methodologies) set forth in the Term Loan Agreement (as amended
and supplemented through the date hereof)). Each of the Parent Representative
and the Seller Representative will have fifteen (15) days after its receipt
of an Earnout Statement to review it. To the extent reasonably required to
complete their respective reviews of such Earnout Statement, the Parent and
its Subsidiaries will provide each of the Parent Representative and the
Seller Representative and their respective Representatives with reasonable
access to the books and records of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, their
respective finance personnel and any other information that the Parent
Representative or the Seller Representative reasonably requests relating to
the determination of the EBITDA, the Regular Earnout Payment for such Earnout
Year, any Catchup Earnout Payment for a prior Earnout Year, an Accelerated
Earnout Payment for a subsequent Earnout Year and any Earnout Cash Payment
Shortfall. In addition, and without limiting the

 



14  foregoing, upon request of either Parent Representative or the Seller
Representative, the CFO shall provide a written statement setting forth in
reasonable detail the calculation of EBITDA as set forth in the applicable
Earnout Statement and reasonable documentary support reflecting the basis of
such calculation. Either the Parent Representative or the Seller
Representative may deliver written notice to the CFO (by providing notice to
the Parent to the attention of the CFO) and the other Party on or prior to
the fifteen (15th) day after receipt of an Earnout Statement specifying in
reasonable detail any items that they wish to dispute and the basis therefor.
If the Seller Representative or the Parent Representative fails to deliver
such written notice in such fifteen (15) day period, then such Party will have
waived its right (and, with respect to the Seller Representative, the right of
the Company Securityholders, and, with respect to the Parent Representative,
the right of the Parent or its Subsidiaries) to contest such Earnout Statement
and the calculations set forth therein of the EBITDA, the Regular Earnout
Payment for such Earnout Year, any Catchup Earnout Payment for a prior
Earnout Year or an Accelerated Earnout Payment for a subsequent Earnout Year.
If either the Parent Representative or the Seller Representative provides the
CFO and the other Party with written notice of any objections to the Earnout
Statement in such fifteen (15) day period, then the Seller Representative and
the Parent Representative will, for a period of twenty (20) days following the
date of delivery of such notice, attempt to resolve their differences and any
written resolution by them as to any disputed amount will be final and binding
for all purposes under this Agreement. If at the conclusion of such twenty
(20) day period the Seller Representative and the Parent Representative have
not reached an agreement on any objections with respect to the Earnout
Statement, then upon the written request of either Party the Parties will
refer the dispute to the Independent Expert for final resolution of the
dispute in accordance with the dispute resolution procedures set forth in
_Section 1.12(b)_ (with any reference therein to the Closing Statement
instead referring to the applicable Earnout Statement in dispute). The Parties
acknowledge that any information provided pursuant to this _Section 2.2_
will be subject to the confidentiality obligations of _Section 6.14_. The
Parent hereby agrees during the Earnout Period to use its reasonable best
efforts to maintain a financial reporting system that enables the parties to
calculate the EBITDA and Earnout Payments for purposes of this _Article II_.

 

2.3 _Sponsor Earnout Shares_.

 

(a) In accordance with the letter agreement entered into on or about the date
hereof by and among the Sponsor, the Parent, the Company and the Seller
Representative in the form attached as _Exhibit D_ hereto (the " _Sponsor
Earnout Letter and Amendment to Escrow Agreement_ "), the Sponsor has agreed
that effective upon the Closing, the Sponsor will forfeit 1,078,125 of the
Parent Founder Shares owned by the Sponsor and subject 2,156,250 of the Parent
Founder Shares owned by the Sponsor (the " _Sponsor Earnout Shares_ ") to
potential forfeiture in the event that the Earnout Payments are not achieved
by the Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Surviving Corporation and
Surviving Entity pursuant to this Article II, with such Sponsor Earnout Shares
vesting pursuant to the terms of this _Section 2.3_.

 

(b) One-third (1/3rd) of the Sponsor Earnout Shares shall become fully vested
and no longer subject to forfeiture upon each date of final determination
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ that (i) the 2018 Target has been achieved, (ii)
the 2019 Target has been achieved, and (iii) the 2020 Target has been
achieved, and, in each case, that the applicable Earnout Payment has become
payable as a result thereof (whether in the form of a Regular Earnout Payment,
Catchup Earnout Payment or Accelerated Earnout Payment). In the event of a
Change of Control, all Sponsor Earnout Shares shall immediately vest and no
longer be subject to forfeiture upon such Change of Control.

(c) Any Sponsor Earnout Shares that have not vested pursuant to this _Section
2.3_ on or prior to the date that (i) all earned Earnout Payments have been
made and (ii) it is finally determined that the Company Securityholders are
not entitled to or eligible to receive any further Earnout Payments under
this Agreement, will be forfeited by the Sponsor after such date.

(d) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that notwithstanding _Section
2.1_, each Earnout Payment otherwise payable to the Company Securityholders
will be reduced by the amount of the Sponsor Earnout Shares that become vested
in connection with an Earnout Payment by directly reducing each Earnout Stock
Payment by the amount of the Sponsor Earnout Shares that have become vested
pursuant to this _Section 2.3_.

 



15 2.4 _Future Operations_. Following the Closing (including during the Earnout
Period), the Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Target Companies,
will be entitled to operate their respective businesses based upon the good
faith business requirements of the Parent and its Subsidiaries. Each of the
Parent and its Subsidiaries, including the Target Companies will be
permitted, following the Closing (including during the Earnout Period), to
make changes at its sole discretion, based upon the good faith business
requirements of the Parent and its Subsidiaries, to its operations,
organization, personnel, accounting practices and other aspects of its
business, including actions that may have an impact on the EBITDA and the
ability of the Company Securityholders to earn the Earnout Payments, and,
subject to the proviso below, neither the Company Securityholders, nor the
Seller Representative on their behalf, will have any right to claim the loss
of all or any portion of an Earnout Payment or other damages as a result of
such decisions; provided, that, the disinterested independent directors on
the Post-Closing Parent Board shall not cause the Parent and its Subsidiaries,
including the Target Companies, to take any actions in bad faith specifically
intended to prevent or impede the achievement of any of the Earnout Targets
or otherwise frustrate the earning of any Earnout Payment.

required to be filed or furnished by the Parent with the SEC under

 



18  the Securities Act and/or the Exchange Act, together with any amendments,
restatements or supplements thereto, and will file all such forms, reports,

site through EDGAR, the Parent has delivered to the Company copies in the form
filed with the SEC of all of the following: (i) the Parents annual reports
on Form 10-K for each fiscal year of the Parent beginning with the first year
the Parent was required to file such a form, (ii) the Parents quarterly
reports on Form 10-Q for each fiscal quarter that the Parent filed such
reports to disclose its quarterly financial results in each of the fiscal
years of the Parent referred to in clause (i) above, (iii) all other forms,
reports, registration statements, prospectuses and other documents (other
than preliminary materials) filed by the Parent with the SEC since the
beginning of the first fiscal year referred to in clause (i) above (the forms,
reports, registration statements, prospectuses and other documents
referred to in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above, whether or not available
through EDGAR, are collectively, the " _SEC Reports_ ") and (iv) all
certifications and statements required by (A) Rules 13a-14 or 15d-14
under the Exchange Act, and (B) 18 U.S.C. §1350 (Section 906 of SOX) with
respect to any report referred to in clause (i) above (collectively, the "
_Public Certifications_ "). The SEC Reports (x) were prepared in all material
respects in accordance with the requirements of the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules and regulations thereunder and
(y) did not, as of their respective effective dates (in the case of
SEC Reports that are registration statements filed pursuant to the
requirements of the Securities Act) and at the time they were filed with the
SEC (in the case of all other SEC Reports) contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. The Public
Certifications are each true as of their respective dates of filing. As used
in this _Section 4.6_, the term "file" shall be broadly construed to include
any manner permitted by SEC rules and regulations in which a document or
information is furnished, supplied or otherwise made available to the SEC. As
of the date of this Agreement, (A) the Parent Public Units, the Parent Common
Shares, the Parent Public Rights and the Parent Public Warrants are listed on
Nasdaq, (B) the Parent has not received any written deficiency notice from
Nasdaq relating to the continued listing requirements of such Parent
Securities, (C) there are no Actions pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Parent, threatened against the Parent by the Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority or any other Person with respect to the continued
listing of the Parent Securities on Nasdaq, including any intention by such
entity to suspend, prohibit or terminate the quoting of such Parent Securities
on Nasdaq and (D) such Parent Securities are in compliance with all of the
applicable listing and corporate governance rules of Nasdaq.

(b) The financial statements and notes contained or incorporated by reference
in the SEC Reports (the " _Parent Financials_ "), fairly present in all
material respects the financial position and the results of operations,
changes in shareholders equity, and cash flows of the Parent at the
respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial
statements, all in accordance with (i) GAAP methodologies applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved and (ii) Regulation S-X or
Regulation S-K, as applicable (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto
and for the omission of notes and audit adjustments in the case of unaudited
quarterly financial statements to the extent permitted by Regulation S-X or
Regulation S-K, as applicable).

(c) The Parent has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures and internal control over financial reporting (as such terms are
defined in paragraphs (e) and (f), respectively, of Rule 13a-15 and paragraph
(e) of Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rules 13a-15 and
15d-15 under the Exchange Act. The Parents disclosure controls and
procedures are designed to ensure that all information (both financial and
non-financial) required to be disclosed by the Parent in the reports that it
files or furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized
and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such information is accumulated and communicated to the
Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Parents management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Parents disclosure
controls and procedures and, to the extent required by applicable Law,
presented in any applicable SEC Report, or any amendment thereto, its
conclusions about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures
as of the end of the period covered by such report or amendment based on such
evaluation. Based on the Parents managements most recently completed
evaluation

respects, and has paid, collected or withheld, or caused to be paid, collected

such defaults as would not individually or the aggregate, reasonably be

necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not materially misleading.

satisfy the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and other
applicable Laws in connection with the Registration Statement, the Special
Meeting and the Redemption. Each of Parent and the Company shall, and shall

to any SEC comments on the Registration Statement and shall otherwise use its
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Registration Statement to "clear"
comments from the SEC and become effective. Parent shall provide the Company

material oral comments, that Parent or its Representatives receive from the
SEC or its staff with respect to the Registration Statement, the Special
Meeting and the Redemption promptly after the receipt of such comments and
shall give the Company a reasonable opportunity under the circumstances to
review and comment on any proposed written or material oral responses to such
comments.

such Company Meeting, and to take all other actions necessary or advisable to
secure the Required Company Stockholder Approval, including enforcing the
Voting Agreements.

6.12 _PIPE Investment_. Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
to consummate the PIPE Investment in accordance with the PIPE Agreements

The Parent shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (such

protective order or other remedy is not obtained, or the Parent waives

Parent Confidential Information which is legally required to be provided
as advised in writing by outside counsel and to exercise its commercially

46 6.16 _Indemnification of Directors and Officers; Tail Insurance_.

 

(a) The Parties agree that all rights to exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current or former directors
and officers of the Target Companies, Parent or the Merger Subs (as
applicable) and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee
or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust,
pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of the
Target Companies, Parent or the Merger Subs (the " _D andO Indemnified
Parties_") as provided in their respective Organizational Documents or under
any indemnification, employment or other similar agreements between any DandO
Indemnified Party and the Target Companies, Parent or the Merger Subs, in each
case as in effect on the date of this Agreement, shall survive the Mergers and
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms
to the extent permitted by applicable Law. For a period of six (6) years after
the Effective Time, the Parent shall cause the Organizational Documents of the
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the other Target Companies to contain
provisions no less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification
of and advancement of expenses to DandO Indemnified Parties than are set forth
as of the date of this Agreement in the Organizational Documents of the
Parent, the Merger Subs and Target Companies to the extent permitted by
applicable Law.

(b) On or prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall obtain binding
policies for run-off coverage for (i) the Target Companies directors and
officers in a form acceptable to the Company (the " _Company D andO Tail
Insurance_"), which Company DandO Tail Insurance shall provide such directors
and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Effective Time in
an amount not less than the existing coverage of the Target Companies and
shall have other terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons
than the directors and officers liability insurance coverage presently
maintained by the Target Companies. The Parent shall, and shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain the Company DandO Tail Insurance in full
force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder. After the
Effective Time, the Parent shall timely pay all premiums with respect to the
Company DandO Tail Insurance, which such premiums shall constitute a Company
Transaction Expense hereunder.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 6.16_ shall survive the consummation of
the Mergers and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be
enforceable by, each of the DandO Indemnified Parties and their respective heirs
and representatives.

 

(d) For the benefit of the Parents directors and officers, the Parent shall
be permitted prior to the Effective Time to obtain and fully pay the premium
for a "tail" insurance policy that provides coverage for up to a six-year
period from and after the Effective Time for events occurring prior to the
Effective Time (the " _Parent D andO Tail Insurance_") that is substantially
equivalent to and in any event not less favorable in the aggregate than the
Parents existing policy (true and complete copies of which have been
previously provided to the Company) or, if substantially equivalent insurance
coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage. For purposes of this
Agreement, the purchase of such Parent DandO Tail Insurance shall be treated as
a Parent Transaction Expense. If obtained, the Parent shall maintain the
Parent DandO Tail Insurance in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder. After the Effective Time, the Parent shall timely pay
all premiums with respect to the Parent DandO Tail Insurance, which such
premiums shall constitute a Parent Transaction Expense hereunder.

6.17 _Post-Closing Board of Directors and Executive Officers_. 

(a) The Parties shall take all necessary action, including causing the
directors of the Parent to resign, so that effective as of the Closing, the
Parents board of directors (the " _Post-Closing Parent Board_ ") will consist
of ten (10) individuals. Immediately after the Closing, the Parties shall take
all necessary action to designate and appoint to the Post-Closing Parent
Board as follows: (i) two (2) persons shall be designated by the Parent prior
to the Closing (the " _Parent Directors_ "), both of whom shall be required to
qualify as an independent director under Nasdaq rules, and (ii) eight (8)
persons shall designated by the Company prior to the Closing (the " _Company
Directors_ "), at least three (3) of whom shall be required to qualify as an
independent director under Nasdaq rules.

 



47  Subject to resignations provided by the Companys directors, the board of
directors of the Surviving Corporation immediately after the Closing shall be
the same as the board of directors of the Company immediately prior to the
Closing. At or prior to the Closing, the Company will provide each Parent
Director with a customary director indemnification agreement, in form and
substance reasonable acceptable to such Parent Director.

 

(b) The Parties shall take all action necessary, including causing the
executive officers of the Parent to resign, so that the individuals serving
as executive officers of the Parent immediately after the Closing will be the
same individuals (in the same offices) as those of the Company immediately
prior to the Closing.

 

6.18 _Use of Trust Account Proceeds After the Closing_. The Parties agree that
at the Closing, the funds in the Trust Account and any proceeds received by
the Parent from the PIPE Investment, after taking into account payments for
the Redemption, shall first be used (i) to pay the Cash Consideration, (ii) to
pay any loans owed by the Parent to the Sponsor for any Parent Transaction
Expenses or other administrative expenses incurred by the Parent (" _Sponsor
Loans_ "), and (iii) to pay all unpaid Transaction Expenses. The Sponsor Loans
and Transaction Expenses, as well as any Parent Transaction Expenses that are
required to be paid by delivery of the Parents securities, will be paid as
and when due pursuant to their terms (including at the Closing to the extent
then due pursuant to their terms, or otherwise after the Closing). Any
remaining cash will be used for working capital and general corporate
purposes.

6.19 _Parent Post-Closing Dividend Policy_. From and after the Closing,
Parent will adopt a stated dividend policy for the Parent to use its
commercially reasonable efforts to declare and pay a dividend in such amount
as to provide an annual dividend yield to Parents stockholders of at least
one percent (1%), subject to the determination by Parents board of directors
(i) that such dividend payment is permitted by applicable Law and (ii) that
Parent and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis, have a sufficient
amount of unrestricted cash to make such dividend payment and still satisfy
their respective existing liabilities and have sufficient reserves for future
contingencies or future needs of the business of Parent and its
Subsidiaries. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Parties acknowledge that the
Parents board of directors is solely responsible for declaring and paying
dividends, and nothing herein shall require a director of Parent to breach its
fiduciary duties to the Parent or Parents stockholders.

6.20 _Post-Closing Registration Statement_. Parent hereby agrees that within
thirty (30) days after the Closing, it will (a) file with the SEC a
registration statement for the resale of (i) the Parent Securities acquired by
the PIPE Investors in the PIPE Investment (including the Parent Securities to
be issued in the Deferred PIPE Closing) and (ii) the Parent Securities of any
holder that has registration rights with respect thereto, and (b) use its
reasonable best efforts to cause such registration statement to be declared
effective as promptly as practicable thereafter.

6.21 _Security Clearances_. During the Interim Period, the Company shall (a)
ensure that each of the Defense Security Service of the United States
Department of Defense and any other Governmental Authority responsible for the
maintenance of the Target Companies facility security clearances, if any,
shall not terminate, suspend, revoke or in any way materially change either
the Government Contracts with a Target Company or a Target Companys facility
security clearance with respect to such Government Contracts as a result of
this Agreement or the consummation of the Mergers or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (b) continue to take any and all requisite
steps to and otherwise cause each of its Subsidiaries to obtain or retain the
requisite facility and personnel security clearances to own and operate the
Target Companies (and any successor thereto) and their respective businesses
as currently conducted and as currently contemplated to be conducted without
delay or interruption.

 

6.22 _Listing of Parent Common Shares_. Parent will use its commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Parent Common Shares that will be issued in

approved for listing on Nasdaq, subject to official notice of issuance, prior
to the Effective Time.

ARTICLE IX

 

 _TERMINATION AND EXPENSES_

 

9.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated and the transactions
contemplated hereby may be abandoned at any time prior to the Closing as
follows:

(a) by mutual written consent of the Parent and the Company;

 

(b) by written notice by the Parent or the Company if any of the conditions to
the Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ have not been satisfied or waived by
March 31, 2018 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , the right to
terminate this Agreement under this _Section 9.1(b)_ shall not be available
to (i) Parent if the breach or violation by such Party or its Affiliates of
any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation under this Agreement was
the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on or before
the Outside Date or (ii) the Company if any action or omission by a Target
Company or its Affiliates (including any acquisitions that individually or in
the aggregate would require the preparation of pro forma financial statements
pursuant to Regulation S-X), in each case that was not previously expressly
approved in writing by Parent, was the cause of, or resulted in, the failure
of the Closing to occur on or before the Outside Date;

 

(c) by written notice by either the Parent or the Company if a Governmental
Authority of competent jurisdiction shall have issued an Order or taken any
other action permanently restraining, enjoining or otherwise prohibiting the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order or other action
has become final and non-appealable; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(c)_ shall
not be available to a Party if the failure by such Party or its Affiliates to
comply with any provision of this Agreement has been a substantial cause of,
or substantially resulted in, such action by such Governmental Authority;

 



52 (d) by written notice by the Company, if (i) there has been a material breach
by the Parent of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or
agreements contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty
of the Parent shall have become materially untrue or materially inaccurate, in
any case, which would result in a failure of a condition set forth in
_Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ to be satisfied (treating the Closing
Date for such purposes as the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date of
such breach), and (ii) the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured
or is not cured within the earlier of (A) twenty (20) days after written
notice of such breach or inaccuracy is provided by the Company or (B) the
Outside Date; _provided_ , that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(d)_ if at such time
the Company is in material uncured breach of this Agreement;

 

(e) by written notice by the Parent, if (i) there has been a breach by the
Company of any of its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements
contained in this Agreement, or if any representation or warranty of such
Parties shall have become untrue or inaccurate, in any case, which would
result in a failure of a condition set forth in _Section 8.3(a)_ or 
_Section 8.3(b)_ to be satisfied (treating the Closing Date for such purposes
as the date of this Agreement or, if later, the date of such breach), and (ii)
the breach or inaccuracy is incapable of being cured or is not cured
within the earlier of (A) twenty (20) days after written notice of such
breach or inaccuracy is provided by the Parent or (B) the Outside Date;
_provided_ , that the Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.1(e)_ if at such time the Company is
in material uncured breach of this Agreement;

(f) by written notice by the Parent if there shall have been a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company or its Subsidiaries following the date of this
Agreement which is uncured and continuing within twenty (20) days after
written notice of such Material Adverse Effect is provided by the Parent;

(g) by written notice by either the Parent or the Company, if the Special
Meeting has been held (including any adjournment or postponement thereof),
has concluded, the Parents stockholders have duly voted, and the Required
Parent Stockholder Approval was not obtained; or

 

(h) by written notice by either the Parent or the Company, if the Company
Stockholder Meeting has been held (including any adjournment or postponement
thereof), has concluded, the Companys stockholders have duly voted, and the
Required Company Stockholder Approval was not obtained.

 

9.2 _Effect of Termination_. This Agreement may only be terminated in the
circumstances described in _Section 9.1_ and pursuant to a written notice
delivered by the applicable Party to the other applicable Parties, which sets
forth the basis for such termination, including the provision of _Section
9.1_ under which such termination is made. In the event of the valid
termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void, and there shall be no Liability on the part of any
Party or any of their respective Representatives, and all rights and
obligations of each Party shall cease, except: (i) _Sections 6.13_, _6.14_
, _9.3_ , _9.4_ , _10.1_ , _Article XI_ and this _Section 9.2_ shall survive
the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any
Party from Liability for any willful breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or obligation under this Agreement or any Fraud of such Party, in
either case, prior to termination of this Agreement (in each case of
clauses (i) and (ii) above, subject to _Section 10.1_). Without limiting the
foregoing, and except as provided in _Section 9.3_ and this _Section 9.2_
(including clause (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence, but subject to
_Section 10.1_), and subject to the right to seek injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable relief in accordance with _Section 11.7_, the
Parties sole right prior to the Closing with respect to any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement contained in this
Agreement by another Party or with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement shall be the right, if applicable, to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.1_.

9.3 _Transaction Expenses_. All Transaction Expenses shall be paid by Parent
and/or the Company at or after the Closing pursuant to _Section 6.18_;
_provided_ , that, in the event of termination of this Agreement, all
Transaction Expenses shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses;
_provided_ , _further_ , that, in the event of such termination, the Company
shall reimburse the Seller Representative for all costs and expenses incurred
by the Seller Representative in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby.

 



53 9.4 _Termination Fee_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding _Section 9.3_ above, in the event that there is a valid
and effective termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.1(d)_ due to the Parents breach of its representations and
warranties in _Sections 4.20_ or _4.22_ or its covenants in _Section 6.12_,
then the Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee in an amount in
cash equal to $2,500,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ "), payable by the Parent
upon the earlier of the Parents completion of a Business Combination with
another Person thereafter or the dissolution and liquidation of the Parent
(solely to the extent of funds outside of the Trust Account after payment of
the amounts owed to Public Stockholders with respect to their Parent Common
Shares in connection with such dissolution and liquidation), by wire transfer
of immediately available funds to an account designated in writing by the
Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Parties
expressly acknowledge and agree that, with respect to any termination of this
Agreement in circumstances where a Termination Fee is payable under this
_Section 9.4_, the payment of the Termination Fee shall, in light of the
difficulty of accurately determining actual damages, constitute liquidated
damages with respect to any claim for damages or any other claim which the
Company would otherwise be entitled to assert against the Parent or its
Affiliates or any of their respective assets, or against any of their
respective directors, officers, employees or shareholders with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and shall constitute the
sole and exclusive remedy available to the Company, provided, that the
foregoing shall not limit (x) any claim for Fraud prior to termination of this
Agreement or (y) the rights of the Company to seek specific performance or
other injunctive relief in lieu of terminating this Agreement.

ARTICLE X

 

 _WAIVERS AND RELEASES_

 

10.1 _Waiver of Claims Against Trust_. Reference is made to the IPO
Prospectus. The Company represents and warrants that it has read the IPO
Prospectus and understands that Parent has established the Trust Account
containing the proceeds of the IPO and overallotment shares acquired by
Parents underwriters (including interest accrued from time to time thereon)
for the benefit of Parents public stockholders (including overallotment
shares acquired by Parents underwriters) (the " _Public Stockholders_ ") and
that, except as otherwise described in the IPO Prospectus, Parent may disburse
monies from the Trust Account only: (a) to the Public Shareholders in the
event they elect to redeem their Parent Common Shares in connection with the
consummation of its initial business combination (as such term is used in the
IPO Prospectus) (" _Business Combination_ ") or in connection with an
extension of the deadline to consummate a Business Combination, (b) to the
Public Shareholders if the Parent fails to consummate a Business Combination
within twenty-four (24) months after the closing of the IPO, (c) with respect
to any interest earned on the amounts held in the Trust Account, as necessary
to pay any franchise or income Taxes, and (d) to the Parent after or
concurrently with the consummation of its Business Combination. For and in
consideration of Parent entering into this Agreement and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Company hereby agrees on behalf of itself and its
Affiliates that, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
neither the Company nor its Affiliates does now or shall at any time prior to
the Effective Time have any right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or
to any monies in the Trust Account (or, or at any time hereafter, to
distributions therefrom to Public Stockholders or otherwise occurring prior to
the Closing in accordance with the terms of the Trust Agreement "
_Public Distributions_ "), or make any claim against the Trust Account
(including any Public Distributions therefrom), regardless of whether such
claim arises as a result of, in connection with or relating in any way to,
this Agreement or any proposed or actual business relationship between the
Parent or its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Company or its
Representatives, on the other hand, this Agreement or any other matter, and
regardless of whether such claim arises based on contract, tort, equity or
any other theory of legal liability (any and all such claims are collectively
referred to hereafter as the " _Released Claims_ "). The Company on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates hereby irrevocably waives any Released Claims that
the Company or its Affiliates may have against the Trust Account (including
any Public Distributions therefrom) now or in the future as a result of, or
arising out of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Parent or its
Representatives

 



54  and will not seek recourse against the Trust Account (including any Public
Distributions therefrom) for any reason whatsoever (including for an alleged
breach of this Agreement or any other agreement with Parent or its
Affiliates). The Company agrees and acknowledges that such irrevocable waiver
is material to this Agreement and specifically relied upon by the Parent and
its Affiliates to induce Parent to enter in this Agreement, and the Company
further intends and understands such waiver to be valid, binding and
enforceable against the Company and each of its Affiliates under applicable
Law. To the extent the Company or any of its Affiliates commences any action
or proceeding based upon, in connection with, relating to or arising out of
any matter relating to the Parent or its Representatives, which proceeding
seeks, in whole or in part, monetary relief against the Parent or its
Representatives, the Company hereby acknowledges and agrees the Companys and
its Affiliates sole remedy shall be against funds held outside of the Trust
Account and that such claim shall not permit any the Company or its Affiliates
(or any Person claiming on any of their behalves or in lieu of them) to have
any claim against the Trust Account (including any Public Distributions
therefrom) or any amounts contained therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
(x) nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit the Companys or the
Seller Representatives right to pursue a claim against the Parent for legal
relief against monies or other assets held outside the Trust Account (other
than Public Distributions therefrom), or for specific performance or other
equitable relief in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.7_ hereof (including a
claim for Parent to specifically perform its obligations under this Agreement
and cause the disbursement of the balance of the cash remaining in the Trust
Account (after giving effect to the redemption of Parent Common Shares
pursuant to the Redemption) to the Company and the Company Securityholders in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Trust Agreement, and (y)
nothing herein shall serve to limit or prohibit any claims that the Company
and the Seller Representative may have in the future against the Parents
assets or funds that are not held in the Trust Account (including any funds
that have been released from the Trust Account to Parent upon Parents
Business Combination and any assets that have been purchased or acquired with
any such funds, but excluding Public Distributions therefrom). This _Section
10.1_ shall survive termination of this Agreement for any reason.

56 11.2 _Binding Effect; Assignment_. This Agreement and all of the provisions
hereof shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns. This Agreement shall
not be assigned by operation of Law or otherwise without the prior written
consent of the Parent, the Company, the Parent Representative and the Seller
Representative, and any assignment without such consent shall be null and
void; _provided_ that no such assignment shall relieve the assigning Party of
its obligations hereunder.

 

11.3 _Third Parties_. Except for (a) the rights of the PIPE Investors and any
Person that has been engaged as a placement agent in connection with the PIPE
Investment (who shall, in each case, be entitled to rely, subject to the same
limitations with respect to reliance and survival applicable to the Parties as
set forth in this Agreement (including _Sections 4.21_ ,  _5.29_ and _7.1_ ),
on the representations and warranties of the Parties set forth in this
Agreement, it being understood and agreed that such Persons shall have no
right to rely (i) on any other provisions of this Agreement and shall have no
rights or recourse against the Company Securityholders with respect to any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) any other instrument
or document executed by the Company or the Company Securityholders in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, and (b) the rights of
the DandO Indemnified Parties set forth in _Section 6.16_, which the Parties
acknowledge and agree are express third party beneficiaries of this Agreement,
nothing contained in this Agreement (except as set forth in the next
sentence) or in any instrument or document executed by any party in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby shall create any rights in, or be
deemed to have been executed for the benefit of, any Person that is not a
Party hereto or thereto or a successor or permitted assign of such a Party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the Effective Time, the Company
Securityholders (and their successors, heirs and legal representatives
(including the Seller Representative) are intended third party beneficiaries
of, and may enforce (subject to _Section 11.14_) _Article I_ and _Article
II_. The Parent Representative from and after the Closing shall be deemed to
be a Party to this Agreement for purposes of enforcing its rights and
obligations under this Agreement.

11.4  _Arbitration_. Any and all disputes, controversies and claims (other

permanent injunction or other equitable relief or application for enforcement
of a resolution under this _Section 11.4_) arising out of, related to, or in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby (a "
_Dispute_ ") shall be governed by this _Section 11.4_. A party must, in the
first instance, provide written notice of any Disputes to the other parties
subject to such Dispute, which notice must provide a reasonably detailed
description of the matters subject to the Dispute. The parties involved in
such Dispute shall seek to resolve the Dispute on an amicable basis within ten
(10) Business Days of the notice of such Dispute being received by such
other parties subject to such Dispute; the " _Resolution Period_ ");
_provided_ , that if any Dispute would reasonably be expected to have become
moot or otherwise irrelevant if not decided within sixty (60) days after
the occurrence of such Dispute, then there shall be no Resolution Period with
respect to such Dispute. Any Dispute that is not resolved during the
Resolution Period may immediately be referred to and finally resolved by
arbitration pursuant to the then-existing Expedited Procedures (as defined in
the AAA Procedures) of the Commercial Arbitration Rules (the " _AAA
Procedures_ ") of the American Arbitration Association (the " _AAA_ "). Any
party involved in such Dispute may submit the Dispute to the AAA to commence
the proceedings after the Resolution Period. To the extent that the AAA
Procedures and this Agreement are in conflict, the terms of this Agreement
shall control. The arbitration shall be conducted by one arbitrator nominated
by the AAA promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after the
submission of the Dispute to the AAA and reasonably acceptable to each party
subject to the Dispute, which arbitrator shall be a commercial lawyer with
substantial experience arbitrating disputes under acquisition agreements. The
arbitrator shall accept his or her appointment and begin the arbitration
process promptly (but in any event within five (5) Business Days) after his
or her nomination and acceptance by the parties subject to the Dispute. The
proceedings shall be streamlined and efficient. The arbitrator shall decide
the Dispute in accordance with the substantive law of the state of New York.
Time is of the essence. Each party shall submit a proposal for resolution of
the Dispute to the arbitrator within twenty (20) days after confirmation of
the appointment of the arbitrator. The arbitrator shall have the power to
order any party to do, or to refrain from doing, anything consistent with
this Agreement, the Ancillary

 



57  Documents and applicable Law, including to perform its contractual
obligation(s); provided, that the arbitrator shall be limited to ordering
pursuant to the foregoing power (and, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
order) the relevant party (or parties, as applicable) to comply with only one
or the other of the proposals. The arbitrators award shall be in writing and
shall include a reasonable explanation of the arbitrators reason(s) for
selecting one or the other proposal. The seat of arbitration shall be in New
York County, State of New York. The language of the arbitration shall be
English.

 

11.5 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction_. This Agreement shall be governed by,
construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of New York
without regard to the conflict of laws principles thereof; provided, that, to
the extent required by the Laws of the State of Delaware (including any Law
related to any fiduciary duty, duty of loyalty, or other duty or obligation of
the Companys or the Parents respective boards of directors with respect to
the Mergers or this Agreement), such Laws of the State of Delaware will apply
to the Mergers. Subject to _Section 11.4_, all Actions arising out of
or relating to this Agreement shall be heard and determined exclusively in
any state or federal court located in New York, New York (or in any appellate
courts thereof) (the " _Specified Courts_ "). Subject to  _Section 11.4_,
each Party hereto hereby (a) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of any
Specified Court for the purpose of any Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement brought by any Party hereto and (b) irrevocably waives, and

by an applicable Party in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. Accordingly, each Party shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or restraining order to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to

necessary to render the same valid, legal and enforceable, and the validity,
legality and enforceability of the 

 



58  remaining provisions hereof shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby nor shall the validity, legality or enforceability of such provision
be affected thereby in any other jurisdiction. Upon such determination that
any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being
enforced, the Parties will substitute for any invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provision a suitable and equitable provision that carries out,
so far as may be valid, legal and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision.

forth in an instrument in writing signed by the Party or Parties to be bound
thereby (including by the Parent Representative or Seller Representative in
lieu of such Party to the extent provided in this Agreement). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by a Party in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any waiver of any provision of this
Agreement after the Closing shall also require the prior written consent
of the Parent Representative.

and Prior Company Counsel shall have no duty to reveal or disclose any such
files or other materials or any Privileged Company Deal Communications by
reason of any attorney-client relationship between Prior Company Counsel, on
