Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the

conditions set forth in _Article V_ (other than those conditions that by their
nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the fulfillment or
waiver of those conditions).

 

2.3 _Effective Time_. Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, prior to
the Closing, the Company and Parent will jointly prepare, and as soon as
practicable following the Closing, the Company and Parent will cause to be
filed with the office of the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware, a
certificate of merger (the " _Delaware Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form
as is required by, and executed in accordance with, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at the time when the Delaware
Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the office of the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by the
Company and Parent in writing and specified in the Delaware Certificate of
Merger (the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

2.4 _Certificate of Incorporation_. At the Effective Time, the certificate of
incorporation of the Company shall be amended as a result of the Merger so as
to read in its entirety as set forth in _Exhibit B_ and, as so amended, shall

(subject to _Section 4.11_ ).

following the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company are amended to be
identical to the bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the

2.6 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation,
each to hold office until his or her successor has been duly elected or
appointed and qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or
removal in accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

2.7 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, each to hold
office until his or her successor has been duly elected or appointed and
qualified or until his or her earlier death, resignation or removal in
accordance with the Charter and the Bylaws.

 

2.8 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, as a result of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company or the sole stockholder of Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Merger Consideration_. Each share of the common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Company (a " _Common Share_ ") issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than issued and outstanding
Common Shares (i) that are owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent, (ii) that are owned by the Company
as treasury stock or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the
Company, (iii) that are also shares of Company Restricted Stock or (iv) that
are owned by stockholders (" _Dissenting Stockholders_ ") that have perfected
and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their right to, appraisal pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to such Common Shares (the " _Dissenting
Shares_ ," and, together with the Common Shares referred to in the
immediately preceding clauses (i), (ii) and (iii), the " _Excluded Shares_
")) shall be automatically converted into the right to receive $14.05 per
Common Share in cash (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "), without
interest. At the Effective Time, all of the Common Shares shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each
certificate (a " _Certificate_ ") formerly representing any of the Common
Shares (other than Excluded Shares) shall thereafter represent only the right
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration for each such Common Share,
without interest, in accordance with this _Article II_.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each Excluded Share shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist, subject to the right of the Record Holder of any
Dissenting Shares to receive the payment for such Dissenting Shares pursuant
to _Section 2.9(f)_ and subject to the right of a holder of any shares of
Company Restricted Stock that are not Dissenting Shares to receive the
Restricted Stock Consideration therefor pursuant to _Section 2.10(b)_.

 

(c) _Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be automatically converted into one validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

2.9 _Exchange of Certificates and Book-Entry Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Immediately prior to, or at, the Effective Time, Parent
shall deposit, or shall cause to be deposited, with American Stock Transfer and
Trust Company or such

  

14 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

other bank or trust company mutually acceptably to Parent and the Company (the
" _Paying Agent_ "), for the benefit of the Record Holders of Common Shares
(other than Excluded Shares), a cash amount in immediately available funds
necessary for the Paying Agent to make payments under _Section 2.8(a)_ (such
cash amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ "). If a Dissenting Stockholder effectively
withdraws its demand for, or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its rights
to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, (i) such Common Shares shall cease to be Excluded Shares
and (ii) Parent shall make available, or cause to be made available, to the
Paying Agent additional cash funds in an amount equal to the product of (x)
the number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Stockholder has
withdrawn its demand for, or failed to perfect or otherwise lost its rights
to, appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and (y) the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days) after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent
to mail to each Record Holder of Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares)
(i) a letter of transmittal specifying that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section 2.9(e)_ ) to the Paying Agent, such letter of transmittal to be in
customary form and to have such other provisions as Parent and the Company
may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
_Section 2.9(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the amount to
which such Record Holder is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to
_Section 2.8(a)_. If any Excluded Shares cease to be Excluded Shares pursuant
to _Section 2.9(a)_ , the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent
promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) after the date on
which such Excluded Shares cease to be Excluded Shares to mail to the Record
Holder of such Common Shares the letter of transmittal and instructions
referred to in the immediately preceding sentence, with respect to such
Common Shares. Upon delivery of such letter of transmittal by any Record
Holder of Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares), duly completed and duly
executed in accordance with its instructions, and the surrender to the Paying
Agent of a Certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such Common Shares (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.9(e)_ ), or receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents
message" or other evidence of transfer of Book-Entry Shares as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry
Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount by
check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such holder (less any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.11_ ) equal to the product of (x) the number of Common Shares
represented by such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as
provided in _Section 2.9(e)_ ) or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the
Effective Time and (y) the Per Share Merger Consideration, and the
Certificate so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will
be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Common Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance with the procedures
described above may be issued to the transferee if the applicable letter of
transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by
the Surviving Corporation to evidence and effect such transfer and to
evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

  

15 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

(c) _No Further Registration of Transfers_. From and after the Effective
Time, there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the Company of the Common Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and, subject to compliance with
the procedures set forth in _Section 2.9(b)_ , exchanged for the cash amount
to which the Record Holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.11_ ), to be
paid by check or wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated by such holder.

 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by
the Record Holders of the Common Shares for one (1) year after the Effective
Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation upon demand. Any Record
Holder of Common Shares (other than Excluded Shares) that has not theretofore
complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the amount to which such Record Holder
is entitled as a result of the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.8(a)_ (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.11_ ), without any
interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to
any holder of Common Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

 

(e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of
that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
the form and amount reasonably required by Parent as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such Certificate, the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (less
any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.11_ ) equal to the
product of (i) the number of Common Shares represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(f) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, no Person that has perfected a demand for appraisal rights
pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting Shares
shall be entitled to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect
to such Dissenting Shares unless and until such Person shall have effectively
withdrawn its demand for, or failed to perfect or otherwise lost its right
to, appraisal under the DGCL with respect to such Dissenting Shares.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless
and until a Dissenting Stockholder shall have effectively withdrawn its demand
for, or failed to perfect or otherwise lost its right to, appraisal under the
DGCL with respect to Dissenting Shares, each Dissenting Stockholder shall be
entitled to receive only the payment provided by Section 262 of the DGCL with
respect to such Dissenting Shares. If any Dissenting Stockholder effectively
withdraws it demand for, or fails to perfect or otherwise loses its rights to,
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to any Dissenting
Shares, then the right of such Dissenting Stockholder to receive the payment
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL shall cease and such Dissenting Shares
shall be deemed to have been automatically converted into, as of the
Effective Time, and shall represent

  

16 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

only, the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration, without
interest, pursuant to the provisions of this _Section 2.9_. At the Effective
Time, the Dissenting Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled
and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except such rights provided in this
_Section 2.9(f)_. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by
the Company prior to the Effective Time, any withdrawals of such demands and
any other demands, notices or instruments delivered to the Company pursuant to
Section 262 of the DGCL prior to the Effective Time that relate to such
demands and (ii) the opportunity to make decisions in respect of all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such demand, notice or
instrument. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of
Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal
or offer to settle or settle any such demands.

 

2.10 _Treatment of Outstanding Company Options and Company Restricted Stock
Under Stock Plans_.

 

(a) _Company Options_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding and unexercised option to purchase Common Shares issued under a
Stock Plan (a " _Company Option_ "), whether or not then vested or
exercisable, shall become fully vested and exercisable and, at the Effective
Time, each such Company Option not theretofore exercised shall be cancelled
and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount (less any
required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.11_ ) in cash equal to
the product of (i) the total number of Common Shares subject to such Company
Option immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii) the excess, if any, of
(A) the Per Share Merger Consideration over (B) the exercise price per Common
Share under such Company Option (the " _Option Consideration_ "),
without interest. For the avoidance of doubt, in the event that the exercise
price per Common Share of any Company Option is equal to or greater than the
Per Share Merger Consideration, at the Effective Time, such Company Option
shall be cancelled without any consideration being payable in respect
thereof. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
any event no later than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time),
Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to (or pay to
the Surviving Corporations payroll provider for payment to) each holder of a
Company Option the Option Consideration owed to such holder pursuant to this
_Section 2.10(a)_.

 

(b) _Company Restricted Stock_. Immediately prior to the Effective Time, each
outstanding share of Company Restricted Stock, whether or not then vested,
shall become free of all restrictions, fully vested and transferable and, at
the Effective Time, each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be
cancelled and shall only entitle the holder thereof to receive an amount
(less any required Tax withholdings as provided in _Section 2.11_ ) in cash
equal to the Per Share Merger Consideration (the " _Restricted Stock
Consideration_ "), without interest, subject, however, to any rights of the
holder of such share of Restricted Stock pursuant to _Section 2.9(f)_. As soon
as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in any event no later
than three (3) Business Days after the Effective Time), Parent shall, or
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, pay to each holder of a share of
Company Restricted Stock (other than a Dissenting Share) the Restricted Stock
Consideration owed to such holder pursuant to this _Section 2.10(b)_. If any
shares of Company Restricted Stock that are also Dissenting Shares cease to
be Dissenting Shares pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_ , Parent shall, or shall
cause the Surviving

  

17 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

Corporation to, promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) pay
to the holder of such shares of Company Restricted Stock the Restricted Stock
Consideration owed to such holder pursuant to this _Section 2.10(b)_.

 

(c) _Corporate Actions_.

 

(i) Prior to the Effective Time, if and as required by the applicable Stock
Plan, the Company shall provide notice to each holder of a Company Option or
Company Restricted Stock describing the treatment of and payment for such
Company Option or Company Restricted Stock under _Section 2.10(a)_ or _Section
2.10(b)_ , as applicable.

 

(ii) At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the Board of Directors
of the Company and the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors of the
Company, as applicable, shall adopt resolutions and shall take such other
appropriate actions (including obtaining any required consents) to implement
the provisions of _Section 2.10(a)_ and _Section 2.10(b)_ and to terminate
the Stock Plans at the Effective Time.

plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to

estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information and business
plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective Representatives, or any
other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub hereby

adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable such Acquisition
Proposal, if and only to the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action
described in clause (i) or (ii), the Board of Directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisor) that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal and (y) prior to taking any action described in clause
(iii), the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor)
that such Acquisition Proposal is a Superior Proposal.

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_.

 

(i) Except as contemplated by this _Section 4.2(c)_ , _Section 4.2(d)_ ,
_Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(c)_ , the Board of Directors of the Company
shall not: (A) withhold, withdraw, modify or amend, in a manner adverse to
Parent, the Company Recommendation; (B) authorize, adopt, approve, recommend
or otherwise declare advisable any Acquisition Proposal; or (C) cause or
permit the Company to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, but
subject to _Section 4.2(c)(iii)_ and _Section 4.2(c)(iv)_ , prior to the time
the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Board of Directors of the Company
may (A) withhold, withdraw, modify or amend the Company Recommendation or (B)
authorize, adopt, approve, recommend or otherwise declare advisable any
Acquisition Proposal made after the date hereof that the Board of Directors of
the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with the Companys
outside legal counsel and financial advisor) is a Superior Proposal (any
action in clause (A) or (B), a " _Change of Recommendation_ "), in each case
if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that failure to do so could be
inconsistent with its fiduciary obligations under applicable Law, and may also
take action pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(c)_.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Company shall not effect a Change of Recommendation, in connection with a
Superior Proposal or otherwise, prior to taking the following actions: (A) the
Company shall notify Parent in writing, at least seventy-two (72) hours in
advance, that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation, in connection
with a Superior Proposal or otherwise; (B) upon Parents request, the Company
shall discuss with Parent the facts and circumstances giving rise to such
Change of Recommendation to facilitate Parents evaluation of whether to
improve the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments
or the Limited Guaranty as would permit the Board of Directors of the Company
not to effect a Change of Recommendation, in connection with a Superior
Proposal or otherwise; (C) if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a
written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of being accepted by the
Company to alter the terms of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments or the
Limited Guaranty during such seventy-two (72) hour notice period, the Board of
Directors of the Company shall have determined in good faith, after
considering the terms of such offer by Parent and (1) if the intended Change
of Recommendation is in connection with a Superior Proposal, after
consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and financial advisor,
that such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal
or (2) after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel, that
failure to effect a Change of Recommendation could be inconsistent with its
fiduciary obligations under applicable Law; and (D) with respect to an
intended Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal, in
the event of any material change to the material terms of such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, provide Parent with an additional
notice and, unless the Company provides such additional notice to Parent
within forty-eight (48) hours of providing Parent with the original notice
contemplated by clause (A), the notice period shall recommence, except that
the notice period shall be twenty-four (24) hours rather than the seventy-two
(72) hour notice period otherwise contemplated by clause (A).

  

47

--- 

    
 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the
Company shall not enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect
to a Superior Proposal prior to taking the following actions: (A) the Company
shall notify Parent in writing, at least seventy-two (72) hours in advance,
that it intends to enter into such Alternate Acquisition Agreement (which
notice shall include a copy of such Superior Proposal and any financing
commitments relating thereto) to facilitate Parents evaluation of whether to
improve the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments
or the Limited Guaranty in such a manner that would cause such Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal; (B) if Parent shall have
delivered to the Company a written, binding and irrevocable offer capable of
being accepted by the Company to alter the terms of this Agreement, the
Financing Commitments or the Limited Guaranty during such seventy-two (72)
hour notice period, the Board of Director of the Company shall have determined
in good faith (after consultation with the Companys outside legal counsel and
financial advisor), after considering the terms of such offer by Parent, that
such Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior Proposal; and
(C) in the event of any material change to the material terms of such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, provide Parent with an additional
notice and, unless the Company provides such additional notice to Parent
within forty-eight (48) hours of providing Parent with the original notice
contemplated by clause (A), the notice period shall recommence, except that
the notice period shall be twenty-four (24) hours rather than the seventy-two
(72) hour notice period otherwise contemplated by _clause (A)_.

shall be deemed to prohibit the Board of Directors of the Company from (i)
complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Law, including
taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act (or any similar communications to

any non-public information is requested from the Company or any of its
Representatives by any Person or Persons that have made an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) the Company or its Representatives engage, enter
into or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person or
Persons that have made an Acquisition Proposal, other than to clarify the
terms and conditions thereof (and the Company shall keep Parent reasonably
informed on a reasonably current basis of any material discussions or
negotiations with such Person or Persons); or (iv) an amendment to a
previously disclosed Acquisition Proposal is received by the Company or any of
its Representatives, indicating, in connection with such notice, the material

4.3 _Proxy Statement_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date hereof, the Company
shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary form
relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any
amendments or supplements thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Parent shall
cooperate with the Company in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement, including furnishing to the Company any and all
information regarding Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates
as may be required to be disclosed or incorporated by reference therein under
the Exchange Act or other applicable Law as promptly as reasonably practicable
after the date hereof. The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the
receipt of all comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy
Statement and of any request by the SEC or its staff for any amendment or
supplement thereto or for additional information, and shall promptly provide
to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company and/or any of its
Representatives and the SEC or its staff with respect to the Proxy Statement
or the Merger. The Company and Parent (to the extent applicable) shall each
use its reasonable best efforts to promptly provide responses to the SEC or
its staff with respect to all comments received on the Proxy Statement from
the SEC or its staff. The Company shall cause the definitive Proxy Statement
to be mailed to the holders of Common Shares promptly after the date the
staff of the SEC advises the Company that it has no further comments thereon
or that the Company may commence mailing the Proxy Statement to the holders
of Common Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement, prior to filing the Proxy Statement, or any amendment or
supplement thereto, with the SEC, mailing the Proxy Statement, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, to the holders of Common Shares or responding
to any comments or requests from the SEC or its staff with respect to the
Proxy Statement or the Merger, the Company shall provide Parent and its
counsel with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on such Proxy
Statement, amendment, supplement or response and shall consider in good
faith any comments reasonably proposed by Parent and/or its counsel and, to
the extent permissible, shall provide Parent and its counsel an opportunity
to participate in any material discussions or meetings with the staff of the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement.

 

(b) If, at any time prior to the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained,
any information is discovered by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub which it
reasonably believes should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the
Proxy Statement so that the Proxy Statement does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements made therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall provide prompt notice thereof to the
other parties hereto and, if the Board of Directors of the Company determines
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel) that an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement describing such information is
required under Applicable Law, such an amendment or supplement shall be filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company.

 

4.4 _Stockholders Meeting_. Unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, and subject to fiduciary obligations under
applicable Law, the Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law, its
certificate of incorporation and bylaws and the rules and

  

49 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

regulations of the SEC and NASDAQ, all reasonable action necessary to convene
and hold a meeting of the holders of Common Shares (the " _Stockholders
Meeting_ "), which Stockholders Meeting shall be held as promptly as
reasonably practicable after the date the Proxy Statement is mailed to the
holders of Common Shares, to consider and vote upon the adoption of this
Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , for the avoidance of doubt, the Company
may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting: (i) with the consent of
Parent in its sole discretion; (ii) for the absence of a quorum; (iii) to the
extent necessary to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy
Statement required under applicable Law is provided to the holders of Common
Shares within a reasonable period of time in advance of the Stockholders
Meeting; (iv) to allow reasonable additional time to solicit additional
proxies; (v) to the extent required by Law; (vi) if the Company has provided a
written notice to Parent pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)(iii)_ that it intends to
make a Change of Recommendation in connection with a Superior Proposal and the
notice period contemplated by _Section 4.2(c)(iii)_ has not yet expired; or
(vii) if the Company has provided a written notice to Parent pursuant to
_Section 4.2(c)(iv)_ that it intends to enter into an Alternative Acquisition
Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal and the notice period
contemplated by _Section 4.2(c)(iv)_ has not yet expired. Subject to a Change
of Recommendation pursuant to _Section 4.2_ , the Board of Directors of the
Company shall recommend the adoption of this Agreement by the holders of
Common Shares, shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement and
shall take all reasonable lawful action to solicit such adoption of this
Agreement by the holders of Common Shares.

 

4.5 _Filings; Other Actions; Notification_.

 

(a) _Cooperation_. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
this Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as
reasonably practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as
reasonably practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,
reports and other filings and to obtain as promptly as reasonably practicable
the expiration or termination of any applicable waiting period, and to
obtain all necessary actions, non-actions, waivers, consents, registrations,

advisable to be obtained from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity,
in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Law. In furtherance of and not in limitation of the
foregoing, Parent and the Company each shall file the initial pre-merger
notifications with respect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated herein required under the HSR Act (which filing, including
the exhibits thereto, need not be shared or otherwise disclosed to the other
party except to outside counsel of each party) no later than ten (10)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement. Parent and the Company shall
also make, as soon as reasonably practicable, all notifications, reports,
applications or other filings, and take all other actions, that may be
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable, under any other applicable
Antitrust Law. The Company and Parent will each request early termination of
the waiting period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act and any other
applicable Antitrust Law. Parent will not withdraw its initial filing under
the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law, as the case may be, and refile it
unless the Company has

  

50 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

consented in advance to such withdrawal and refiling. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the Company shall
have the right to review in advance, and to the extent practicable each will
consult with the other on and consider in good faith the views of the other in
connection with, all of the information relating to Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, and any of their respective Affiliates, that appears in any
filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Nothing in this Agreement shall require the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take or agree to take any action with respect to
its business or operations unless the effectiveness of such agreement or
action is conditioned upon the Closing.

 

(b) _Information_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company and Parent each
shall, upon request by the other, furnish the other with all information
concerning itself, its Affiliates, directors, officers and stockholders and
such other matters as may be reasonably necessary or advisable in connection
with any statement, filing, notice or application made by or on behalf of
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to any third
party and/or any Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including under the HSR Act and
any other applicable Antitrust Law.

Governmental Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised
of the status of matters relating to completion of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of
notices or other communications received by Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of its Affiliates, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor
Parent shall permit any of its Affiliates, officers or any other
Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in
respect of any filing, investigation or other inquiry with respect to the
Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated hereby unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

 

(d) _Antitrust Matters_.

 

(i) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, without
limiting the generality of the other undertakings pursuant to this _Section

the following actions:

 

(A) to provide promptly to each and every Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable Antitrust Law (a "
_Governmental Antitrust Entity_ ") such non-privileged information and
documents as requested by any such Governmental Antitrust Entity or that are
necessary, proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement;

  

51 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

(B) to use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the entry or enactment of any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination, judgment, investigation or Law that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; and

 

(C) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or Law is entered, issued or
enacted, or becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered, issued or enacted,
in any proceeding, review or inquiry of any kind that would make consummation
of the Merger in accordance with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that
would delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to use
its reasonable best efforts to take any and all steps (including the appeal
thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the steps contemplated by
clause (B)) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse, suspend, prevent,
eliminate, avoid or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination, decree or enactment so
as to permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of Parent under this _Section 4.5_ shall include Parent committing

particular assets, categories, portions or parts of assets or businesses of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time; and (D)

respect to its respective assets or the assets of the Company or conduct
of business arrangements or terminating any and all existing relationships
and contractual rights and obligations as a condition to obtaining any and
all expirations of waiting periods under the HSR Act or consents from any
Governmental Antitrust Entity necessary, to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby. All efforts described in this _Section 4.5(d)(ii)_ shall
be unconditional and shall not be qualified by reasonable best efforts and no
actions taken pursuant to this _Section 4.5(d)(ii)_ shall be considered for
purposes of determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has
occurred.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this _Section 4.5_ or any
other provision of this Agreement, the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub
with respect to the Financing are solely set forth in _Section 4.14_.

 

4.6 _Access_. Commencing on the date hereof and ending at the Effective Time
or such earlier date as this Agreement may be terminated in accordance with
its terms, the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) (a) upon

disrupt or interfere with business operations, to its employees, properties,
books, contracts and records, (b) furnish promptly to Parent all information

physicians at the Physician Practices, during normal business hours and in a
manner that does not disrupt or interfere with business operations; _provided_
, that the foregoing shall not require the Company to, nor shall the Company
be required to cause its Subsidiaries to, (w) permit any access, or disclose
any information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result
in the disclosure of any trade secrets of a third party or violate any of the
Companys obligations with respect to confidentiality, (x) permit any Phase I
or Phase II environmental site assessments or any other sampling activities,
(y) disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (z) permit any access, or disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company would violate any applicable Law. The
parties will use their reasonable best efforts to make appropriate substitute
arrangements under circumstances in which the restrictions of the preceding
sentence apply. All information obtained by Parent or any of its
Representatives pursuant to this _Section 4.6_ shall be governed by the terms
of the Confidentiality Agreement.

 

4.7 _Stock Exchange De-listing_. The Company agrees to use its reasonable
best efforts to continue the quotation of the Common Shares on NASDAQ prior to
the Effective Time. Parent shall take such actions as are necessary to cause
the Companys securities to be de-listed from NASDAQ and de-registered
under the Exchange Act as soon as practicable following the Effective Time.

 

4.8 _Publicity_. Neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger
Sub, on the other hand, shall issue any public release or make any public
announcement or disclosure concerning this Agreement or the Merger without the
prior written consent of the other party(ies) (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), except as such release,
announcement or disclosure may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable securities exchange or Governmental Entity to
which the relevant party is subject or submits, wherever situated, in which
case the party required to make the release, announcement or disclosure shall
use its reasonable best efforts to allow the other party(ies) reasonable time
to comment on such release, announcement or disclosure in advance of such
issuance (it being understood that the final form and content of any such
release, announcement or disclosure, as well as the timing of any such
release, announcement or disclosure, shall be at the final discretion of the
disclosing party); _provided_ , _however_ , that the restrictions set forth in
this _Section 4.8_ shall not apply to any release, announcement or disclosure

their respective Subsidiaries under which such Affected Employee may be
eligible to participate from or after the Effective Time to the same extent
recognized by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under an analogous

such Affected Employee and his or her eligible dependants under any Purchaser
Welfare Benefit Plan to the same extent waived under an analogous Benefit
Plan, (ii) cause any eligible expenses incurred by any Affected Employee and
his or her eligible dependants under a Benefit Plan during the plan year in
which such individuals move to an analogous Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan to
be taken into account under such Purchaser Welfare Benefit Plan for purposes

requirements applicable to such Affected Employee and his or her eligible
dependants as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such Purchaser
Welfare Benefit Plan and (iii) waive any waiting period limitation or
evidence of insurability requirement that would otherwise be applicable to an
Affected Employee and his or her eligible dependants from or after the
Effective Time during the plan year in which such individuals move to an

6.5(b)_ or _Section 6.5(d)_ , whether or not the Merger is consummated, all
costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger, the
other transactions contemplated hereby or the financing thereof shall be paid
by the party incurring such costs or expenses; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company and Parent shall share equally all costs and expenses, other than

the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation and

less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and

incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the governing documents of its
applicable Subsidiary as in effect on the date hereof. For a period of six (6)
years after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and shall also advance expenses
as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law upon receipt
of an undertaking by or on behalf of an Indemnified Party to repay such amount
if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnified Party is not
entitled to be indemnified), each person who is now, has been at any time
prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time a
director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") against any fees, costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements), judgments, fines, losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or amounts paid in settlement incurred in
connection with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether
civil, criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of or related
to such Indemnified Partys service as a director, officer, employee or agent
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or services performed by such
Indemnified Party at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time,
including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection with (i)
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (ii) actions to enforce
this provision or any other indemnification or advancement right of any
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that if, at any time prior to the
six (6) year anniversary of the Effective Time, any Indemnified Party
delivers to the Surviving Corporation a written notice asserting a claim for
indemnification under this _Section 4.11(a)_ , then the foregoing obligations
of the Surviving Corporation, and of Parent to cause the
Surviving Corporation, to indemnify, hold harmless and advance expenses to
Indemnified Parties in respect of the claim asserted in such notice shall
survive the six (6) year anniversary of the Effective Time until such time as
such claim is fully and finally resolved.

 

(b) The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts prior to the
Effective Time to purchase a six (6) year prepaid "tail policy," with terms,
conditions, retentions

thereof as provided in the Companys existing directors and officers
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the " _Current D andO Insurance Policies_") as of the
date hereof, with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, covering, without limitation, the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , that (i) such "tail policy" shall not require the payment
of an aggregate annual premium in excess of three hundred percent (300%) of
the aggregate annual premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the
date hereof to maintain the Current DandO Insurance Policies (and if the
aggregate annual premium of such "tail policy" exceeds such amount, the
Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts prior to the Effective Time
to purchase a prepaid "tail policy" with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount) and (ii) the Company shall not purchase such
"tail policy" without the prior written consent of Parent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed). If the Company shall
for any reason fail to obtain such "tail policy" prior to the Effective Time,
the Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, maintain in effect for at least six (6) years from the
Effective Time, at no expense to the beneficiaries thereof, the Current DandO
Insurance Policies, with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of liability
that are at least as favorable to the beneficiaries thereof as provided in the
Current DandO Insurance Policies as of the date hereof, with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that
neither Parent nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an
aggregate annual premium for such Current DandO Insurance Policies in excess of
three hundred percent (300%) of the aggregate annual premium most recently
paid by the Company prior to the date hereof to maintain the Current DandO
Insurance Policies (and if the aggregate annual premium of such Current DandO
Insurance Policies exceeds such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall, and
Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain directors and
officers insurance policies and fiduciary liability insurance policies with
the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount).

 

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns shall (i) consolidate with or merge into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger, (ii) transfer all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person or (iii) cease to exist for any
reason, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, shall assume all of the obligations of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this _Section 4.11_.

 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 4.11_ are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties, each of the
other persons who are beneficiaries under the Current DandO Insurance Policies
and their respective heirs and legal representatives, who are third party
beneficiaries of this _Section 4.11_ , with full rights of enforcement
against Parent and the Surviving Corporation as if a party hereto.

 

(e) The provisions of this _Section 4.11_ are intended to be in addition to
the rights available to current or former directors, officers or employees, as
the case may be, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the governing
documents of any of its Subsidiaries, or under any applicable agreements,
contracts, arrangements, understandings or Laws. Parent and Merger Sub
agree that

  

56 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

all rights to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether
asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in
favor of the current or former directors, officers or employees, as the case
may be, of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as provided in the
certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Company or the governing
documents of any of its Subsidiaries or in any agreement, contract,
arrangement or understanding, shall survive the Merger, shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner by the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect following the Merger. The obligations set forth in
this _Section 4.11_ shall not be terminated, amended or otherwise modified in
any manner that adversely affects any Indemnified Party, any other person who
is a beneficiary under a Current DandO Insurance Policy or any of their
respective heirs or legal representatives without the prior written consent of
such affected Indemnified Party or other person.

 

(f) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers or fiduciary
liability insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for any of their
respective current or former directors, officers or employees, it being
understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this  _Section
4.11_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under such
policies.

 

4.12 _Anti-Takeover Laws_. In the event that any state anti-takeover or other
similar Law is or becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement may be consummated as promptly as reasonably practicable on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and otherwise
to eliminate or minimize the effects of such Law on this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 

4.13 _Stockholder Consent_. Immediately following the execution of this
Agreement, Parent shall execute and deliver to the Company, in accordance with
Section 228 of the DGCL and in its capacity as the sole stockholder of Merger
Sub, a written consent adopting this Agreement.

 

4.14 _Financing_.

 

(a) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that they shall be fully responsible
for obtaining the Equity Financing and each shall use its reasonable best
efforts to take (or cause to be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be
done) all things, necessary, proper or advisable to obtain the Equity
Financing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Equity Financing
Commitment, including (i) maintaining in effect the Equity Financing
Commitment, (ii) using reasonable best efforts to ensure the accuracy of all
representations and warranties of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in the
Equity Financing Commitment, (iii) complying with all covenants and agreements
of Parent or Merger Sub set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment, (iv)
satisfying, on a timely basis, all conditions applicable to Parent or Merger
Sub set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment that are within their
control, (v) consummating the Equity Financing in accordance with the
Equity Financing Commitment (subject to the terms and conditions set forth
therein) at or prior to the Closing (and, in any event, prior to the
Termination

  

57 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

Date) and (vi) fully enforcing the obligations of the investor party to the
Equity Financing Commitment and its investment affiliates (and the rights of
Parent and Merger Sub) under the Equity Financing Commitment, including (at
the request of the Company) by filing one or more lawsuits against such
investor party to fully enforce such investor partys obligations (and the
rights of Parent and Merger) thereunder. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall
amend, alter or waive, or agree to amend, alter or waive (in any case whether
by action or inaction), any term of the Equity Financing Commitment, without
the prior written consent of the Company, if such amendment, alteration or
waiver would (x) reduce the aggregate amount of the Equity Financing below the
amount to be provided as set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment unless
the Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding amount or (y) impose new or
additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any conditions, to
the receipt of the Equity Financing in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to (A) prevent, delay or impair the Closing, (B) make the funding of
the Equity Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to obtaining the
Equity Financing) less likely to occur or (C) adversely impact the ability of
Parent and Merger Sub to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Equity Financing Commitment, the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub agrees to notify the Company promptly, and in any event within one
(1) Business Day, if at any time prior to the Closing Date (1) the Equity
Financing Commitment expires or is terminated for any reason (or if any Person
attempts or purports to terminate the Equity Financing Commitment, whether or
not such attempted or purported termination is valid), (2) the investor party
to the Equity Financing Commitment refuses to provide the full Equity
Financing on the terms set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment or (3) for
any reason, Parent or Merger Sub no longer believes in good faith that it will
be able to obtain all or any portion of the Equity Financing on the terms set
forth in the Equity Financing Commitment. In no event shall Parent and Merger
Sub be required to seek or obtain equity financing other than the Equity
Financing and in no event shall the investor party to the Equity Financing
Commitment be required to provide equity financing in an amount in excess of
the amount set forth in the Equity Financing Commitment.

 

(b) Parent acknowledges that it shall be fully responsible for obtaining the
Debt Financing and shall use its reasonable best efforts to take (or cause to
be taken) all actions, and do (or cause to be done) all things, necessary,
proper or advisable to obtain the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions
set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment. Parent shall not permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, or any waiver of any provision or
remedy under, the Debt Financing Commitment, without the prior written consent
of the Company, if such amendment, modification or waiver would (x) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing (including by changing the amount
of fees to be paid or original issue discount of the Debt Financing), unless
the Equity Financing is increased by a corresponding amount, or (y)
impose new or additional conditions, or otherwise amend, modify or expand any
conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to (1) prevent, delay or impair the Closing, (2) make
the funding of the Debt Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions to
obtaining the Debt Financing) less likely to occur or (3) adversely impact the
ability of Sagard Capital Partners, L.P., Parent or Merger Sub to enforce its
rights against the other parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or the
definitive agreements contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, the
ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or the likelihood of consummation of the

  

58 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and
Merger Sub may (A) amend or modify the Debt Financing Commitment to add
lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication agents or similar entities
that have not executed the Debt Financing Commitment as of the date hereof, if
the addition of such additional parties, individually or in the aggregate,
would not prevent, delay or impair the availability of the Debt Financing or
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (B)
enter into additional financing commitment letters with respect to the debt
financing of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_ ,
that such commitment letters either do not reduce the aggregate amount of the
Debt Financing committed pursuant to the Debt Financing Commitment or, if such
commitments are reduced, such commitment letters do not contain any new or
additional conditions other than those set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment or that would not adversely affect the ability of Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or the likelihood of
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Financing
Commitment until the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated, (ii) ensure the accuracy of all representations and warranties of
Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and Parent set forth in the Debt Financing
Commitment, (iii) comply with all covenants of Sagard Capital Partners, L.P.
and Parent set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment, (iv) satisfy, on a
timely basis, all conditions applicable to Sagard Capital Partners, L.P. and
Parent set forth in the Debt Financing Commitment (including by consummating
the Equity Financing pursuant to the terms of the Equity Financing Commitment)
that are within its control, (v) enter into definitive agreements with respect
to the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions contemplated by the Debt
Financing Commitment and (vi) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the
Closing (and, in any event, prior to the Termination Date). In the event that
all conditions precedent in the Debt Financing Commitment (other than the
availability of funding of the Equity Financing contemplated under the Equity
Financing Commitment) have been satisfied, or upon funding will be satisfied,
each of Parent and Merger Sub will use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the lender parties to the Debt Financing Commitment to fund on the Closing
Date the Debt Financing required to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and otherwise enforce its rights under the Debt Financing
Commitment (including through litigation pursued in good faith).

 

(c) Parent shall keep the Company informed, on a reasonably current basis, in
reasonable detail, with respect to the Debt Financing, shall provide the
Company with prompt notice if it becomes aware of any material adverse change
with respect to the availability of the Debt Financing and shall promptly
provide copies of all material documents provided to the Financing Sources or
otherwise related to the Debt Financing to the Company. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees to notify
the Company promptly, and in any event within one (1) Business Day, if at any
time prior to the Closing Date: (i) the Debt Financing Commitment expires or
is terminated for any reason (or if any Person attempts or purports to
terminate the Debt Financing Commitment, whether or not such attempted or
purported termination is valid); (ii) Parent or Merger Sub becomes aware of
any breach or default (or any event or circumstance that, with or without
notice, lapse of time or both, would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any breach or default) by any party to the Debt Financing Commitment or any
of the definitive agreements contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment;
(iii) Sagard Capital Partners, L.P., Parent or Merger Sub receives any

  

59 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

written notice or other written communication from any Person with respect to
any: (x) actual or potential breach, default, termination or repudiation by
any party to the Debt Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or (y) material dispute or
disagreement between or among any parties to the Debt Financing Commitment or
any definitive agreement contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment; or
(iv) for any reason, Sagard Capital Partners, L.P., Parent or Merger Sub
believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion
of the Debt Financing on the terms, in the manner or from the Financing
Sources contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment or the definitive
agreements contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment, including if a
Financing Source refuses in writing to provide, expresses an intent to refuse
to provide, or expresses any material concern or reservation regarding its
obligation and/or ability to provide, all or a portion of the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment on the terms set forth therein.
As soon as reasonably practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business
Days after the date the Company delivers Parent or Merger Sub a written
request, Parent and Merger Sub shall provide any information reasonably
requested by the Company relating to any circumstance referred to in _clause
(i)_ , _(ii)_ , _(iii)_ or _(iv)_ of the preceding sentence. Neither Parent
nor Merger Sub shall, nor shall it permit any of its Affiliates to, without
the prior written consent of the Company, take any action or enter into any
transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint venture, disposition,
lease, contract or debt or equity financing, that could reasonably be expected
to impair, delay or prevent consummation of all or a portion of the Debt
Financing. If all or any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable on
the terms and conditions contemplated in the Debt Financing Commitment, or the
Debt Financing Commitment shall be terminated or modified in a manner
materially adverse to Parent or Merger Sub for any reason, each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts (A) to arrange to promptly
obtain such Debt Financing from alternative sources in an amount that is
sufficient, when added to the portion of the Financing that is available and
together with any cash or cash equivalents held by the Company as of the
Effective Time, to pay in cash all amounts required to be paid by Parent,
Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and (B) to promptly obtain a new debt financing
commitment letter and a new definitive agreement with respect thereto that
provides for debt financing on terms (including structure, covenants and
pricing) not materially less favorable, in the aggregate, to Parent and Merger
Sub, taken as a whole, and in an amount that is sufficient, when added to the
portion of the Financing that is available together with any cash or cash
equivalents held by the Company as of the Effective Time, to pay in cash all
amounts required to be paid by Parent, Merger Sub and the Surviving
Corporation in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration, the
aggregate Option Consideration, the aggregate Restricted Stock Consideration
and all other payments, fees and expenses related to or arising out of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (any such new debt financing
commitment letter described in this _clause (B)_ , a " _Satisfactory
Replacement Debt Financing Commitment_ ").

 

(d) Prior to the Closing, at Parents sole expense, the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to provide Parent and Merger Sub with such cooperation
in connection with the financing of the Merger (including the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment) as may be reasonably requested
by Parent and as is customary in connection with the arrangement of financing
similar in all material respects to the Financing; _provided_ , that (i) no
liability or obligation (including any liability or obligation to pay any

  

60 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

commitment or other similar fee) of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under any certificate, document or instrument shall be effective until the
Effective Time and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take any action under any certificate, document or instrument that
is not contingent upon the Closing (including the entry into any agreement
that is effective before the Effective Time) or that would be effective prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) nothing herein shall require such cooperation to
the extent it would interfere unreasonably with the business or operations of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (iii) none of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries shall be required to issue any offering or information
document. Subject in all cases to the proviso in the immediately preceding
sentence, such cooperation shall include the following: (A) participating in a
reasonable and limited number of meetings (including customary one-on-one
meetings with the parties acting as lead arrangers or agents for, and
prospective lenders and purchasers of, the Debt Financing and senior
management and Representatives, with appropriate seniority and expertise, of
the Company), presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and sessions with rating agencies in connection with the Debt
Financing; (B) assisting Parent and Merger Sub with the preparation of
customary offering memoranda, bank information memoranda, rating agency
presentations and similar documents relating to the Debt Financing (it being
understood that each such memoranda, presentation and documents will state
that the Debt Financing will not be an obligation of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries unless and until the Merger occurs); (C) delivery to Parent,
Merger Sub and their Financing Sources of all information with respect to the
business, operations, financial condition, projections and prospects of the
Company as may be reasonably requested by Parent and as is customarily
provided by a borrower in a secured financing transaction (including in
connection with Parents preparation of pro forma financial statements); (D)
participation by senior management of the Company in the negotiation of, and
the execution and delivery of, the definitive agreements contemplated by the
Debt Financing Commitment; (E) providing and executing documents as may be
reasonably requested by Parent, including a certificate of the Chief Financial
Officer of the Company with respect to solvency matters; (F) executing and
delivering customary pledge and security documents and otherwise facilitating
the pledge of collateral; (G) cooperating with marketing efforts of Parent,
Merger Sub and their Financing Sources for all or any portion of the Debt
Financing; (H) using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain accountants
comfort letters and legal opinions from the Companys current outside legal
counsel (it being understood that the main enforceability legal opinion
relating to the Debt Financing will be rendered by counsel to Parent)
reasonably requested by Parent and customary for financings similar to the
Debt Financing; and (I) using reasonable best efforts to arrange for customary
payoff letters, Lien terminations and instruments of discharge in connection
with the repayment of outstanding Indebtedness of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as contemplated by the Financing Commitments. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, the condition set forth
in _Section 5.2(b)_ , as it applies to the Companys obligations under this
_Section 4.14(d)_ , shall be deemed satisfied unless there has occurred a
knowing and willful material breach of the Companys obligations under this
_Section 4.14(d)_. All non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company or any of its Subsidiaries obtained by Parent, Merger
Sub or any of their respective Representatives pursuant to this _Section
4.14(d)_ shall be kept confidential in accordance with the Confidentiality
Agreement; _provided_ , that the Company agrees that Parent and Merger Sub may
share non-public or otherwise confidential information with rating agencies
and the Financing Sources, and that Parent, Merger Sub and such Financing
Sources may share such information with potential

  

61 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

Financing Sources in connection with the marketing of the Debt Financing, in
each case, if the recipients of such information agree to customary
confidentiality arrangements. Parent shall, promptly upon request by the
Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with the cooperation contemplated by this _Section
4.14(d)_. Parent and Merger Sub shall, on a joint and several basis, indemnify
and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by any of them in connection with the arrangement of the Financing
(including any action taken in accordance with this _Section 4.14(d)_ ) and
any information utilized in connection therewith (other than historical
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries approved by the
Company in writing specifically for use in the Debt Financing offering
documents). The Company hereby consents to the use of its and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Debt Financing; _provided_ , that
such logos shall be used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Intellectual Property rights or imply that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries have prepared, endorsed or approved any such materials.

 

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that the obtaining of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, is not a condition to the Closing and
reaffirm their obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement irrespective and independently of the availability of the
Financing, or any alternative financing, subject to the fulfillment or waiver
of the conditions set forth in _Article V_.

 

(f) For purposes of this _Section 4.14_ , unless the context otherwise
requires, references to "Financing" shall include the financing contemplated
by the Financing Commitments as permitted to be replaced, amended and/or
modified by this _Section 4.14_ , references to "Equity Financing"
shall include the equity financing contemplated by the Equity Financing
Commitment as permitted to be amended and/or modified by this  _Section 4.14_
, references to "Debt Financing" shall include the debt financing contemplated
by the Debt Financing Commitment as permitted to be replaced, amended and/or
modified by this _Section 4.14_ and references to "Equity

_Section 4.14_.

 

4.15 _Litigation_. In the event that any litigation related to this Agreement,
the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is
brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened in writing, against
the Company and/or the members of the Board of Directors of the Company prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of any such
litigation and shall keep Parent reasonably informed with respect to the
status thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligation of the Company to
notify Parent of any demands for appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL
is solely set forth in _Section 2.9(f)_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to consult with the Company regarding the defense or settlement of
any such litigation and shall consider in good faith Parents views with
respect to any such litigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right of
Parent to participate in the defense or settlement of any demands for
appraisal pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL is solely set forth

  

62 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

in _Section 2.9(f)_. The Company shall not settle any such litigation without
Parents prior written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned (except to the extent that such consent is
required under the provisions of _Section 4.1(a)(xv)_ ).

 

4.16 _Rule 16b-3_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such
steps as may be reasonably necessary or advisable to cause dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the

under the Exchange Act to the extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

4.17 _Notification of Certain Matters_. At all times during the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending at the Effective Time or such earlier
date as this Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its terms, Parent
shall give prompt notice to the Company, and the Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, (a) upon becoming aware that any representation or warranty
made by it (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) has become untrue or
inaccurate in any material respect such that the condition set forth in
_Section 5.2(a)_ (with respect to representations and warranties made by the
Company) or _Section 5.3(a)_ (with respect to representations and warranties
made by Parent or Merger Sub) would not be satisfied, in each case, at any
time from and after the date of this Agreement until the Effective Time or
such earlier date as this Agreement may be terminated in accordance with its
terms or (b) of any failure by it (or, in the case of Parent, Merger Sub) to
comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it (or, in the case of Parent,
Merger Sub) under this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
unintentional failure to give notice upon becoming aware that any
representation or warranty has become untrue or inaccurate under this _Section
4.17_ shall not be deemed a covenant breach, but instead shall constitute only
a breach of the underlying representation or warranty. Notwithstanding the
above, the delivery of any notice pursuant to this _Section 4.17_ will not
affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty set forth in this
Agreement or limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the
party receiving such notice or the conditions to such partys obligation to
consummate the Merger. All information obtained by Parent pursuant to this
_Section 4.17_ shall be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement.

 

4.18 _Company Affidavit_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Parent

that an Affiliate of Parent and the Company have previously executed a
Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of March 16, 2012 (as the same may have

continue in full force and effect in accordance with its terms except as
expressly modified herein. Parent and Merger Sub hereby agree to be bound by
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement as so modified; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent and Merger Sub may share non-public or otherwise
confidential information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries with
rating agencies and the Financing Sources, and that Parent, Merger Sub and
such Financing Sources may share such information with potential Financing
Sources in

be satisfied (except if the occurrence of the events described in _clauses
(i)_ and _(ii)_ of this _Section 6.3(e)_ is the primary cause of such
material breach); (Y) the condition in _Section 5.2(c)_ is not then satisfied

to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ , _Section 5.3(a)_
or _Section 5.3(b)_ not to be satisfied.

--- 

    
 

no liability to any Person on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
Representatives or Affiliates); _provided_ , _however_ , and notwithstanding
anything in the foregoing to the contrary, that (i) the agreements of the
Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in _Article I_ , _Section 4.10_ , the
indemnification and reimbursement provisions of _Section 4.14(d)_ , _Section
4.19_ , this _Section 6.5_ , _Article VII_ , the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Limited Guaranty shall survive the termination of this Agreement (in the
case of the Confidentiality Agreement and the Limited Guaranty, subject to the
terms thereof) and (ii) the termination of this Agreement will not relieve any
party hereto from liability for fraud in connection with this Agreement.
Nothing shall limit or prevent any party hereto from exercising any rights or
remedies it may have under _Section 7.8_ in lieu of terminating this
Agreement, and abandoning the Merger, pursuant to this _Article VI_.

 

(b) In the event that:

 

(i) (A) this Agreement is terminated (1) pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ before
obtaining the Company Requisite Vote or (2) pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_ , (B)
after the date of this Agreement but prior to such termination, a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal shall have been publicly announced or otherwise
publicly communicated to the holders of Common Shares and not subsequently
withdrawn at least three (3) days prior to such termination and (C) within
nine (9) months after such termination either an Acquisition Transaction is
consummated or the Company shall have entered into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Transaction that is subsequently consummated
(provided, that for purposes of this clause (C), the references to twenty
percent (20%) and eighty percent (80%) in the definition of "Acquisition
Transaction" shall be deemed to be references to fifty percent (50%)), then
the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days
after the date on which the Company consummates such Acquisition Transaction,
pay Parent an amount equal to $5,086,087 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by wire
transfer of immediately available funds;

 

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to _Section 6.4(a)_ or
_Section 6.4(b)_ , then the Company shall promptly, but in no event later than
three (3) Business Days after the date of such termination, pay Parent the
Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds; or

 

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to _Section 6.3(a)_
or _Section 6.3(c)_ , then the Company shall, immediately prior to or
substantially concurrently with such termination, pay Parent the Termination
Fee by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be required to pay
the Termination Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Termination
Fee may be payable under multiple provisions of this Agreement at the same
time or at different times or upon the occurrence of different events.

 

In addition to the payment of the Termination Fee, in the event that this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section 6.2(a)_ before obtaining the
Company Requisite Vote or pursuant to _Section 6.2(b)_ , the Company shall,
upon demand of Parent accompanied by copies of all appropriate invoices,
promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date

  

69 
--- 

 


--- 

    
 

of such demand, reimburse Parent for the out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by or on behalf of Parent and/or Merger Sub in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, up to a maximum amount equal to
$2,119,203 (it being agreed and understood that any amounts paid pursuant to
this paragraph shall be credited against any Termination Fee ultimately due
pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)(i)_ ).

 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (i) _Section
6.3(b)_ , _Section 6.3(d)_ or _Section 6.3(e)_ or (ii) _Section 6.2(a)_ and at
the time of such termination this Agreement could have been terminated by the
Company pursuant to _Section 6.3(b)_ or _Section 6.3(d)_ , then Parent shall
promptly, but in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date of
such termination, pay or cause to be paid to the Company an amount equal to
$8,476,812 (the " _Parent Fee_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available
funds. For the avoidance of doubt in no event shall Parent be required to pay
the Parent Fee on more than one occasion, whether or not the Parent Fee may
be payable under multiple provisions of this Agreement at the same time or at
different times or upon the occurrence of different events.

 

(d) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this _Section
6.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
and that, without these agreements, the parties would not enter into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to  _Section 6.5(b)_ or Parent fails to promptly pay the amount due
pursuant to _Section 6.5(c)_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent
or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or the Company, on the other hand, commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the Company for the amount set forth
in _Section 6.5(b)_ or any portion thereof or a judgment against Parent
for the amount set forth in _Section 6.5(c)_ or any portion thereof, the
Company shall pay to Parent or Merger Sub, on the one hand, or Parent shall
pay to the Company, on the other hand, (i) its reasonable costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) in connection with such suit and (ii)
interest on the amount payable pursuant to such judgment, at the prime rate as
published in the Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was
originally required to be made pursuant to _Section 6.5(b) _ or _Section
6.5(c)_ , as the case may be, with such interest being payable in respect of
the period from the date that payment was originally required to be made
pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_ or _Section 6.5(c)_ , as the case may be,
through the date of payment.

 

(e) In the event that Parent shall receive full payment of the Termination
Fee, the receipt of the Termination Fee, together with any indemnification or
reimbursement owed pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ , shall be deemed to be
liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy of Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Affiliates against the Company, its Subsidiaries and any of
their respective former, current or future equity holders,
controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general or
limited partners, managers, management companies, members,
stockholders, Physician Practices, Affiliates or assignees and any and all
former, current or future equity holders, controlling Persons,

Physician Practices or assignees of any of the foregoing, and any and all
former, current or future heirs, executors, administrators,
trustees, successors or assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, "
_Company Related Parties_ "), and no Company Related Party shall have any
other liability or obligation for any or all losses or damages suffered or
incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination

  

70

hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment thereof) or
any matter forming the basis for the termination of this Agreement, and none
of Parent, Merger Sub, any of their respective Affiliates or any other Person
shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or proceeding
against the Company, any of its Affiliates or any Company Related Party
arising out of this Agreement, any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or
any matters forming the basis for the termination of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) under no circumstances will Parent or Merger Sub be
entitled to amounts in excess of the amount of the Termination Fee (and any
payment pursuant to _Section 6.5(d)_ ) and (ii) although Parent and Merger Sub
may pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section
7.8_ and the payment of the Termination Fee under _Section 6.5(b)_ , under no
circumstances shall Parent or Merger Sub be permitted or entitled to receive
both a grant of specific performance that results in the Closing and any
portion of the Termination Fee.

 

(f) In the event that the Company shall receive full payment of the Parent
Fee, the receipt of the Parent Fee, together with any indemnification or
reimbursement owed pursuant to _Section 4.14(d)_ or _Section 6.5(d)_ , shall
be deemed to be liquidated damages and the sole and exclusive remedy of
Company and its Subsidiaries and stockholders against Parent, Merger Sub and
any of their respective former, current or future equity holders, controlling
Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited partners,
managers, management companies, members, stockholders, Affiliates or
assignees and any and all former, current or future equity holders,
controlling Persons, directors, officers, employees, agents, general or
limited partners, managers, management companies, members, stockholders,
Affiliates or assignees of any of the foregoing, and any and all former,
current or future heirs, executors, administrators, trustees, successors or
assigns of any of the foregoing, and any Financing Source and each Affiliate,
officer, director, employee, controlling Person, advisor, agent, attorney or
representative of any Financing Source (collectively, " _Parent Related
Parties_ "), and no Parent Related Party shall have any other liability or
obligation for any or all losses or damages suffered or incurred by the
Company or any other Person in connection with this Agreement (and the
termination hereof), the transactions contemplated hereby (and the
abandonment thereof) or any matter forming the basis for the termination of
this Agreement, and none of the Company, any of its Affiliates or any other
Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any other claim, action or
proceeding against the Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Party
arising out of this Agreement, the Financing Commitments, the
Limited Guaranty or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, or any
matters forming the basis for the termination of this Agreement. For the
avoidance of doubt, (i) under no circumstances will the Company be entitled to
amounts in excess of the amount of the Parent Fee (and any payment pursuant
to _Section 4.14(d)_ or _Section 6.5(d)_ ) and (ii) although the Company may
pursue both a grant of specific performance in accordance with _Section 7.8_
and the payment of the Parent Fee under _Section 6.5(c)_ , under no
circumstances shall the Company be permitted or entitled to receive both a
grant of specific performance that results in the Closing and any portion of
the Parent Fee.

granting of an injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief
sought in accordance with this _Section 7.8_ on the basis that (i) the party
seeking such remedy has an adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity.

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 7.8(b)_ , it is explicitly agreed that the
Company shall be entitled to enforce specifically the obligations of Parent
and Merger Sub to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to fund the Merger
only in the event that (i) all conditions set forth in _Section 5.1_ and
_Section 5.2_ have been satisfied (other than delivery of items to be
delivered at the Closing and other than satisfaction of those conditions that
by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) at the time when the
Closing would have occurred but for the failure of the Equity Financing to be
funded, (ii) the Debt Financing (or, if alternative financing is being used in
accordance with _Section 4.14_ , pursuant to the commitments with respect
thereto) has been funded or will be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing and (iii) the Company has irrevocably
confirmed that if specific performance is granted and the Equity Financing
and Debt Financing are funded, then it would take such actions required of it
under this Agreement to cause the Closing to occur. For the avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the Company be entitled to enforce or seek to
enforce specifically the obligation of Parent or Merger Sub to cause the
Equity Financing to be funded or to complete the Merger if the Debt Financing
has not been funded (or will not be funded at the Closing if the Equity
Financing is funded at the Closing).

Any party to this Agreement may give any notice or other communication
hereunder using any other means (including ordinary mail or electronic mail),
but no such notice or other communication shall be deemed to have been duly
delivered and received unless and until it is actually received by the party
for whom it is intended. Any party to this Agreement may change the address to

7.10 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Exhibits hereto), the
Company Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Voting
Agreement, the Financing Commitments and the Limited Guaranty constitute the
entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter
hereof, and supersede all other prior agreements, understandings,
representations and warranties by or among the parties hereto, or any of them,
whether written or oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof.

(a) Except as provided (i) in _Section 4.11_ (with respect to which the
Indemnified Parties, each of the other persons who are beneficiaries under the
Current DandO Insurance Policies and their respective heirs and legal
representatives shall be third party beneficiaries, but only following the

Option Consideration shall be enforceable by holders of Company Options and
(3) the provisions of _Article II_ relating to the payment of Company

The representations and warranties in this Agreement are the product of
negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole benefit of the
parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations or warranties are
subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with _Section 7.3_
without notice or liability to any other Person. In some instances, the
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters.
Consequently, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 

(b) The Company acknowledges and agrees that it has no right of recovery
against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Party, whether by or
through attempted piercing of the corporate, limited liability company or
partnership veil, by or through a claim by or on behalf of Parent or Merger
Sub against any other Parent Related Party, by the enforcement of any
assessment or by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any
statute, regulation or applicable Law, or otherwise, except for its rights
(i) against Parent and Merger Sub under, and solely in accordance with the
terms of, this Agreement, (ii) against the Guarantor under, and solely in
accordance with the terms of, the Limited Guaranty (subject to the Cap (as
defined in the Limited Guaranty)), (iii) under, and solely in accordance with
the terms of, the Equity Financing Commitment and (iv) under, and solely in
accordance with the terms of, the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company
hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not institute, and shall cause its
Affiliates not to institute, any proceeding or bring any other claim arising
under, or in connection with, this Agreement, the Equity Financing Commitment
or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or in respect of any oral
representations made or alleged to be made in connection herewith or
therewith, against Parent, Merger Sub or any other Parent Related Party,
except for (1) claims against Parent and/or Merger Sub under, and solely in
accordance with the terms of, this Agreement, (2) claims against the Guarantor
under, and solely in accordance with the terms of, the Limited Guaranty (and

Confidentiality Agreement.

Whenever this Agreement requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action,
such requirement shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of
Parent to cause such Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of the Company to take any action, such requirement
shall be deemed to include an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause
such Subsidiary to take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part
of the Surviving Corporation to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.

 

7.13 _Transfer Taxes_. Except as expressly contemplated in _Section 2.9(b)_ ,
all transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp, recording, registration and
other such Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest thereon) incurred
in connection with the Merger shall be paid by Parent or Merger Sub when due,
and Parent and Merger Sub shall, at their own expense, properly file on a
timely basis all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to
any such Taxes.

7.14 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term
or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In the
event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to negotiate in good faith to replace such
invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term
or provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

7.15 _Company Disclosure Letter_. The Company Disclosure Letter shall be
arranged in Sections corresponding to the Sections of this Agreement. The
disclosure set forth in any particular Section of the Company Disclosure
Letter shall be deemed to be an exception to (or, as applicable, a disclosure
for purposes of) (i) the representations and warranties (or covenants, as
applicable) of the Company that are set forth in the corresponding Section of
this Agreement and (ii) any other representations and warranties (or
covenants, as applicable) of the Company that are set forth in this Agreement,
but, in the case of clause (ii), only if the relevance of that disclosure as
an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) such other representations and
warranties (or covenants, as applicable) is reasonably apparent on the face of
such disclosure. The inclusion of any information in the Company Disclosure
Letter shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgement, in and of
itself, that such information is required by the terms hereof to be disclosed,
is material, has resulted in or would result in a Company Material Adverse
Effect or is outside of the ordinary course of business.

 

7.16 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise, by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties hereto, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , that
(a) prior to the date that the definitive Proxy Statement is printed, Parent
and Merger Sub may assign or transfer their respective rights under this
Agreement to any Affiliate without the prior written consent of the Company
provided that the Commitment Letters and the Limited Guaranty remain in full
force and effect and (b) after the Effective Time, each of Parent and Merger
Sub may assign its rights and obligations hereunder to the Financing Sources
providing the Debt Financing, pursuant to the terms thereof, to the extent
necessary for the purposes of creating a security interest herein or otherwise
assigning as collateral in respect of such Debt Financing; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that no such assignment shall release any assigning party from its
obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
