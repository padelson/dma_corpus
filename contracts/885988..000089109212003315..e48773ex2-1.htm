so surrendered shall immediately be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of
the Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Common Shares that is not registered in the
transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash to be delivered upon compliance with the procedures described above may
be issued to the transferee if the applicable letter of transmittal is accompanied by all documents reasonably required by the
Surviving Corporation to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been
