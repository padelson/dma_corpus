any holder of any Equity Securities of the Constituent Corporations:

          (a) Each share of FEI Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into the right to receive 1.355
Veeco Shares (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION"). Accordingly, 1.355 is hereinafter
referred to as the "EXCHANGE RATIO."

                                      -14-
<Page>

          (b) Each share of common stock of Acquisition issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and exchanged
for one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of
the Surviving Corporation.

          (c) The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect fully the effect
of any stock split, reverse split, stock dividend (including any dividend or
distribution of securities convertible into Veeco Shares or FEI Common Stock),
reorganization, recapitalization or other like change with respect to Veeco
Shares or FEI Common Stock occurring after the date of this Merger Agreement and
prior to the Effective Time or after the Effective Time if the record date with
respect thereto is set after the date of this Merger Agreement and prior to the
Effective Time.

          (d) No fraction of a Veeco Share will be issued in exchange for
surrendered shares of FEI Common Stock, but in lieu thereof each holder of
shares of FEI Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a
Veeco Share (after aggregating all fractional shares of Veeco Shares to be
received by such holder) shall receive from Veeco an amount of cash (rounded to
the nearest whole cent), without interest, equal to the product of (i) such
fraction, multiplied by (ii) the Closing Price Per Share.

          (e) All FEI Common Stock, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, shall no longer be outstanding and
shall be canceled and retired and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a FEI
Stock Certificate shall thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to the
shares of FEI Common Stock represented thereby, except the right to receive the
Merger Consideration for such FEI Common Stock upon the surrender of such FEI
Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section and Section 2.08 hereof.

          (f) If any shares of FEI Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time are unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement with FEI or any other FEI Entity or under which FEI
or any other FEI Entity has any rights, then the Veeco Shares issued in exchange
for such shares of FEI Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
certificates representing such Veeco Shares may accordingly be marked with
appropriate legends. FEI shall use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure
that, from and after the Effective Time, Veeco is entitled to exercise any such
repurchase option or other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase
agreement or other agreement.

     2.07 CLOSING OF FEI'S TRANSFER BOOKS. At the Effective Time, the stock
transfer books of FEI shall be closed with respect to all shares of FEI Common
Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. No further transfer
of any such shares of FEI Common Stock shall be made on such stock transfer
books after the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid
certificate previously representing any shares of FEI Common Stock (a "FEI STOCK
CERTIFICATE") is presented to the Exchange Agent or to the Surviving Corporation
or Veeco, such FEI Stock Certificate shall be canceled, and shall be exchanged
as provided in Section 2.08 hereof.

                                      -15-

     2.08 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES.

          (a) On or prior to the Closing Date, Veeco shall select a reputable
bank or trust company to act as exchange agent in the Merger (the "EXCHANGE
AGENT"). Promptly (but in no event more than three business days) after the
Effective Time, Veeco shall deposit with the Exchange Agent (i) certificates
representing the Veeco Shares issuable pursuant to this Article II and (ii) cash
sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with
Section 2.06(d) hereof. The Veeco Shares and cash amounts so deposited with the
Exchange Agent, together with any dividends or distributions received by the
Exchange Agent with respect to such shares, are referred to herein collectively
as the "EXCHANGE FUND."

          (b) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time (but in
no event more than three business days after the Effective Time), the Exchange
Agent will mail to the record holders of FEI Stock Certificates: (i) a letter of
transmittal in customary form and containing such provisions as Veeco may
reasonably specify (including a provision confirming that delivery of FEI Stock
Certificates shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to FEI Stock
Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of such FEI Stock Certificates to
the Exchange Agent), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
FEI Stock Certificates in exchange for certificates representing Veeco Shares as
contemplated by this Article II. Upon surrender of a FEI Stock Certificate to
the Exchange Agent for exchange, together with a duly executed letter of
transmittal and such other documents as may be reasonably required by the
Exchange Agent or Veeco, (1) the holder of such FEI Stock Certificates shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a certificate representing the number
of whole Veeco Shares that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 2.06 hereof (and an appropriate amount of cash in lieu of
any fractional Veeco Share otherwise issuable), and (2) the FEI Stock
Certificate so surrendered shall be canceled. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this Section 2.08, each FEI Stock Certificate shall be deemed, from and after
the Effective Time, to represent only the right to receive Veeco Shares (and an
appropriate amount of cash in lieu of any fractional Veeco Share otherwise
issuable) as contemplated by this Article II. If any FEI Stock Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, Veeco may, in its reasonable discretion and
as a condition precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Veeco
Shares hereunder, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed FEI Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in such
sum as Veeco may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against the Exchange Agent, Veeco or the Surviving Corporation with respect
to such FEI Stock Certificate.

          (c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect
to Veeco Shares with a record date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered FEI Stock Certificate with respect to the Veeco
Shares that such holder has the right to receive in the Merger until such holder
surrenders such FEI Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 2.08 (at
which time such holder shall be entitled, subject to the effect of applicable
escheat or similar Laws, to receive all such dividends and distributions,
without interest).

          (d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to
holders of FEI Stock Certificates as of the date that is 180 days after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Veeco upon demand, and any holders of FEI
Stock Certificates who have not theretofore surrendered their FEI Stock
Certificates in accordance with this Section 2.08 shall thereafter look

                                      -16-
<Page>

only to Veeco for satisfaction of their claims for Veeco Shares, cash in lieu of
fractional Veeco Shares and any dividends or distributions with respect to Veeco
Shares.

          (e) Each of the Exchange Agent, Veeco and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Merger Agreement to any holder or former
holder of FEI Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or
withheld therefrom under the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign
Tax Law or under any other applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so
deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this
Merger Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such amounts would
otherwise have been paid.

          (f) Neither Veeco nor the Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any
holder or former holder of FEI Common Stock or to any other Person with respect
to any Veeco Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for
any cash amounts, delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property Law, escheat Law or similar Law.

     2.09 TAX CONSEQUENCES. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger is
intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the
Code. The parties to this Merger Agreement hereby adopt this Merger Agreement as
a "plan of reorganization" as described in Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of
the United States Treasury Regulations.

     2.10 SUBSEQUENT ACTION. If, at any time after the Effective Time, Veeco or
the Surviving Corporation shall determine or be advised that any deeds, bills of
sale, assignments, assurances and any other actions or things are necessary,
desirable or proper to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Constituent Corporations as a result of, or
in connection with, the Merger, or to otherwise carry out the purposes of
Merger, the officers and directors of Veeco and the Surviving Corporation shall
be authorized (in the name and on behalf of Acquisition, in the name and on
behalf of FEI or otherwise) to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of
the Constituent Corporations or otherwise, all such deeds, bills of sale,
assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the
Constituent Corporations or otherwise, all such other actions and things as may
be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and all right, title
and interest in, to and under such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving
Corporation or otherwise to carry out the purposes of this Merger Agreement.

III. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF FEI

     FEI hereby represents and warrants to and covenants and agrees with Veeco
and Acquisition that, except as set forth in the FEI Disclosure Schedule:

     3.01 CORPORATE ORGANIZATION.

          (a) FEI is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Oregon. FEI has the corporate power and
authority to own or lease all of its properties and assets and to carry on its
business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by
it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to
be so licensed or qualified would

                                      -17-
<Page>

not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on
FEI. True and complete copies of the Articles of Incorporation and By-Laws of
FEI, as in effect as of the date of this Merger Agreement, have been filed by
FEI as part of the FEI SEC Documents.

          (b) Each Subsidiary of FEI (i) is duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of its jurisdiction of organization, (ii) is duly qualified to do
business and in good standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state or
local or foreign) where its ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of
its business requires it to be so qualified and (iii) has all requisite
corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and assets and to
carry on its business as now conducted, in each case, except as would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on FEI. Section 3.01(b) of the FEI Disclosure Schedule
contains a complete and accurate list of each Subsidiary of FEI, indicating the
jurisdiction of incorporation or organization of each such Subsidiary and FEI's
percentage ownership interest therein (including each type of security held by
FEI of each Subsidiary).

     3.02 CAPITALIZATION.

          (a) The authorized capital stock of FEI consists of 45,000,000 shares
of FEI Common Stock, of which 32,393,766 were issued and outstanding as of June
30, 2002, and 500,000 shares of preferred stock, none of which are outstanding.
All of the outstanding shares of FEI Common Stock have been duly authorized and
validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable, are free of preemptive
rights, with no personal liability attaching to the ownership thereof, and were
issued in conformity with applicable Laws.

          (b) As of June 30, 2002, 3,080,783 shares of FEI Common Stock (in the
aggregate) were issuable upon the exercise of options previously granted, and
1,502,299 shares of FEI Common Stock (in the aggregate) were reserved for
issuance upon the exercise of options available for grant, under FEI's stock
option plans (collectively, the "FEI OPTIONS"), 3,533,926 shares of FEI Common
Stock (in the aggregate) were issuable upon the conversion of FEI's outstanding
$175 million 5.5% Convertible Subordinated Notes due August 15, 2008 (the "FEI
CONVERTIBLE DEBT") and 391,645 shares of FEI Common Stock (in the aggregate)
were reserved for issuance under the FEI ESPP. Except as set forth above, there
are no outstanding Equity Securities, or other obligations to issue or grant any
rights to acquire any Equity Securities, of FEI or any Contracts to restructure
or recapitalize FEI. Other than in connection with the FEI Convertible Debt,
there are no outstanding Contracts of FEI or any Subsidiary of FEI to
repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Equity Securities of FEI or any
Subsidiary of FEI. From December 31, 2001 to the date of this Merger Agreement,
no shares of FEI capital stock have been issued except pursuant to the exercise
of FEI Options, the FEI Convertible Debt or under the FEI ESPP. As of June 30,
2002, no shares of FEI capital stock were reserved for issuance, except for
1,893,944 shares of FEI Common Stock reserved for issuance upon exercise of FEI
Options, the FEI Convertible Debt and under the FEI ESPP. FEI has no issued or
outstanding Voting Debt.

          (c) FEI owns, directly or indirectly, all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock or other equity ownership interests of each
Subsidiary of FEI, free and clear of any Liens, and all of such shares or equity
ownership interests are duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid,
non-assessable and free of preemptive rights, with no personal liability
attaching to the ownership thereof. No Subsidiary of FEI has or is bound by any
outstanding subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, commitments or agreements
of any character calling for the purchase or issuance of

                                      -18-
<Page>

any shares of capital stock or any other Equity Security of such Subsidiary or
any securities representing the right to purchase or otherwise receive any
shares of capital stock or any other equity security of such Subsidiary. Section
3.02(c) of the FEI Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of each material
investment of FEI in the equity (or any security convertible or exchangeable
into equity) of any Person other than its Subsidiaries.

     3.03 AUTHORIZATION. FEI has full corporate power and authority to execute,
deliver and perform this Merger Agreement and the Articles of Merger, and to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. The execution,
delivery and performance of this Merger Agreement, the Articles of Merger and
all other documents and agreements to be delivered pursuant hereto and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized by the Board of Directors of FEI, and no other corporate proceedings
on the part of FEI (other than the Required FEI Stockholder Vote and the filing
of the Articles of Merger) are necessary to authorize this Merger Agreement, the
Articles of Merger and any such related documents or agreements or to consummate
the transactions contemplated hereby. This Merger Agreement has been duly and
validly executed and delivered by FEI and the Articles of Merger, when executed
at the Closing, will be duly and validly executed and delivered by FEI. This
Merger Agreement, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by each
of the other parties hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding agreement of
FEI, enforceable in accordance with its terms, and the Articles of Merger, when
executed by FEI at the Closing, assuming the due authorization, execution and
delivery by each of the other parties thereto, will be legal, valid and binding
agreements of FEI, enforceable in accordance with their respective terms except
as may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, moratorium, insolvency,
reorganization, fraudulent conveyance or other Laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally or by general equitable principles.

     3.04 REPORTS. All FEI SEC Documents were filed as and when required by the
Exchange Act or the Securities Act, as applicable. All documents required to be
filed as exhibits to the FEI SEC Documents have been so filed. The FEI SEC
Documents include all statements, reports and documents required to be filed by
FEI pursuant to the Exchange Act and the Securities Act. The FEI SEC Documents
comply in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and
the Securities Act, as applicable, and none of the FEI SEC Documents, as of
their respective filing dates, contained any untrue statement of a material fact
or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
were made, not misleading. None of FEI's Subsidiaries is required to file any
statements, reports or documents with the SEC. The financial statements of FEI
and its Subsidiaries, including the notes thereto, included in the FEI SEC
Documents (the "FEI FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") complied in all material respects
with applicable accounting requirements and with the published rules and
regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their respective dates (except
as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the case of unaudited statements
included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the
SEC). The FEI Financial Statements fairly present the consolidated financial
condition, operating results and cash flows of FEI and its Subsidiaries at the
dates and during the periods indicated therein in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to normal
year-end adjustments and additional footnote disclosures). There has been no
material change in FEI's accounting policies except as described in the notes to
the FEI Financial Statements. At all times since January 1, 1999, FEI has (i)
filed as and

                                      -19-
<Page>

when due all documents required to be filed with NASDAQ, and (ii) otherwise
timely performed all of FEI's obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations
of NASDAQ.

     3.05 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. The FEI Entities do not have any
obligations or liabilities of any nature (whether matured or unmatured,
absolute, accrued, fixed or contingent) other than those (i) set forth or
adequately provided for in the Balance Sheet of FEI and its Subsidiaries
included in FEI's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2001 (the "FEI Balance Sheet"), (ii) not required to be set forth on the FEI
Balance Sheet under GAAP consistently applied, (iii) incurred in the ordinary
course of business since the FEI Balance Sheet Date, and consistent with past
practice or (iv) which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on FEI.

     3.06 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS.

          (a) Each of the FEI Entities has complied with, is not in violation
of, and has not received any notices of violation with respect to, any federal,
state, local or foreign statute, Law or regulation with respect to the conduct
of its business, or the ownership or operation of its business, except for such
violations or failures to comply as could not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FEI.

          (b) Each of the FEI Entities has obtained each federal, state, county,
local or foreign governmental Consent, approval, certificate, license, permit,
grant, or other authorization of a Governmental Authority that is required for
the operation of its business or the holding of any interest in its properties
(collectively, the "FEI AUTHORIZATIONS"), and all of such FEI Authorizations are
in full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain or have any of such
FEI Authorizations could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on FEI.

     3.07 NO CONFLICTS.

          (a) The execution, delivery and performance by FEI of this Merger
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
(i) violate any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or By-Laws or other
organizational documents of FEI or any other FEI Entity, (ii) violate, or be in
conflict with, or constitute a default (or an event which, with notice or lapse
of time or both, would constitute a default) under, or result in or provide the
basis for the termination of, or accelerate the performance required by, or
excuse performance by any Person of any of its obligations under, or cause the
acceleration of the maturity, or trigger any repurchase obligation, of any debt
or obligation pursuant to, or result in the creation or imposition of any Lien
upon any property or assets of FEI or any other FEI Entity under, any material
Contract to which FEI or any other FEI Entity is a party or by which any of
their respective properties or assets are bound, or to which any of the property
or assets of FEI or any other FEI Entity are subject, except for Contracts
wherein the other party thereto has consented to the consummation of the Merger
or irrevocably waived in writing its right to take any action contemplated in
this clause (ii), (iii) violate any Law applicable to FEI or any other FEI
Entity or (iv) violate or result in the revocation or suspension of any material
license, permit, certificate, Consent or approval from a Governmental Authority
that is necessary for the business and operations of FEI or any other FEI
Entity.

                                      -20-
<Page>

          (b) No filing or registration with, or permit, authorization, Consent
or approval of, or notification or disclosure to, any Governmental Authority is
required by FEI or any other FEI Entity in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Merger Agreement or the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby, except (i) in connection with the
applicable requirements of the HSR Act or any other Regulatory Law and any other
applicable anti-trust or competition approvals, (ii) in connection with the
provisions of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, and the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, (iii) the filing of appropriate merger documents as required by the
DGCL and OBCA, (iv) Consents, filings or exemptions in connection with
compliance with the rules of NASDAQ, (v) such Consents, orders, registrations,
declarations and filings as may be required under the laws of various states or
(vi) such other Consents, filings and registrations the failure of which to
obtain would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
FEI.

     3.08 CONTRACTS.

          (a) Neither FEI nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is bound
by any written contract, arrangement or commitment (i) with respect to the
employment of any directors, officers or employees other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the
consummation or stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Merger Agreement, will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional
acts or events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise)
becoming due from FEI, Veeco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof, (iii) which is a
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC) to be performed, entirely or in part, after the date of this
Merger Agreement, but which has not been previously filed with the SEC, (iv)
which are of the type required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K
of the SEC, but which has not been previously filed with the SEC, (v) which
materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by FEI or any
Subsidiary thereof or, upon consummation of the Merger, will materially restrict
the ability of Veeco or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to
engage in any proposed line of business or (vi) which, upon the consummation or
stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement,
will result in any of the Veeco Entities or any of the FEI Entities, granting
any rights or licenses to any material Intellectual Property of any of the Veeco
Entities or any of the FEI Entities, to any third party. Each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section
3.08(a), whether or not set forth in the FEI Disclosure Schedule, is referred to
herein as a "FEI CONTRACT".

          (b) (i) Each FEI Contract is valid and binding on FEI and any of its
Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, as applicable, and is in full force and
effect (except to the extent such contract has expired or terminated according
to its terms), (ii) FEI and each of its Subsidiaries has in all material
respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to date under
each FEI Contract, except where such noncompliance, either individually or in
the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on FEI, and (iii) neither FEI nor any of its Subsidiaries, knows of, or
has received notice of, the existence of any event or condition which
constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will constitute, a
material default on the part of FEI or any of its Subsidiaries under any such
FEI Contract, except where such default, either individually or in the
aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on
FEI.

                                      -21-
<Page>

     3.09 LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the FEI SEC Documents prior to the
date hereof, (i) there is no private or governmental action, suit, proceeding,
claim, arbitration or investigation pending before any agency, court or
tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, to the knowledge of FEI, Threatened against
FEI or any other FEI Entity or any of their respective properties or any of
their respective officers or directors (in their capacities as such) that,
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FEI, and (ii) there is no judgment, decree or order
against FEI or any other FEI Entity or, to the knowledge of FEI, any of their
respective directors or officers (in their capacities as such) that could
prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay any of the transactions contemplated
by this Merger Agreement, or that could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FEI.

     3.10 TAXES. FEI and each of the FEI Entities has filed or caused to be
filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns that are or were required to be filed by
FEI and/or any of the other FEI Entities, either separately or as part of an
affiliated group of corporations, pursuant to the Laws of any Governmental
Authority with taxing power over any of the FEI Entities or its assets and
business. All Tax Returns filed by any of the FEI Entities are true, correct and
complete. FEI and each of the FEI Entities has paid all Taxes that have become
due by it pursuant to those Tax Returns or pursuant to any assessment received
by any of the FEI Entities, except such Taxes, if any, as are being contested in
good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided in the FEI
Financial Statements. All Taxes that FEI or any of the FEI Entities is, or was,
required by Law to withhold and collect have been duly withheld and collected
and, to the extent required, have been paid to the appropriate Governmental
Authority. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or other contract covering
any employee or independent contractor of FEI or any of the FEI Entities that
would give rise to the payment of any amount that would not be deductible by
Veeco or any of the Veeco Entities or the Surviving Corporation pursuant to
Section 280G or Section 162(m) of the Code. FEI is not a "United States real
property holding corporation," as defined in Section 897(c)(2) of the Code. The
charges, accruals and reserves with respect to Taxes on the FEI Financial
Statements with respect to each of the FEI Entities (excluding any provision for
deferred income taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and
tax income) for all tax periods (or portions thereof) ending on or before the
Closing Date (including any period for which no Tax Return has yet been filed)
are adequate.

     3.11 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Except as disclosed in or filed as an
exhibit to the FEI SEC Documents prior to the date hereof, since December 31,
2001 (the "FEI Balance Sheet Date"), the FEI Entities have conducted their
business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has not
occurred: (i) any change, event or condition (whether or not covered by
insurance) that has resulted in, or might reasonably be expected to result in, a
Material Adverse Effect to FEI; (ii) any acquisition, sale or transfer of any
material asset of the FEI Entities other than in the ordinary course of business
and consistent with past practice; (iii) any change in accounting methods or
practices (including any change in depreciation or amortization policies or
rates) by FEI or any revaluation by FEI of any of its assets; (iv) any
declaration, setting aside, or payment of a dividend or other distribution with
respect to the shares of FEI Common Stock or any other FEI Equity Securities
(excluding interest payments on the FEI Convertible Debt contemplated by the
Indenture relating thereto), or any direct or indirect redemption, purchase or
other acquisition by FEI of any of its shares of capital stock; (v) any material
Contract entered into by any FEI Entity, other than in the ordinary course of
business, or any material amendment or termination of, or default under, any
material Contract to which any FEI Entity is a party or by which any of them is
bound; or (vi) any

                                      -22-
<Page>

agreement by any FEI Entity to do any of the things described in the preceding
clauses (i) through (v) (other than negotiations with Veeco and its

Agreement).

     3.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; LABOR MATTERS.

          (a) There does not now exist any and, to the knowledge of FEI, there
are no existing circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in,
any Controlled Group Liability to FEI or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FEI. No FEI Benefit Plan is (i) a "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (ii) a "multiple
employer plan" as defined in ERISA or the Code, or (iii) a "funded welfare plan"
within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code. None of the FEI Benefit Plans
provides for any welfare or other non-pension benefits to retired or former
employees, except to the extent required by the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state law.

          (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on FEI, (i) each of the FEI Benefit
Plans has been operated and administered in all material respects in accordance
with applicable law and administrative rules and regulations of any Governmental
Authority, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code, and (ii) there are
no pending or, to the knowledge of FEI, Threatened claims (other than claims for
benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or arbitrations that have been
asserted or instituted, and, to the knowledge of FEI, no set of circumstances
exists, that may reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the FEI
Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the FEI
Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the FEI Benefit
Plans that could reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of
FEI or any of its Subsidiaries to the PBGC, the U.S. Department of the Treasury,
the U.S. Department of Labor, any FEI Benefit Plan, any participant in a FEI
Benefit Plan, or any other party. There are no unpaid contributions due prior to
the date hereof with respect to any FEI Benefit Plan that are required to have
been made under its terms and provisions, any related insurance contract or any
applicable law.

          (c) Neither FEI nor any Subsidiary of FEI is a party to any collective
bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to individuals employed by
FEI or any Subsidiary of FEI, and no collective bargaining agreement or other
labor union contract is being negotiated by FEI or any Subsidiary of FEI. Except
as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on FEI,
(i) there is no labor dispute, strike, slowdown or work stoppage against FEI or
any Subsidiary of FEI pending or, to the knowledge of FEI, Threatened against
FEI or any Subsidiary of FEI and (ii) no unfair labor practice or labor charge
or complaint has occurred with respect to FEI or any Subsidiary of FEI.

          (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Merger Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) will (i) result in any payment or benefit
(including, without limitation, option acceleration, severance, unemployment
compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any
director, consultant or any current or former employee of FEI or any
Subsidiaries of FEI under any FEI consultant Benefit Plan or otherwise; (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any FEI

                                      -23-
<Page>

Benefit Plan; (iii) result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting
of any such benefits; (iv) require the funding of any trust or other funding
vehicle; or (v) limit or prohibit the ability to amend, merge, terminate or
receive a reversion of assets from any FEI Benefit Plan or related trust.

          (e) There has been no disallowance of a deduction, or reasonable
expectation of a disallowance of a deduction, under Section 162(m) of the Code
for employee compensation of any amount paid or payable by FEI or any Subsidiary
of FEI that, either individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on FEI.

          (f) Section 3.12(f) of the FEI Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of each material FEI Benefit Plan.

          (g) FEI has heretofore made available to Veeco true and complete
copies of each of the FEI Benefit Plans (and all related trust agreements,
insurance contracts and other ancillary documents) and, to the extent
applicable, (i)the actuarial report for such FEI Benefit Plan for each of the
last two years, (ii)the most recent determination letter from the IRS for such
FEI Benefit Plan, (iii)the summary plan description for such FEI Benefit Plan,
and (iv)the Form 5500 for such FEI Benefit Plan for each of the last two years,
and all schedules thereto. Since the date of the documents made available, there
has not been any material change in the assets or liabilities of any of the FEI
Benefit Plans or any change in their terms and operations that could reasonably
be expected to affect or alter the tax status or materially affect the cost of
maintaining such Plan, and none of the FEI Benefit Plans has been or will be
amended prior to the Closing Date to the extent such amendment will materially
affect the cost of maintaining such Plans. Each of the FEI Benefit Plans can be
amended, modified or terminated by FEI or a Subsidiary of FEI within a period of
30 days, without payment of any additional compensation or amount or the
additional vesting or acceleration of any such benefits, except to the extent
that such vesting is required under the Code upon the complete or partial
termination of any FEI Benefit Plan intended to be qualified within the meaning
of Section 401(a) of the Code.

          (h) Each FEI Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
IRS as to the qualification of such plan (or is a prototype plan entitled to
rely on a favorable determination, opinion or advisory letter issued to the
prototype sponsor), or has remaining a period of time under applicable Treasury
regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to receive such a determination. For
each FEI Benefit Plan that has received such a determination, such letter has
not been modified, revoked or limited by the failure to satisfy any condition
thereof or by a subsequent amendment thereto, or failure to amend such FEI
Benefit Plan.

          (i) Except as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on FEI, no individual
who has been classified by FEI as a non-employee (such as an independent
contractor, leased employee or consultant) would reasonably be expected to have
a claim against FEI for eligibility to participate in any FEI Benefit Plan, if
such individual is later reclassified as a FEI employee.

          (j) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on FEI, all FEI Benefit Plans
subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have
been maintained in accordance with all applicable

                                      -24-
<Page>

requirements, (ii) if they are intended to qualify for special tax treatment
meet all requirements for such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be
funded and/or book-reserved are fully funded and/or book reserved, as
appropriate, based upon reasonable actuarial assumptions.

     3.13 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

          (a) FEI and its Subsidiaries own, or are licensed to use, all FEI
Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of FEI, the business and operations of
FEI and its Subsidiaries as they are currently conducted do not infringe on the
rights of any third party where such infringement, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on any
Material FEI Entity or any material business or product offering of FEI or any
of its Subsidiaries, and, to the extent material FEI Intellectual Property is
licensed from a third party, FEI's use of such Intellectual Property is in
accordance in all material respects with the applicable license pursuant to
which FEI acquired the right to use such Intellectual Property. To the knowledge
of FEI, no third party is challenging, infringing on or otherwise violating any
right of FEI in the FEI Intellectual Property where such infringement,
individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on any Material FEI Entity or any material business or
product offering of FEI or any of its Subsidiaries. Neither FEI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any pending claim, order or
proceeding with respect to any material FEI Intellectual Property, nor has FEI
received any written demand from any other party to cease and desist from
infringement of such other party's Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of
FEI, no material Intellectual Property owned or licensed by FEI is being used or
enforced by FEI or its Subsidiaries in a manner that would reasonably be
expected to result in the abandonment, estoppel, cancellation or
unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

          (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by FEI
and the consummation by FEI of the transactions contemplated hereby will not (i)
constitute a breach by FEI or its Subsidiaries of any material instrument or
agreement governing any FEI Intellectual Property, (ii) pursuant to the terms of
any material license or agreement relating to any FEI Intellectual Property,
cause the material modification of any terms of any such license or agreement,
including but not limited to the modification of the effective rate of any
royalties or other payments provided for in any such license or agreement, (iii)
cause the forfeiture or termination of any FEI Intellectual Property under the
terms thereof, (iv) give rise to a right of forfeiture or termination of any FEI
Intellectual Property under the terms thereof or (v) impair the right of FEI,
its Subsidiaries or, to FEI's knowledge, Veeco to make, have made, offer for
sale, use, sell, export or license any products or processes used by FEI, its
Subsidiaries or, to FEI's knowledge, Veeco in the conduct of their business as
it is currently configured, except in each case for those matters that
individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on FEI.

          (c) Each item of material FEI Intellectual Property owned by FEI or a
Subsidiary thereof (the "FEI-OWNED IP") (i) is free and clear of any Liens or
filings required under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any
jurisdiction; (ii) is not subject to any outstanding judicial order, decree,
judgment or stipulation or to any agreement materially restricting the scope of
FEI's or such Subsidiary's use thereof; and (iii) together with each item of
material FEI Intellectual Property which FEI or such Subsidiary has a right to
use or practice pursuant to one or more license or similar agreements, is not
subject to any suits, actions, written claims or demands of any third party and
no action or proceeding, whether judicial, administrative, has been instituted,
is pending or, to FEI's

                                      -25-
<Page>

knowledge, Threatened, which challenges or affects the rights of FEI or such
Subsidiary in the same manner.

          (d) Neither FEI nor any Subsidiary thereof has entered into any
agreement to indemnify any third party against any claim of infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of FEI Intellectual Property rights other
than indemnification provisions contained in purchase orders, customer
agreements or similar agreements arising in the ordinary course of business.

          (e) To the knowledge of FEI and its Subsidiaries, (a) all rights in
all inventions and discoveries made, developed or conceived by any current or
former officer, employee, independent contractor, consultant or any other agent
of FEI or any Subsidiary thereof during the course of their employment (or other
retention) by FEI or a Subsidiary thereof and material to the business of FEI or
a Subsidiary thereof and which are the subject of one or more issued letters
patent or applications for letters patent have been assigned in writing to FEI
or a Subsidiary thereof; and (b) the policy of FEI or a Subsidiary thereof
requires each employee of FEI or a Subsidiary thereof to sign documents
confirming that he or she assign to FEI or a Subsidiary thereof all Intellectual
Property rights made, written, developed or conceived by him or her during the
course of his or her employment (or other retention) by FEI or a Subsidiary
thereof and relating to the business of FEI or a Subsidiary thereof to the
extent that ownership of any such Intellectual Property rights does not vest in
FEI or a Subsidiary thereof by operation of Law.

          (f) FEI believes that FEI and its Subsidiaries have taken reasonable
and practicable steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of any
material FEI Intellectual Property that it wishes to remain confidential ("FEI
CONFIDENTIAL IP INFORMATION"). FEI believes that all use by FEI and its
Subsidiaries of FEI Confidential IP Information not owned by FEI and its
Subsidiaries has been and is pursuant to the terms of a written agreement
between FEI or a Subsidiary thereof and the owner of such Confidential
Information, or is otherwise lawful.

     3.14 ABSENCE OF LIENS; TITLE TO PROPERTY.

          (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "FEI Real Property" means all
interests in real property including, fee estates, leaseholds and subleaseholds,
purchase options, easements, licenses, privileges, hereditaments, appurtenances,
rights to access and rights of way, and all fixtures, buildings, structures and
other improvements thereon, owned or used by FEI, together with any additions
thereto or replacements thereof.

          (b) Section 3.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedule contains the true and
correct street address of all FEI Real Property owned by FEI (the "FEI Owned
Real Property") and contains the true and correct street address of all FEI Real
Property leased by FEI and exceeding 10,000 square feet of leased area,
excluding, however, any FEI Owned Real Property or leased FEI Real Property
identified in FEI's financial statements or the FEI SEC Documents (the "FEI
Leased Real Property"). There is no other material real property that is owned
or leased by FEI or used in or necessary for the conduct of business as
presently conducted.

          (c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on FEI, all leases for material FEI Leased Real Property (the
"FEI Leases") are in good standing, valid and effective in accordance with their
respective terms, and neither FEI nor any of its

                                      -26-
<Page>

Subsidiaries, nor to FEI's knowledge, any other party to a FEI Lease, is in
material breach, violation or default under, and neither FEI nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received written notice that it has breached, violated or
defaulted under, any of the terms or conditions of any FEI Lease. FEI has
provided Veeco with true, complete and correct copies of each FEI Lease.

          (d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on FEI, the FEI Real Property and all present uses and operations
of the FEI Real Property comply with all applicable Laws, Court Orders,
Governmental Permits, restrictions of any Governmental Body having jurisdiction
over any portion of the FEI Real Property (including, those relating to zoning,
land use, safety, health, employment and employment practices and access by the
handicapped), covenants, conditions, restrictions, easements, disposition
agreements and similar matters affecting the FEI Real Property. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on FEI, FEI has
obtained all approvals of any Governmental Body (including, certificates of use
and occupancy, licenses and permits) required in connection with the
construction, ownership, use, and occupation of the FEI Real Property and
operation of its business. (e) FEI and each of its Subsidiaries has good and
valid title to, or, in the case of leased assets, valid leasehold interests in,
all of its material tangible assets used in its business, free and clear of any
Liens, except (i) Liens reflected in the FEI Financial Statements or the FEI SEC
Documents; (ii) Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable; and (iii) Liens which
are not material to FEI and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     3.15 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

     Except as disclosed in the FEI SEC Documents:

          (a) The FEI Entities have conducted all Hazardous Substance Activities
relating to the business in compliance in all material respects with all
applicable Environmental Laws. The Hazardous Substance Activities of the FEI
Entities prior to the Closing have not resulted in the exposure of any person to
a Hazardous Substance in a manner which could reasonably be expected to result
in a Material Adverse Effect on FEI. The FEI Entities have obtained all material
permits, licenses and approvals necessary or required under all applicable
Environmental Laws for the ownership and operation of their business
("Environmental Permits"). All such Environmental Permits are valid and in full
force and effect. The FEI Entities have not received written notice of any
action to revoke or modify any of such Environmental Permits, and, to FEI's
knowledge, the ownership and operation of the FEI Entities' business is and has
been in material compliance with all terms and conditions thereof. The FEI
Entities have not received notice of any pending or Threatened claim by any
Governmental Authority or any other Person concerning potential liability of any
of the FEI Entities under Environmental Laws in connection with the ownership or
operation of its business. Except in compliance with Environmental Laws and in a
manner that could not reasonably be expected to subject the FEI Entities to
material liability, to the knowledge of the FEI Entities, no Hazardous
Substances are present on any real property currently owned, operated, occupied,
controlled or leased by the FEI Entities or were present on any other real
property at the time it ceased to be owned, operated, occupied, controlled or
leased by the FEI Entities.

                                      -27-
<Page>

          (b) The FEI Entities have made all disclosures, including notice of a
Release or Threatened Release of a Hazardous Substance, required of any FEI
Entity under any Environmental Law.

          (c) No FEI Entity has received written notice, or otherwise obtained
knowledge, of the existence of any circumstances or conditions that would
reasonably be expected to result in any material environmental liability.

          (d) No FEI Entity has received written notice or otherwise obtained
knowledge of any material liability with respect to any Hazardous Substance,
which it has transported or arranged for the transportation of to premises not
owned or operated by any FEI Entity.

     3.16 BROKERS AND FINDERS. Except for Credit Suisse First Boston ("FEI'S
BROKER"), no broker, finder, agent or similar intermediary has acted on FEI's
behalf in connection with this Merger Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby, and there are no brokerage commissions, finders' fees or similar fees or
commissions payable in connection therewith based on any Contract with FEI or
any action taken by FEI. FEI shall pay all fees and disbursements of FEI's
Broker.

     3.17 REORGANIZATION. Neither FEI nor any of its Subsidiaries has taken any
action or has knowledge of any fact or circumstance that would reasonably be
expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code.

     3.18 BOARD APPROVAL. The Board of Directors of FEI has unanimously (i)
determined that the Merger is advisable, consistent with and in the furtherance
of the long-term business strategy of FEI and fair to, and in the best interests
of, FEI and its stockholders, (ii) approved this Merger Agreement, the Merger

the opinion of FEI's Broker, dated the date of this Agreement, to the effect
that, as of such date, the Exchange Ratio was fair, from a financial point of
view, to the stockholders of FEI (other than Philips and its Affiliates).

     3.20 RESTRICTIONS ON BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. There is no material agreement,
judgment, injunction, order or decree binding upon FEI or any of its
Subsidiaries which has or, to its knowledge, reasonably could be expected to
have the effect of prohibiting or materially impairing any current or proposed
future business practice of FEI or any of its Subsidiaries, any proposed
acquisition of property by FEI or any of its Subsidiaries or the conduct of
business by FEI or any of its Subsidiaries as currently conducted or as proposed
to be conducted by FEI or any of its Subsidiaries.

     3.21 STATE ANTI-TAKEOVER STATUTES. FEI has granted all approvals and taken
all other steps necessary to exempt the FEI Stockholder Voting Agreements, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby from the requirements and
provisions of Section 835 of the OBCA and other state anti-takeover statutes or
regulations to the extent applicable such that none of the provisions of such
"business combination," "moratorium," "control share," or other state
anti-takeover statute or regulation (a) applies to this Merger Agreement or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, (b)

                                      -28-

Merger Agreement or its ability to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby, (c) would have the effect of invalidating or
voiding this Merger Agreement or any provisions hereof or (d) would subject FEI
to any material impediment or condition in connection with the exercise of any
of its rights under this Merger Agreement.

     3.22 OWNERSHIP OF VEECO STOCK. As of the date of this Merger Agreement,
neither FEI nor any of its Subsidiaries own any Veeco Shares. 3.23 FORM S-4

to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein not
misleading and (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement will, on the date of the mailing
of the Joint Proxy Statement and any amendments or supplements thereto, at the
time of each of the FEI Stockholders' Meeting and the Veeco Stockholders'
Meeting, and at the Effective Time, contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not false or misleading, or omit to state any
material fact necessary to correct any statement in any earlier communication
with respect to the solicitation of proxies for the FEI Stockholders Meeting or
the Veeco Stockholders Meeting, which has become false or misleading. The Joint
Proxy Statement will comply, as of its mailing date, as to form in all material
respects with all applicable Laws, including the provisions of the Exchange Act,
except that no representation is made by FEI with respect to information
supplied by Veeco or Acquisition for inclusion therein.

carry on its business as it is now being conducted, and is duly licensed or
qualified to do business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the
business conducted by it or the character or location of the properties and
assets owned or leased by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary,

in effect as of the date of this Merger Agreement, have been filed by Veeco as

requisite corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as now conducted, in each case, except as
would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco. Section 4.01(b) of the

as of their respective filing dates, contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the circumstances
in which they were made, not misleading. None of Veeco's Subsidiaries is
required to file any statements, reports or documents with the SEC. The
financial statements of Veeco and its Subsidiaries, including the notes thereto,
included in the Veeco SEC Documents (the "VEECO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS") complied
in all material respects with applicable accounting requirements and with the
published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto as of their
respective dates (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto or, in the
case of unaudited statements included in Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, as
permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC). The Veeco Financial Statements fairly
present the consolidated financial condition, operating results and cash flows
of Veeco and its Subsidiaries at the dates and during the periods indicated
therein in accordance with GAAP consistently applied (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to normal year-end adjustments and additional footnote
disclosures). There has been no material change in Veeco's accounting policies
except as described in the notes to the Veeco Financial Statements. At all times
since January 1, 1999, Veeco has (i) filed as and when due all documents
required to be filed with NASDAQ, and (ii) otherwise timely performed all of
Veeco's obligations pursuant to the rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

     4.05 NO UNDISCLOSED LIABILITIES. The Veeco Entities do not have any
obligations or liabilities of any nature (whether matured or unmatured,
absolute, accrued, fixed or contingent) other than those (i) set forth or
adequately provided for in the Balance Sheet of Veeco and its Subsidiaries

                                      -31-
<Page>

included in Veeco's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2001 (the "Veeco Balance Sheet"), (ii) not required to be set forth on the Veeco
Balance Sheet under GAAP consistently applied, (iii) incurred in the ordinary
course of business since the Veeco Balance Sheet Date and consistent with past
practice or (iv) which, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a
Material Adverse Effect on Veeco.

     4.06 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW; GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORIZATIONS.

          (a) Each of the Veeco Entities has complied with, is not in violation
of, and has not received any notices of violation with respect to, any federal,
state, local or foreign statute, Law or regulation with respect to the conduct
of its business, or the ownership or operation of its business, except for such
violations or failures to comply as could not be reasonably expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Veeco.

          (b) Each of the Veeco Entities has obtained each federal, state,
county, local or foreign governmental Consent, approval, certificate, license,
permit, grant, or other authorization of a Governmental Authority that is
required for the operation of its business or the holding of any interest in its
properties (collectively, the "VEECO Authorizations"), and all of such Veeco
Authorizations are in full force and effect, except where the failure to obtain
or have any of such Veeco Authorizations could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco.

     4.07 NO CONFLICTS.

          (a) The execution, delivery and performance by Veeco and Acquisition
of this Merger Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will not (i) violate any provision of the Certificate of Incorporation or
By-Laws or other organizational documents of Veeco or Acquisition or any other
Veeco Entity, (ii) violate, or be in conflict with, or constitute a default (or
an event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default) under, or result in or provide the basis for the termination of, or
accelerate the performance required by, or excuse performance by any Person of
any of its obligations under, or cause the acceleration of the maturity, or
trigger any repurchase obligation, of any debt or obligation pursuant to, or
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien upon any property or assets of
Veeco or Acquisition or any other Veeco Entity under, any material Contract to
which Veeco or Acquisition or any other Veeco Entity is a party or by which any
of their respective properties or assets are bound, or to which any of the
property or assets of Veeco or Acquisition or any other Veeco Entity are
subject, except for Contracts wherein the other party thereto has consented to
the consummation of the Merger or irrevocably waived in writing its right to
take any action contemplated in this clause (ii), (iii) violate any Law
applicable to Veeco or Acquisition or any other Veeco Entity or (iv) violate or
result in the revocation or suspension of any material license, permit,

or approval of, or notification or disclosure to, any Governmental Authority is
required by Veeco or Acquisition or any other Veeco Entity in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Merger Agreement or the consummation of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby, except (i) in connection
with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act or any

                                      -32-
<Page>

other Regulatory Law and any other applicable anti-trust or competition

rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, and the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, (iii) the filing of appropriate merger
documents as required by the DGCL and OBCA, (iv) Consents, filings or exemptions
in connection with compliance with the rules of NASDAQ, (v) such Consents,
orders, registrations, declarations and filings as may be required under the
laws of various states or (vi) such other Consents, filings and registrations

Material Adverse Effect on Veeco.

     4.08 CONTRACTS.

          (a) Neither Veeco nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or is
bound by any written contract, arrangement or commitment (i) with respect to the
employment of any directors, officers or employees other than in the ordinary
course of business consistent with past practice, (ii) which, upon the
consummation or stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Merger Agreement, will (either alone or upon the occurrence of any additional
acts or events) result in any payment (whether of severance pay or otherwise)
becoming due from FEI, Veeco, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any officer or employee thereof, (iii) which is a
"material contract" (as such term is defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC) to be performed, entirely or in part, after the date of this
Merger Agreement, but which has not been previously filed with the SEC, (iv)
which are of the type required to be disclosed under Item 404 of Regulation S-K
of the SEC, but which has not been previously filed with the SEC, (v) which
materially restricts the conduct of any line of business by Veeco or any
Subsidiary thereof or, upon consummation of the Merger, will materially restrict
the ability of Veeco or the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary thereof to
engage in any proposed line of business or (vi) which, upon the consummation or
stockholder approval of the transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement,
will result in any of the FEI Entities or any of the Veeco Entities, granting
any rights or licenses to any material Intellectual Property of any of the FEI
Entities or any of the Veeco Entities, to any third party. Each contract,
arrangement, commitment or understanding of the type described in this Section
4.08(a), whether or not set forth in the Veeco Disclosure Schedule, is referred
to herein as a "VEECO CONTRACT".

          (b) (i) Each Veeco Contract is valid and binding on Veeco and any of
its Subsidiaries that is a party thereto, as applicable, and is in full force
and effect (except to the extent such contract has expired or terminated
according to its terms), (ii) Veeco and each of its Subsidiaries has in all
material respects performed all obligations required to be performed by it to
date under each Veeco Contract, except where such noncompliance, either
individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Veeco, and (iii) neither Veeco nor any of its
Subsidiaries, knows of, or has received notice of, the existence of any event or
condition which constitutes, or, after notice or lapse of time or both, will
constitute, a material default on the part of Veeco or any of its Subsidiaries
under any such Veeco Contract, except where such default, either individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Veeco.

     4.09 LITIGATION. Except as disclosed in the Veeco SEC Documents prior to
the date hereof, (i) there is no private or governmental action, suit,
proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending before any agency, court
or tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, to the knowledge of Veeco,

                                      -33-
<Page>

Threatened against Veeco or any other Veeco Entity or any of their respective
properties or any of their respective officers or directors (in their capacities
as such) that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco, and (ii) there is no judgment, decree
or order against Veeco or any other Veeco Entity or, to the knowledge of Veeco,
any of their respective directors or officers (in their capacities as such) that
could prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay any of the transactions
contemplated by this Merger Agreement, or that could reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco.

     4.10 TAXES. Veeco and each of the Veeco Entities has filed or caused to be
filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns that are or were required to be filed by
Veeco and/or any of the other Veeco Entities, either separately or as part of an
affiliated group of corporations, pursuant to the Laws of any Governmental
Authority with taxing power over any of the Veeco Entities or its assets and
business. All Tax Returns filed by any of the Veeco Entities are true, correct
and complete. Veeco and each of the Veeco Entities has paid all Taxes that have
become due by it pursuant to those Tax Returns or pursuant to any assessment
received by any of the Veeco Entities, except such Taxes, if any, as are being
contested in good faith and as to which adequate reserves have been provided in
the Veeco Financial Statements. All Taxes that Veeco or any of the Veeco
Entities is, or was, required by Law to withhold and collect have been duly
withheld and collected and, to the extent required, have been paid to the
appropriate Governmental Authority. There is no agreement, plan, arrangement or
other contract covering any employee or independent contractor of Veeco or any
of the Veeco Entities that would give rise to the payment of any amount that
would not be deductible by Veeco or any of the Veeco Entities or the Surviving
Corporation pursuant to Section 280G or Section 162(m) of the Code. Veeco is not
a "United States real property holding corporation," as defined in Section
897(c)(2) of the Code. The charges, accruals and reserves with respect to Taxes
on the Veeco Financial Statements with respect to each of the Veeco Entities
(excluding any provision for deferred income taxes established to reflect timing
differences between book and tax income) for all tax periods (or portions
thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date (including any period for which no
Tax Return has yet been filed) are adequate.

     4.11 ABSENCE OF CERTAIN CHANGES. Except as disclosed in or filed as an
exhibit to the Veeco SEC Documents prior to the date hereof, since December 31,
2001 (the "VEECO BALANCE SHEET DATE"), the Veeco Entities have conducted their
business in the ordinary course consistent with past practice and there has not
occurred: (i) any change, event or condition (whether or not covered by
insurance) that has resulted in, or might reasonably be expected to result in, a
Material Adverse Effect to Veeco; (ii) any acquisition, sale or transfer of any
material asset of the Veeco Entities other than in the ordinary course of
business and consistent with past practice; (iii) any change in accounting
methods or practices (including any change in depreciation or amortization
policies or rates) by Veeco or any revaluation by Veeco of any of its assets;
(iv) any declaration, setting aside, or payment of a dividend or other
distribution with respect to the Veeco Shares or any other Veeco Equity
Securities (excluding interest payments on the Veeco Convertible Debt
contemplated by the Indenture relating thereto), or any direct or indirect
redemption, purchase or other acquisition by Veeco of any of its shares of
capital stock; (v) any material Contract entered into by any Veeco Entity, other
than in the ordinary course of business, or any material amendment or
termination of, or default under, any material Contract to which any Veeco
Entity is a party or by which any of them is bound; or (vi) any agreement by any
Veeco Entity to do any of the things described in the preceding clauses (i)
through (v) (other than negotiations with FEI and its Representatives regarding
the transactions contemplated by this Merger Agreement).

     4.12 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS; LABOR MATTERS.

          (a) There does not now exist any and, to the knowledge of Veeco, there
are no existing circumstances that could reasonably be expected to result in,
any Controlled Group Liability to Veeco or any of its Subsidiaries that,
individually or in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Veeco. No Veeco Benefit Plan is (i) a "multiemployer
plan" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA, (ii) a "multiple
employer plan" as defined in ERISA or the Code, or (iii) a "funded welfare plan"
within the meaning of Section 419 of the Code. None of the Veeco Benefit Plans
provides for any welfare or other non-pension benefits to retired or former
employees, except to the extent required by the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 601 et. seq. of ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code or
similar state law.

          (b) Except as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in the
aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco, (i) each of the Veeco
Benefit Plans has been operated and administered in all material respects in
accordance with applicable law and administrative rules and regulations of any
Governmental Authority, including, but not limited to, ERISA and the Code, and
(ii) there are no pending or, to the knowledge of Veeco, Threatened claims
(other than claims for benefits in the ordinary course), lawsuits or
arbitrations that have been asserted or instituted, and, to the knowledge of
Veeco, no set of circumstances exists, that may reasonably give rise to a claim
or lawsuit, against the Veeco Benefit Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with
respect to their duties to the Veeco Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the
trusts under any of the Veeco Benefit Plans that could reasonably be expected to
result in any material liability of Veeco or any of its Subsidiaries to the
PBGC, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any
Veeco Benefit Plan, any participant in a Veeco Benefit Plan, or any other party.
There are no unpaid contributions due prior to the date hereof with respect to
any Veeco Benefit Plan that are required to have been made under its terms and
provisions, any related insurance contract or any applicable law.

          (c) Neither Veeco nor any Subsidiary of Veeco is a party to any
collective bargaining or other labor union contract applicable to individuals
employed by Veeco or any Subsidiary of Veeco, and no collective bargaining
agreement or other labor union contract is being negotiated by Veeco or any
Subsidiary of Veeco. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect on Veeco, (i) there is no labor dispute, strike,
slowdown or work stoppage against Veeco or any Subsidiary of Veeco pending or,
to the knowledge of Veeco, Threatened against Veeco or any Subsidiary of Veeco
and (ii) no unfair labor practice or labor charge or complaint has occurred with
respect to Veeco or any Subsidiary of Veeco.

          (d) Neither the execution and delivery of this Merger Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) will (i) result in any payment or benefit
(including, without limitation, option acceleration, severance, unemployment
compensation, "excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G of
the Code), forgiveness of indebtedness or otherwise) becoming due to any
director, consultant or any current or former employee of Veeco or any
Subsidiaries of Veeco under any Veeco consultant Benefit Plan or otherwise; (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Veeco Benefit Plan; (iii)
result in any acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such
benefits; (iv) require the funding of any trust or other funding vehicle; or (v)
limit or prohibit the

                                      -35-
<Page>

ability to amend, merge, terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any
Veeco Benefit Plan or related trust.

          (e) There has been no disallowance of a deduction, or reasonable
expectation of a disallowance of a deduction, under Section 162(m) of the Code
for employee compensation of any amount paid or payable by Veeco or any
Subsidiary of Veeco that, either individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco.

          (f) Section 4.12(f) of the Veeco Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list
of each material Veeco Benefit Plan.

          (g) Veeco has heretofore made available to FEI true and complete
copies of each of the Veeco Benefit Plans (and all related trust agreements,
insurance contracts and other ancillary documents) and, to the extent
applicable, (i) the actuarial report for such Veeco Benefit Plan for each of the
last two years, (ii) the most recent determination letter from the IRS for such
Veeco Benefit Plan, (iii) the summary plan description for such Veeco Benefit
Plan, and (iv) the Form 5500 for such Veeco Benefit Plan for each of the last
two years, and all schedules thereto. Since the date of the documents made
available, there has not been any material change in the assets or liabilities
of any of the Veeco Benefit Plans or any change in their terms and operations
that could reasonably be expected to affect or alter the tax status or
materially affect the cost of maintaining such Plan, and none of the Veeco
Benefit Plans has been or will be amended prior to the Closing Date to the
extent such amendment will materially affect the cost of maintaining such Plans.
Each of the Veeco Benefit Plans can be amended, modified or terminated by Veeco
or a Subsidiary of Veeco within a period of 30 days, without payment of any
additional compensation or amount or the additional vesting or acceleration of
any such benefits, except to the extent that such vesting is required under the
Code upon the complete or partial termination of any Veeco Benefit Plan intended
to be qualified within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code.

          (h) Each Veeco Benefit Plan that is intended to be qualified under
Section 401 of the Code has received a favorable determination letter from the
IRS as to the qualification of such plan (or is a prototype plan entitled to
rely on a favorable determination, opinion or advisory letter issued to the
prototype sponsor), or has remaining a period of time under applicable Treasury
regulations or IRS pronouncements in which to receive such a determination. For
each Veeco Benefit Plan that has received such a determination, such letter has
not been modified, revoked or limited by the failure to satisfy any condition
thereof or by a subsequent amendment thereto, or failure to amend such Veeco
Benefit Plan.

          (i) Except as, either individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco, no individual
who has been classified by Veeco as a non-employee (such as an independent
contractor, leased employee or consultant) would reasonably be expected to have
a claim against Veeco for eligibility to participate in any Veeco Benefit Plan,
if such individual is later reclassified as a Veeco employee.

          (j) Except as, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco, all Veeco Benefit Plans
subject to the laws of any jurisdiction outside of the United States (i) have
been maintained in accordance with all applicable requirements, (ii) if they are
intended to qualify for special tax treatment meet all requirements for

                                      -36-
<Page>

such treatment, and (iii) if they are intended to be funded and/or book-reserved
are fully funded and/or book reserved, as appropriate, based upon reasonable
actuarial assumptions.

     4.13 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

          (a) Veeco and its Subsidiaries own, or are licensed to use, all Veeco
Intellectual Property. To the knowledge of Veeco, the business and operations of
Veeco and its Subsidiaries as they are currently conducted do not infringe on
the rights of any third party where such infringement, individually or in the
aggregate, would be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on any
Material Veeco Entity or any material business or product offering of Veeco or
any of its Subsidiaries, and, to the extent material Veeco Intellectual Property
is licensed from a third party, Veeco's use of such Intellectual Property is in
accordance in all material respects with the applicable license pursuant to
which Veeco acquired the right to use such Intellectual Property. To the
knowledge of Veeco, no third party is challenging, infringing on or otherwise
violating any right of Veeco in the Veeco Intellectual Property where such
infringement, individually or in the aggregate, would be reasonably expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect on any Material Veeco Entity or any material
business or product offering of Veeco or any of its Subsidiaries. Since Neither
Veeco nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice of any pending
claim, order or proceeding with respect to any material Veeco Intellectual
Property, nor has Veeco received any written demand from any other party to
cease and desist from infringement of such other party's Intellectual Property.
To the knowledge of Veeco, no material Intellectual Property owned or licensed
by Veeco is being used or enforced by Veeco or its Subsidiaries in a manner that
would reasonably be expected to result in the abandonment, estoppel,
cancellation or unenforceability of such Intellectual Property.

          (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Veeco
and the consummation by Veeco of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
(i) constitute a breach by Veeco or its Subsidiaries of any material instrument
or agreement governing any Veeco Intellectual Property, (ii) pursuant to the
terms of any material license or agreement relating to any Veeco Intellectual
Property, cause the material modification of any terms of any such license or
agreement, including but not limited to the modification of the effective rate
of any royalties or other payments provided for in any such license or
agreement, (iii) cause the forfeiture or termination of any Veeco Intellectual
Property under the terms thereof, (iv) give rise to a right of forfeiture or
termination of any Veeco Intellectual Property under the terms thereof or (v)
impair the right of Veeco, its Subsidiaries or, to Veeco's knowledge, FEI to
make, have made, offer for sale, use, sell, export or license any products or
processes used by Veeco, its Subsidiaries or, to Veeco's knowledge, FEI in the
conduct of their business as it is currently configured, except in each case for
those matters that individually or in the aggregate would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco.

          (c) Each item of material Veeco Intellectual Property owned by Veeco
or a Subsidiary thereof (the "VEECO-OWNED IP") (i) is free and clear of any
Liens or filings required under the Uniform Commercial Code in effect in any
jurisdiction; (ii) is not subject to any outstanding judicial order, decree,
judgment or stipulation or to any agreement materially restricting the scope of
Veeco's or such Subsidiary's use thereof; and (iii) together with each item of
material Veeco Intellectual Property which Veeco or such Subsidiary has a right
to use or practice pursuant to one or more license or similar agreements, is not
subject to any suits, actions, written claims or

                                      -37-
<Page>

demands of any third party and no action or proceeding, whether judicial,
administrative, has been instituted, is pending or, to Veeco's knowledge,
Threatened, which challenges or affects the rights of Veeco or such Subsidiary
in the same manner.

          (d) Neither Veeco nor any Subsidiary thereof has entered into any
agreement to indemnify any third party against any claim of infringement,
misappropriation or other violation of Veeco Intellectual Property rights other
than indemnification provisions contained in purchase orders, customer
agreements or similar agreements arising in the ordinary course of business.

          (e) To the knowledge of Veeco and its Subsidiaries, (a) all rights in
all inventions and discoveries made, developed or conceived by any current or
former officer, employee, independent contractor, consultant or any other agent
of Veeco or any Subsidiary thereof during the course of their employment (or
other retention) by Veeco or a Subsidiary thereof and material to the business
of Veeco or a Subsidiary thereof and which are the subject of one or more issued
letters patent or applications for letters patent have been assigned in writing
to Veeco or a Subsidiary thereof; and (b) the policy of Veeco or a Subsidiary
thereof requires each employee of Veeco or a Subsidiary thereof to sign
documents confirming that he or she assign to Veeco or a Subsidiary thereof all
Intellectual Property rights made, written, developed or conceived by him or her
during the course of his or her employment (or other retention) by Veeco or a
Subsidiary thereof and relating to the business of Veeco or a Subsidiary thereof
to the extent that ownership of any such Intellectual Property rights does not
vest in Veeco or a Subsidiary thereof by operation of Law.

          (f) Veeco believes that Veeco and its Subsidiaries have taken
reasonable and practicable steps to protect and preserve the confidentiality of
any material Veeco Intellectual Property that it wishes to remain confidential
("VEECO CONFIDENTIAL IP INFORMATION"). Veeco believes that all use by Veeco and
its Subsidiaries of Veeco Confidential IP Information not owned by Veeco and its
Subsidiaries has been and is pursuant to the terms of a written agreement
between Veeco or a Subsidiary thereof and the owner of such Confidential
Information, or is otherwise lawful.

     4.14 ABSENCE OF LIENS; TITLE TO PROPERTY.

          (a) For purposes of this Agreement, "Veeco Real Property" means all
interests in real property including, fee estates, leaseholds and subleaseholds,
purchase options, easements, licenses, privileges, hereditaments, appurtenances,
rights to access and rights of way, and all fixtures, buildings, structures and
other improvements thereon, owned or used by Veeco, together with any additions
thereto or replacements thereof.

          (b) Section 4.14(b) of the Disclosure Schedule contains the true and
correct street address of all Veeco Real Property owned by Veeco (the "Veeco
Owned Real Property") and contains the true and correct street address of all
Veeco Real Property leased by Veeco and exceeding 10,000 square feet of leased
area, excluding, however, any Veeco Owned Real Property or leased Veeco Real
Property identified in Veeco's financial statements or the Veeco SEC Documents
(the "Veeco Leased Real Property"). There is no other material real property
that is owned or leased by Veeco or used in or necessary for the conduct of
business as presently conducted.

                                      -38-
<Page>

(c) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect
on Veeco, all leases for material Veeco Leased Real Property (the "Veeco
Leases") are in good standing, valid and effective in accordance with their
respective terms, and neither Veeco nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor to Veeco's
knowledge, any other party to a Veeco Lease, is in material breach, violation or
default under, and neither Veeco nor any of its Subsidiaries has received
written notice that it has breached, violated or defaulted under, any of the
terms or conditions of any Veeco Lease. Veeco has provided FEI with true,
complete and correct copies of each Veeco Lease.

          (d) Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect on Veeco, the Veeco Real Property and all present uses and
operations of the Veeco Real Property comply with all applicable Laws, Court
Orders, Governmental Permits, restrictions of any Governmental Body having
jurisdiction over any portion of the Veeco Real Property (including, those
relating to zoning, land use, safety, health, employment and employment
practices and access by the handicapped), covenants, conditions, restrictions,
easements, disposition agreements and similar matters affecting the Veeco Real
Property. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect on Veeco, Veeco has obtained all approvals of any Governmental Body
(including, certificates of use and occupancy, licenses and permits) required in
connection with the construction, ownership, use, and occupation of the Veeco
Real Property and operation of its business.

          (e) Veeco and each of its Subsidiaries has good and valid title to,
or, in the case of leased assets, valid leasehold interests in, all of its
material tangible assets used in its business, free and clear of any Liens,
except (i) Liens reflected in the Veeco Financial Statements or the Veeco SEC
Documents; (ii) Liens for Taxes not yet due and payable; and (iii) Liens which
are not material to Veeco and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

     4.15 ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

     Except as disclosed in the Veeco SEC Documents:

          (a) The Veeco Entities have conducted all Hazardous Substance
Activities relating to the business in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable Environmental Laws. The Hazardous Substance Activities of the
Veeco Entities prior to the Closing have not resulted in the exposure of any
person to a Hazardous Substance in a manner which could reasonably be expected
to result in a Material Adverse Effect on Veeco. The Veeco Entities have
obtained all material Environmental Permits. All such Environmental Permits are
valid and in full force and effect. The Veeco Entities have not received written
notice of any action to revoke or modify any of such Environmental Permits, and,
to Veeco's knowledge the ownership and operation of the Veeco Entities' business
is and has been in material compliance with all terms and conditions thereof.
The Veeco Entities have not received notice of any pending or Threatened claim
by any Governmental Authority or any other Person concerning potential liability

of the stock option plan or other arrangement under which it was issued and the
terms of the stock option agreement by which it is evidenced. From and after the
Effective Time, (i) each FEI Option assumed by Veeco may be exercised by the
holder thereof solely for Veeco Shares, (ii) the number of Veeco Shares subject

shares of FEI Common Stock subject to such FEI Option immediately prior to the

whole share, (iii) the per share exercise price under each such FEI Option shall
be adjusted by dividing (x) the per share exercise price under such FEI Option
by (y) the Exchange Ratio and rounding to the nearest cent and (iv) any
restriction on the exercise or transfer of any such FEI Option shall continue in
full force and effect in accordance with its terms and the term, exercisability,
vesting schedule and other provisions of or relating to such FEI Option shall
otherwise remain unchanged. Veeco shall file with the SEC, no later than the

relating to the Veeco Shares issuable with respect to FEI Options assumed by
Veeco in accordance with this Section 5.05(a).

by Veeco shall qualify, to the maximum extent permissible following the
Effective Time, as incentive stock options, as defined in Section 422 of the
Code, to the extent the FEI Options so assumed qualified as incentive stock
options prior to the Effective Time.

          (c) Prior to the Effective Time, FEI shall take all action that may be
necessary (under the plans pursuant to which FEI Options are outstanding and
otherwise) to effectuate the provisions of this Section 5.05 and to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time, holders of FEI

                                      -46-
<Page>

Options have no rights with respect thereto other than those specifically
provided in this Section 5.05.

          (a) At the Effective Time, the FEI Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
"FEI ESPP") and each outstanding purchase right with respect to all open
offering periods under the FEI ESPP (each an "ASSUMED PURCHASE RIGHT") shall be
assumed by Veeco. Each Assumed Purchase Right shall continue to have, and be
subject to, the terms and conditions set forth in the FEI ESPP and the documents
governing the Assumed Purchase Right, except that the purchase price of Veeco
Shares under each Assumed Purchase Right shall be the lower of (i) the quotient
determined by dividing eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a
share of FEI Common Stock on the offering date of each assumed offering period
by the Exchange Ratio (with the purchase price rounded up to the nearest whole
cent) or (ii) eighty-five percent (85%) of the fair market value of a Veeco
Share on the applicable purchase date of each assumed offering period occurring
after the Effective Time. Subject to Section 5.06(b), the Assumed Purchase
Rights shall be exercised at such times following the Effective Time as set
forth in the FEI ESPP, and each participant shall, accordingly, be issued Veeco
Shares at such times.

          (b) Prior to the Effective Time, FEI shall take any and all action
that may be necessary under the FEI ESPP (or otherwise) to ensure that (i) all
offering periods under the FEI ESPP that are open at the Effective Time and are
assumed by Veeco pursuant to Section 5.06(a), shall terminate, and the
applicable purchase date for all Assumed Purchase Rights shall occur, on or
before December 31, 2002, (ii) the FEI ESPP shall terminate on or before
December 31, 2002, and (iii) the offering period scheduled to begin on or about
September 1, 2002 shall be the last offering period to commence under the FEI

the applicable purchase date shall occur, on December 31, 2002. Veeco agrees to
implement or continue, as applicable, the September Offering and all Assumed
Purchase Rights until the earlier of (i) December 31, 2002, or (ii) the date
that the applicable offering period would have otherwise terminated, without
additional corporate action, pursuant to the FEI ESPP.

          (c) Veeco agrees that the employees of FEI who become employees of
Veeco or any Subsidiary of Veeco may participate in the employee stock purchase
plan sponsored by Veeco (the "VEECO ESPP"), subject to the terms and conditions
of the Veeco ESPP.

     5.07 EMPLOYEE MATTERS.

          (a) Until the first anniversary of the Effective Time, Veeco shall, or
shall cause a Subsidiary of Veeco to, (i) provide the employees of FEI who
remain employed with Veeco or any Subsidiary of Veeco in the U.S. after the
Effective Time (the "U.S. CONTINUING EMPLOYEES") with terms and conditions of
employment that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided
to similarly situated employees of Veeco (the "VEECO BENEFITS") or (ii) continue
to provide the U.S. Continuing Employees with terms and conditions of employment
that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to those provided by FEI
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Nothing contained herein shall be
construed to limit the ability of Veeco or a Subsidiary of Veeco, following the
Effective Time, to terminate the employment of any employee or to amend or
terminate any Veeco or FEI Benefit Plan in accordance with its terms.

                                      -47-

          (b) Except to the extent necessary to avoid duplication of benefits,
and, to the extent permitted under applicable law (after adoption of any
amendments necessary to implement the following), Veeco shall provide the U.S.
Continuing Employees with full credit, for purposes of eligibility and vesting
under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Veeco or any
Subsidiary of Veeco in which such employees are eligible to participate, for
such employees' service with FEI to the same extent recognized by FEI
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Veeco shall cause any and all
pre-existing condition (or actively-at-work or similar) limitations, eligibility
waiting periods and evidence of insurability requirements under any welfare plan
to be waived with respect to the U.S. Continuing Employees and their eligible
dependents and shall provide them with credit for any co-payments, deductibles
and offsets (or similar payments) made prior to the Effective Time for purposes
of satisfying any applicable deductible, out-of-pocket, or similar requirement
under any employee benefit plans or arrangements maintained by Veeco or any
Subsidiary of Veeco in which such employees are eligible to participate on and
after the Effective Time.

          (c) Nothing herein expressed or implied shall confer upon any of the
U.S. Continuing Employees or any other current or former employee or legal
representative thereof, any rights or remedies, including, without limitation,
any right to employment, or continued employment for any specified period, of
any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement.

          (d) Veeco shall provide employees of FEI who remain employed with
Veeco or any Subsidiary of Veeco outside the U.S. after the Effective Time (the
"FOREIGN CONTINUING EMPLOYEES") with terms and conditions of employment that are
substantially similar to those provided by FEI or any Subsidiary of FEI
immediately prior to the Effective Time as and to the extent required by
applicable Law.

          (e) Until such time as that certain Employment Agreement, dated as of
the date hereof, between Veeco and Vahe Sarkissian is terminated, Veeco will
continue in effect the FEI Non-Qualified Deferred Compensation Plan on
substantially the same terms and conditions as existing on the date of this
Agreement (or will put in place a successor plan with substantially the same
terms and conditions, which may permit participation by other employees of Veeco
and its Subsidiaries); provided, however, that in no event shall the Company be
required to make any contributions to such plan.

     5.08 INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS.

          (a) From and after the Effective Time, Veeco will, and will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of
FEI pursuant to any indemnification agreements between FEI and its directors and
officers immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the "INDEMNIFIED
PERSONS"), subject to applicable law. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws
of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation
and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Persons as
those provisions contained in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of FEI as
in effect on the date of this Merger Agreement, which provisions will not be
amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the
Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder
of an Indemnified Person, unless such modification is required by law.

                                      -48-

          (b) From the Effective Time until the sixth anniversary of the
Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect (and Veeco
shall cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect), for the benefit of
the Indemnified Persons, with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to
the Effective Time, the existing policy of directors' and officers' liability
insurance maintained by FEI as of the date of this Merger Agreement in the form
disclosed by FEI to Veeco prior to the date of this Merger Agreement (the
"EXISTING POLICY"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (i) the Surviving Corporation may in
its sole discretion determine to substitute for the Existing Policy a policy or
policies of comparable coverage, and (ii) the Surviving Corporation shall not be
required to pay annual premiums for the Existing Policy (or for any such
substitute policies) in excess of 200% of the premium payable by FEI therefor as
of the date of this Merger Agreement, in the aggregate. In the event any future
annual premium for the Existing Policy (or any such substitute policies) exceeds
200% of the premium payable by FEI therefor as of the date of this Merger
Agreement, in the aggregate, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to
reduce the amount of coverage of the Existing Policy (or any such substitute
policies) to the amount of coverage that can be obtained for a premium equal to
200% of the premium payable by FEI therefor as of the date of this Merger
Agreement.

          (b) This Section 5.08 is intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by the Indemnified Persons and their heirs and personal
representatives and shall be binding on Veeco, the Surviving Corporation and
their successors and assigns. In the event Veeco, the Surviving Corporation or
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving Person in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision
shall be made so that the successor and assign of Veeco or the Surviving
Corporation, as applicable, honor the obligations set forth in this Section
5.08.

     5.09 REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3. Veeco shall file with the SEC, no
later than the date on which the Merger becomes effective, a registration
statement on Form S-3, relating to the resale of the FEI Convertible Debt and
the common stock issuable upon conversion of the FEI Convertible Debt.

     5.10 TAX MATTERS.

          (a)   (i) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, FEI shall file
or cause to be filed on a timely basis all Tax Returns that are required to be
filed by it or by any of the other FEI Entities, either separately or as part of
an affiliated group of corporations, pursuant to the Laws of each Governmental
Authority with taxing power over it or any of the other FEI Entities or any of
the FEI Entities' assets and businesses. Each of such Tax Returns will be true,
correct and complete in all material respects when filed. Neither FEI nor any
FEI Entity shall (i) make any election or (ii) file any amended Tax Return
reflecting any position, in the case of each of (i) and (ii) that could result
in a material adverse Tax consequence to Veeco, Acquisition, FEI or any FEI
Entity or Veeco Entity for any period beginning on or after the Effective Time.
FEI shall timely file all required transfer Tax Returns and/or notices of the
transfer of the FEI Entities' business, if any, with the appropriate

Entities or any of the Veeco Entities' assets and businesses. Each of such Tax
Returns will be true, correct and complete in all material respects when filed.

Rosati, Professional Corporation, to deliver to FEI, a tax opinion with respect
to such matters as are appropriate for description, and inclusion as exhibits,
in the Form S-4 Registration Statement and the Joint Proxy Statement, such
opinions to be substantially similar in substance. In rendering such opinions,
each of such counsel shall be entitled to rely on the tax representation letters
referred to in this Section 5.10(b).

          (c) None of Veeco, Acquisition or FEI will take any action prior or
subsequent to the Effective Time that would reasonably be expected to cause the
Merger to fail to qualify as a reorganization as described in Section 368(a) of
the Code.

aware after the date hereof and prior to the Closing Date that would constitute
a violation or breach of this Merger Agreement (or a breach of any

FEI, or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered
by Veeco or FEI and such information should be set forth in an amendment or

would not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein not misleading or (ii) the Joint Proxy Statement so that such
document would not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

     5.22  FEI Stockholders' Meeting.

           (a) FEI shall take all action necessary under all applicable Laws to
call, give notice of and hold a meeting of the holders of FEI Common Stock to
vote on a proposal to approve the Merger (the "FEI STOCKHOLDERS' MEETING"). The
FEI Stockholders' Meeting shall be held as promptly as practicable after the
Form S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act
on a date or dates determined in accordance with the mutual agreement of FEI and
Veeco, but in no event later than 45 days after the Form S-4 Registration
Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act, unless a stop order
shall have been issued by the SEC with respect to the Form S-4 Registration
Statement or an injunction shall have been issued by a court of competent
jurisdiction or other appropriate Governmental Authority to restrain or prohibit
the consummation of the Merger. FEI shall ensure that all proxies solicited in
connection with the FEI Stockholders' Meeting are solicited in compliance with
all applicable Laws.

           (b) Subject to Section 5.22(c): (i) the Joint Proxy Statement shall
include a statement to the effect that the Board of Directors of FEI recommends
that FEI's stockholders vote to approve the Merger at the FEI Stockholders'
Meeting (such recommendation of FEI's Board of Directors that FEI's stockholders
vote to approve the Merger being referred to as the "FEI BOARD RECOMMENDATION");
and (ii) the FEI Board Recommendation shall not be withdrawn or modified in a
manner adverse to Veeco, and no resolution by the Board of Directors of FEI or
any committee thereof to withdraw or modify the FEI Board Recommendation in a
manner adverse to Veeco shall be adopted.

           (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section
5.22(b), at any time prior to the approval of the Merger by the Required FEI
Stockholder Vote, the FEI Board Recommendation may be withdrawn or modified in a
manner adverse to Veeco if: (i) a FEI Acquisition Proposal is made and is not
withdrawn; (ii) FEI promptly provides Veeco prior written notice of any meeting
of FEI's Board of Directors at which such Board of Directors will consider and
determine whether such offer is a Superior FEI Proposal; (iii) FEI's Board of
Directors determines in good faith that such offer constitutes a Superior FEI
Proposal (after consultation with an independent financial advisor of nationally
recognized reputation); (iv) FEI's Board of Directors determines in good faith,
after consultation with FEI's outside legal counsel, that, in light of such
Superior FEI Proposal, the failure to withdraw or modify the FEI Board
Recommendation would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the fiduciary
obligations of FEI's Board of Directors to FEI's stockholders under applicable
Law; and (v) neither FEI nor any of its Representatives shall have materially

constitutes a Superior Veeco Proposal (after consultation with an independent
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation); (iv) Veeco's Board of
Directors determines in good faith, after consultation with Veeco's outside
legal counsel, that, in light of such Superior Veeco Proposal, the failure to
withdraw or modify the Veeco Board Recommendation would be reasonably likely to
result in a breach of the fiduciary obligations of Veeco's Board of Directors to
Veeco's stockholders under applicable Law; and (v) neither Veeco nor any of its
Representatives shall have materially violated any of the restrictions set forth

Proxy have been duly and validly authorized, executed and delivered by such
Party and constitutes such Party's legal, valid and binding obligation,

or similar organizational, governing or constating documents, (ii) any agreement
or instrument to which such Party is a party or by which it is bound, or (iii)
any law, or any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental authority

any liens, claims, security interests, proxies, voting trusts or agreements,
restrictions,


                                      -3-

<Page>

qualifications, limitations, understandings or arrangements which would in any
way restrict or impair the Stockholder's right to vote Stockholder Florence
Shares in its sole discretion, or could require the Stockholder to sell or
transfer any Stockholder Florence Shares (whether upon default on a loan or
otherwise) before the Effective Time.

         (c) The Stockholder has sufficient voting power and sufficient power to
issue instructions and sufficient power to agree to the matters set forth in
this Agreement with respect to the Stockholder Florence Shares.

         3.01 VOTE FOR MERGER.

         (a) The Stockholder shall cause the Stockholder Florence Shares to be
counted as present for purposes of establishing a quorum at any meeting of
stockholders of Florence called to vote upon the Merger and the Merger
Agreement, or at any adjournment or postponement thereof, or in any other
circumstances upon which a vote, consent or other approval with respect to the
Merger and the Merger Agreement is sought, and shall cause the Stockholder
Florence Shares to be voted or consented in favor of the Merger; PROVIDED that
nothing set forth in this Section 3.01(a) or in the Proxy is intended or shall
be construed to restrict or impair the right of the Stockholder to vote or
consent (or cause to be voted or consented) any Stockholder Florence Shares in
favor of any Superior FEI Proposal or related FEI Acquisition Transaction.

         (b) In order to effectuate the voting arrangements contemplated by
Sections 3.01(a) and 3.02, contemporaneously with the execution and delivery by
the Parties of this Agreement, and as a condition to such execution and delivery
by the Company, the Stockholder is delivering to the Company the Proxy, duly
executed by or on behalf of the Stockholder; PROVIDED that nothing set forth in
this Section 3.01(b) or in the Proxy is intended or shall be construed to
restrict or impair the right of the Stockholder to vote or consent (or cause to
be voted or consented) any Stockholder Florence Shares in favor of any Superior
FEI Proposal or related FEI Acquisition Transaction.

         3.02 VOTE AGAINST CERTAIN MATTERS. Prior to the Effective Time, the

cause the Stockholder Florence Shares to be voted or consented against any
proposal or transaction involving Florence or any of its subsidiaries that would
prevent or nullify the Merger or the Merger Agreement (any such proposal or
transaction, a "PARTICULAR MATTER"); PROVIDED that nothing set forth


                                      -4-

<Page>

in this Section 3.02 or such Proxy is intended or shall be construed to restrict
or impair the right of the Stockholder to vote or consent (or cause to be voted
or consented) any Stockholder Florence Shares in favor of any Superior FEI
Proposal or related FEI Acquisition Transaction.

         3.03 TRANSFERS; OTHER VOTING ARRANGEMENTS.

         (a) The Stockholder may not Transfer any Stockholder Florence Shares
except (i) to a Transferee that both (A) agrees, prior to the consummation of
such Transfer, to become bound by this Agreement and the Proxy and subject to
the terms, conditions and restrictions hereof and thereof in the same manner as
the Stockholder, by executing and delivering to the Company a writing to such
effect in form and substance satisfactory to the Company, and (B) enters into,
prior to the consummation of such Transfer, a "standstill" agreement with
respect to each of Florence and the Company, each of which "standstill"
agreements (I) shall be identical in substance to Section 4.01(a) of the
Investor Agreement and otherwise in form and substance satisfactory to Florence
or the Company, as the case may be, and (II) shall be effective only for the
period between the consummation of such Transfer and the Effective Time, or (ii)
to a Transferee that has made a Superior FEI Proposal in the FEI Acquisition
Transaction contemplated by such Superior FEI Proposal.

         (b) The Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, enter into any
voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting arrangement, voting agreement,
voting trust or otherwise with respect to any Stockholder Florence Shares, other
than this Agreement and the Proxy; PROVIDED that nothing set forth in this
Section 3.03 or in the Proxy is intended or shall be construed to restrict or
impair the right of the Stockholder to vote or consent (or grant a proxy causing
to be voted or consented) any Stockholder Florence Shares in favor of any
Superior FEI Proposal or related FEI Acquisition Transaction.

         (c) The Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, take any action
that would or could reasonably be expected to invalidate or in any way limit the
enforceability by the Proxyholders (as defined in the Proxy) of the Proxy.

         (d) Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict any employee of the
Stockholder from acting in his or her capacity as a director or officer of
Florence (it being understood that this Agreement shall apply to the Stockholder
solely in the Stockholder's capacity as a stockholder of Florence). No conduct
or action taken by any employee of the Stockholder who is also a director or
officer of Florence, in his capacity as such, shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of any provision of this Agreement.

         3.04 CONFIDENTIALITY. Prior to the first public announcement by the
Company and Florence of the Merger Agreement, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby, the Stockholder shall not, and shall cause
its Affiliates (as defined in the Merger Agreement) and its and their respective
employees, counsel, advisors and


                                      -5-

<Page>

representatives ("REPRESENTATIVES") not to, disclose to any person or entity any
information concerning the Merger Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated thereby, or the discussions concerning the same,
PROVIDED, that such information may be disclosed to employees, counsel, advisors
and representatives of the Stockholder and its Affiliates who have been advised
of the foregoing obligations, and PROVIDED, FURTHER, that nothing set forth in
this Section 3.04 is intended or shall be construed to restrict or impair the
ability of the Stockholder or its Affiliates to comply with their respective
reporting obligations under applicable laws and stock exchange regulations, in
which event the Stockholder shall give prior notice of such disclosure to the
Company as promptly as practicable so as to enable the Company to seek a
protective order from a court of competent jurisdiction with respect thereto or
similar relief in connection therewith.

         3.05 DISCLOSURE. Each Party acknowledges that the other Party is or may
be obligated to disclose in governmental and stock exchange (including NASDAQ)
filings the Stockholder's identity, facts concerning the Stockholder's ownership
of Florence Stock and the nature of the commitments, arrangements and
understandings set forth in this Agreement, the Proxy, the Investor Agreement,
the Amendment Agreement and any other agreements executed and delivered in
connection with the Merger, together with such other information as may be
required by applicable laws and stock exchange regulations. No Party shall issue
any press release naming the other Party or any of the other Party's Affiliates
unless such press release has been approved by such other Party, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

         3.06 NO SOLICITATION. Subject to Section 3.03(d), the Stockholder shall
not, and shall cause Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. ("PHILIPS") and each
other direct and indirect subsidiary of Philips not to, take any action to
solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making, submission or
announcement of any FEI Acquisition Proposal, or engage in discussions or
negotiations with any person or entity (other than with Florence and the Company
or any of their Affiliates or Representatives) with respect to any FEI
Acquisition Proposal, (other than any Superior FEI Proposal or related FEI
Acquisition Transaction) or disclose any nonpublic information relating to
Florence or any subsidiary of Florence. The Stockholder shall advise Florence
and the Company of any FEI Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the
person or entity making or submitting such FEI Acquisition Proposal and the
terms thereof) that is made or submitted by any person or entity after the date
of this Agreement, reasonably promptly following its receipt thereof. The
Stockholder shall keep Florence and the Company reasonably informed with respect
to the status of any such FEI Acquisition Proposal. The Stockholder shall, and
shall cause Philips and each other direct and indirect subsidiary of Philips to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any discussions now pending with
any person or entity that relate to any FEI Acquisition Proposal or FEI
Acquisition Transaction, other than discussions or negotiations with Florence
and the Company or their Affiliates or Representatives.

<Page>

not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise

inconvenience of the forum or otherwise (PROVIDED that nothing in this Section
will prevent a party from removing an action or proceeding from a Delaware state
court to a Federal court located in the State of Delaware), (iv) agrees that
such Party will not bring any action relating to this Agreement or the Proxy or

                                      PROXY

         Reference is hereby made to that certain Voting Agreement, dated as of
July 11, 2002 (the "VOTING AGREEMENT"), of which this Proxy (this "PROXY") forms
a part. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Proxy have the respective
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Voting Agreement. This Proxy is being
delivered by the undersigned Stockholder (the "GRANTING STOCKHOLDER") pursuant
to Section 3.01(b) of the Voting Agreement.

         The undersigned Granting Stockholder hereby appoints Veeco Instruments
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("VEECO"), and each of Veeco's officers and other
designees (each such person or entity, a "PROXYHOLDER") as the Granting
Stockholder's attorney-in-fact and proxy pursuant to the provisions of ORS ss.
60.231 (2001), with full power of substitution, in the Granting Stockholder's
name, place and stead, to vote and otherwise act (by written consent or
otherwise) with respect to all of the Stockholder Florence Shares which the
Granting Stockholder is entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders of
Florence (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed
meeting) or consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise FOR AND IN FAVOR OF
the Merger; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing set forth in this Proxy is intended
or shall be construed to grant to any Proxyholder the right to vote or otherwise
act (by written consent or otherwise) with respect to any Stockholder Florence
Shares with respect to any Superior FEI Proposal or related FEI Acquisition
Transaction.

         The Granting Stockholder hereby revokes all other proxies and powers of
attorney with respect to any Stockholder Florence Shares that the Granting
Stockholder may have heretofore granted, and no subsequent proxy or power of
attorney shall be given or written consent executed (and if given or executed,
shall not be effective) by the Granting Stockholder purporting to grant the
specific voting powers specified herein. Any obligation of the Granting
Stockholder under this Proxy shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
the Granting Stockholder.

         THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND IS IRREVOCABLE UNTIL THE
EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF (I) THE TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE
WITH ITS TERMS, (II) THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER, AND (III) THE EXECUTION
AND DELIVERY BY ANY PARTY TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT OF ANY AMENDMENT THERETO WHICH
WOULD CAUSE EACH SHARE OF FLORENCE STOCK TO BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO
RECEIVE FEWER THAN 1.355 SHARES OF COMPANY STOCK (AS ADJUSTED FOR ANY STOCK
SPLITS, REVERSE STOCK SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS OR SIMILAR EVENTS).

<Page>

         THIS PROXY WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE AND WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
REVOKED, AND THE INTEREST WITH WHICH THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY
EXTINGUISHED, UPON THE EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF THE EVENTS SPECIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS
SENTENCE.

any voting arrangement, whether by proxy, voting arrangement, voting agreement,
voting trust or otherwise with respect to any of its Stockholder FEI Shares,
other than this Agreement and the Proxy; PROVIDED that nothing set forth in this
Section 3.03 or in the Proxy is intended or shall be construed to restrict or
impair the right of such FEI Stockholder to vote or consent (or grant a proxy
causing to be voted or consented) any of its Stockholder FEI Shares in favor of
any Superior FEI Proposal or related FEI Acquisition Transaction.

         (c) Such FEI Stockholder shall not, directly or indirectly, take any

Proxy.

nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict such FEI Stockholder from
acting in his or her capacity as a director or officer of FEI (it being
understood that this Agreement shall apply to such FEI Stockholder solely in
such FEI Stockholder's capacity as a stockholder of FEI). No conduct or action
taken by such FEI Stockholder, if such FEI Stockholder is also a director or

entity any information concerning the Merger Agreement, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated thereby, or the discussions concerning the same,
PROVIDED, that nothing set forth in this Section 3.04 is intended or shall be
construed to restrict or impair the ability of such FEI Stockholder to comply
with its reporting obligations under applicable laws and stock exchange
(including NASDAQ) regulations, in which event such FEI Stockholder shall give
prior notice of such disclosure to the Company as promptly as practicable so as
to enable the Company to seek a protective order from a court of competent
jurisdiction with respect thereto or similar relief in connection therewith.

         3.05 DISCLOSURE. Such FEI Stockholder acknowledges that the Company
and/or FEI may be obligated to disclose in governmental and stock exchange
(including NASDAQ) filings such FEI Stockholder's identity, facts concerning
such FEI Stockholder's ownership of Stockholder FEI Shares and the nature of the
commitments, arrangements and understandings set forth in this Agreement, the
Proxy, and any other agreements executed and delivered in connection with the
Merger, together with such other information as may be required by applicable
laws and stock exchange (including NASDAQ) regulations.

         3.06 NO SOLICITATION. Subject to Section 3.03(d), such FEI Stockholder
shall not solicit, initiate, encourage, induce or facilitate the making,
submission or announcement of any FEI Acquisition Proposal, or engage in
discussions or negotiations

Affiliates or Representatives) with respect to any FEI Acquisition Proposal,
other than any Superior FEI Proposal or related FEI Acquisition Transaction.
Such FEI Stockholder shall promptly advise FEI and the Company of any FEI
Acquisition Proposal (including the identity of the person or entity making or
submitting such FEI Acquisition Proposal and the terms thereof) that is made or
submitted by any person or entity after the date of this Agreement. Such FEI
Stockholder shall keep FEI and the Company reasonably informed with respect to
the status of any such FEI Acquisition Proposal. Such FEI Stockholder shall
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions with any
person or entity that relate to any FEI Acquisition Proposal or FEI Acquisition
Transaction, other than discussions or negotiations with FEI and the Company or
their Affiliates or Representatives.

                                      PROXY

         Reference is hereby made to that certain Voting Agreement, dated as of
July 11, 2002 (the "VOTING AGREEMENT"), of which this Proxy (this "PROXY") forms
a part. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Proxy have the respective
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Voting Agreement. This Proxy is being
delivered by the undersigned Stockholder (the "GRANTING STOCKHOLDER") pursuant
to Section 3.01(b) of the Voting Agreement.

         The undersigned Granting Stockholder hereby appoints Veeco Instruments
Inc., a Delaware corporation ("VEECO"), and each of Veeco's officers and other
designees (each such person or entity, a "PROXYHOLDER") as the Granting
Stockholder's attorney-in-fact and proxy pursuant to the provisions of ORS ss.
60.231 (2001), with full power of substitution, in the Granting Stockholder's
name, place and stead, to vote and otherwise act (by written consent or
otherwise) with respect to all of the Stockholder FEI Shares which the Granting
Stockholder is entitled to vote at any meeting of the stockholders of FEI
(whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned or postponed meeting)
or consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise FOR AND IN FAVOR OF the
Merger; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing set forth in this Proxy is intended or
shall be construed to grant to any Proxyholder the right to vote or otherwise
act (by written consent or otherwise) with respect to any Stockholder FEI Shares
with respect to any Superior FEI Proposal or related FEI Acquisition
Transaction.

         The Granting Stockholder hereby revokes all other proxies and powers of
attorney with respect to any Stockholder FEI Shares that the Granting
Stockholder may have heretofore granted, and no subsequent proxy or power of
attorney shall be given or written consent executed (and if given or executed,
shall not be effective) by the Granting Stockholder purporting to grant the
specific voting powers specified herein. Any obligation of the Granting
Stockholder under this Proxy shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
the Granting Stockholder.

         THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND IS IRREVOCABLE UNTIL THE
EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF (I) THE TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE
WITH ITS TERMS, (II) THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER, AND (III) THE EXECUTION
AND DELIVERY BY ANY PARTY TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT OF ANY AMENDMENT THERETO WHICH
WOULD CAUSE EACH SHARE OF FEI STOCK TO BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE
FEWER THAN 1.355 SHARES OF COMPANY STOCK (AS ADJUSTED FOR ANY STOCK SPLITS,
REVERSE STOCK SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS OR SIMILAR EVENTS). THIS PROXY WILL
AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE AND WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REVOKED, AND THE INTEREST WITH
WHICH THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EXTINGUISHED, UPON THE
EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF THE EVENTS SPECIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE.

right to vote such Existing Veeco Shares in its sole discretion, or could

nothing in this Agreement shall limit or restrict such Veeco Stockholder from

discussions or negotiations with Veeco and the Company or their Affiliates or
Representatives.

                                      PROXY

         Reference is hereby made to that certain Voting Agreement, dated as of
July 11, 2002 (the "VOTING AGREEMENT"), of which this Proxy (this "PROXY") forms
a part. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Proxy have the respective
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Voting Agreement. This Proxy is being
delivered by the undersigned Stockholder (the "GRANTING STOCKHOLDER") pursuant
to Section 3.01(b) of the Voting Agreement.

         The undersigned Granting Stockholder hereby appoints FEI Company, an
Oregon corporation ("FEI"), and each of FEI's officers and other designees (each
such person or entity, a "PROXYHOLDER") as the Granting Stockholder's
attorney-in-fact and proxy pursuant to the provisions of Section 212 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, with full power of substitution, in the
Granting Stockholder's name, place and stead, to vote and otherwise act (by
written consent or otherwise) with respect to all of the Stockholder Veeco
Shares which the Granting Stockholder is entitled to vote at any meeting of the
stockholders of Veeco (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned
or postponed meeting) or consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise FOR
AND IN FAVOR OF the issuance of Veeco Stock in the Merger and approval of the
Veeco Certificate of Incorporation Amendment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing
set forth in this Proxy is intended or shall be construed to grant to any
Proxyholder the right to vote or otherwise act (by written consent or otherwise)
with respect to any Stockholder Veeco Shares with respect to any Superior Veeco
Proposal or related Veeco Acquisition Transaction.

         The Granting Stockholder hereby revokes all other proxies and powers of
attorney with respect to any Stockholder Veeco Shares that the Granting
Stockholder may have heretofore granted, and no subsequent proxy or power of
attorney shall be given or written consent executed (and if given or executed,
shall not be effective) by the Granting Stockholder purporting to grant the
specific voting powers specified herein. Any obligation of the Granting
Stockholder under this Proxy shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
the Granting Stockholder.

         THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND IS IRREVOCABLE UNTIL THE
EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF (I) THE TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE
WITH ITS TERMS, (II) THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER, AND (III) THE EXECUTION
AND DELIVERY BY ANY PARTY TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT OF ANY AMENDMENT THERETO WHICH
WOULD CAUSE EACH SHARE OF FEI COMMON STOCK TO BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO
RECEIVE GREATER THAN 1.355 SHARES OF VEECO STOCK (AS ADJUSTED FOR ANY STOCK
SPLITS, REVERSE STOCK SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS OR SIMILAR EVENTS). THIS PROXY
WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE AND WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REVOKED, AND THE INTEREST
WITH WHICH THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EXTINGUISHED, UPON THE
EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF THE EVENTS SPECIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE.

the Company may be obligated to disclose in governmental and stock exchange

                                      PROXY

         Reference is hereby made to that certain Voting Agreement, dated as of
July __, 2002 (the "VOTING AGREEMENT"), of which this Proxy (this "PROXY") forms
a part. Capitalized terms used but not defined in this Proxy have the respective
meanings ascribed to such terms in the Voting Agreement. This Proxy is being
delivered by the undersigned Stockholder (the "GRANTING STOCKHOLDER") pursuant
to Section 3.01(b) of the Voting Agreement.

         The undersigned Granting Stockholder hereby appoints FEI Company, an
Oregon corporation ("FEI"), and each of FEI's officers and other designees (each
such person or entity, a "PROXYHOLDER") as the Granting Stockholder's
attorney-in-fact and proxy pursuant to the provisions of Section 212 of the
Delaware General Corporation Law, with full power of substitution, in the
Granting Stockholder's name, place and stead, to vote and otherwise act (by
written consent or otherwise) with respect to all of the Stockholder Veeco
Shares which the Granting Stockholder is entitled to vote at any meeting of the
stockholders of Veeco (whether annual or special and whether or not an adjourned
or postponed meeting) or consent in lieu of any such meeting or otherwise FOR
AND IN FAVOR OF the issuance of Veeco Stock in the Merger and approval of the
Veeco Certificate of Incorporation Amendment; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that nothing
set forth in this Proxy is intended or shall be construed to grant to any
Proxyholder the right to vote or otherwise act (by written consent or otherwise)
with respect to any Stockholder Veeco Shares with respect to any Superior Veeco
Proposal or related Veeco Acquisition Transaction.

         The Granting Stockholder hereby revokes all other proxies and powers of
attorney with respect to any Stockholder Veeco Shares that the Granting
Stockholder may have heretofore granted, and no subsequent proxy or power of
attorney shall be given or written consent executed (and if given or executed,
shall not be effective) by the Granting Stockholder purporting to grant the
specific voting powers specified herein. Any obligation of the Granting
Stockholder under this Proxy shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
the Granting Stockholder other than the transferees under Section 3.03(d).

         THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WITH AN INTEREST AND IS IRREVOCABLE UNTIL THE
EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF (I) THE TERMINATION OF THE MERGER AGREEMENT IN ACCORDANCE
WITH ITS TERMS, (II) THE EFFECTIVE TIME OF THE MERGER, AND (III) THE EXECUTION
AND DELIVERY BY ANY PARTY TO THE MERGER AGREEMENT OF ANY AMENDMENT THERETO WHICH
WOULD CAUSE EACH SHARE OF FEI COMMON STOCK TO BE CONVERTED INTO THE RIGHT TO
RECEIVE GREATER THAN 1.355 SHARES OF VEECO STOCK (AS ADJUSTED FOR ANY STOCK
SPLITS, REVERSE STOCK SPLITS, STOCK DIVIDENDS OR SIMILAR EVENTS). THIS PROXY
WILL AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATE AND WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY REVOKED, AND THE INTEREST
WITH WHICH THIS PROXY IS COUPLED WILL BE AUTOMATICALLY EXTINGUISHED, UPON THE
EARLIEST TO OCCUR OF THE EVENTS SPECIFIED IN THE PREVIOUS SENTENCE.

                            EFFECTIVE ______ __, 2002


1.       MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS.

         1.1  ANNUAL MEETING. The annual meeting of stockholders shall be held
at a place and time determined by the board of directors (the "Board").

         1.2  SPECIAL MEETINGS. Special meetings of the stockholders may be
called by resolution of the Board or by the president or chief executive officer
and shall be called by the president, chief executive officer or secretary upon
the written request (stating the purpose or purposes of the meeting) of a
majority of the directors then in office or of the holders of 50% of the
outstanding shares entitled to vote. Only business related to the purposes set
forth in the notice of the meeting may be transacted at a special meeting.

         1.3  PLACE AND TIME OF MEETINGS. Meetings of the stockholders may be
held in or outside Delaware at the place and time specified by the Board, the
chief executive officer of the Corporation or the directors or stockholders
requesting the meeting (as applicable).

         1.4  NOTICE OF MEETINGS; WAIVER OF NOTICE. Written notice of each
meeting of stockholders shall be given to each stockholder entitled to vote at
the meeting, except that (a) it shall not be necessary to give notice to any
stockholder who submits a signed waiver of notice before or after the meeting,
and (b) no notice of an adjourned meeting need be given except when required
under Section 1.6 of these bylaws or by law. Each notice of a meeting shall be
given, personally or by mail, not less than 10 nor more than 60 days before the
meeting and shall state the time and place of the meeting, and unless it is the
annual meeting, shall state at whose direction or request the meeting is called
and the purposes for which it is called. If mailed, notice shall be considered
given when mailed to a stockholder at his address on the Corporation's records.
The attendance of any stockholder at a meeting, without protesting at the
beginning of the meeting that the meeting is not lawfully called or convened,
shall constitute a waiver of notice by him.

         1.5  NATURE OF BUSINESS AT MEETINGS OF STOCKHOLDERS. No business may be
transacted at an annual or special meeting of stockholders, other than business
that is either (a) specified in the notice of meeting (or any supplement
thereto) given by or at the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized
committee thereof), (b) otherwise properly brought before the meeting by or at
the direction of the Board (or any duly authorized committee thereof) or (c)
otherwise properly brought before the meeting by any stockholder of the
Corporation (i) who is a stockholder of record on the date of the giving of the
notice provided for in this Section 1.5 and on the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to vote at such meeting and (ii) who
complies with the notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.5.

<Page>

              In addition to any other applicable requirements, for business to
be properly brought before an annual or special meeting by a stockholder, such
stockholder must have given timely notice thereof in proper written form to the
secretary of the Corporation.

              To be timely, a stockholder's notice to the secretary must be
delivered to or mailed and received at the principal executive offices of the
Corporation (a) in the case of an annual meeting, not less than ninety (90) days
nor more than one hundred and twenty (120) days prior to the anniversary date of
the immediately preceding annual meeting of stockholders; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that in the event that the annual meeting is called for a date that is not
within thirty (30) days before or after such anniversary date, notice by the
stockholder in order to be timely must be so received not later than the close
of business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such notice of
the date of the annual meeting was mailed or such public disclosure of the date
of the annual meeting was made, whichever first occurs; and (b) in the case of a
special meeting, not less than ninety (90) days nor more than one hundred and
twenty (120) days prior to such special meeting.

              To be in proper written form, a stockholder's notice to the
secretary must set forth as to each matter such stockholder proposes to bring
before the meeting (i) a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the meeting and the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting,
(ii) the name and record address of such stockholder, (iii) the class or series
and number of shares of capital stock of the Corporation which are owned
beneficially or of record by such stockholder, (iv) a description of all
arrangements or understandings between such stockholder and any other person or
persons (including their names) in connection with the proposal of such business
by such stockholder and any material interest of such stockholder in such
business and (v) a representation that such stockholder intends to appear in
person or by proxy at the meeting to bring such business before the meeting.

              At the same time or prior to the submission of any stockholder
proposal of business to be conducted at an annual or special meeting that, if
approved, could not be implemented by the Corporation without notifying or
obtaining the consent or approval of any federal, state, municipal or other
regulatory body, the proponent stockholder or stockholders shall submit to the
secretary of the Corporation an analysis, satisfactory to the Board,
demonstrating that the proposal will have no material detrimental effect on the
business and operations of the Corporation after making the requisite notices or
obtaining the requisite consents or approvals and after giving effect to the
potential responses thereto.

              No business shall be conducted at a meeting of stockholders except
business brought before the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth
in this Section 1.5; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, once business has been properly
brought before the meeting in accordance with such procedures, nothing in this
Section 1.5 shall be deemed to preclude discussion by any stockholder of any
such business. If the chairman of the meeting determines that business was not
properly brought before the meeting in accordance with such procedures, the
chairman shall declare to the meeting that the business was not properly brought
before the meeting and such business shall not be transacted.

         1.6  QUORUM. At any meeting of stockholders, the presence in person or
by proxy of the holders of 50% of the shares entitled to vote shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction


                                       2
<Page>

of any business. In the absence of a quorum, a majority in voting interest of
those present or, if no stockholders are present, any officer entitled to
preside at or to act as secretary of the meeting, may adjourn the meeting until
a quorum is present. At any adjourned meeting at which a quorum is present any
action may be taken which might have been taken at the meeting as originally
called. No notice of an adjourned meeting need be given if the time and place
are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken except that, if
adjournment is for more than thirty days or if, after the adjournment, a new
record date is fixed for the meeting, notice of the adjourned meeting shall be
given pursuant to Section 1.4.

         1.7  VOTING; PROXIES. Each stockholder of record shall be entitled to
one vote for every share registered in his name. Corporate action to be taken by
stockholder vote, other than the election of directors, shall be authorized by a
majority of the votes cast at a meeting of stockholders, except as otherwise
provided by law or by Section 1.9 of these bylaws. Directors shall be elected in
the manner provided in Section 2.1 of these bylaws. Voting need not be by ballot
unless ordered by the chairman of the meeting; however, all elections of
directors shall be by written ballot, unless otherwise provided in the
certificate of incorporation. Each stockholder entitled to vote at any meeting
of stockholders or to express consent to or dissent from corporate action in
writing without a meeting may authorize another person to act for him by proxy.
Every proxy must be signed by the stockholder or his attorney-in-fact. No proxy
shall be valid after three years from its date unless it provides otherwise.

         1.8  LIST OF STOCKHOLDERS. Not less than 10 days prior to the date of
any meeting of stockholders, the secretary of the Corporation shall prepare a
complete list of stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of
shares registered in his name. For a period of not less than 10 days prior to
the meeting, the list shall be available during ordinary business hours for
inspection by any stockholder for any purpose germane to the meeting. During
this period, the list shall be kept either (a) at a place within the city where
the meeting is to be held, if that place shall have been specified in the notice
of the meeting, or (b) if not so specified, at the place where the meeting is to
be held. The list shall also be available for inspection by stockholders at the
time and place of the meeting.

         1.9  ACTION BY CONSENT WITHOUT A MEETING. No action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting of stockholders may be taken by written
consent without a meeting.

2.       BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

         2.1  NUMBER, QUALIFICATION, ELECTION AND TERM OF DIRECTORS. The
business of the Corporation shall be managed by the Board. The Board shall
consist of not less than three nor more than fifteen members, the exact number
of which shall be determined from time to time by resolution adopted by a
majority vote of the directors then serving, but no decrease in the number of
directors that constitutes the Board may shorten the term of any incumbent
director. Subject to the rights of the holders of any series of preferred stock
to elect additional directors under specified circumstances, the directors shall
be divided into three (3) classes designated as Class I, Class II and Class III,
respectively, as nearly equal in size as possible. Unless otherwise provided in
the certificate of incorporation, directors shall be elected

at each annual meeting of stockholders and shall hold office for a full term of
three (3) years to succeed the directors of the class whose terms expire at such
annual meeting. Each director shall also serve until the election and
qualification of their respective successors, subject to the provisions of
Section 2.10. As used in these bylaws, the term "entire Board" means the total
number of directors which the Corporation would have if there were no vacancies
on the Board.

         2.2  NOMINATION OF DIRECTORS. Only persons who are nominated in
accordance with the following procedures shall be eligible for election as
directors of the Corporation, except as may be otherwise provided in the

directors in certain circumstances. Nominations of persons for election to the
Board may be made at any annual meeting of stockholders, or at any special
