v _AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER_

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Plan of Merger_ ") is made as of
August 14, 2013, by and between Firstbank Corporation, a Michigan corporation
(" _Firstbank_ "), and Mercantile Bank Corporation, a Michigan corporation ("
_Mercantile_ ").

 

 _PRELIMINARY STATEMENT_

1\. The respective Boards of Directors of each of Firstbank and Mercantile
have determined that it is in the best interests of their respective
corporations and shareholders that Firstbank and Mercantile engage in a
business combination in order to continue and advance their respective long-
term business strategies and goals; and

 

 __2\. The respective Boards of Directors of each of Firstbank and Mercantile
have approved the merger of Firstbank with and into Mercantile (the "
_Merger_ ") in accordance with the terms of this Plan of Merger, the Michigan
Business Corporation Act (the " _MBCA_ ") and any other applicable Law; and __

 

3\. The Firstbank Board of Directors has, in light of and subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in this Plan of Merger (a) determined that the terms
of this Plan of Merger are fair to and in the best interests of Firstbank and
the Firstbank Shareholders, and (b) resolved to adopt this Plan of Merger, to
authorize the transactions contemplated by it and to recommend approval by
the Firstbank Shareholders of this Plan of Merger; and

4\. This Plan of Merger is a memorandum of understanding within the meaning
of Article X(B) of Firstbanks articles of incorporation and it has been
approved by the Firstbank Board of Directors pursuant to and in accordance
with Article X(B) of Firstbanks articles of incorporation; and

5\. The Mercantile Board of Directors has, in light of and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth in this Plan of Merger (a) determined that the
terms of this Plan of Merger are fair to and in the best interests of
Mercantile and the Mercantile Shareholders, and (b) resolved to adopt this
Plan of Merger, to authorize the transactions contemplated by it and to
recommend approval by the Mercantile Shareholders of this Plan of Merger and
the issuance of shares of Mercantile Common Stock constituting the Merger
Consideration; and

 

 __6\. For federal income tax purposes, it is intended that the Merger shall
qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section 368(a)(1)(A) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), and this Plan
of Merger is intended to be and is adopted as a "Plan of Reorganization" for
the purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code. __

In consideration of the representations, warranties, mutual covenants and
agreements contained in this Plan of Merger, Firstbank and Mercantile agree
as follows: ARTICLE I

THE MERGER

1.1 _Merger._

 

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Plan of Merger, at the Effective
Time, Firstbank shall be merged with and into Mercantile and the
separate corporate existence of Firstbank shall cease. Firstbank and
Mercantile are each sometimes referred to as a " _Constituent Corporation_ "
prior to the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Constituent Corporations shall
become a single corporation, which corporation shall be Mercantile (the "
_Surviving Corporation_ "). The effect of the Merger upon each of the
Constituent Corporations and the Surviving Corporation shall be as provided in
Chapter Seven of the MBCA with respect to the merger of domestic
corporations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject to
the MBCA, at the Effective Time: (a) all the rights, privileges, powers,
franchises, licenses, and interests in and to every type of property (whether
real, personal, or mixed) of Firstbank and Mercantile, shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, (b) all choses in action of Firstbank and Mercantile
shall continue unaffected and uninterrupted by the Merger and shall accrue to
the Surviving Corporation, and (c) all debts, liabilities and duties of
Firstbank and Mercantile shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

 

1.2 _The Closing._

 

Firstbank and Mercantile shall consummate the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") (a)
at the offices of Warner Norcross and Judd LLP, 900 Fifth Third Center, 111
Lyon Street N.W., Grand Rapids, Michigan, at 10:00 a.m., local time, on a date
to be agreed upon by Firstbank and Mercantile, which will be no later than
five Business Days immediately following the day on which the last of the
conditions to Closing contained in _Article VI_ (other than any conditions
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing) is satisfied or
waived in accordance with this Plan of Merger or (b) at such other place
and time or on such other date as Firstbank and Mercantile may mutually
determine (the date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the
" _Closing Date_ ").

 

1.3 _Effective Time of Merger._

Upon completion of the Closing, Firstbank and Mercantile shall each promptly
execute and file a certificate of merger as required by the MBCA to effect the
Merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ "). No party shall take any action to
revoke the Certificate of Merger after its filing without the written consent
of the other party. The " _Effective Time_ " of the Merger shall be as of the
time and date when the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the
Certificate of Merger, but not later than two Business Days after the Closing
occurs.

1.4 _Additional Actions._

At any time after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation may determine
that deeds, assignments, or assurances or any other acts are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect, or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its rights, title, or interest in, to, or under any of
the rights, properties, or assets of Firstbank and Mercantile acquired or to
be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection
with, the Merger, or to otherwise carry out the purposes of this Plan of
Merger. Firstbank and Mercantile grant to the

 



2  Surviving Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and
deliver all such deeds, assignments, and assurances and to do all acts
necessary, proper, or convenient to accomplish this purpose. This irrevocable
power of attorney shall only be operative following the Effective Time and at
such time the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be
fully authorized in the name of Firstbank and Mercantile to take any and all
such actions contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

1.5 _Surviving Corporation._

 

At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall have the following
attributes until they are subsequently changed in the manner provided by
Law: 

1.5.1 _Name_. The name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Mercantile Bank
Corporation."

 

1.5.2 _Articles of Incorporation_. The articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be the articles of incorporation of Mercantile as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, without change.

1.5.3 _Bylaws_. The bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be the bylaws
of Mercantile as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, without
change.

 

1.5.4 _Officers_. The officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set
forth in _Section 5.10_.

 

1.5.5 _Directors_. The directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be as set
forth in _Section 5.10_.

 

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF MERGER ON CAPITAL STOCK

2.1 _Conversion of Securities_.

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of Firstbank, Mercantile or any other Person:

2.1.1 _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of Firstbank Common Stock
that is owned by Firstbank (or by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) or
Mercantile (or by any of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") immediately before the Effective Time will automatically
be canceled and cease to exist without delivery of any consideration in
exchange for or in respect of any Excluded Share.

2.1.2 _Conversion of Common Stock_. Each share of Firstbank Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than the
Excluded Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive 1.00 (the "
_Exchange Ratio_ ") fully paid and nonassessable share of Mercantile Common
Stock (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), whereupon such shares of Firstbank
Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and all rights with respect to
such shares of Firstbank Common Stock will cease to exist, except the right to
receive the Merger

 



3  Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to
_Section 2.7_, and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.4_, upon surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares, in
accordance with _Section 2.3_. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on
any payment to holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the
provisions of this _Article II_. 

2.2 _Stock Plans._

2.2.1 Firstbank and Mercantile shall take all requisite action so that, as of
the Effective Time, each Firstbank Stock Option and share of Firstbank
Restricted Stock (each, an " _Award_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent
an Award with respect to Firstbank Common Stock, and shall be converted by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of that
Award, into an award with respect to a number of shares of Mercantile Common
Stock equal to the product of (a) the aggregate number of shares of Firstbank
Common Stock subject to such Award, multiplied by (b) the Exchange Ratio (as
converted, a " _Converted Stock-Based Award_ "). The value of any fractional
shares related to any Converted Stock-Based Award shall be paid in cash at the
time such Converted Stock-Based Award is otherwise settled pursuant to its
terms. As of the Effective Time, Mercantile will assume each of the Firstbank
Stock Plans.

2.2.2 All Converted Stock-Based Awards shall continue to have, and be subject
to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Firstbank Stock
Plan (or any other agreement to which such Converted Stock-Based Award was
subject immediately prior to the Effective Time), except as otherwise provided
in this Plan of Merger. The exercise or strike price (if any) per share of
Mercantile Common Stock applicable to any Converted Stock-Based Award which
was a Firstbank Stock Option shall be equal to (a) the per share exercise
price of such Award immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by (b) the
Exchange Ratio. Prior to the Effective Time, Firstbank shall make
such amendments and take such other actions with respect to the Firstbank
Stock Plans as shall be necessary to effect the adjustment referred to in this
Section 2.2, including notifying all participants in the Firstbank Stock Plans
of such adjustment.

2.2.3 Mercantile shall take all corporate action necessary to reserve for
issuance a sufficient number of shares of Mercantile Common Stock for
delivery upon exercise or settlement of the Converted Stock-Based Awards in
accordance with this Section 2.2. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, if and to the extent necessary to cause a sufficient number
of shares of Mercantile Common Stock to be registered and issuable under
Converted Stock-Based Awards, Mercantile shall file a post-effective amendment
to the Registration Statement or one or more registration statements on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the
shares of Mercantile Common Stock subject to Converted Stock-Based Awards and
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of
such registration statement or registration statements (and maintain the
current status of the prospectus or prospectuses contained therein) for so
long as such Converted Stock-Based Awards remain outstanding.

 



4 __2.2.4 Each share of Firstbank Restricted Stock shall vest as of the
Effective Time and be converted into a share of Mercantile Common Stock on
the same basis as other shares of Firstbank Common Stock pursuant to this
_Section 2.2_. Each holder of Firstbank Restricted Stock which is converted
pursuant to this  _Section 2.2_ shall be permitted to surrender shares of
Mercantile Common Stock in satisfaction of applicable Tax withholding
obligations. __

2.3 _Surrender of Shares_.

2.3.1 _Exchange Agent_ ; _Exchange Fund_. Prior to or at the Effective Time,
Mercantile shall deposit with a bank or trust company designated by Mercantile
and reasonably satisfactory to Firstbank (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of Firstbank Common Stock as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether represented by Certificates or held as Book-Entry
Shares, shares of Mercantile Common Stock, in the aggregate amount equal to
the number of shares of Mercantile Common Stock to which holders of Firstbank
Common Stock are entitled based on the Exchange Ratio pursuant to Section
2.1.2. In addition, Mercantile shall deposit with the Exchange Agent, prior to
or at the Effective Time and as necessary from time to time after the
Effective Time, cash in an amount sufficient to make payment in lieu of any
fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.7 and payment of any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.4. All such shares
of Mercantile Common Stock and cash deposited with the Exchange Agent
pursuant to this Section 2.3.1 is referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_."

2.3.2 _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Mercantile shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each
holder of record of shares of Firstbank Common Stock (other than the Excluded
Shares), as of the Effective Time, a form of letter of transmittal (which
shall be in customary form and shall specify that delivery will be effected,
and risk of loss and title to Certificates or Book-Entry Shares will pass,
only upon proper delivery of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares to the
Exchange Agent upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of
transmittal) and instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.7 _and
any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_. __

 

Upon surrender of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares for cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed
and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such
other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, each
holder of a Certificate or of Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive
in exchange therefor (a) book-entry shares representing the number of whole
shares of Mercantile Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.1.2_, (b) cash in lieu of any fractional shares payable
pursuant to _Section 2.7_, and (c) any dividends or distributions payable
pursuant to _Section 2.4, _and such Certificates and Book-Entry Shares so
surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.

 



5 In the event of a transfer of ownership of Firstbank Common Stock that is not
registered in the transfer records of Firstbank, payment of the Merger
Consideration may be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares so surrendered are registered if properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting
such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes required by reason of the
transfer or establish, to the reasonable satisfaction of Mercantile, that such
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated
by this _Section 2.3.2_, each Certificate and Book-Entry Share shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.7_ and any dividends or
other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_.

2.4 _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_.

No dividends or other distributions with respect to Mercantile Common Stock
with a record date on or after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder
of any unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share with respect to the
shares of Mercantile Common Stock that the holder of such unsurrendered
Certificate or Book-Entry Share has the right to receive upon the surrender of
such unsurrendered Certificate or Book-Entry Share, and no cash payment in
lieu of fractional shares of Mercantile Common Stock shall be paid to any
such holder pursuant to _Section 2.7_, until the holder of such Certificate
or Book-Entry Share shall have surrendered such Certificate or Book-Entry
Share in accordance with this _Article II_. Subject to escheat or other
applicable Law, following the surrender of any Certificate or Book-Entry
Share, there shall be paid to the record holder of whole shares of Mercantile
Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest, with respect to
such whole shares of Mercantile Common Stock (a) at the time of such
surrender, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record date
and a payment date on or after the Effective Time and on or prior to the date
of such surrender and the amount of any cash payable in lieu of a fractional
share of Mercantile Common Stock to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
_Section 2.7_ and (b) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of
dividends or other distributions with a record date on or after the Effective
Time but prior to such surrender and a payment date subsequent to such
surrender payable with respect to such whole shares of Mercantile Common
Stock.

2.5 _Termination of Exchange Fund_.

Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to holders of
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares for one year after the Effective Time shall
be delivered to Mercantile, upon demand, and any holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares who have not then complied with this _Article II_ shall
thereafter look only to Mercantile for, and Mercantile shall remain liable
for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of
any fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.7_, and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_, in accordance with
this _Article II_.

2.6  _No Further Ownership Rights in Firstbank Common Stock_.

The Merger Consideration, any cash in lieu of any fractional shares
payable pursuant to _Section 2.7_, and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_ upon the surrender of Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article II_ shall be
deemed to have been in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the
Firstbank Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. At the close of business on the

 



6  Closing Date, the share transfer books of Firstbank shall be closed, and
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the share transfer
books of Firstbank of shares of Firstbank Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect to shares of Firstbank Common Stock, except as otherwise
provided in this Plan of Merger or by applicable Law.

2.7 _No Fractional Shares._

 

No certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Mercantile Common
Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares, no dividends or other distributions of Mercantile shall
be paid with respect to such fractional share interests, and such fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner to vote or to have any rights of a
holder of shares of Mercantile Common Stock. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Plan of Merger, each holder of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares who would otherwise have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share
of Mercantile Common Stock (determined after taking into account all
Certificates and Book-Entry Shares delivered by such holder) shall receive, in
lieu of such fractional part of a share of Mercantile Common Stock, cash
(without interest) in an amount equal to the product of (a) such fractional
part of a share of Mercantile Common Stock multiplied by (b) the closing price
for a share of Mercantile Common Stock as reported on NASDAQ on the trading
day immediately before the date on which the Effective Time occurs.

2.8 _No Liability._

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none of Firstbank,
Mercantile, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent will be liable to
any Firstbank Shareholder or any other Person in respect of any cash properly
delivered to a Governmental Entity pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Exchange Fund remaining
unclaimed by Firstbank Shareholders as of a date that is immediately prior
to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of
any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by applicable Law,
become the property of Mercantile free and clear of any claims or interest of
any Person previously entitled thereto.

2.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificate_ s.

In the event that any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed,
Mercantile or the Exchange Agent will, upon the receipt of an affidavit of
that fact by the holder of such Certificate in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Mercantile or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, pay in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Merger
Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to 
_Section 2.7 _and any dividends or other distributions payable pursuant to
_Section 2.4 _payable in respect of the shares of Firstbank Common Stock
previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate. Mercantile
or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, may, in its discretion and as a
condition precedent to the payment of the Merger Consideration, any cash in
lieu of fractional shares payable pursuant to _Section 2.7 _and any dividends
or other distributions payable pursuant to _Section 2.4_, require the owner
of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as
Mercantile or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, may reasonably direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against Mercantile or the
Exchange Agent with respect to such Certificate.

 



7 2.10 _Withholding Rights_.

Mercantile shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or cause to be deducted
or withheld, from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Plan of
Merger such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to
the making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or paid over to or
deposited with the relevant Governmental Entity by Mercantile, such withheld
amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan of Merger as having
been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and withholding was
made by Mercantile.

 

2.11 _Investment of Exchange Fund._

The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Mercantile from time to time provided that no gain or loss thereon
shall affect the amounts payable or the timing of the amounts payable to
Firstbank Shareholders pursuant to this _Article II_. The Exchange Fund shall
not be used for any purpose except as set forth herein. Any interest and other
income resulting from such investments shall be for Mercantiles account.

2.12 _Adjustments._

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article II_ , if, between
the date of this Plan of Merger and the Effective Time, there is declared
(with an effective time prior to the Effective Time) or effected a
reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including a
reverse stock split), split-up, stock dividend or stock distribution
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
Mercantile Common Stock or Firstbank Common Stock), combination, exchange, or
readjustment of shares with respect to, or rights issued in respect of,
Mercantile Common Stock or Firstbank Common Stock, the Exchange Ratio shall be
proportionately adjusted accordingly to provide to the holders of Firstbank
Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Plan of Merger
prior to such event.

Mercantile prior to or concurrently with the execution of this Plan of Merger
(the " _Firstbank Disclosure Letter_ "), it being understood and agreed that

shares of Firstbank Common Stock entitled to vote to approve the Plan of
Merger (the " _Firstbank Shareholder_ _Approval_ "), 

 



8  to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger. This
Plan of Merger has been duly adopted, and the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger have been duly

Directors has (a) determined that the terms of this Plan of Merger are fair to
and in the best interests of Firstbank and the Firstbank Shareholders, and
(b) adopted this Plan of Merger and authorized the transactions contemplated

(such recommendation, the " _Firstbank Board Recommendation_ "). This Plan of
Merger is a memorandum of understanding within the meaning of Article X(B) of
Firstbanks articles of incorporation and it has been approved by the
Firstbank Board of Directors pursuant to and in accordance with Article X(B)
of Firstbanks articles of incorporation. Except for the Firstbank Shareholder
Approval, no other corporate proceedings on the part of Firstbank are
necessary to authorize this Plan of Merger or to consummate the Merger. This
Plan of Merger has been duly executed and delivered by, and (assuming due
authorization, execution and delivery by Mercantile) constitutes valid and
binding obligations of, Firstbank and is enforceable against Firstbank in
accordance with its terms, except to the extent that (i) such enforcement may
be subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect, relating to creditors rights
generally and (ii) equitable remedies of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and
to the discretion of the court before which any proceeding therefor may be
brought.

3.1.2 _No Conflict, Breach, Violation, Etc_. The execution, delivery,
and performance of this Plan of Merger by Firstbank and the consummation of
the Merger, do not and will not violate, conflict with, or result in a breach
of: (a) any provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws (or similar
organizational documents) of Firstbank or any Subsidiary of Firstbank (each a
" _Firstbank Subsidiary_ " and collectively, the " _Firstbank Subsidiaries_
"); or (b) any Law or Order applicable to Firstbank or any Firstbank
Subsidiary, assuming the timely receipt of each of the approvals referred to
in _Section 3.1.4_.

3.1.3  _Regulatory Restrictions_. The execution, delivery, and performance of
this Plan of Merger by Firstbank and the consummation of the Merger do not and
will not violate, conflict with, result in a breach of, constitute a default
under, or require any consent, approval, waiver, extension, amendment,
authorization, notice, or filing under, any cease and desist order, written
agreement, memorandum of understanding, board resolutions or other regulatory
agreement or commitment with or from a Governmental Entity to which Firstbank
or any Firstbank Subsidiary is a party or subject, or by which Firstbank or
any Firstbank Subsidiary is bound or affected.

3.1.4 _Required Approvals_. No notice to, filing with, authorization of,
exemption by, or consent or approval of, any Governmental Entity is necessary
for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger
by Firstbank other than in connection or compliance with the provisions of the
MBCA, compliance with federal and state securities laws, and the consents,
authorizations, approvals, or exemptions required under the Bank Holding
Company Act, the FDI Act, and the Michigan Banking Code. Firstbank has no
Knowledge of any reason why the regulatory approvals referred to in this
_Section 3.1.4_ cannot be obtained or why the regulatory approval process
would be materially impeded.

 



9 3.2 _Organization and Good Standing._

 

Firstbank is a corporation duly organized, validly existing, and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Michigan. Firstbank has all
requisite corporate power and authority to own, operate, and lease its
properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted in all material respects. Firstbank is a bank holding company duly
registered as such with the Federal Reserve Board under the Bank Holding
Company Act. Firstbank is not, and is not required to be, qualified or
admitted to conduct business as a foreign corporation in any other state,
except where such failure to be so qualified has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Firstbank
Material Adverse Effect.

3.3  _Subsidiaries_.

3.3.1 _Ownership_. Firstbank has provided to Mercantile a true and complete
list of each Firstbank Subsidiary as of the date of this Plan of Merger.
Other than the Firstbank Subsidiaries, Firstbank does not have "control" (as
defined in Section 2(a)(2) of the Bank Holding Company Act, using 5 percent
rather than 25 percent), either directly or indirectly, of any Person engaged
in an active trade or business or that holds any significant assets. Firstbank
or a Firstbank Subsidiary owns all of the issued and outstanding capital stock
or other equity interests of each of the Firstbank Subsidiaries, free and
clear of any claim or Lien of any kind. There is no legally binding and
enforceable subscription, option, warrant, right to acquire, or any other
similar agreement pertaining to the capital stock or other equity interests
of any Firstbank Subsidiary.

3.3.2 _Organization and Good Standing_. Each of the Firstbank
Subsidiaries (a) is duly organized and validly existing under the laws of its
jurisdiction of organization; (b) is duly qualified to do business and in good
standing in all jurisdictions (whether federal, state, or local) where its
ownership or leasing of property or the conduct of its business requires it
to be so qualified, and (c) has all requisite corporate power and authority to
own or lease its properties and assets and to carry on its business as now
conducted, except in each of (a) through (c) as has not had, and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Firstbank
Material Adverse Effect.

3.3.3 _Deposit Insurance; Other Assessments_. The deposits of each Firstbank
Subsidiary that is a depository institution are insured by the FDIC to the
fullest extent permitted by Law, and all premiums and assessments to be paid
in connection therewith have been paid by each such Firstbank Subsidiary when
due. No proceeding for the revocation or termination of such deposit insurance
is pending or, to the Knowledge of Firstbank, threatened. Firstbank and each
Firstbank Subsidiary has paid as and when due all material fees, charges,
assessments, and the like as required by Law to each and every Governmental
Entity having jurisdiction over Firstbank or each Firstbank Subsidiary.

 



10 3.4 _Capital Stock_.

 

3.4.1 _Classes and Shares_. The authorized capital stock of Firstbank consists
of 20,300,000 shares, divided into two classes, as follows (i) 20,000,000
shares of common stock, no par value (the " _Firstbank Common Stock_ "), of
which 8,073,821 shares were issued and outstanding as of the date of this Plan
of Merger; and (ii) 300,000 shares of preferred stock, no par value (the "
_Firstbank Preferred Stock_ "), of which no shares were issued and outstanding
as of the date of this Plan of Merger. Except for the Firstbank Share-Based
Awards, as of the date of this Plan of Merger, there is no security or class
of securities outstanding that represents or is convertible into capital stock
of Firstbank.

3.4.2 _Share-Based Awards_. Section 3.4.2 of the Firstbank Disclosure Letter
sets forth, as of the date of this Plan of Merger, the number of shares of
Firstbank Common Stock that are authorized and reserved for issuance under
each Firstbank Stock Plan, and the number of shares of Firstbank Common Stock
that are subject to outstanding Firstbank Stock Options and Firstbank
Restricted Stock (collectively, " _Firstbank Share-Based Awards_ ") issued
under a Firstbank Stock Plan. All Firstbank Share-Based Awards have been
awarded under a Firstbank Stock Plan, and, as of the date of this Plan of
Merger, there are no other compensatory awards outstanding pursuant to which
Firstbank Common Stock has issued or is issuable, or that relate to or are
determined by reference to the value of Firstbank Common Stock. All
outstanding shares of Firstbank Common Stock, and all Firstbank Common Stock
reserved for issuance under the Firstbank Stock Plans when issued in
accordance with the respective terms of the Firstbank Stock Plans, are or will
be duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and not
issued in violation of any preemptive rights, purchase option, call or right
of first refusal rights.

3.4.3 _Issuance of Shares_. After the date of this Plan of Merger, the number
of issued and outstanding shares of Firstbank Common Stock and Firstbank
Preferred Stock is not subject to change before the Effective Time, other than
the issuance of shares of Firstbank Common Stock upon the exercise of
any Firstbank Stock Options granted pursuant to a Firstbank Stock Plan prior
to the date of this Plan of Merger.

3.4.4 _Voting Rights_. Other than the issued and outstanding shares of
Firstbank Common Stock described in _Section 3.4.1_, neither Firstbank nor
any Firstbank Subsidiary has outstanding any security or issue of securities
the holder or holders of which have the right to vote on the approval of the
Merger or this Plan of Merger, or that entitle the holder or holders to
consent to, or withhold consent on, the Merger or this Plan of Merger.

 

3.4.5 _Appraisal Rights_. No Firstbank Shareholder will be entitled to
appraisal rights pursuant to the MBCA as a result of the consummation of the

of the respective dates of and for the periods referred to in such financial
statements, all in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, subject, in the
case of unaudited interim financial statements, to normal, recurring year-end
adjustments (the effect of which has not had, and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Firstbank Material
Adverse Effect) and the absence of notes (that, if presented, would
not differ materially from those included in Firstbanks Financial
Statements). No financial statements of any entity or enterprise other than
the Firstbank Subsidiaries are required by GAAP to be included in the
consolidated financial statements of Firstbank.

notes, and exhibits) were prepared and filed in conformity with applicable
regulatory requirements and were correct and complete in all material respects
when filed:

will be prepared and filed in conformity with applicable regulatory
requirements applied consistently throughout their respective periods (except
as otherwise noted in such reports) and will be correct and complete in all
material respects when filed. All of the reports identified in this _Section
3.5.2_ are collectively referred to as the " _Firstbank Call Reports_."

Since December 31, 2012, (a) Firstbank and the Firstbank Subsidiaries have
conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary course consistent with
past practice and (b) no event has occurred that has had, or would reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Firstbank Material
Adverse Effect.

 

3.7 _Legal Proceedings_.

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Firstbank Material
Adverse Effect. There 

 



12  is no material unsatisfied judgment, penalty or award against Firstbank or
any of the Firstbank Subsidiaries. Neither Firstbank nor any of the Firstbank
Subsidiaries, nor any of their respective properties or assets, is subject to
any Order or any investigation by a Governmental Entity that has had, or would
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Firstbank
Material Adverse Effect. No officer or director of Firstbank or any of the
Firstbank Subsidiaries is a defendant in any Action commenced by any
shareholder of Firstbank or any of the Firstbank Subsidiaries with respect to
the performance of his or her duties as an officer or a director of
Firstbank or any of the Firstbank Subsidiaries under any applicable Law,
except for any Action arising out of or relating to the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

 

3.8 _Regulatory Filings_.

 

In the last three years:

3.8.1  _Regulatory Filings_. Firstbank and each Firstbank Subsidiary has
filed in a timely manner all filings with Governmental Entities as required by
applicable Law; and

3.8.2 _Complete and Accurate_. All such filings, as of their respective filing
dates, complied in all material respects with all Laws, forms, and guidelines
applicable to such filings.

 

3.9 _No Indemnification Claims_.

To the Knowledge of Firstbank, there has been no event, action, or omission by
or with respect to any director, officer, employee, trustee, agent, or other

except for violations that have not had, and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Firstbank Material Adverse
Effect.

3.11 _Transaction Documents_. 

None of the information supplied or to be supplied by Firstbank for inclusion
or incorporation by reference in any Transaction Document will contain any
untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, (a) in the case of

Proxy Statement.

3.12 _Agreements With Bank Regulators_.

 

Neither Firstbank nor any Firstbank Subsidiary is a party to any Contract,
cease and desist order, written agreement or memorandum of understanding
with, or a party to any commitment letter, board resolution or similar
undertaking to, or is subject to any Order by, or is a recipient of any
extraordinary supervisory letter from, any Governmental Entity that restricts
materially the conduct of Firstbanks or a Firstbank Subsidiarys business,
or in any manner relates to the capital adequacy, credit or reserve policies
or management of Firstbank or any Firstbank Subsidiary (a " _Regulatory
Agreement_ "), nor has Firstbank nor any Firstbank Subsidiary been advised by
any Governmental Entity that a Governmental Entity is contemplating issuing or
requesting (or is considering the appropriateness of issuing or requesting) an

359 or the Federal Reserve Board to give prior notice to a federal banking
agency of the proposed addition of an individual to its board of directors or
the employment of an individual as a senior executive officer or to limit
golden parachute payments or indemnification.

3.13 _Tax Matters_.

3.13.1 All material Tax Returns required by applicable Law to have been filed
by Firstbank and each Firstbank Subsidiary since January 1, 2007 have been
filed when due (taking into account any extensions), and each such Tax Return
is complete and accurate and correctly reflects the liability for Taxes in
all material respects. Since January 1, 2007, Firstbank and each Firstbank
Subsidiary has withheld and paid all material Taxes required to have been
withheld and paid in connection with amounts paid or owing to any third party.
Since January 1, 2007, all material Taxes that are due and payable by
Firstbank and each Firstbank Subsidiary have been paid.

 

3.13.2 There is no audit or other proceeding pending against or with respect
to Firstbank or any Firstbank Subsidiary with respect to any material amount
of Tax. There are no material Liens on any of the assets of Firstbank or any
of the Firstbank Subsidiaries that arose in connection with any failure (or
alleged failure) to pay any Tax, other than Liens for Taxes not yet due
and payable.

of limitations in respect of Taxes or agreed to any extension of time with
respect to any Taxes, which waiver or extension is still open.

which the statute of limitations has not expired (other than a group of which
Firstbank and one or more Firstbank Subsidiaries are the only members).
Neither Firstbank nor any Firstbank Subsidiary is a general partner in any
partnership.

3.13.6 Within the past three years, neither Firstbank nor any
Firstbank Subsidiary has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in a distribution intended to qualify for tax-free treatment
under Section 355 of the Code.

 

3.13.7 Neither Firstbank nor any Firstbank Subsidiary has participated in or
been a party to a transaction that, as of the date of this Plan of Merger,
constitutes a "listed transaction" for purposes of Section 6011 of the Code
(or a similar provision of state Law).

3.13.8 Neither Firstbank nor any Firstbank Subsidiary has taken any action or

Adverse Recommendation Change by the Firstbank Board of Directors. For
avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the making of a Firstbank Adverse
Recommendation Change relieve Firstbank of any obligation to call, give proper
notice of, convene, and hold the Firstbank Shareholder Meeting, and to
distribute, collect, tabulate and vote proxies for the Firstbank
Shareholder Meeting, in each case to the extent generally consistent with
past practice for Firstbank shareholder meetings.

which the Firstbank Shareholder Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth

insufficient votes to obtain the Firstbank Shareholder Approval, (A) at the
request of Mercantile, Firstbank shall adjourn or postpone the Firstbank
Shareholder Meeting to a date no more than 10 Business Days later than the
date of the initial Firstbank Shareholder Meeting; _provided_ , that
Mercantile may not request that Firstbank make such an adjournment
or postponement more than once and (B) Firstbank may adjourn or postpone the
Firstbank Shareholder Meeting.

5.6.5 Mercantile shall, as soon as practicable following the date of this
Plan of Merger, duly call, give proper notice of, convene and hold a special
meeting of the Mercantile Shareholders for the purpose of seeking the
Mercantile Shareholder Approval ( _"Mercantile Shareholder Meeting"_ ).
Mercantile shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (a) cause the
Joint Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Mercantile Shareholders and to hold
the Mercantile Shareholder Meeting as promptly as practicable after the
Registration Statement is declared effective under the Securities Act and (b)
except if the Mercantile Board of Directors shall have made a Mercantile
Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by  _Section 5.5_, solicit the
Mercantile Shareholder Approval. Mercantile shall, through the Mercantile
Board of Directors, recommend to the Mercantile Shareholders that they vote
for the Mercantile Shareholder Approval and shall include such recommendation
in the Joint Proxy Statement, except to the extent that the Mercantile Board
of Directors shall have made a Mercantile Adverse Recommendation Change as
permitted by _Section 5.5_. Except as expressly contemplated by the
two immediately preceding sentences, Mercantile agrees that its obligations
pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ shall not be affected by the commencement,
public proposal, public disclosure or communication to Mercantile of any
Mercantile Takeover Proposal or by the making of any Mercantile Adverse
Recommendation Change by the Mercantile Board of Directors. For avoidance of
doubt, in no event shall the making of a Mercantile Adverse Recommendation
Change relieve Mercantile of any obligation to call, give proper notice of,
convene, and hold the Mercantile Shareholder Meeting, and to distribute,
collect, tabulate and vote proxies for the Mercantile Shareholder Meeting, in
each case to the extent generally consistent with past practice for
Mercantile shareholder meetings.

Consolidation and the other transactions contemplated herein, (c) make or
cause to be made the applications or filings required to be made by Firstbank

transactions contemplated by this Plan

 



68  of Merger and (e) coordinate and cooperate with, submit to the other party
for review and give due consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions
or changes suggested by the other party in connection with, making (i) any
filing or application under or with respect to any such Laws, and (ii) any
filings, conferences or other submissions related to resolving any
investigation or other inquiry by any Governmental Entity.

Each of Firstbank and Mercantile shall, and shall cause their respective
Affiliates to, furnish to the other party all information reasonably
necessary for any such application or other filings to be made in connection
with the Merger, the Bank Consolidation or other transactions contemplated by
this Plan of Merger, including all Banking Filings. Each of Firstbank and
Mercantile shall promptly inform the other party of any communication with,
and any proposed understanding, undertaking or agreement with, any
Governmental Entity regarding any such application or filing. If Firstbank or
Mercantile intends to independently participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Entity in respect of any such filings, investigation or other
inquiry, then Firstbank or Mercantile, as applicable, shall give the other
party reasonable prior notice of, and the opportunity to participate in, such
meeting. The parties shall coordinate and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party in connection with all meetings, actions and proceedings under or
relating to any such application or filing.

consents in order to consummate the Merger, the Bank Consolidation and the
other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger (collectively, the
_"Banking Filings"_ ). In connection therewith, the parties shall use, and
shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to use, commercially reasonable
efforts to promptly resolve any objections and respond to any inquiries that
may arise in connection with any of the Banking Filings. Each party will
furnish all information, including certificates, consents and opinions
of experts reasonably requested by the other party for the preparation of the
Banking Filings and will advise each other and their respective counsel about
any significant developments with respect to the Banking Filings and the
status of the approvals being sought, in each case subject to applicable Laws
relating to the confidentiality of information. Each of the parties shall have
the right to review a reasonable time in advance of any filing deadline all
Banking Filings and related submissions and written communications to any
applicable Governmental Entity, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed.

5.8.3 Firstbank and Mercantile shall give (or shall cause their respective

shall coordinate and cooperate in determining whether any actions, consents,
approvals or waivers are required to be obtained from parties to any Firstbank
Material Contracts or Mercantile Material Contracts in connection with
consummation of the Merger or

 



69  the other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger and in seeking
any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers. Except as expressly provided
in _Article VI_ , no such actions, consents, approvals or waivers shall
constitute conditions to Closing. In the event that either party fails to
obtain any third party consent described in the first sentence of this
_Section 5.8.3_, such party shall use commercially reasonable efforts, and
shall take any such actions reasonably requested by the other party hereto, to
mitigate any adverse effect upon Firstbank and Mercantile, their respective
Subsidiaries, and their respective businesses resulting, or, with respect to
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, which could reasonably be
expected to result after the Effective Time, from the failure to obtain such
consent.

5.8.4 From the date of this Plan of Merger until the Effective Time, each of
Firstbank and Mercantile shall promptly notify the other party in writing of
any pending or, to the Knowledge of Firstbank or Mercantile (as the case may
be), threatened Action or Order by any Governmental Entity or any other Person
(a) challenging or seeking material damages in connection with the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger or (b) seeking to
restrain or prohibit the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

5.8.5 If any Action or Order is instituted (or threatened to be instituted)
challenging any of the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger as
violative of any Law, each of Firstbank and Mercantile shall, and shall cause
their respective Representatives to, cooperate and use their commercially
reasonable efforts to contest and resist, except insofar as Firstbank and
Mercantile may otherwise agree, any such Action or Order, including any
Action or Order that seeks a temporary restraining order or preliminary
injunction that would prohibit, prevent or restrict consummation of the Merger
or the other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

 

5.8.6 Nothing contained in this Plan of Merger shall give Firstbank, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of Mercantile or
give Mercantile, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the
operations of Firstbank prior to the Effective Time. Prior to the Effective
Time, subject to _Sections 5.1 and 5.2_ , as applicable, Firstbank and
Mercantile each shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of
this Plan of Merger, complete control and supervision over their respective
business operations.

 

5.8.7 Each of Firstbank and Mercantile shall, and shall cause their respective
Subsidiaries to, take all commercially reasonable and lawful actions as may
be necessary or appropriate to transfer, or to allow for the Surviving
Corporation to utilize after the Effective Time, or obtain, as permitted by
Law, all Permits appropriate or necessary to continue the business of
Firstbank and Mercantile and their respective Subsidiaries as currently
conducted.

with and into Mercantile Bank of Michigan, a Michigan state-chartered bank
(the " _Bank Consolidation_ "), in

 



70  accordance with the provisions of, and with the effect provided under, the
Michigan Banking Code and applicable Law and to take, or cause to be taken,

Banks and Mercantile Bank, respectively, approve, adopt, execute, and deliver
(as applicable) the Bank Consolidation, the Bank Consolidation agreement and
any other documents necessary to consummate the Bank Consolidation and take
other reasonable steps prior to the Effective Time to consummate the Bank

under the Exchange Act) selected by the Mercantile Board of Directors (the
_"Mercantile Designees"_ ). If any such Firstbank Designee or Mercantile
Designee, as applicable, is unwilling, ineligible or otherwise not capable or
qualified to act in such capacity, the current Firstbank Board of Directors
or Mercantile Board of Directors, as applicable, shall prior to the Effective
Time, subject to the prior written consent of Firstbank or Mercantile, as
applicable (which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), designate another qualified person or persons to serve as a
Firstbank Designee or Mercantile Designee, as applicable, in each case to
serve for a term expiring on the earlier of his or her death, resignation or
removal or the next annual meeting of shareholders of the Surviving
Corporation, and, despite the expiration of his or her term, until his or her
successor has been elected and qualified or there is a decrease in the size of
the Board of Directors of the Surviving Corporation.

Corporation, if the effective time of the Bank Consolidation occurs after the
Effective Time, in each case subject to the consent of Mercantile (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

5.11 _Press Releases and Public Announcement._

 

Neither Firstbank nor Mercantile will issue any press release or make any
public announcement relating to this Plan of Merger, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger without the prior
written approval of, in the case of Firstbank, Mercantile, and in the case of
Mercantile, Firstbank. However, each party may issue any such press release or
make such public announcement, including with respect to actions contemplated
by _Sections 5.1_ and _5.2_ , as applicable, it believes in good faith is
required to be made by applicable Law or any applicable rule or regulation
promulgated by any applicable securities exchange after consultation with
outside legal counsel, in which case the disclosing party will use its
commercially reasonable efforts to advise and consult with the other party
regarding any such press release or other announcement prior to making any
such disclosure. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this _Section
5.11_ shall be deemed to expand, modify or limit Firstbanks and Mercantiles
rights and obligations set forth in _Sections 5.4 _ and _5.5_ , as
applicable. Firstbank and Mercantile agree to issue a joint press release
initially announcing this Plan of Merger and the transactions contemplated by
this Plan of Merger, including the Merger.

 

5.12 _Access to Information._

5.12.1 Subject to applicable Law, during the period commencing on the date of
this Plan of Merger and ending at the earlier of the Effective Time and the

upon reasonable prior written notice, permit the other party and its
respective Representatives to have reasonable access (including promptly

all applicable Laws, (b) not result in, or reasonably be expected to result
in, the waiver of the attorney-client privilege, or (c) not result in, or
reasonably be expected to result in, a material breach of any material
Contract. No such access shall affect the representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements of the parties (or the remedies with respect thereto)
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Plan of Merger.
Firstbank and Mercantile will use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
from third parties any consents or waivers of any confidentiality

it. __

5.12.2 Firstbank will give prompt written notice to Mercantile of any event
that would reasonably be expected to give rise to a Firstbank Material Adverse

5.12.2_ will not limit, expand or otherwise affect the remedies available
hereunder (if any) to the party receiving such notice.

 

5.12.3 While this Plan of Merger is in effect, if either Firstbank or
Mercantile becomes aware of any facts or the occurrence or impending
occurrence of any event that (a) would cause one or more of the
representations and warranties it has given in _Article III_ or _IV_ ,
respectively, subject to the exceptions contained in the Firstbank Disclosure
Letter or the Mercantile Disclosure Letter, respectively, to become untrue or
incomplete in any material respect; or (b) would have caused one or more of
such representations and warranties to be untrue or incomplete in any material
respect had such facts been known or had such event occurred prior to the
date of this Plan of Merger, then such party shall immediately give detailed
written notice of such discovery or change, including a detailed description
of the underlying facts or events, together with all pertinent documents, to
the other party.

5.12.4 Each of Firstbank, on the one hand, and Mercantile, on the other hand,
will, and will cause their respective Representatives to, hold and treat in
confidence all documents and information concerning the other party and its
Subsidiaries furnished to the applicable party or their respective
Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Plan
of Merger in accordance with the letter agreement, dated October 30, 2012,
between Firstbank and Mercantile (" _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which shall remain in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

5.13 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

5.13.1 All rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses
now existing in favor of the current or former directors and officers, as the
case may be, of Firstbank or the Firstbank Subsidiaries as provided in their
respective articles of

 



73 _ _ incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents or in the
existing indemnity agreements with Firstbank or any of the Firstbank
Subsidiaries shall survive the Merger and, except as otherwise expressly
provided in this _Section 5.13_, shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their terms. For a period of six years from the Effective
Time, the Surviving Corporation, subject to compliance with applicable Law,
shall maintain in effect exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses provisions that are no less favorable to officers and directors than
those set forth in the articles of incorporation and bylaws or
similar organization documents of Firstbank and the Firstbank Subsidiaries in
effect immediately prior to the date of this Plan of Merger, and, subject to
compliance with applicable Law, shall not amend, repeal or otherwise modify
any such provisions in any manner that would adversely affect the rights
thereunder of any individuals who at the Effective Time were current or former
directors, officers or employees of Firstbank or any of the Firstbank
Subsidiaries. All rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such period
shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of such
claim. __

 

 __5.13.2 From and after the Effective Time and until the sixth anniversary of
the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold
harmless to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, each current or
former director or officer of Firstbank or any of the Firstbank Subsidiaries
(each, together with such person s heirs, executors or administrators, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") against any costs or expenses (including advancing
attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim,
suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by Law and following receipt of any undertaking required by
applicable Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened
Actions, arising out of, relating to or in connection with any action or
omission occurring or alleged to have occurred at or before the Effective Time
in such Indemnified Partys capacity as a director or officer of Firstbank or
any of the Firstbank Subsidiaries or in such Indemnified Partys capacity as
a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise at the request or for the benefit of Firstbank or any Firstbank
Subsidiary, including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Plan of Merger. All rights to indemnification or advancement of expenses in
respect of any Action pending or asserted or any claim made within such
period shall continue until the disposition of such Action or resolution of
such claim. In the event of any such Action, the Surviving Corporation shall
reasonably cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of the Action.
__

5.13.3 The Surviving Corporation shall maintain in effect for not less than
six years from the Effective Time the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
Firstbank and the Firstbank Subsidiaries for the Indemnified Parties prior to
the Effective Time with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time, including the transactions contemplated by this Plan of
Merger. Alternatively, the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor
policies of substantially the same coverage containing terms and conditions
that, taken as a whole, are no less advantageous to the Indemnified Parties.
After the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall not be required to
pay annual premiums for insurance coverages in excess of 300% of the last
annual premium (such 300% threshold, the " _Maximum Amount_ ")

 



74  paid by Firstbank prior to the date of this Plan of Merger in respect of the
coverages required to be obtained pursuant to this _Section 5.13.3_, but in
such case shall purchase the greatest coverage available for a cost not
exceeding the Maximum Amount. Alternatively, the Surviving Corporation may
purchase at or after the Effective Time, at a cost not exceeding three times
the Maximum Amount, a six-year prepaid "tail" policy on terms and conditions
providing substantially equivalent benefits as the current policies of
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
maintained by Firstbank and the Firstbank Subsidiaries for the Indemnified
Parties with respect to matters occurring at or prior to the Effective Time,
including the transactions contemplated by this Plan of Merger. If such "tail"
prepaid policy has been obtained, the Surviving Corporation shall maintain it
in full force and effect for its full term and honor all obligations
thereunder.

__5.13.4 The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition
to, and not in limitation of, any other rights such person may have under the
articles of incorporation or bylaws or other organization documents of
Firstbank or any of the Firstbank Subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation,
any other indemnification arrangement, the MBCA, directors  and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to Firstbank or the Firstbank Subsidiaries or otherwise. The
provisions of this _Section 5.13_ shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and expressly are intended to benefit, and are enforceable by, each of
the Indemnified Parties, each of whom is a third-party beneficiary of this
_Section 5.13_. __

__5.13.5 In the event that the Surviving Corporation or its successors or
assigns (a) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or
merger or (b) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person, in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.13_. __

If any "moratorium," "control share," "fair price," "affiliate transaction,"
"business combination" or other anti-takeover Law is or may become applicable
to the Merger, the parties shall use their respective commercially reasonable
efforts to (a) take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that the
transactions contemplated hereunder may be consummated as promptly as
practicable on the terms contemplated by this Plan of Merger and (b)
otherwise take all such actions as are reasonably necessary to eliminate or
minimize the effects of any such Law on the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Plan of Merger.

 

5.15 _Section 16 Matters._

steps as may be required to cause (a) any dispositions of Firstbank Common

by this Plan of Merger, by each individual who will be subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
Firstbank immediately prior to the Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act and (b) any acquisitions or
dispositions of Mercantile Common Stock (including derivative securities
with respect to Mercantile Common Stock and Converted

 



75  Stock-Based Awards) resulting from the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Plan of Merger, by each individual who may become or is
reasonably expected to become subject to the reporting requirements of
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to Mercantile immediately
following the Effective Time, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 

5.16 _Stock Purchase Plans_.

Effective as of the date of this Plan of Merger, each of Firstbank and
Mercantile shall take all necessary action to suspend their respective
employee or director stock purchase plans, and all monies contributed for the
purchase of stock pursuant to such plans that have not been so applied to the
purchase of stock shall promptly be refunded to participants.

5.17 _Securityholder Litigation_.

Each party shall keep the other parties reasonably informed with respect to
the defense or settlement of any securityholder Action against it or its
directors or officers relating to the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Plan of Merger. Each party shall give the other party
the opportunity to consult with it regarding the defense or settlement of any
such securityholder Action and shall not settle any such Action without the
other partys prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably
