the review done by the Company as of March 31, 2000, for the Cash Flow
Securities Portfolio Amount and as of June 30, 2000 for the Mortgage Loan and
REO Amount. The purpose of the Purchasers\' Review, in part, is to duplicate
and reconfirm the valuation of certain items included in Consolidated
Mortgage Related Assets determined in the review performed by the Company.
The Company shall provide reasonable assistance and support to Purchasers and
their agents in their efforts to complete the Purchasers\' Review
simultaneously with completion of the Company\'s review. The Company shall
also reasonably assist Purchasers and their agents prior to the Review Date
in preparations that will expedite the Purchasers\' Review and the work to be
completed in arriving at the Gross Adjustment Amount, if any. In any event,
the Purchasers\' Review and the Company\'s review shall have been completed
and the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, if any, shall be determined prior
to the Closing Date.   (d) In order to enable Purchasers to confirm
calculations supporting the component of the Review Date Amount consisting of
Mortgage Securities (the "Mortgage Securities Model Verification"), the
Company will provide to Purchasers and their agents (to the extent such items
are used in its review consistent with the last review performed), from time
to time upon request of Purchasers, with respect to each Mortgage Security
that may be included in the Review Date Amount, an estimated total loss on
associated collateral (with related nonlinear loss vectors where applicable),
a combined voluntary and involuntary prepayment vector, and a discount rate.
The Company will provide access to schedules containing the detailed
calculation of each discount rate for each Mortgage Security included as part
of EXHIBIT 2.3, to the extent relevant, to Purchasers and their agents for
verification of the computations. The Company will assist in reconciliation
of all of its INTEX modeled Mortgage Securities valuations with the INTEX
modeled valuations as produced by Purchasers\' agents. With respect to any
Mortgage Securities not modeled by INTEX but instead modeled using the
Company\'s "hand priced" model or other proprietary models, the valuation
results will be supported by actual schedules or month-by-month model output.
In the event that Purchasers and their agents are unable to reconcile
valuations produced by the Company\'s INTEX model, its "hand-priced" model or
other proprietary models, Purchasers may request that such dispute be
resolved by a big 5 accounting firm mutually acceptable to the parties which
shall determine which of the output of the Company\'s or the Purchaser\'s
models that are in dispute is more appropriate or whether any proposed
adjustment by Purchaser to the output of a model of the Company
is appropriate. The output of the model or the adjusted output of the
model approved by the big 5 accounting firm will be used by the Purchasers or
their agents in the determination of the Cash Flow Securities Amount for
the appropriate Mortgage Securities.    15    (e) The Company will
provide Purchasers and their agents with respect to each Mortgage Security
included in the Review Date Amount (to the extent such items are used in its
review consistent with the last review performed), an estimated total loss on
associated collateral (with related non-linear loss vectors where
applicable), a combined voluntary and involuntary prepayment vector, and the
discount rate that the Company used in performing its review at the Review
Date. Such discount rates shall be computed by the Company consistent with
the procedures utilized by the Company as of June 30, 2000, including
the return on equity goals set by the Company for each rating class of
Mortgage Security. Based upon such information, and such other information as
Purchasers deem relevant, Purchasers and their agents shall compute the Cash
Flow Securities Portfolio Amount. In the event the Sellers dispute the
Purchasers\' determination of the Cash Flow Securities Portfolio Amount,
Purchasers shall provide the Sellers with the valuation determined by the
Purchasers for each Mortgage Security included in the determination of the
Cash Flow Securities Portfolio Amount. The Sellers may request that any
disputed valuation of any particular Mortgage Security be resolved by a
mutually acceptable securities dealer regularly dealing in the market for
such securities, which shall determine the appropriate valuation for the
disputed Mortgage Security, which valuation shall in any event be set in an
amount equal to or between the valuations proposed by the parties.   (f)
Subsequent to the valuation established pursuant to subsection (e) above, all
rated (in the category of "B3" or "B-" or higher) Mortgage Securities whose
collateral is a rated security will be subject to further valuation by
the Purchasers and their agents utilizing spread and overall prepayment
speed (combined voluntary plus involuntary) assumptions with respect to
such Securities as described below. In making such further valuation, the
Purchasers and the Sellers will provide new issuance and secondary spreads
for all combinations of asset types and ratings classes and the Company will
provide overall prepayment speeds. For purposes of this analysis the
Purchaser will utilize the appropriate yield for each Mortgage Security
referenced on page QY of the Bloomberg system and inserting such yield in the
appropriate place on the yield/price table QY for such Mortgage Security. In
the event there is a dispute as to any applicable spread, either Purchasers
or Sellers may request that the disputed spread be determined by a mutually
acceptable securities dealer regularly dealing in the market for such
category of security, which shall determine the appropriate spread, but which
shall in any event be set in an amount equal to or between the spread amounts
proposed by the Purchasers and Sellers. In the event there is a dispute as to
any applicable prepayment speed or yield provided by the Bloomberg system as
set forth above, the Purchasers or Sellers may request that the disputed
items be determined by a mutually acceptable securities dealer as described
above. The further valuation of the rated Mortgage Securities under this
subsection (f) shall thereupon be calculated by Purchasers or their agents
utilizing the calculator functionality on page QY of the Bloomberg System. If
the aggregate rated securities portfolio valuation thereby established is
more or less than the aggregate valuation for such rated Mortgage Securities
as calculated in the determination of the Cash Flow Securities Portfolio
Amount, such difference shall constitute the "Market Spread Adjustment".
Notwithstanding the above, Purchasers and Sellers, after consultation with
the Company, shall mutually agree to exclude or include certain Mortgage
Securities from the above calculation where, due to credit impairment or
other well understood market conditions (such as those associated with the
evaluation of non-rated securities), such exclusion or inclusion would be
appropriate.    16     (g) In order to perform the review of those
components of Consolidated Mortgage Related Assets consisting of Mortgage
Loans and REO, the Company will provide Purchasers and their agents with loan
level collateral information in a format similar to that provided for prior
due diligence by RFC. Purchasers will determine a market valuation of the
Mortgage Loans and REO for the following categories of assets utilizing the
specified discount rates or methodology: (i) REO utilizing a discount rate of
13%; (ii) FHA and VA Loans utilizing a discount rate of 9% (or 9.5%, if
utilized by the Company with respect to any Mortgage Loan); (iii) Mortgage
Loans (other than as covered by subsection (ii)) that are performing loans
utilizing a the methodology set forth on EXHIBIT 2.3(G)(III) hereto, and (iv)
Mortgage Loans that are non-performing loans utilizing a discount rate of
13%. In the event that the Sellers dispute the aggregate valuation of any
category of assets as determined by Purchaser above, the Sellers may request
that any such disputed aggregate value of an asset category be resolved by a
mutually acceptable valuation firm which shall determine the appropriate
market valuation for the disputed asset category, which shall in any event be
set in an amount equal to or between the valuations proposed by the parties
and which in the case of a dispute of a valuation covered by subsection (iii)
above shall be resolved using the methodology set forth on
EXHIBIT 2.3(G)(III). In the event that the Sellers do not wish for any such
disputed aggregate value of an asset category to be resolved by a valuation
firm, Sellers may request that such dispute (other than a dispute as to the
valuation covered by subsection (iii) above) be resolved by tracking actual
performance of the assets within such disputed asset category ("Workout
Method"). In such event, the aggregate value of the disputed asset category
which had been proposed by the Purchasers shall be used for purposes of
determining the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, if any. Thereafter,
beginning with the quarterly period ending on March 31, 2001, and for each
subsequent quarterly period, if the actual aggregate net cash proceeds from
the collection or disposition of the assets within the disputed asset
category after October 31, 2000, and by the end of such period, exceeds the
value which has been used by the Purchasers in determining the Purchase Price
Adjustment Amount ("Excess Proceeds"), the Purchasers shall within 30 days of
the end of such quarterly period pay to the Sellers, as a reduction of the
Purchase Price Adjustment Amount, a sum equal to 45.94% of such Excess
Proceeds, not to exceed, in any event, the Purchase Price Adjustment Amount,
if any, attributable to the disputed asset category of the Mortgage Loans and
REO Amount. The market value of the Mortgage Loans and REO as agreed to or as
finally determined pursuant to this subsection (without reference to the
Workout Method) is referred to herein as the "Mortgage Loans and REO
Amount."   (h) Purchasers and Sellers agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any dispute as to the determination or calculation of any amount under
this Section 2.3. If Purchasers and Sellers cannot resolve any such dispute,
it shall be resolved by dispute resolution procedures consistent with those
otherwise provided for in this Section 2.3. The fees of any independent firm
utilized by the parties for any dispute resolution contemplated by Section
2.3 shall be borne half by Purchasers and half by Sellers. Purchasers and
Sellers shall indemnify the independent firm in connection its services,
provided the independent firm acts in good faith and without
negligence.    17     (i) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of
this Section 2.3, the Company shall not be obligated to provide any
information described above to any other party to this Agreement to the
extent such information is not information owned by the Company or is subject
to an obligation of confidentiality of the Company to a third party, unless
the relevant third party consents to the disclosure thereof and then only to
the extent and for such purposes as set forth in such consent; provided,
however, that with respect to estimated total losses, aggregate combined
voluntary and involuntary prepayment vectors, discount rates, and loss
vectors by aggregate product type, the Company acknowledges that it is either
under no obligation to a third party regarding, or the parties hereto have
obtained the necessary third party consent to, the disclosure of such
information by the Company as contemplated by, and for the purposes described
in, this Section 2.3, and the Company shall so disclose such information to
the extent such information is used by the Company in its review in
accordance with this Section 2.3, consistent with the last review
performed.   (j) The obligations of the Company under this Section 2.3 are
subject to Article XIV hereof.    ARTICLE III  CLOSING   3.1 CLOSING

of the modeled Securitization Receivables owned by the Partnership as of
January 1, 2000, which was prepared by the Partnership on April 11, 2000
using the software model purchased from PaineWebber Incorporated pursuant to
an agreement dated April 8, 1999 ("Model"), utilizing the   
34      information available to the Partnership on April 1, 2000 (which
consisted primarily of data provided to the Partnership by third parties) and
based on certain hypothetical assumptions (the "Assumptions") as to the
performance of the Securitization Receivables and of the mortgage loans
underlying such Securitization Receivables, future interest rates and other
factors which affect the cash flow and taxable income associated with the
Securitization Receivables; provided, however, that no representation is made
regarding the reliability or accuracy of the Model or such data provided by
third parties or that Assumptions will coincide with actual market conditions
or events and the parties acknowledge that the actual performance of the
Securitization Receivables and the mortgage loans underlying the
Securitization Receivables may not be consistent with the estimates shown on
Section 4.26 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule. Further, any Securitization
Receivables shown as owned by the Partnership, the Company or any Related

AGREEMENTS.   (a) A true and complete list of all Listed Agreements to which
the Company or any Related Company is a party, other than Collateral
Certificate Sale Agreements or Mortgage Loan Sale Agreements providing for a
total sale price in each instance of $10,000,000 or less, and with respect to
which any party has not yet completed performance thereunder (with "completed
performance" meaning, in the case of a Listed Agreement for the purchase or
sale of Mortgage Loans, Collateral Certificates, Securitization Receivables
or Servicing, that the assets being purchased or sold have been delivered and
the purchase price therefor paid), as of the Effective Date is set forth on
Section 5.2(a) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which shall be updated as
of the Closing Date. Each Listed Agreement sets forth all the terms and
conditions of the rights of    36      the Company or the Related
Company against, and obligations to, the applicable Agencies, Contract
Parties, Investors and Insurers, and, except as set forth on Section 5.2(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no written or oral agreements
that modify, supplement or amend any Listed Agreement required to be listed
on Schedule 5.2(a) other than such modifications, supplements or amendments
which would not materially affect the rights of the Company or the Related
Company under the related Listed Agreement. Each Listed Agreement is a valid
and binding obligation of the Company or the Related Company and, to the best
of the Sellers\' Knowledge and the Company\'s Knowledge, the Listed
Agreement is in full force and effect, and is enforceable against the Company
or the Related Company and each Contract Party thereto in accordance with its
terms, except as such enforceability may be affected by bankruptcy,
insolvency, fraudulent conveyance, reorganization and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors\' rights generally and general principles
of equity (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).   (b)
Except as set forth in Section 5.2(b) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule,
there is no default or breach by the Company or any Related Company under any
Listed Agreement or under Applicable Requirements related thereto, and no
event has occurred which with the passage of time or the giving of notice
or both would constitute a default or breach by the Company or the Related
Company under Listed Agreement or the Applicable Requirements related thereto
or would permit termination or modification of any Listed Agreement by a
third party, without the consent of the Company or the Related Company. There
is no pending or, to the best of the Sellers\' Knowledge or the Company\'s
Knowledge, threatened cancellation or partial termination of a Listed
Agreement by a Contract Party.   (c) Except as set forth in Section 5.2(c)
of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there exists no breach by the Company or
any Related Company of a representation and warranty set forth in any Listed
Agreement (each of which was made as of the date specified in such Listed
Agreement), which breach gives rise to a repurchase, indemnification, or
other remedy against the Company or the Related Company under such Listed
Agreement.   (d) Except as set forth in Section 5.2(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, the rights of the Company or any Related Company related
to Servicing under a Servicing Agreement to which the Company or Related
Company is currently a party, including the right to receive Servicing
Compensation, are owned by or for the account of the Company or the
applicable Related Company free and clear of any Liens.   5.3 ADVANCES.
Each Advance has been duly and validly made and the Company or Related
Company making such Advance has a right of reimbursement from the applicable
Mortgagors, Investors, Insurers or otherwise. Each Advance is carried on the
books of the Company or a Related Company at values determined in accordance
with GAAP and, except as reflected in that value; is not subject to any set-
off or claim that could be asserted against the Company or the
Related Company, and neither the Company nor any Related Company has any
notice from an Investor, Insurer or other appropriate party in which the
Investor, Insurer or party disputes or denies a claim by the Company or the
Related Company for reimbursement in connection with any Advance. Except as
set forth in Section 5.3 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, there are no
pooling, participation, servicing or other agreements to which the Company or
any of the Related Companies is a party which obligates it to make servicing
advances with respect to defaulted or delinquent Mortgage Loans, other than
as expressly provided in the Servicing Agreements, Master Servicing
Agreements or Certificate Administration Agreements.    37      5.4
NO RECOURSE. Except with respect to those Mortgage Loans listed in Section
5.4 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (which is provided as a matter
of disclosure only and not as a limitation on liability for purposes of
Section 11.1 of this Agreement), none of the Servicing Agreements or
Securitization Instruments provide for Recourse to the Company or any Related
Company.   5.5 MORTGAGE LOAN REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Except as set
forth in Section 5.5 of the Seller Disclosure Schedule and except, with
respect to Portfolio Loans only, those breaches of representations and
warranties contained in Section 5.5(b), (c), (d), (e), or (g) resulting from
facts or circumstances in existence at the time the Company or any Related
Company acquired such Portfolio Loan from a third party ("existing defects")
and as to which the Company or any Related Company both (i) did not obtain
protection against the risk of loss pertaining to such existing defects from
the seller of such Portfolio Loan, or if it did obtain such protection, it
did not rely on such protection as documented by the related purchase
approval memorandum, and (ii) specifically discounted the purchase price for
such Portfolio Loan or the aggregate pool of loans to account for such
existing defects:   (a) INVESTOR/INSURER REQUIREMENTS. There exists no fact
or circumstance that would entitle any Insurer or Investor to (i) demand
either repurchase of any Mortgage Loan or the related Mortgaged Property or
indemnification for losses from the Company or any Related Company, (ii)
impose sanctions, penalties or special requirements in respect of any
Mortgage Loan on, Company or any Related Company, or (iii) rescind any
insurance policy or reduce insurance benefits in respect of any Mortgage Loan
(other than payments with regard to the Mortgage Loan). There exist no facts
or circumstances that would entitle an Investor or any Person to demand
repurchase of a Previously Disposed Loan, a Previously Disposed Servicing
Right, a Securitization Receivable or Collateral Certificate or that would
entitle an Insurer to demand indemnification from a Related Company with
respect to any Previously Disposed Loan, Previously Disposed Servicing Right,
Securitization Receivable or Collateral Certificate.   (b) ENFORCEABILITY OF
MORTGAGE LOAN. Each Mortgage Note and the related Mortgage Instrument are
genuine and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker
thereof, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy,
insolvency and similar laws affecting generally the enforcement of
creditor\'s rights and the discretion of a court to grant
specific performance of contracts or other equitable remedies. Each Mortgage
Loan is not subject to any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or
defense, including the defense of usury, nor will the operation of any of the
terms of the Mortgage Note or the Mortgage Instrument, or the exercise of any
right thereunder, render the Mortgage Note or the Mortgage Instrument
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to any right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, and no such
right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with
respect thereto.    38     (c) MORTGAGE INSURANCE OR GUARANTY. Each
Mortgage Loan that is represented by any Related Company to have FHA
insurance is, or is eligible in the normal course of business to be, insured
by FHA pursuant to the National Housing Act. Each Mortgage Loan that is
represented by the Related Company to be guaranteed by VA is, or is eligible
in the normal course of business to be, guaranteed by VA pursuant to the
Serviceman\'s Readjustment Act. If required by the applicable Investor, each
Conventional Loan is, or prior to the Closing Date will be, insured as to
payment defaults by a PMI policy in the amount required, and by an Insurer
approved by the applicable Investor. All provisions of such PMI policy have
been and are being complied with, such PMI policy is in full force and effect
and all premiums due thereunder to be paid on or prior to the Closing Date
will be paid by the obligated party by the Closing Date. There are
no defenses, counterclaims, or rights of set-off affecting the validity
or enforceability of any PMI policy covering a Mortgage Loan. Any Mortgage
Loan which obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to maintain a PMI policy
obligates the Mortgagor to pay all premiums and charges in connection
therewith. The interest rate on each Mortgage Loan under which the Mortgagor
is obligated to maintain a PMI policy is net of any such insurance
premium.   (d) COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. Each Related Company (and the
Originator and any Prior Servicer for which any Related Company is legally
responsible) has complied with respect to each Mortgage Loan held by it, and
the Mortgage Loans comply, with every Applicable Requirement and every
Applicable Law, including, without limitation, the fair housing, anti-
redlining, equal credit opportunity, truth-in-lending, real estate settlement
procedures, fair credit reporting, and every other prohibition against
unlawful discrimination in residential mortgage lending or governing consumer
credit, and also including, without limitation, the Real Estate Settlement
Procedures Act of 1974 and Regulation X, Consumer Credit Reporting Act, Equal
Credit Opportunity Act of 1975 and Regulation B, Fair Credit Reporting Act,
Truth in Lending Act and Regulation Z, Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973
and any applicable regulations related thereto, state consumer credit
statutes and regulations, all as amended.   (e) DAMAGE, CONDEMNATION. Except
as disclosed on Section 5.5(e) of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, which
schedule shall be updated as of the Closing Date, as of the Effective Date
there exists no physical damage to any Mortgaged Property or REO from fire,
flood, windstorm, earthquake, tornado, hurricane or any other similar
casualty, which physical damage would cause any Mortgage Loan to become
delinquent or materially and adversely affect the value or marketability of
any Mortgage Loan, the Servicing Rights or any Mortgaged Property or REO or
the eligibility of any Mortgage Loan for insurance benefits, or the amount of
insurance benefits, provided by any Insurer. There is no proceeding pending
for the total or partial condemnation of, or eminent domain with respect to,
any Mortgaged Property or REO and the Related Companies have no knowledge
that all or any part of any Mortgaged Property or REO has been or will be
condemned.   (f) ORIGINATION, SALE AND SERVICING PRACTICES. The origination,
purchase, sale, servicing and securitization practices used by the applicable
Related Company (or any Originator and/or any Prior Servicer for which any
Related Company is responsible) with respect to each Mortgage Loan comply
with Applicable Requirements.   (g) HAZARDOUS MATERIAL. Neither any Related
Company nor any Prior Servicer has engaged in any activity that involves or
involved the generation, use, manufacture, treatment, transportation, storage
in tanks or otherwise, or disposal of Hazardous Material on or from any
Mortgaged Property or REO and no (i) presence, release, threatened release,
discharge, spillage or migration of Hazardous Material in violation of any
existing Applicable Requirement, (ii) condition that has resulted in any use,
ownership or transfer restriction, or (iii) condition of actual nuisance, has
occurred on or from any such Mortgaged Property or REO.    39     
(h) ADJUSTABLE RATE LOANS. With respect to each Adjustable Rate Loan, each of
the Related Companies and each Prior Servicer has (i) properly and accurately
entered into its system, or subsequently corrected, all data required to
service the Mortgage Loan in accordance with all Applicable
Requirements, (ii) properly and accurately adjusted or subsequently
corrected, the mortgage interest rate on each interest adjustment date, (iii)
properly and accurately adjusted, or subsequently corrected, the monthly
payment on each payment adjustment date, (iv) properly and accurately
calculated, or subsequently corrected, the amortization of principal and
interest on each payment adjustment date, in each case in compliance with all
Applicable Requirements, and (v) executed and delivered any and all necessary
notices required under, and in a form that complies with, all Applicable
Requirements regarding interest rate and payment adjustments.   Purchasers
acknowledge that Sellers and the Company do not necessarily have actual
knowledge with respect to the matters addressed in this Section 5.5, and
Sellers acknowledge that the representations and warranties made in
this Section 5.5 are intended to allocate risk of loss to Sellers for the
purposes of Article XI hereof.   5.6 MORTGAGE BANKING QUALIFICATION. Except

agreements in effect on the Effective Date, all the funds the Purchasers will

this Agreement.   6.9 LITIGATION. There is no Litigation pending or, to the
best of the knowledge of either Purchaser, threatened against either of the

covered thereby, or amounts payable thereunder, for the continued use of the
office space currently subleased by Company from EFS, at 335 Madison Avenue,
New York, New York, and the furniture, fixtures and equipment currently
leased by Company from EFS. Such indemnification agreement shall be deemed
satisfactory to the Company if it provides for indemnification of the Company
for all costs and expenses arising as a result of any change in the duration
of such lease or sublease, the amounts payable thereunder, or the square
footage covered thereby. The satisfaction of this condition may not be waived
by the Purchasers without the consent of the Company.   (k) JOINDER. The
Partnership shall have executed a joinder agreement establishing the
Partnership as a member in good standing and the holder of 45.94% of the
outstanding Membership Interests.   8.3 ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS TO THE

WAIVER   9.1 TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the

Date:   (a) by mutual written consent of the Sellers and Purchasers;   (b)
by either the Sellers or the Purchasers upon written notice given to the
other in the event of a material breach or material default in
the performance by such other party of any representation, warranty, covenant

cured within 30 days after written notice thereof, describing such breach or
default in reasonable detail, is given by the terminating party to the
breaching or defaulting party;   (c) by either the Sellers or the
Purchasers upon written notice to the other in the event that (i) any request
or application for a requisite approval shall have been denied or withdrawn
at the request or recommendation of the Governmental Authority which must
grant such approval; provided, that neither the Sellers nor Purchasers shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c) if
such denial or request or recommendation for withdrawal shall be due to the
failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to perform or
observe the agreements of such party set forth herein or (ii) any
Governmental Authority (including any court of competent jurisdiction), the
consent of which is necessary for the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall have issued an order, decree or
ruling or taken any other official action enjoining or otherwise prohibiting
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or denying approval of any
application or notice for approval to consummate such transactions, and such
order, decree, ruling or other action shall have become final and non-
appealable; or   (d) by Purchasers or Sellers upon the occurrence of a
Competing Transaction;   (e) by the Purchasers or Sellers if the Closing
does not occur by December 31, 2000 or, in the event that the Gross

parties referred to in Section 7.5 and under the Confidentiality Agreements,
shall continue to apply following any such termination of this Agreement. In
the event of the termination of this Agreement by the Sellers or the
Purchasers pursuant to Section 9.1(d), then Sellers shall pay to Purchasers

notice to Purchasers of any such Competing Transaction, which notice shall be
given immediately after executing any agreement providing for the Competing
Transaction, and which shall set forth the parties to and the terms and
conditions of the Competing Transaction. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement by Purchasers or Sellers pursuant to Section 9.1(e), unless
terminated (i) by Sellers as a result of a failure by Purchasers to fulfill
the conditions in Section 8.3, or (ii) by Purchasers as a result of a failure
by Sellers to fulfill the conditions in Section 8.1(a) or 8.2(g) of this
Agreement, Sellers shall pay to Purchasers U.S. $2.0 million as liquidated
damages; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, Sellers shall pay Purchasers an additional U.S.
$2.0 million in the event that either of the Sellers enter into an agreement
for a Competing Transaction on or prior to December 31, 2001. Subject to
Article XIV hereof, in the event Sellers or Purchasers terminate this
Agreement pursuant to section 9.1(b), then the terminating party shall have
the right to sue the breaching party for any and all Damages sustained or
incurred as a result of such breach and termination.    52     
ARTICLE X  TAX MATTERS   10.1 RETURNS. The Sellers shall have the
obligation to file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns that are required to
be filed by or with respect to the Partnership for all taxable years or other
taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending on or prior to the Closing Date
("Pre-Closing Periods"). Purchasers will have the obligation to prepare all
Tax Returns relating to the Overlap Period. Purchasers and the Sellers shall
in good faith take all available measures so that all Tax periods with
respect to the Partnership end on or immediately prior to the Closing Date.
No later than 60 days prior to the due date for the filing of any Tax Return
with respect to any Pre-Closing Periods (taking account of extensions),
Sellers shall (1) provide the Purchasers with a draft of such Tax Return and
(2) provide the Purchasers with access to all records of the Partnership in
Sellers\' possession or control reasonably necessary to enable the Purchasers
and their representatives to evaluate the draft Tax Returns provided with
such notice. No later than 45 days prior to the due date for the filing
of such Tax Return, the Purchasers shall notify Sellers of any
reasonable objections the Purchasers may have to any items set forth in such
draft Tax Return. Purchasers and Sellers agree to consult and resolve in good
faith any such objection, it being understood and agreed that in the absence
of any such resolution, either party may submit the issue in dispute to a
nationally recognized accounting firm mutually acceptable to Purchasers and
Sellers (the "Independent Accountant") and the Purchasers and Sellers shall
request that the Independent Accountant, within 30 days after such
submission, determine and report to the Sellers and Purchasers upon such
disputed items, and such determination shall be final, binding and conclusive
on Purchasers and Sellers. The fees of any Independent Accountant shall be
borne half by Purchasers and half by Sellers. Purchasers and Sellers shall
indemnify the Independent Accountant in connection its services, provided the
Independent Accountant acts in good faith and without gross negligence.  
10.2 CONTESTS. The Sellers and their duly appointed representatives
shall have the exclusive authority to control any audit or examination by any
taxing authority, initiate any claim for refund, amend any Tax Return and
contest, resolve and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes,
notice of Tax deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to any
liability of the Partnership or its partners for all Pre-Closing Periods;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither Purchasers nor any of their duly appointed
representatives shall without the prior written consent of the Sellers, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, enter into any settlement of any
contest or otherwise compromise any issue that affects or may affect the tax
liability of the Sellers or any of their Affiliates for Pre-Closing Periods.
Purchasers and their duly appointed representatives shall have the exclusive
authority to control any audit or examination by any taxing authority,
initiate any claim for a refund, amend any Tax Return and contest, resolve
and defend against any assessment for additional Taxes, notice of Tax
deficiency or other adjustment of Taxes of or relating to any liability of
the Partnership or its partners for Taxes for any taxable year or other
taxable period ending after the Closing Date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that neither
Sellers nor any of their duly appointed representatives shall, without the
prior written consent of the Purchasers, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, enter into any settlement of any contest or otherwise
compromise any issue that affects or may affect the Tax liability of the
Purchasers or any of their Affiliates for any taxable year or other
taxable period or portion thereof ending on or after the Closing Date.   
53     10.3 PAYMENT OF TAXES.   (a) Taxes of the Partnership that relate
to any taxable year or other taxable period beginning on or before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (the "Overlap Period") shall
be apportioned between the portion of such period ending on the Closing Date
and the portion of such period beginning after the Closing Date on the basis
of an interim closing of the books as of the Closing Date (the "Closing
Balance Sheet and Income Statement"), and based on accounting methods,
elections and conventions that do not have the effect of distorting income or
expenses. The Closing Balance Sheet and Income Statement shall be prepared by
the Company not later than 60 days after the Closing Date, and provided for
the Sellers and the Purchasers. The Sellers shall pay to Purchasers or the
appropriate taxing authority the Taxes calculated with respect to the portion
of the Overlap Period ending on the Closing Date (as determined by the
Sellers and Purchasers using the procedure set forth under Section 10.1), but
any such payment required by the Sellers shall be reduced by the amount
of such Taxes already paid by the Sellers or any Affiliate of the
Sellers (including, without limitation, the Partnership) on or prior to the
Closing Date or accrued or otherwise reflected as a liability for such period
on the Closing Balance Sheet and Income Statement.   (b) Except as
otherwise provided in this Section, the Sellers agree to indemnify and hold
harmless Purchasers against all Taxes of or with respect to the Partnership
for all taxable years or other taxable periods ending on or prior to the
Closing Date and, with respect to any Overlap Period, the portion of such
taxable year or other taxable period ended on the Closing Date; if and to the
extent that the amount of such Taxes would, in any case or in the aggregate,
exceed the aggregate amount of recorded liability accruals for
Taxes reflected on the Closing Balance Sheet and Income Statement.   (c)
After the Closing Date, the participation of the Partnership in all Tax
sharing agreements and other Tax sharing arrangements with respect to taxable
years ending on or prior to the Closing Date to which the Sellers, or any
Affiliate of the Sellers (other than the Partnership), on the one hand,
and the Partnership on the other, are parties shall be terminated and none of
the Sellers, the Purchasers or the Partnership shall have any continuing
obligation to make any payment thereunder.   (d) The parties hereto agree
that all indemnification payments under Section 10.3 shall be treated as
adjustments to the Purchase Price.    54      10.4 NOTICES.   (a)
Purchasers shall promptly forward to the Sellers (and to the Company to the
extent it involves the Company) all written notifications and
other communications from any taxing authority received by Purchasers or any
of their Affiliates relating to any Tax audit or other proceeding relating to
the Tax liability of or with respect to the Partnership, the Company or the
Related Companies with regard to any Pre-Closing Period or Overlap Period.
The failure of Purchasers to give the Sellers such written notice shall
excuse the Sellers from their obligations under Section 10.3 with respect to
any increased Tax liability directly or indirectly attributable to the
subject matter of any such written notification or other communication, but
only to the extent that such failure on the part of Purchasers (a) results in
a Tax liability greater than the Tax liability owing by the Sellers or their
Affiliates had such failure not occurred or (b) otherwise adversely affects
the ability of the Sellers to defend the action.   (b) Sellers shall
promptly forward to the Purchasers (and to the Company to the extent it
involves the Company) all written notifications and other communications from
any taxing authority received by Sellers or any of their Affiliates relating
to any Tax audit or other proceeding relating the Tax liability of or with
respect to the Partnership, the Company or the Related Companies with regard
for an Overlap Period or a period which begins after the Closing Date. The
failure of the Sellers to give the Purchasers such written notice shall
excuse the Purchasers from their obligations under Section 10.3 with respect
to any increased Tax liability directly or indirectly attributable to the
subject matter of any such written notification or other communication, but
only to the extent that such failure on the part of Sellers (a) results in
a Tax liability greater than the Tax liability owing by the Purchasers or
their Affiliates had such failure not occurred or (b) otherwise adversely
affects the ability of the Purchasers to defend the action.   10.5
COOPERATION. Purchasers shall provide the Sellers and their designees with
such assistance as may reasonably be requested by the Sellers, or any
such designee, in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit
or judicial or administrative proceeding or determination relating to
liability for Taxes of or with respect to the Partnership, including, but not
limited to, access to the books and records, and the assistance of the
officers and employees, of the Partnership and, to the extent they can do so,
of the Company and the Related Companies. Sellers shall provide the
Purchasers and their designees with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested by the Purchasers, or any such designee, in connection with the
preparation of any Tax Return, audit or judicial or administrative proceeding
or determination relating to liability for Taxes of or with respect to the
Partnership, including, but not limited to, access to the books and records,
and the assistance of the former officers and employees, of the Partnership
and, to the extent they can do so, of the Company and the Related Companies.
Purchasers and the Sellers acknowledge that any and all information obtained
in connection with the preparation of any Tax Return, audit or judicial or
administrative proceeding or determination pursuant to this Section 10.5 is
of a confidential nature and that all such information shall be used only for
the purposes set forth in the immediately preceding sentence.   10.6
TRANSFER TAXES. All stamp, transfer, documentary, sales, use, registration
and other such taxes and fees (including any penalties and interest) incurred
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the "Transfer Taxes") shall be paid by the Sellers, and the
Sellers shall, at their own expense, properly file on a timely basis all
necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any Transfer
Tax and provide to Purchasers evidence of payment of all
Transfer Taxes.    55      ARTICLE XI  INDEMNIFICATION BY
SELLERS   11.1 INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to and not in limitation of
the indemnities provided in Article X (which Article sets forth the exclusive
remedy of Purchasers and the Sellers in respect of the matters covered
thereby) from and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of
this Article XI, the Sellers shall indemnify Purchasers and the Partnership
and each of their respective current, former and future officers, directors,
agents and employees (collectively, the "Indemnified Purchaser Entities") and
hold each of them harmless from and against, and agrees to assume liability
for, any and all Damages suffered, paid or incurred by any Indemnified
Purchaser Entity, arising from or in connection with or resulting from:  
(a) any breach of any of the representations and warranties made by the
Sellers or the Company to Purchasers in this Agreement,   (b) any breach by
the Sellers or the Company of any covenant, obligation or agreement of the
Sellers or the Company contained in this Agreement;   (c) any third party
claims or costs reasonably incurred by Purchasers to avoid or otherwise
mitigate Damages in connection with any facts, matters or circumstances
which, in the reasonable judgment of the Purchasers, could result in a third
party claim against either Purchaser, in either case resulting from, based on
or arising out of, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, the operation
of the business of the Partnership, the Company or the Related Companies
prior to the Closing Date;   (d) any of the matters referred to in Section
11.1(d) of the Purchaser Disclosure Schedule (the "Retained Liabilities");
and   (e) VA No Bids, and Buydowns resulting from or made to avoid a VA No
Bid, in connection with any VA guaranteed Mortgage Loan owned by the Company
or a Related Company on the Closing Date with respect to which
Foreclosure proceedings have been initiated within two (2) years after the
Closing Date, including a Buydown Loss.  For the purposes of establishing
whether any matter is indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 11.1, or whether
any representation or warranty in this Agreement has been breached, the
accuracy of the representations and warranties made in this Agreement shall
be determined without giving effect to any updates after the Effective Date
to any disclosure on the Seller Disclosure Schedule, or the Purchaser
Disclosure Schedule, as the case may be, which adds information which was not
set forth on such Disclosure Schedule delivered as of the Effective Date.  
11.2 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE.   (a) If an Indemnified Purchaser Entity
believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance exists that has given or
may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of indemnification under
this Article XI (whether or not the amount of Damages relating thereto is
then quantifiable), such Indemnified Purchaser Entity shall promptly assert
its claim for indemnification by giving a Claim Notice to the Sellers. Each
Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable detail. The failure to so
notify the Sellers shall not relieve the Sellers of any obligation to
indemnify any Indemnified Purchaser Entity unless the Sellers demonstrate
that such failure materially prejudices the rights or increases the liability
of the Sellers with respect to the claim to which the Claim Notice relates
and then the Sellers\' obligation to indemnify shall be reduced only by the
amount that they actually have been damaged thereby.     56     (b) If
any claim or demand by an Indemnified Purchaser Entity under this Article XI
relates to an action or claim filed or made against an Indemnified Purchaser
Entity by a third party, except as otherwise provided herein, the Sellers may
elect at any time to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such action or
claim or to defend such action or claim, in each case at their sole cost and
expense (subject to the last sentence of this Section 11.2(b)) and with their
own counsel, provided that such counsel is satisfactory to the
Indemnified Purchaser Entity in the exercise of its reasonable discretion. If
(i) within ten (10) days of receipt from an Indemnified Purchaser Entity of
any Claim Notice with respect to a third-party action or claim, the Sellers
(A) advise such Indemnified Purchaser Entity in writing that the Sellers will
not elect to defend, settle or compromise such action or claim or (B) fail to
make such an election to defend, settle, or compromise such action or claim
in writing, (ii) the Indemnified Purchaser Entity reasonably believes that
the assumption of the defense or prosecution of all or a portion of such
action or claim is necessary to assure that its right or ability to enforce
any portion of the Mortgage Loans or Servicing or its other mortgage loans or
servicing rights or to assure that its method of doing business or its
authority and approvals to service or originate loans are not materially
impaired or its reputation, or (iii) Purchasers reasonably determine that
there likely exists a material conflict between the interests of the
Indemnified Purchaser Entities and the interests of the Sellers, such
Indemnified Purchaser Entity may, at its option, defend, settle or otherwise
compromise or pay such action or claim and the costs and expenses arising out
of the defense, settlement or compromise of any such action or claim shall be
Damages subject to indemnification hereunder. If the Indemnified Purchaser
Entity shall elect to exercise such right, the Sellers shall have the right
to participate in, but not control, the defense, compromise or settlement of
such third party claim at its sole cost and expense. Each Indemnified
Purchaser Entity shall make available to the Sellers all
information reasonably available to such Indemnified Purchaser Entity
relating to such action or claim. In addition, the parties hereto shall
render to each other such assistance as may reasonably be requested in order
to ensure the proper and adequate defense of any such action or claim. The
party in charge of the defense shall keep the other party fully apprised at
all times as to the status of the defense or any settlement negotiations with
respect thereto. If the Sellers elect to defend any such action or claim,
then the Indemnified Purchaser Entity shall be entitled to participate in
such defense with the counsel of its choice, which shall be reasonably
acceptable to the Sellers, at such Indemnified Purchaser Entity\'s sole cost
and expense. Neither the Sellers nor the Indemnified Purchaser Entity shall
be entitled to settle, compromise or otherwise dispose of any action or claim
of more than $10,000 without the written consent of the other, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The Sellers shall not settle,
compromise or otherwise dispose of any action or claim that imposes any non-
monetary obligation on any Indemnified Purchaser Entity without Purchasers\'
consent, which may be given or withheld in their sole discretion.   
57      (c) If an indemnification claim made under this Article XI
involves a matter other than a third party claim, the Sellers shall have
thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claim Notice to object to such claim by
delivery of a written notice of objection to the Indemnified Purchaser
Entities, specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such objection.
Failure to timely so object shall constitute a final and binding acceptance
of the indemnification claim by the Sellers, and the claim shall be paid in
accordance with Section 11.2(d) hereof.   (d) The Sellers shall pay any
claim for which they are liable hereunder within thirty (30) days after the
receipt of a Claims Notice. If the Sellers dispute any portion of a Claims
Notice, they shall pay the undisputed portion while negotiating the disputed
portion. In the event the Sellers do not make a payment when due under the
terms of this Agreement, interest shall be paid on such payment at a rate per
annum (using a 365 day year) of ten percent (10%) and such interest shall be
calculated from the date the payment was due to the date of payment.
Acceptance by an Indemnified Purchaser Entity of such interest shall not
constitute a waiver of any rights such party may have against the other
for breach of the Agreement or for failure to make payment when due.   11.3
LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Article XI, the Indemnified Purchaser Entities shall not be entitled
to indemnification pursuant to this Article XI with respect to any claim for
indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1 as follows:   (a) (i) with respect
to any claim of indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(a) (to the extent
the relevant representation or warranty was made in Article IV or Section
5.11), if the related Claim Notice is not received on or before the date that
is three years after the Closing Date or to the extent the aggregate Damages
which are the subject of those claims exceed $40,000,000, but in the case of
a claim made for breach of Section 4.10, after giving effect to the
application of the $500,000 threshold set forth in subsection (ii)(A)
below; except notwithstanding the above: (A) with respect to matters covered
by Section 4.13 or 4.14, Article X or Section 5.11, time limit for delivery
of a Claim Notice will expire 30 days after expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations with respect to the subject matter of the claim and
there will be no limitation on the amount of aggregate Damages; and (B) with
respect to matters covered by Sections 4.1 or 4.8, there shall be no time
limit for delivery of a Claim Notice, but there will be no indemnity to the
extent the aggregate Damages exceed the Purchase Price, and   (ii) with
respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(a), (to the
extent the relevant representation or warranty was made in Article V, except
for Section 5.11, or in Section 4.10 to the extent provided for below), if
the related Claim Notice is not received by Sellers on or before the date
that is ten years after the Closing Date or, with respect to
Investor requests for the repurchase of a Mortgage Loan, the term of the
affected Mortgage Loan, as the case may be, and there will be no indemnity to
the extent the aggregate Damages exceed the Purchase Price; except
notwithstanding the above: (A) no Claim Notice shall be sent with respect to
a breach of Section 5.5 regarding a Portfolio Loan or a breach of Section
4.10 regarding Litigation related to an individual mortgage loan, mortgaged
property, or REO until Damages to the Company for such breaches aggregate in
excess of $500,000, and then only to the extent of such excess with Damages
being measured for these purposes in the case of a breach of Section 5.5
regarding a Portfolio Loan as a loss with respect to, or the reduced value
of, a Portfolio Loan from the book value reflected in the Interim Financial
Statements, or the purchase price thereof, if acquired after June 30, 2000,
in either event without giving effect to any further write downs other than
to reflect payments received; and (B) with respect to matters covered by
Section 5.6, there shall be no time limit for delivery of a Claim Notice or
limitation on the amount of aggregate Damages; and    58      (b) with
respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.1(c), if the
related Claim Notice is not received within three years of the Closing Date,
and there will be no indemnity to the extent the aggregate Damages exceed the
Purchase Price.   (c) with respect to any claim for indemnification pursuant
to Sections 11.1(b), (d) or (e), there shall be no time limit for delivery of
a Claim Notice or limitation on the amount of aggregate Damages.   (d) The
indemnification provided for in Section 11.1, subject to the limitations in
this Section 11.3, is the sole remedy to which either of the Purchasers is
entitled because of any breach of the representations and warranties of the
Sellers in this Agreement, except in the case of fraud.   11.4 DAMAGES TO
COMPANY. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, except
Section 8.2(j) and Article XIV, to the extent Damages consist of Damages to
the Company or a Related Company (whether because the assets of the Company
or a Related Company are not as represented and warranted, because facts are
not as represented or warranted, or otherwise), the liability of the Sellers
under this Article XI will be 45.94% of the Damages suffered by the Company
or the Related Company.   ARTICLE XII  INDEMNIFICATION BY PURCHASER  
12.1 INDEMNIFICATION. In addition to and not in limitation of the indemnities
provided in Article X (which Article sets forth the exclusive remedy of
Purchasers and the Sellers in respect of the matters covered thereby),
from and after the Closing Date, subject to the other provisions of this
Article XII, Purchasers agree to indemnify the Sellers and their Affiliates
and each of their respective current, former and future officers, directors,
agents and employees (collectively, the "Indemnified Seller Entities") and to
hold each of them harmless from and against, and agree to assume liability
for, any and all Damages, suffered, paid or incurred by any Indemnified
Seller Entity arising from, in connection with or resulting from any breach
by Purchasers of any covenant, obligation or agreement of Purchasers
contained in this Agreement due to be performed by Purchasers after the
Closing Date.   12.2 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE.   (a) If an Indemnified
Seller Entity believes that a claim, demand or other circumstance exists that
has given or may reasonably be expected to give rise to a right of
indemnification under this Article XII (whether or not the amount of Damages
relating thereto is then quantifiable), such Indemnified Seller Entity shall
promptly assert its claim for indemnification by giving a Claim Notice
to Purchasers. Each Claim Notice shall describe the claim in reasonable
detail. The failure to so notify Purchasers shall not relieve Purchasers of
any obligation to indemnify any Indemnified Seller Entity unless such failure
materially prejudices the rights or increases the liability of Purchasers
with respect to the claim to which the Claim Notice related and then
Purchasers\' obligation to indemnify shall be reduced only by the amount that
it actually has been damaged thereby.    59      (b) If any claim or
demand by an Indemnified Seller Entity under this Article XII relates to an
action or claim filed or made against an Indemnified Seller Entity by a third
party, except as otherwise provided herein, Purchasers may elect at any time
to negotiate a settlement or a compromise of such action or claim or to
defend any such action or claim, in each case at their sole cost and expense
(subject to the last sentence of this Section 12.2(b)) and with their own
counsel; provided that such counsel is satisfactory to the Indemnified Seller
Entity in the exercise of its reasonable discretion. If, within ten (10) days
of receipt from an Indemnified Seller Entity of any Claim Notice with respect
to a third party action or claim, Purchasers (i) advise such
Indemnified Seller Entity in writing that Purchasers will not elect to
defend, settle or compromise such action or claim, or (ii) fail to make such
an election to defend, settle, or compromise such action or claim in writing,
such Indemnified Seller Entity may (subject to Purchasers\' continuing right
of election in the preceding sentence), at its option, defend, settle or
otherwise compromise or pay such action or claim. Unless and until Purchasers
make an election in accordance with this Section 12.2(b), all of such
Indemnified Seller Entity\'s reasonable costs and expenses arising out of the
defense, settlement or compromise of any such action or claim shall be
Damages subject to indemnification hereunder to the extent provided herein.
Each Indemnified Seller Entity shall make available to Purchasers all
information reasonably available to it relating to such action or claim. In
addition, the parties shall render to each other such assistance as may
reasonably be requested in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of
any such action or claim. The party in charge of the defense shall keep the
other party fully apprised at all times as to the status of the defense or
any settlement negotiations with respect thereto. If Purchasers elect to
defend any such action or claim, then the Indemnified Seller Entity shall be
entitled to participate in such defense with counsel of its choice, which
shall be reasonably acceptable to Purchasers, at such Indemnified Seller
Entity\'s sole cost and expense. Neither Purchasers nor the
Indemnified Seller Entity shall be entitled to settle, compromise or
otherwise dispose of any action or claim of more than $10,000 without the
written consent of the other, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.   12.3 LIMITATION ON LIABILITY. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Article XII, the Indemnified

EXONERATION OF THE  COMPANY AND THE RELATED COMPANIES   14.1 ACCOMMODATION.
The Company is a party to this Agreement at the request of the Purchasers who
desired that the Company carefully review the representations and warranties
in Article IV (insofar as they apply to the Company) and in Article V as well
as the covenants in Sections 2.3 and 7.1 hereof (such review is herein
referred to as the "Review"). The Purchasers assured the Company that the
Company\'s becoming a party hereto for the purposes of the Review would not
result in any liability or obligation on the part of the Company nor would
the Purchasers be entitled to assert a claim against the Company on account
of the Review other than with respect to the Section 2.3 Obligations, as
defined below. The Sellers, with respect to any liability or obligation to
them as a result of the Company becoming a party hereto or the Review, made
an equivalent assurance. As an accommodation to the Purchasers, the Company,
with the concurrence of its equity owners (a majority of the equity interests
in the Company being owned by persons other than the Sellers), agreed to
become a party to this Agreement on the condition that this Article XIV
be added to this Agreement. The Purchasers and the Sellers acknowledge that
the addition of Article XIV was the sole reason for the Company\'s becoming a
party to this Agreement and that but for the addition of this Article XIV the
Company would not have become a party to this Agreement. This paragraph is
included in Article XIV to memorialize the circumstances under which Article
XIV was added to this Agreement and as an aid in the construction of the
following provisions of Article XIV.   14.2 EXONERATION. Each of RFC, RFC
Sub, EFS and Enhance GP acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself and any
person claiming by or through any of them (and taking into account the
provisions of Section 13.6 to the effect that there are no third party
beneficiaries of this Agreement), that notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement, any other instrument or any law (including statutes, common law
and regulations) (such law is hereinafter collectively referred to as "Law")
to the contrary, that:    63      (a) with the sole exception of the
obligations of the Company expressly set forth in Section 2.3, as modified by
the provisions of subsection (e) below, (such obligations as so modified are
herein referred to as the "Section 2.3 Obligations"), this Agreement creates
no obligation, duty or liability of any nature, legal or otherwise, on the
part of the Company, any of the Related Companies or any member (other than
the Sellers as provided pursuant to this Agreement), member of a member,
officer, manager or employee of any of the Company, or any of the Related
Companies (such persons are collectively referred to herein as the
"Exonerated Persons"), any such obligation, duty or liability that would have
arisen in the absence of this Article XIV, whether under Law , contract or
otherwise, being expressly waived by each of RFC, RFC Sub, EFS and Enhance
GP;   (b) other than with respect to the Section 2.3 Obligations, there
shall be no obligation duty or liability of any nature, legal or otherwise,
on the part of any Exonerated Person arising from, in connection with, or
resulting from the Review, any such obligation, duty or liability that would
have arisen in the absence of this Article XIV, whether under Law, contract
or otherwise, being expressly waived by each of RFC, RFC Sub, EFS and Enhance
GP;   (c) except for any breach of the Section 2.3 Obligations, claims for
which may be asserted only against the Company (and not against any other
Exonerated Person) by RFC and RFC Sub, none of RFC, RFC Sub, EFS or Enhance
GP will assert any claim against any Exonerated Person arising from, in
connection with, or resulting from this Agreement or the Review (such a claim
is herein referred to as a "Prohibited Claim");   (d) if despite the
provisions of subsection (c) above, any of RFC, RFC Sub, EFS or Enhance GP
assert a Prohibited Claim, the person asserting the Prohibited Claim shall
indemnify and hold harmless each Exonerated Person against whom the
Prohibited Claim has been asserted from all liabilities, costs and expenses
(including the costs and expenses of investigating and defending against such
prohibited Claim, which shall encompass reasonable attorneys\' fees and
expenses) arising therefrom; and   (e) the obligations of the Company under
Section 2.3 hereof shall be deemed by this subsection (e) to be modified such
that there shall be no breach thereof unless it is demonstrated that the
Company did not perform such obligations in good faith.   It is the express
intention of the parties, and regardless of whether a different result may
occur under Section 13.8 hereof, that the provisions of this Section shall be
construed as broadly as possible to provide the maximum possible benefit to
the Exonerated Persons and that any ambiguity in such provisions shall be
resolved in favor of the Exonerated Persons.    [SIGNATURES CONTAINED ON
