6   AGREEMENT AND PLAN  OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION   THIS AGREEMENT AND
PLAN OF MERGER AND REORGANIZATION ("Agreement") is made and entered into as
of June 27, 2000, by and among CONEXANT SYSTEMS, INC., a Delaware corporation
("Parent"); STEAM ACQUISITION CORP., a Delaware corporation and a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"); and HOTRAIL, INC., a California
corporation (the "Company"). Certain capitalized terms used in this Agreement
are defined in EXHIBIT A.   RECITALS   A. Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company intend to effect a merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company in
accordance with this Agreement, the California General Corporation Law and
the Delaware General Corporation Law (the "Merger"). Upon consummation of the
Merger, Merger Sub will cease to exist, and the Company will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent.   B. It is intended that the Merger qualify as a
tax-free reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). For accounting purposes, it is
intended that the Merger be treated as a "purchase."   C. This Agreement
has been approved by the respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub
and the Company.   D. Contemporaneously with the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, certain holders of voting capital stock of the Company are
executing and delivering to Parent a voting agreement (a "Voting Agreement")
of even date herewith substantially in the form of EXHIBIT B.  
AGREEMENT   The parties to this Agreement agree as follows:  SECTION 1.
DESCRIPTION OF TRANSACTION   1.1 MERGER OF MERGER SUB INTO THE COMPANY. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, at the
Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3), Merger Sub shall be merged with
and into the Company, and the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease.
The Company will continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the
"Surviving Corporation").   1.2 EFFECT OF THE MERGER. The Merger shall have
the effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of
the California General Corporation Law and the Delaware General Corporation
Law.   1.3 CLOSING; EFFECTIVE TIME. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place
at the offices of Cooley Godward LLP, Palo Alto,    1   
7  California 94306 at 10:00 a.m. (or at such other time as Parent and the
Company may agree) on a date to be designated by Parent as soon as
practicable after the satisfaction (or, to the extent permitted, waiver) of
the conditions set forth in Sections 6 and 7. (The date on which the Closing
actually takes place is referred to in this Agreement as the "Closing Date.")
Contemporaneously with or as promptly as practicable after the Closing, a
properly executed agreement of merger (in the form attached hereto as EXHIBIT
N) conforming to the requirements of the California General Corporation Law
shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California and a
properly executed certificate of merger (in the form attached hereto as
EXHIBIT O) conforming to the requirements of the Delaware General Corporation
Law shall be filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware. The
Merger shall become effective upon the later of the time the agreement of
merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of California or the
time the certificate of merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the
State of Delaware (the "Effective Time").   1.4 ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION;
DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS. Unless otherwise determined by Parent and the Company
prior to the Effective Time:   (a) the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated as of the Effective Time
in the form of EXHIBIT M; and   (b) the directors and officers of the
Surviving Corporation immediately after the Effective Time shall be the
individuals selected by Parent prior to the Closing.   1.5 CONVERSION OF
SHARES.   (a) Subject to Sections 1.8(c) and 1.9, at the Effective Time,
by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of
Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any shareholder of the Company:   (i)
each share of the common stock (no par value per share) of  the Company
("Company Common Stock") outstanding immediately prior to  the Effective Time
shall be converted into a fraction of a share of  Parent Common Stock equal
to the Exchange Ratio; and   (ii) each share of the common stock (par value
$0.001 per  share) of Merger Sub outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective  Time shall be converted into one share of common stock of the
Surviving  Corporation.   (b) If any shares of Company Capital Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
the Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for
such shares of Company Capital Stock will also be unvested and subject to the
same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition, and the
certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may accordingly
be marked with appropriate legends.    2    8   (c) A portion of the
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger shall be delivered into
escrow and held as specified in Section 1.8.   (d) If, between the date of
this Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company
Capital Stock or Parent Common Stock are changed into a different number or
class of shares by reason of any stock split, division or subdivision of
shares, stock dividend, reverse stock split, consolidation of shares,
reclassification, recapitalization or other similar transaction, then the
Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted.   (e) For purposes of
this Agreement:   (i) The "Aggregate Common Number" shall be the sum of (A)
the  total number of shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and 
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time; (B) the total  number of
shares of Company Common Stock that are issuable upon the  conversion of any
shares of Company Preferred Stock issued and  outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time; (C) the total  number of shares of Company Common
Stock that are issuable upon the  conversion of any shares of Company
Preferred Stock that are issuable  upon the exercise in full of all warrants
to acquire shares of Company  Preferred Stock that are outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective  Time; and (D) the total number of shares
of Company capital stock that  are issuable upon the conversion or exercise
in full of all convertible  securities or options (vested and unvested),
warrants or other rights  to acquire Company capital stock that are
outstanding immediately prior  to the Effective Time other than convertible
securities or warrants  referred to in clauses "(B)" or "(C)" of this
sentence; provided,  however, that notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in  this paragraph, no shares, warrants, options or rights shall be
counted  more than one time in calculating the "Aggregate Common Number."  
(ii) "Calculated Stock Price" shall mean the average of the  closing prices
of a share of Parent Common Stock, as reported by  Nasdaq, for the ten
trading days immediately preceding the Closing  Date.   (iii) "Exchange
Ratio" shall mean the quotient obtained by  dividing (A) the Merger
Consideration by (B) the Aggregate Common  Number.   (iv) "Merger
Consideration" shall mean the number of shares of  Parent Common Stock equal
to the amount by which (A) 7,855,000, exceeds  (B) the number determined by
dividing the Excess Transaction Expenses,  if any, at the Effective Time, by
the Calculated Stock Price.   1.6 STOCK OPTIONS.   (a) At the Effective
Time, each option to purchase shares of capital stock of the Company that is
then outstanding, whether vested or unvested (a "Company Option"), shall be
assumed by Parent. All rights with respect to Company Common Stock under
outstanding Company Options shall thereupon be converted into rights with
respect to Parent Common Stock. Accordingly, from and after the Effective
Time, (i) each Company Option assumed by    3    9  Parent may be
exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock, (ii) the number of shares
of Parent Common Stock subject to each such assumed Company Option shall be
equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were subject to
such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the
Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent
Common Stock, (iii) the per share exercise price for the Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of each such assumed Company Option shall
be determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Option, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and rounding the resulting exercise
price up to the nearest whole cent and (iv) all restrictions on the exercise
of each such assumed Company Option shall continue in full force and effect,
and the term, exercisability, vesting schedule and other provisions of such
Company Option shall otherwise remain unchanged; provided, however, that each
such assumed Company Option shall, in accordance with its terms, be subject
to further adjustment as appropriate to reflect any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, recapitalization or other similar transaction
effected by Parent after the Effective Time. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Section 1.6, in lieu of assuming outstanding
Company Options in accordance with Section 1.6, Parent may, at its election,
cause such outstanding Company Options to be replaced by issuing
substantially equivalent replacement stock options in substitution therefor.
The Company and Parent shall take all action that may be necessary (under the
1997 Stock Plan, the 2000 Equity Plan and otherwise) to effectuate the
provisions of this Section 1.6. Following the Closing, Parent will send to
each holder of an assumed or substituted Company Option a written notice
setting forth (i) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such
assumed or substituted Company Option and (ii) the exercise price per
share of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed or
substituted Company Option. Parent shall file with the SEC, as soon as
practicable (and in any event within 30 days) after the Closing Date, a
registration statement on Form S-8 registering the Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of all Company Options assumed or substituted by
Parent pursuant to this Section 1.6.   (b) At the Effective Time, any
Company Warrant that is then outstanding shall be assumed by Parent in
accordance with the terms (as in effect as of the date of this Agreement) of
the instrument by which such Company Warrant is evidenced. All rights with
respect to Company Common Stock under outstanding Company Warrants shall
thereupon be converted into rights with respect to Parent Common Stock.
Accordingly, from and after the Effective Time, (i) each Company Warrant
assumed by Parent may be exercised solely for shares of Parent Common Stock,
(ii) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to each such assumed
Company Warrant shall be equal to the number of shares of Company Capital
Stock that were subject to such Company Warrant immediately prior to the
Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, (iii) the per share exercise
price for the Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each such assumed
Company Warrant shall be determined by dividing the exercise price per share
of Company Capital Stock subject to such Company Warrant, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, by the Exchange Ratio, and
rounding the resulting exercise price up to the nearest whole cent and (iv)
all restrictions on the exercise of each such assumed Company Warrant shall
continue in full force and effect, and the term, exercisability and other
provisions of such Company Warrant shall otherwise remain unchanged;
provided, however, that each such assumed Company Warrant shall, in
accordance with its terms, be subject to further adjustment as appropriate to
reflect any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization or other similar transaction effected by Parent after the
Effective Time.    4    10   1.7 CLOSING OF THE COMPANY\'S TRANSFER
BOOKS. At the Effective Time, holders of certificates representing shares of
the Company\'s capital stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall cease to have any rights as shareholders of the Company,
and the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed with respect to
all shares of such capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time. No further transfer of any such shares of the Company\'s
capital stock shall be made on such stock transfer books after the Effective
Time. If, after the Effective Time, a valid certificate previously
representing any of such shares of the Company\'s capital stock (a "Company
Stock Certificate") is presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent, such
Company Stock Certificate shall be canceled and shall be exchanged as
provided in Section 1.8.   1.8 EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; ESCROW SHARES.  
(a) At or as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, Parent shall (i)
deliver to each Merger Shareholder a certificate representing 90 percent of
the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such
Merger Shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
Section 1.5 and (ii) deliver to the escrow agent under the Escrow Agreement
substantially in the form of EXHIBIT C (the "Escrow Agreement"), on behalf of
the Merger Shareholders (but in the name of the Escrow Agent), a certificate
representing 10 percent of the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that the Merger Shareholders have the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of Section 1.5, rounded down to the nearest whole share, (the
"Escrow Shares"). If any Company Stock Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance of any certificate representing Parent Common
Stock, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Company Stock
Certificate to provide an appropriate affidavit and to deliver a bond (in
such sum as Parent may reasonably direct) as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against Parent or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such
Company Stock Certificate.   (b) No dividends or other distributions
declared or made with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after
the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company
Stock Certificate with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of any fractional share
shall be paid to any such holder, until such holder surrenders such Company
Stock Certificate in accordance with this Section 1.8 (at which time such
holder shall be entitled to receive all such dividends and distributions and
such cash payment).   (c) No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such
fractional shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any
holder of capital stock of the Company who would otherwise be entitled to
receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock issuable to such holder) shall, upon
surrender of such holder\'s Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid in cash the
dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without interest,
determined by multiplying such fraction by the closing sale price of a share
of Parent Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq National Market on the
Closing Date.    5    11   (d) Parent and the Surviving Corporation
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or
otherwise deliverable to any holder or former holder of capital stock of the
Company pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Surviving
Corporation may be required to deduct or withhold therefrom under the Code or
under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all
purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid.   (e) Neither Parent nor the
Surviving Corporation shall be liable to any holder or former holder of
capital stock of the Company for any shares of Parent Common Stock (or
dividends or distributions with respect thereto), or for any cash amounts,
delivered to any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.   1.9 DISSENTING SHARES.   (a)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, any
shares of capital stock of the Company that, as of the Effective Time, are or
may become "dissenting shares" within the meaning of Section 1300(b) of the
California Corporations Code shall not be converted into or represent the
right to receive Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 1.5 (or cash
in lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.8(c)), and the
holder or holders of such shares shall be entitled only to such rights as may
be granted to such holder or holders in Chapter 13 of the
California Corporations Code; provided, however, that if the status of any
such shares as "dissenting shares" shall not be perfected, or if any such
shares shall lose their status as "dissenting shares," then, as of the later
of the Effective Time or the time of the failure to perfect such status or
the loss of such status, such shares shall automatically be converted into
and shall represent only the right to receive (upon the surrender of the
certificate or certificates representing such shares) Parent Common Stock in
accordance with Section 1.5 (and cash in lieu of fractional shares in
accordance with Section 1.8(c)).   (b) The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any written demand received by the Company prior to the
Effective Time to require the Company to purchase shares of capital stock of
the Company pursuant to the California Corporations Code and of any other
demand, notice or instrument delivered to the Company prior to the Effective
Time pursuant to the California Corporations Code and (ii) the opportunity to
participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to any such
demand, notice or instrument. The Company shall not make any payment or
settlement offer prior to the Effective Time with respect to any such demand
unless Parent shall have consented in writing to such payment or settlement
offer.   1.10 TAX CONSEQUENCES. For federal income tax purposes, the Merger
is intended to constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368
of the Code. The parties to this Agreement hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the United States Treasury Regulations.    6    12  
1.11 ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. For accounting purposes, the Merger is intended to
be treated as a "purchase."   1.12 FURTHER ACTION. If, at any time after the
Effective Time, any further action is determined by Parent to be necessary or
desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the
Surviving Corporation or Parent with full right, title and possession of and
to all rights and property of Merger Sub and the Company, the officers and
directors of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall be fully authorized
(in the name of Merger Sub, in the name of the Company and otherwise) to take
such action.  SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

contracts, minimum premium contracts, stop-loss agreements,
investment management agreements, subscription and participation agreements
and recordkeeping agreements; and (vi) an accurate and complete copy of the

group" within the meaning of Section 414(m) of the Code. None of the Employee
Plans identified in the Disclosure Schedule is a multiemployer plan (within
the meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA). The Company has never made a complete
or partial withdrawal from a multiemployer plan, as such term is defined in
Section 3(37) of ERISA, resulting in "withdrawal liability," as such term is

Plan provides death, medical or health benefits (whether or not insured) with
respect to any current or former employee or director of the Company after
any termination of service of such employee or director (other than benefit
coverage mandated by applicable law, including, without limitation, coverage
provided pursuant to Section 4980B of the Code).   (h) With respect to any
Employee Plan constituting a group health plan within the meaning of Section
4980B(g)(2) of the Code, the provisions of Section 4980B of the Code   
19    25  ("COBRA") have been complied with in all material respects.
Part 2.15(h) of the Disclosure Schedule describes all obligations of the
Company as of the date of this Agreement under any of the provisions of
COBRA.   (i) Each of the Employee Plans has been operated and
administered in all material respects in accordance with its terms and with
applicable Legal Requirements, including, without limitation, ERISA, the Code
and applicable foreign Legal Requirements. The Company has performed all of
its obligations under the Employee Plans.   (j) Each of the Employee Plans
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the Internal Revenue Service, and nothing
has occurred that would adversely affect such determination.   (k) Neither
the execution, delivery or performance of this Agreement, nor the
consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, will result in any bonus, golden parachute, severance or
other payment or obligation to any current or former employee or director of
the Company (whether or not under any Employee Plan), or materially increase
the benefits payable or provided under any Employee Plan, or result in any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing (and except as set forth in
Part 2.15(k) of the Disclosure Schedule), the consummation of the Merger will
not result in the acceleration of vesting of any unvested Company
Options.   (l) Part 2.15(l) of the Disclosure Schedule contains a list of
all salaried employees of the Company as of the date of this Agreement,
and correctly reflects, in all material respects, their salaries and

contract or other Contract with a labor union involving any of its employees.
All of the employees of the Company are "at will" employees.   (m) Part

compliance in all material respects with all applicable Legal Requirements
and Contracts relating to employment.   (o) The Company has good labor
relations, and the Company has no knowledge of any facts indicating that (i)
the consummation of the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement will have a material adverse effect on the labor relations
of the Company, or (ii) any of the employees of the Company intends to
terminate his or her employment with the Company.   2.16 ENVIRONMENTAL

currently held by the Company pursuant to Environmental Laws are identified

set forth in Sections 9.3(a) and 9.3(b) shall not apply in the case of a
Person\'s own intentional misrepresentation or fraud.   9.4 NO
CONTRIBUTION. No shareholder of the Company shall have any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against Merger
Sub or the Company in connection with any indemnification obligation or any
other liability to which she, he or it may become subject under or in
connection with this Agreement.   9.5 DEFENSE OF THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. In the
event of the assertion or commencement by any Person of any claim or Legal
Proceeding (whether against Merger Sub, the Company, Parent or any other
Person) with respect to which any of the Indemnitors may become obligated to
hold harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to
this Section 9, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with
the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own. If Parent so
proceeds with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:   (a) all
reasonable expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding
shall be borne and paid exclusively from the Escrow Shares;   (b) each
Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any documents and materials in his
or its possession or control that may be reasonably necessary to the defense
of such claim or Legal Proceeding; and    40    46   (c) Parent shall
not have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim or Legal
Proceeding without the consent of the Shareholders\' Agents; provided,
however, that such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.  Parent shall give the Shareholders\' Agents notice of the
commencement of any such claim or Legal Proceeding against Parent, Merger Sub
or the Company promptly after Parent becomes aware of such claims or Legal
Proceeding; provided, however, that any failure on the part of Parent to so
notify the Shareholders\' Agents shall not limit any of the obligations of
the Indemnitors under this Section 9 (except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). If Parent does
not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding,
the Shareholders\' Agents may proceed with the defense of such claim or Legal
Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent; provided, however,
that the Shareholders\' Agents may not settle, adjust or compromise any such
claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed).   9.6 OTHER
LIMITATIONS. No Indemnitee will be entitled to be indemnified pursuant to
this Section 9: (a) with respect to any obligation, liability or matter to
the extent reserves or accruals for such matter are properly reflected in the
Unaudited Interim Balance Sheet; (b) to the extent any obligation, liability
or matter, including with respect to environmental remediation and clean-up,
arises under any law or regulation or interpretations of any law
or regulation that first arise or are first promulgated or announced after
the Closing Date that would create liability not otherwise expressly provided
for in this Agreement; (c) with respect to any breach of representations
relating to tax matters, to the extent arising from any tax determinations,
allocations or positions of Parent or the Surviving Corporation after the
Closing that are materially different from those of the Company prior to the
Closing, unless it is asserted by a Governmental Body that the Company\'s
determinations, allocations or positions were incorrect or improperly made;
or (d) with respect to increases in Taxes for calendar years 1993, 1994, 1995
and 1996, to the extent that in the year in which the Taxes have been so
increased, there would have been Tax carryforwards or Tax carrybacks
available to shelter any such increase.  SECTION 10. MISCELLANEOUS
