ARTICLE 1



THE MERGER



1.01 _The Merger_. At the Effective Time (as defined in _Section 1.02_ ),
subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and in accordance with
the provisions of the GBCC, Merger Sub shall be merged (the " _Merger_ ") with
and into the Company. Following the Merger, the separate corporate existence
of Merger Sub shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving
corporation (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving
Corporation_ ") and shall continue to be governed by the laws of the State of
Georgia.



1.02  _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing (as
defined in _Section 1.07_ ), the Company will cause a Certificate of Merger
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit 1.02_ (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") to be duly executed, acknowledged and filed, in
the manner required by the GBCC, with the Secretary of State of the State of
Georgia, and the parties shall take such other and further actions as may be
required by law to make the Merger effective. The date and time the Merger
becomes effective in accordance with applicable law is referred to herein as
the " _Effective Time_."



1.03 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger shall have the effects set forth
herein, in the Certificate of Merger and in the GBCC. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
the Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts,
liabilities and duties of the Company and the Merger Sub shall become the
debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.



1.04 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation_.



(a) The Articles of Incorporation of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, shall be the Articles of Incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until duly amended; provided that such Articles of
Incorporation shall be amended to reflect that the name of the Surviving
Corporation shall be "MAPICS, Inc."



(b) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the
Effective Time, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until duly
amended.



 

2 1.05 _Directors_. The directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors of the Surviving Corporation
and shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with
applicable law and the Surviving Corporations Articles of Incorporation and
Bylaws.



1.06  _Officers_. The officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation and
shall hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and
qualified, or their earlier death, resignation or removal.



1.07 _Closing_. Subject to the conditions contained in this Agreement, the
closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place (a) at the offices
of Kirkland and Ellis, 153 East 53rd Street, New York, New York 10022, on the
day immediately following the last to occur of (i) March 14, 2005 and (ii) the
third business day following the satisfaction (or waiver if permissible) of
the conditions set forth in _Article 6_ that by their terms are not to be
satisfied at the Closing or (b) at such other place and time and/or on such
other date as the Company and Merger Sub may agree in writing. The date on
which the Closing occurs is hereinafter referred to as the " _Closing Date_."



1.08 _Additional Actions_. If, at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall consider or be advised that any deeds, bills
of sale, assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or
desirable to vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in the
Surviving Corporation its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company or Merger Sub, the Company and
its officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to the Surviving
Corporation an irrevocable power of attorney to execute and deliver all such
deeds, assignments and assurances in law and to take all acts necessary,
proper or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm title to and possession of
such rights, properties or assets in the Surviving Corporation, and the
officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation are authorized in the
name of the Company to take any and all such action.



ARTICLE 2



EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK

OF THE COMPANY AND MERGER SUB



2.01 _Effect on Shares of Capital Stock_.



(a) _Common Shares of the Company_. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any Common Shares,
the Company or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Dissenting Shares, and
(ii) those Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to  _Section 2.01(b)_ )
shall be canceled and extinguished and converted into the right to receive
$12.75 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable to the holder
thereof, without interest or dividends thereon, less any applicable
withholding of taxes, in the manner provided in _Section 2.03_. All such
Common Shares, when so converted, shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and each holder of a certificate or
certificates representing any such Common Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the consideration
specified in the preceding sentence.



 

3 (b) _Cancellation of Certain Common Shares_. As of the Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any
Common Shares, the Company or Merger Sub, each Common Share that is owned by
the Company or any wholly owned subsidiary as treasury stock or otherwise or
owned by Merger Sub or Infor or any of their respective subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and no cash or other consideration shall be delivered or
deliverable in exchange therefor.



(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. As of the Effective Time, each share of
common stock, par value $.01 per share, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common
Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holders of Merger Sub Common Stock, the Company or Merger Sub, be converted
into one validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable share of common stock,
par value $.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation (" _Surviving
Corporation Common Stock_ "). Each certificate that, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, represented issued and outstanding shares of Merger Sub Common
Stock shall, from and after the Effective Time, automatically and without the
necessity of presenting the same for exchange, represent the shares of the
Surviving Corporation capital stock into which such shares have been converted
pursuant to the terms hereof; provided, however, that the record holder
thereof shall receive, upon surrender of any such certificate, a certificate
representing the shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock into which the
shares of Merger Sub Common Stock formerly represented thereby shall have been
converted pursuant to the terms hereof.



(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, any Common Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time and held by a holder (a " _Dissenting Shareholder_ ") who
timely delivers to the Company such holders notice of intent to
demand payment for such holders shares if the Merger is effected, thereafter
does not vote in favor of the Merger or consent thereto in writing and who
otherwise properly demands appraisal for such Common Shares in accordance with
the GBCC (" _Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into a right to
receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time in accordance with
_Section 2.01(a)_ hereof, but shall represent and become the right to receive
such consideration as may be determined to be due to such Dissenting
Shareholder pursuant to the laws of the State of Georgia, unless and until
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
right to appraisal and payment under the GBCC. If, after the Effective Time,
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses such holders
right to appraisal, such former Dissenting Shares held by such holder shall be
treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a right
to receive, upon surrender as provided above, the Merger Consideration,
without any interest or dividends thereon, in accordance with _Section
2.01(a)_. The Company shall give Merger Sub prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for appraisal of Common Shares, withdrawals of such
demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the GBCC and received by
the Company, and Merger Sub shall have the right to direct all negotiations
and proceedings with respect to such demands. The Company shall not make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands,
except with the prior written consent of Merger Sub, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed.



 

4 2.02 _Options; Warrants; Stock Plans_.



(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Option_ " means each
outstanding unexercised option to purchase Common Shares, whether or not then
vested or fully exercisable, granted on or prior to the date hereof to any
current or former employee or director of the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company or any other person, whether under any stock option plan or otherwise
(including, without limitation, under the Marcam Corporation 1994 Stock Plan,
as amended; the Marcam Corporation Amended and Restated 1987 Stock Plan, as
amended; the MAPICS, Inc. Amended and Restated 1998 Non-Employee Directors
Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _DSIP_ "); the MAPICS, Inc. Amended
and Restated 1998 Non-Employee Director Stock Option Plan, as amended; the
MAPICS, Inc. Amended and Restated 1998 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended;
the Symix Systems, Inc. Non-Qualified Stock Option Plan for Key Employees and
Directors, as amended; and the Frontstep, Inc. 1999 Non-Qualified Stock Option
Plan for Key Employees, as amended) (collectively, the " _Stock Plans_ ").



(b) The Company shall take all actions necessary so that (i) immediately
prior to the Effective Time, each outstanding Option granted under the Stock
Plans held by those holders of record listed on the _Option Schedule_ included
as part of _Section 3.03(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule under the
heading "Cash-Pay Options" (the " _Cash-Pay Options_ ") shall become
immediately vested and exercisable in full and (ii) at the Effective Time, all
Options shall be canceled, in each case, in accordance with and pursuant to
the terms of the Stock Plans under which such Options were granted. In
consideration of such cancellation, each holder of a Cash-Pay Option canceled
in accordance with this _Section 2.02(b)_ will be entitled to receive in
settlement of such Cash-Pay Option as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 business days after the
Effective Time, a cash payment from the Payment Fund (as defined in _Section
2.03_ ), subject to any required withholding of taxes, equal to the product of
(i) the total number of Common Shares otherwise issuable upon exercise of such
Cash-Pay Option and (ii) the Merger Consideration per Common Share less the
applicable exercise price per Common Share otherwise issuable upon exercise of
such Cash-Pay Option (the " _Cash-Pay Option Consideration_ "); provided,
however, that with respect to any person subject to Section 16 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange Act_ "), any
such amount shall be paid as soon as practicable after the first date payment
can be made without liability to such person under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act. The Company Board will fully accelerate the vesting schedule of
the Options issued under the Companys Stock Plans.



(c) [Intentionally Omitted]



(d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Warrant_ " means each
outstanding unexercised warrant to purchase Common Shares granted on or prior
to the date hereof to any person (including, without limitation, pursuant to
that certain Common Share Purchase Warrant dated February 18, 2003, pursuant
to which the holder thereof is entitled to purchase 134,270 Common Shares at
an exercise price of $7.81 per share). The Company shall take all actions
necessary so that, at the Effective Time, each Warrant shall be canceled, in
each  



 

5  case, in accordance with and pursuant to the terms of each such Warrant. In
consideration of such cancellation, each holder of a Warrant canceled
in accordance with this _Section 2.02(d)_ will be entitled to receive in
settlement of such Warrant as promptly as practicable following the Effective
Time, but in no event later than 10 business days after the Effective Time, a
cash payment from the Payment Fund, subject to any required withholding of
taxes, equal to the product of (i) the total number of Common Shares otherwise
issuable upon exercise of such Warrant and (ii) the Merger Consideration per
Common Share less the applicable exercise price per Common Share otherwise
issuable upon exercise of such Warrant (the " _Warrant Consideration_ ").



(e) With respect to the Companys 2000 Employee Stock Purchase Plan, as
amended (the " _Purchase Plan_ "), the Company shall (i) take all actions
thereunder to terminate all outstanding options under the Purchase Plan (each,
a " _Purchase Plan Cash Option_ " and collectively, the " _Purchase Plan Cash
Options_ ") at the close of business on the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time (including the refund of all payroll deductions not used to
purchase stock as required by Article 15 of the Purchase Plan) and (ii) in
consideration for such termination, provide each of the
participants thereunder, in lieu of Common Shares that would have otherwise
been issuable upon the exercise of the outstanding Purchase Plan Cash Options,
a cash payment from the Payment Fund, subject to any required withholding of
taxes, equal to the product of (A) the total number of Common Shares the
participant would have otherwise been issued upon the exercise of the Purchase
Plan Cash Options (determined for this purpose by dividing the dollar amount
of the payroll deductions refunded to the participant as provided in clause
(i) above which would have otherwise been eligible to purchase Common Shares
under the Purchase Plan by 85% of the fair market value of a Common Share (as
determined in accordance with the Purchase Plan) on the first business day of
the applicable Payment Period (as defined in the Purchase Plan)) and (B) the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over 85% of the fair market value
of a Common Share on the first business day of the applicable Payment Period
(the " _Purchase Plan Cash Option Consideration_ "); provided, however, that
with respect to any person subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, any
such amount shall be paid as soon as practicable after the first date payment
can be made without liability to such person under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act.



(f) The Company shall (i) take all actions necessary to cause the termination
(effective as of the close of business on the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time) of the rights of each participant in the DSIP who has made an
election under Section 6(d) of the DSIP to defer a grant of Common Shares
under the DSIP (such rights, the " _DSIP Deferred Rights_ ") and (ii) in
consideration for such termination, provide each such participant, in lieu of
Common Shares that would have otherwise been issuable on the Deferred Grant
Date (as defined in the DSIP), a cash payment from the Payment Fund, subject
to any required withholding of taxes, equal to the product of (A) the total
number of Common Shares the participant would have otherwise been issued on
the Deferred Grant Date and (B) the Merger Consideration (the " _DSIP Deferred
Grant Consideration_ "); provided, however, that with respect to any person
subject to Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, any such amount shall be paid
as soon as practicable after the first date payment can be made without
liability to such person under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.



 

6 (g) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions
(including, if appropriate, amending the terms of the relevant Stock Plans or
the Purchase Plan or amending or waiving relevant agreements providing for
vesting conditions on Common Shares or Options therefor) that are necessary to
give effect to the transactions contemplated by this  _Section 2.02_.



(h) Except as otherwise provided herein or agreed to in writing by Merger Sub
and the Company or as may be necessary to administer Options remaining
outstanding following the Effective Time, the Stock Plans and the Purchase
Plan shall terminate effective as of the Effective Time and no participant in
the Stock Plans or the Purchase Plan shall thereafter be granted any rights
thereunder to acquire any equity securities of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation, Infor or any subsidiary of any of the foregoing.



(i) The Company covenants that prior to the Effective Time it will take
all actions necessary under that certain SEC no-action letter, dated January
12, 1999, to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom, to provide that the
cancellation and cash-out and conversion of Cash-Pay Options, the Purchase
Plan Cash Options and the DSIP Deferred Rights, pursuant to this _Section
2.02_ , will qualify for exemption under Rule 16b-3(d) or (e), as applicable,
under the Exchange Act.



2.03 _Payment for Common Shares, Options and Warrants in the Merger_.



(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall appoint a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as exchange and
paying agent, registrar and transfer agent (the " _Agent_ ") for the purpose
of (i) exchanging certificates representing, immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Common Shares for the aggregate Merger Consideration, (ii)
making payment of the aggregate Cash-Pay Option Consideration in exchange for
the cancellation of all Cash-Pay Options, (iii) making payment of the
aggregate Warrant Consideration in exchange for the cancellation of all
Warrants, (iv) making payment of the aggregate Purchase Plan Cash Option
Consideration in exchange for the cancellation of all Purchase Plan Cash
Options, and (v) making payment of the aggregate DSIP Deferred Grant
Consideration in exchange for the cancellation of all DSIP Deferred Rights.
Subject to the Companys obligations to deposit cash in the Payment Fund
described in this _Section 2.03(a)_ , at or prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall deposit, or Merger Sub shall otherwise take all steps
necessary to cause to be deposited, in trust with the Agent for the benefit of
the holders of Common Shares, Cash-Pay Options, Warrants, Purchase Plan Cash
Options and DSIP Deferred Rights, as the case may be, cash in an aggregate
amount equal to (i) the sum of (A) the product of (I) the number of Common
Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in accordance with _Section
2.01(a)_ and (II) the Merger Consideration and (B) the amount necessary for
the payment in full of the Cash-Pay Option Consideration, the Warrant
Consideration, the Purchase Plan Cash Option Consideration and the DSIP
Deferred Grant Consideration less (ii) the amount to be deposited by the
Company as provided in this _Section 2.03(a)_ (such aggregate amount described
in (i) and (ii), together with the amount to be deposited by the Company as
provided in this _Section 2.03(a)_ being hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deposit, or
the Company shall otherwise take all steps necessary to cause to be deposited,
in trust for the benefit of the holders of Common Shares, Cash Pay Options,
Warrants, Purchase Plan Cash Options and DSIP Deferred Rights, as the case may
be, cash in an aggregate amount  



 

7  (subject to the following sentence) of not less than $24 million with the
Agent for deposit into the Payment Fund (the " _Company Cash Deposit_ "),
which deposit shall be used solely and exclusively for purposes of paying the
consideration specified in _Section 2.02_ , and shall not be used to satisfy
any other obligations of the Company or any of its subsidiaries; provided,
however, that the Company shall retain such portion of the Company Cash
Deposit as is necessary for purposes of paying the consideration specified in
_Section 2.02_ to the holders of Cash Pay Options, Purchase Plan Cash
Options, Warrants and DSIP Deferred Rights, which consideration shall be paid
directly by the Company. Without limiting the Companys obligations set forth
in the preceding sentence, the Company shall, as of the Effective Time, have
sufficient unrestricted domestic cash on hand to pay (i) any unpaid Expenses
contemplated by _Section 3.28_ (including, without limitation, those incurred
or which may be incurred by the Financial Advisor and counsel to the Company)
and Expenses incurred in connection with any litigation with respect to,
arising from or related to the Transactions, (ii) any compensation,
remuneration or other amounts which may be payable by the Company in
connection with the Change of Control Agreements (as defined in _Section
3.10_ ) (assuming that each employee of the Company that is a party to a
Change of Control Agreement is terminated without Cause immediately following
the consummation of the Merger) and (iii) the cost of the Tail Policy (as
defined in _Section 5.07_ _(d)_ ), and shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to deposit all other available domestic cash of the Company (taking
into account the reasonable short-term working capital needs of the Company)
with the Agent for deposit into the Payment Fund. For purposes of determining
the aggregate amount of cash to be deposited by Merger Sub pursuant to this
_Section 2.03(a)_ , Merger Sub shall assume that no holder of Common Shares
will perfect their right to appraisal of their Common Shares under the GBCC.
The Agent shall, pursuant to instructions provided by Merger Sub, make the
payments provided for in _Section 2.01_ and _Section 2.02_ of this Agreement
out of the Payment Fund (it being understood that any and all interest earned
on funds made available to the Agent pursuant to this Agreement shall be
turned over to the party depositing such funds with the Agent). The Payment
Fund shall not be used for any other purpose except as provided in this
Agreement.



(b) Promptly after the Effective Time, but in no event later than 10 business
days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Agent
to mail to each record holder of certificates (the " _Certificates_ ") that
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Common Shares (i) a
notice of the effectiveness of the Merger, (ii) a form letter of transmittal
which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and
title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the
Certificates to the Agent, and (iii) instructions for use in surrendering such
Certificates and receiving the Merger Consideration in respect thereof.



(c) Upon surrender to the Agent of a Certificate, together with such letter of
transmittal duly executed and completed in accordance with the instructions
thereto, the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive, within
10 business days after such surrender, in exchange therefor, in the case of
Common Shares (other than Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section
2.01(b)_ ), cash in an amount equal to the product of (i) the number of Common
Shares formerly represented by such Certificate and (ii) the Merger
Consideration, which amounts shall be paid by Agent by check or wire transfer
in accordance with the instructions provided by such holder. No interest or
dividends will be paid or accrued on the consideration payable upon the
surrender of any Certificate. If the consideration provided for



 

8  herein is to be delivered in the name of a person other than the person in
whose name the Certificate surrendered is registered, it shall be a condition
of such delivery that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly
endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the person
requesting such delivery shall pay any transfer or other taxes required by
reason of such delivery to a person other than the registered holder of the
Certificate, or that such person shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered in accordance with the provisions of this  _Section 2.03_ , each
Certificate (other than Certificates representing Dissenting Shares or Common
Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ ) shall represent, for all
purposes, in the case of Certificates representing Common Shares (other than
Common Shares to be canceled pursuant to _Section 2.01(b)_ ), only the right
to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by
the number of Common Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate without
any interest or dividends thereon.



(d) The consideration issued upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance
with this Agreement shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction
of all rights pertaining to such Common Shares formerly represented thereby.
After the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of any Common Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this _Article 2_.



(e) Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any amounts that may be payable
to the former shareholders of the Company in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement) which remains unclaimed by the former shareholders of the Company
upon the 180th day immediately following the Closing Date shall be returned to
the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any former shareholders of the
Company who have not theretofore complied with this _Article 2_ shall, subject
to _Section 2.03(f)_ , thereafter look to the Surviving Corporation only as
general unsecured creditors thereof for payment of any Merger Consideration,
without any interest or dividends thereon, that may be payable in respect of
each Common Share held by such shareholder. Following the Closing, the Agent
shall retain the right to invest and reinvest the Payment Fund on behalf of
the Surviving Corporation in securities listed or guaranteed by the United
States government or certificates of deposit of commercial banks that have, or
are members of a group of commercial banks that has, consolidated total
assets of not less than $500,000,000 and the Surviving Corporation shall
receive the interest earned thereon.



(f) None of Merger Sub, the Company or Agent shall be liable to a holder of
Certificates or any other person in respect of any cash delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificates shall not have been surrendered upon the
seventh anniversary of the Closing Date (or immediately prior to such earlier
date on which any Merger Consideration, dividends (whether in cash, stock or
property) or other distributions with respect to Common Shares in respect of
such Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Authority (as defined in  _Section 3.06(b)_ ), any such shares,
cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such Certificate shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable law, become the property of the Surviving
Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person
previously entitled thereto.



 

9 (g) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,
upon the making of an affidavit (in form and substance acceptable to the
Surviving Corporation) of that fact by the person (who shall be the record
owner of such Certificate) claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or
destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such
person of a bond in such amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof
pursuant to this Agreement.



(h) Each of the Agent, the Surviving Corporation and Infor shall be entitled
to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable to any
holder of Common Shares, Options, Warrants, Purchase Plan Cash Options or
DSIP Deferred Rights pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be
required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the making of such payment
under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any
applicable provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To the extent that
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority by Agent, the Surviving Corporation or Infor, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person
to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY



Except as set forth in the Companys SEC Reports (as defined below) publicly
filed after the filing date of the Companys report on Form 10-K for the

or warranty in this _Article 3_ is expressly qualified by a reference to such
SEC Reports) or in the disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to
Merger Sub and Infor prior to the execution of this Agreement (the " _Company
Disclosure Schedule_ ") (it being agreed that any disclosure set forth on any
particular Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed
disclosed in another Section of the Company Disclosure Schedule if disclosure
with respect to the particular Section is sufficient to make reasonably clear
the relevance of the disclosure to such other Section), the Company represents
and warrants to each of Merger Sub and Infor as of the date hereof and as of
the Effective Time that:



3.01 _Organization and Qualification_. The Company and each of its
subsidiaries (as described in _Section 3.05_ ) is a corporation or limited
liability company, as the case may be, duly organized or formed, as the case
may be, validly existing and in good standing (to the extent applicable) under
the laws of its state or jurisdiction of incorporation or formation, as the
case may be, and has the requisite power and authority to carry on its

standing (to the extent applicable) would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Except
as set forth on _Section 3.01_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company and each of its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a
foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing (to the extent
applicable), in each jurisdiction where the nature of its business makes such
qualification or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so
qualified or licensed and in good standing (to the extent applicable) would
not, individually or in the  



 

10  aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect. As used in this
Agreement, the term " _Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means any

materially adverse to the business, financial condition or results of
operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, other than

Excluded Matters described in clauses (c), (e), (f) or (h) of the following
sentence. As used in this Agreement, " _Excluded Matters_ " means any one or
more of the following effects, events or changes: (a) general changes in

Common Shares, in and of itself, or any change in the financial markets
generally, (c) the effect of any change arising in connection with any "act
of God" including, without limitation, weather, natural disasters and
earthquakes, hostilities, acts of war, sabotage or terrorism or military
actions or any escalation or material worsening of any such hostilities, acts
of war, sabotage or terrorism or military actions, (d) the effect of any
change caused by the taking of any action required or expressly permitted by
this Agreement, (e) the effect of any change caused by the taking of any
action by the Company that has been approved in writing by Parent, Infor or
Merger Sub, (f) any change or effect resulting from a change in accounting
rules or procedures announced by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, the
SEC or any other accounting body with authority to promulgate U.S. generally
accepted accounting principles, (g) resulting from a breach of this Agreement
by Parent, Infor or Merger Sub, (h) resulting from or arising out of any
change in any Law applicable to the Company or its industry or (i) resulting
from the public announcement of the Transactions.



3.02 _Charter Documents and Bylaws_. The Company has heretofore made
available to Merger Sub or its representatives a complete and correct copy of
the articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the Company in full force and
effect as of the date hereof. The Company is not in violation of any of the
provisions of its articles of incorporation or bylaws. The Company has

violation of any of the provisions of its articles of incorporation or bylaws
(or equivalent organizational documents).



3.03  _Capitalization_.



(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 90,000,000 Common

F Junior Participating Preferred Stock pursuant to the Amended and Restated
Rights Agreement, dated as of March 30, 1998, as amended, between the Company
and SunTrust, as rights agent (the " _Rights Agreement_ "). As of the close of

any character relating to the issued or unissued capital stock of the Company
or obligating the Company to issue, transfer or sell any shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, the Company or any subsidiary of the
Company. _Section 3.03(a)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the

agreements or commitments, obligating any subsidiary of the Company to issue,
transfer or sell any shares of its capital stock or other equity interests.

to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock of, or
other equity interests in, the Company or any subsidiary of the Company.

corporate power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to
perform its obligations hereunder and, subject to the adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger by the holders of a majority of the outstanding
Common Shares entitled to vote thereon, to consummate the Transactions
pursuant to the GBCC. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the Merger and the other Transactions have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action and no other
corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to authorize
the Companys execution and delivery of this Agreement or to consummate the  



 

12  Transactions (other than the adoption of this Agreement and the Merger by
the holders of a majority of the outstanding Common Shares entitled to vote
thereon and the filing or recordation of appropriate merger documents as

capital stock or other ownership interest in any Person, except for the
capital stock and/or other ownership interest in another wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Company.



3.06 _No Violation; Required Filings and Consents_.

provision of the articles of incorporation or bylaws or equivalent
organization documents of any subsidiary of the Company, (ii) assuming that

payment under, or give rise to a loss of any benefit to which the Company or
any subsidiary of the Company is entitled under any provision of any
contract, instrument, permit, concession, franchise, license, loan or credit
agreement, note, bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other property agreement,
partnership or joint venture agreement or other legally binding agreement,
whether oral or written (each, a " _Contract_ " and, collectively, "
_Contracts_ "), applicable to the Company or any such subsidiary or their
respective properties or assets or (iv) to the Companys knowledge, result in
the creation or imposition of a lien, claim, security interest or other
charge, title imperfection or encumbrance (each, a " _Lien_ " and,
collectively, " _Liens_ ") on any asset of the Company or any subsidiary of
the Company, except in the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of this
_Section 3.06(a)_ , to the extent that any such conflict, violation, breach,
default, right, loss or Lien would not, individually or in the aggregate, have
a Company Material Adverse Effect. 



 

13 (b) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement does not, and
the performance of this Agreement and the consummation by the Company of the
Transactions will not, require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or notification to, any domestic (federal, state or local)
or foreign government or governmental, regulatory or administrative
authority, agency, commission, board, bureau, court or instrumentality or

_Section 2.02_ and _Section 2.03_ with respect to the Stock Plans and the
Purchase Plan and (iii) where the failure to obtain such consents, approvals,
authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or notifications, would
not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

documents due to be filed at any time on or after September 30, 2001 (the "

party shall affect the representations, warranties or covenants of any party
or the conditions to the obligations of any party hereunder, nor shall it
limit or otherwise affect the remedies available hereunder to the party
receiving such notice.



5.06 _Public Announcements_. Each of the parties hereto agrees that, promptly

5.07  _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(a) The articles of incorporation and the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
shall contain provisions with respect to indemnification, advancement of
expenses and director exculpation as are set forth in the Companys articles
of incorporation and bylaws as in effect at the date hereof (to the extent
consistent with applicable Law), which provisions shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights thereunder of the persons who at any time prior to the Effective Time
were entitled to indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation under
the Companys articles of incorporation or bylaws in respect of actions or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without
limitation, the Transactions), unless otherwise required by applicable Law.



(b) From and after the Effective Time and until 180 days following the
expiration of any statute of limitation applicable to the claim asserted
against an Indemnified Party (as hereafter defined) and for which
indemnification is sought hereunder, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless each person who is or has been prior to
the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Effective Time an officer,
director, employee or agent of the Company (collectively, the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") against all losses, claims, damages, expenses, liabilities or
amounts that are paid in settlement of, or otherwise incurred (" _Losses_ ")
(but only to the extent such Losses are not otherwise covered by insurance and
paid), in connection with any claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or
investigation (a " _Claim_ "), to which any Indemnified Party is or may
become a party to by virtue of his or her service as a present or former
director, officer, employee or agent of the Company and arising out of actual
or alleged events, actions or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred
at or prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, in
connection with or relating to the Transactions), in each case, to the fullest
extent permitted and provided in the Companys articles of incorporation and
bylaws as in effect at the date hereof (and shall pay expenses in advance of
the final disposition of the Claim(s) that are reasonably incurred in
defending any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the
fullest extent permitted under the GBCC as provided in the Companys articles
of incorporation and bylaws as in effect at the date hereof, upon receipt from
the Indemnified Party to whom expenses are advanced of the undertaking to
repay such advances contemplated by the GBCC). 



(c) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
_Section 5.07_ after the Effective Time, upon learning of any such Claim,
shall notify the Surviving Corporation thereof (although the failure to so
notify the Surviving Corporation shall not relieve the Surviving Corporation
from any liability that the Surviving Corporation may have  



 

40  under this _Section 5.07_ , except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices the Surviving Corporation). In the event of any such Claim,
the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to assume the defense thereof
and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable to such Indemnified Party
for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently
incurred by such Indemnified Party in connection with the defense thereof,
except that if the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
if there is an actual or potential conflict of interest between, or different
defenses exist for the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified Party, the
Indemnified Party may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to him or her and
the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel for the Indemnified Party promptly as statements therefor are
received by the Surviving Corporation; provided, however, that (i) the
Surviving Corporation shall not, in connection with any such action or
proceeding or separate but substantially similar actions or proceedings
arising out of the same general allegations, be liable for the fees and
expenses of more than one separate firm of attorneys at any time for all
Indemnified Parties, (ii) the Surviving Corporation and the Indemnified
Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter and (iii) the
Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed; and provided, further, that the Surviving Corporation shall not have
any obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine that the indemnification of
such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited
by applicable Law.



(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall procure a "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
policy (the " _Tail Policy_ ") with terms and conditions reasonably
satisfactory to the Company Board, so long as the cost thereof does not
exceed the amount set forth in _Section 5.07(d)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule in the aggregate, it being agreed that the Company shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain competitive quotes for
such insurance coverage in an effort to reduce the cost thereof and shall
keep Parent, Infor and Merger Sub reasonably informed of the status of the
procurement of the Tail Policy and consult with Parent, Infor and Merger Sub
prior to completing the procurement of the Tail Policy.



(e) This _Section 5.07_  shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
Indemnified Parties referred to herein, their heirs, legal representatives,
successors, assigns and personal representatives and shall be binding on the
Surviving Corporation and its successors and assigns. The provisions of this
_Section 5.07_ are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights to indemnification that the Indemnified Parties, their heirs and
personal representatives may have by contract or otherwise.



(f) If the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each case, as a condition to such
consolidation, merger, transfer or conveyance, proper provision shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume
and agree to perform the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.07_.



 

41 (g) In the event of a conflict between the provisions of this _Section 5.07_
and the provisions of the Companys articles of incorporation and bylaws, as
in effect as of the date hereof, providing for the indemnification of
directors and officers, the provisions of such articles of incorporation and
bylaws shall control.



5.08 _Further Assurances; Reasonable Best Efforts_. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, prior to the Effective Time, the
parties hereto shall use their reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be
taken, all such actions as may be necessary or appropriate in order to
effectuate, as expeditiously as practicable, the Merger and the other
Transactions on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement.

encourage, any effort or attempt by any other Person (other than Merger Sub,
Infor or any of the Purchaser Representatives, as applicable) to make or
effect an Acquisition Proposal or (iii) enter into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding with respect to, or otherwise endorse, any Acquisition
Proposal; provided, however, that nothing contained in this _Section 5.10_
shall prohibit the Company Board or the Special Committee from furnishing
information to, or engaging in discussions or negotiations with, any Person
that makes an unsolicited Acquisition Proposal (which did not result from a
breach of this _Section 5.10_ ) if (A) the Company Board or the Special
Committee determines in good faith after consultation with its independent
outside legal counsel, that such action is necessary for the Company Board to
comply with its fiduciary duties to the Companys shareholders under
applicable Law, (B) the Acquisition Proposal constitutes or would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal (as defined in _Section 5.10(g)_ )
and (C) prior to furnishing such information to, or engaging in discussions
or negotiations with, such Person, the Company receives from such Person an
executed confidentiality agreement (which agreement shall be provided to Infor

material respects, than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement.



(b) From and after the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Article 7_ , if the Company
Board or the Special Committee is entitled to furnish information to, or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, any Person pursuant to _Section
5.10(a)_ , the Company Board may terminate this Agreement in  



 

42  respect of any Acquisition Proposal pursuant to the termination provisions
set forth in _Article 7_ hereof if (A) such Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Superior Proposal and (B) the Company Board, based upon the
recommendation of the Special Committee, shall have determined in good faith
after consultation with independent outside legal counsel, that such action is
necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to the
Companys shareholders under applicable Law.

Infor orally and in writing of the receipt of any Acquisition Proposal or any
inquiry regarding the making of an Acquisition Proposal including any request
for information, the terms and conditions of such request, Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry and the identity of the Person making such request,
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry and (ii) will keep Infor fully informed of
the status and details (including amendments and proposed amendments) of any
such request, Acquisition Proposal or inquiry. Prior to taking any of the
actions referred to in _Section 5.10(a)_ , the Company Board shall promptly
(but in any event within one day) notify Infor orally and in writing of any
action it proposes to take with respect to such Acquisition Proposal. After
taking any such action, the Company Board shall promptly advise Infor orally
and in writing of the status of such action as developments arise or as
requested by Infor. Without limiting the foregoing, at least two days prior to
taking any of the actions referred to in _Section 5.10(b)_ , the Company Board
shall notify Infor of any such action it proposes to take and, during such
two day period, the Company Board or the Special Committee, as applicable,
shall negotiate in good faith with Infor with respect to any revised proposal
to acquire the Common Shares that Infor may make prior to or during such two
day period.

taking, and disclosing to the Companys shareholders, a position contemplated
by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act with regard to

Company in connection with such Acquisition Proposal to return or destroy all
such information in the possession of any such party or its representatives.

10% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or any of its

(d) the term " _subsidiary_ " or " _subsidiaries_ " means, with respect to
any Person, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other legal entity
of which such Person (either alone or through or together with any
other subsidiary), owns, directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the stock
or other equity or beneficial interests, the holders of which are generally
entitled to vote for the election of the board of directors or other governing
body of such corporation or other legal entity.



8.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties hereto agree that, except with
respect to the specific circumstances addressed in _Section 8.01_ hereof,
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were
otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be  



 

55  entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in any
court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled hereunder at law or in
equity.



8.13 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, a party may
(a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other
acts of the other party, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and
warranties of the other party contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) subject to the proviso in
_Section 8.04_ , waive compliance by the other party with any of the
agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on the
part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.



8.14 _Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except for the provisions of _Section 5.07_
, this Agreement is not intended to confer upon any person other than the
parties hereto any rights or remedies.



8.15 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, unless the effects of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability
would prevent the parties from realizing the major portion of the economic
benefits of the Merger that they currently anticipate obtaining therefrom, all
other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain
in full force and effect. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.



8.16 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties hereto submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court sitting in Atlanta,
Georgia in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Agreement and agrees that all claims in respect of the action or proceeding
may be heard and determined in any such court. Each of the parties hereto
also agrees not to bring any action or proceeding arising out of or relating
to this Agreement in any other court. Each of the parties hereto waives any
defense of inconvenient forum to the maintenance of any action or proceeding
so brought and waives any bond, surety, or other security that might be
required of any other party with respect thereto. Any party hereto may make
service on any other party by sending or delivering a copy of the process to
the party to be served at the address and in the manner provided for the
giving of notices in _Section 8.07_ above. Nothing in this _Section 8.16_ ,
however, shall affect the right of any party to serve legal process in any
other manner permitted by law or at equity. Each party hereto agrees that a
final judgment in any action or proceeding so brought shall be conclusive and
may be enforced by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law
or at equity.
