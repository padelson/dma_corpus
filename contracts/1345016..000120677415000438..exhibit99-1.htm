 **This Agreement And Plan of Merger ** (the " _Agreement_ ") is made and
entered into as of February 9, 2015, by and among: **Yelp Inc.,** a Delaware
corporation ("Parent"); **Kale Acquisition Corp.,** a Delaware corporation
and a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub I"); **Quinoa
Acquisition LLC,** a Delaware limited liability company and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub II", and with Merger Sub I, the "Merger
Subs"); **Eat24hours.Com, Inc.,** a Delaware corporation (the "Company");
**Nadav Sharon, Haim Erez, Moran Hacmon, Chen Shashar, Asaf Sharon And Amir
Eisenstein,** each an individual (collectively, the "Major Stockholders") and
**Nadav Sharon,** as the Stockholders Agent (as defined in Section 5.1).
Certain other capitalized terms used in this Agreement are defined in Section
1.4(b) and Exhibit A.

 

Recitals

 

A. Parent, Merger Sub I and the Company intend to effect a merger of Merger
Sub I into the Company (the " _First Step Merger_ ") in accordance with this
Agreement and the Delaware General Corporation Law (the " _DGCL_ ") and, to
the extent applicable, the California General Corporation Law (the " _CGCL_
"). Upon consummation of the First Step Merger, Merger Sub I will cease to
exist, and the Company will become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. 

 

B. As soon as practicable following the First Step Merger, Parent intends to
cause the Company to merge with and into Merger Sub II (the " _Second
Step Merger_ " and, taken together with the First Step Merger, the "
_Integrated Merger_ " or the " _Merger_ "). Upon consummation of the Second
Step Merger, the Company will cease to exist, and Merger Sub II will survive
as wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent. The Integrated Merger is intended to
constitute a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"). Parent and the
Company intend that the First Step Merger and the Second Step Merger will
constitute integrated steps in a single "plan of reorganization" within the
meaning of Treas. Reg. §§1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3, which plan of reorganization
the parties adopt by executing this Agreement.

 

C. Pursuant to the First Step Merger, among other things, and subject to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, all of the issued and outstanding
capital stock of the Company shall be converted into the right to receive the
consideration set forth herein.

 

D. A portion of the consideration payable in connection with the First Step
Merger shall be placed in escrow as security for the indemnification
obligations set forth in this Agreement.

 

E. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent and certain
employees of the Company are executing offer letters, and related
documentation and agreements, in form and substance mutually agreed to by the
parties thereto and delivering their respective countersignatures
thereto (the " _Offer Letters_ ").

 

F. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, each of the Major
Stockholders is executing and delivering to Parent a Non-Competition and Non-
Solicitation Agreement in favor of Parent in form and substance mutually
agreed to by the parties thereto (the " _Non-Competition Agreements_ ").

 

G. The respective boards of directors of Parent, Merger Sub I, Merger Sub II
and the Company have approved this Agreement and the Integrated Merger.

Stockholders shall be entitled to exercise the voting rights of the Escrow
Shares transferred to the Escrow Fund and to receive dividends (if declared)
with respect to such shares (other than non-taxable stock dividends, which
shall be included as part of the Escrow Fund). Parent shall be treated as the
owner of cash in the Escrow Fund for tax purposes until such funds are
disbursed pursuant to this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and all
interest on or other taxable income, if any, earned from the investment of

to Parents right to receive tax distributions in respect of such taxable
income as provided in the Escrow Agreement.

  
 

1.5 Exchange of Certificates.

 

(a) _Closing Deliveries_. At the Closing, the Company shall deliver
certificates for shares of Company Capital Stock (" _Company
Stock Certificates_ ") representing all shares of Company Capital Stock
outstanding as of the Closing, duly endorsed (or accompanied by duly executed
stock powers) and letters of transmittal substantially the form of Exhibit G
attached hereto (a " _Letter of_ _Transmittal_ ") executed by each holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock as of the Closing. The Company Stock
Certificates so delivered shall be canceled as of the Effective Time.
From and after the Effective Time, each Company Stock Certificate which prior
to the Effective Time represented shares of Company Capital Stock shall be
deemed to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration, if
any, payable with respect to such shares, and the holder of each such Company
Stock Certificate shall cease to have any rights with respect to the shares
of Company Capital Stock formerly represented thereby.

 

(b) _Delivery of Merger Consideration_. Promptly after the Effective Time,
subject to receipt of the deliveries required pursuant to Section 1.5(a),
Parent will deliver or, in the case of Parent Class A Common Stock, cause its
transfer agent to deliver, to the holder of shares of Company Capital Stock
as of the Closing: (a) by wire transfer to their respective accounts as
specified in their Letters of Transmittal, the cash amounts to be paid to
such holder at Closing pursuant to Section 1.4(a)(ii) and (b) by mail
to their respective addresses as specified in their Letters of Transmittal,
stock certificates representing the shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to
be issued to such holder at Closing pursuant to Section 1.4(a)(ii)).

 

(c) No dividends or other distributions declared or made with respect to
Parent Class A Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time shall
be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Company Stock Certificate, and no
cash payment in lieu of any fractional share shall be paid to any such
holder, until such holder surrenders such Company Stock Certificate in
accordance with this Section 1.5 (at which time such holder shall be entitled
to receive all such dividends and distributions and such cash payment).

 

(d) No fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock shall be issued in
connection with the Merger, and no certificates for any such fractional
shares shall be issued. In lieu of such fractional shares, any holder of
shares of Company Capital Stock who would otherwise be entitled to receive a
fraction of a share of Parent Class A Common Stock (after aggregating all
fractional shares of Parent Class A Common Stock issuable to such holder)
shall, upon surrender of such holders Company Stock Certificate(s), be paid
in cash the dollar amount (rounded to the nearest whole cent), without
interest, determined by multiplying such fraction by the FMV of Parent Class
A Common Stock.

 

(e) The shares of Parent Class A Common Stock to be issued in the Merger
shall be characterized as "restricted securities" for purposes of Rule 144
under the Securities Act, and each certificate representing any such shares
shall, until such time that the shares are not so restricted under the
Securities Act, bear a legend identical or similar in effect to the following
legend (together with any other legend or legends required by applicable
state securities laws or otherwise, if any): 

  
 

"THE SHARES REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 (THE "ACT") AND MAY NOT BE OFFERED, SOLD OR
OTHERWISE TRANSFERRED, ASSIGNED, PLEDGED OR HYPOTHECATED UNLESS REGISTERED
UNDER THE ACT OR UNLESS AN EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF
THE ACT IS AVAILABLE."

 

(f) _Stock Transfer Books_. As of the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and there shall not be any further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Capital Stock thereafter on
the records of the Company. If, after the Effective Time, Company Stock
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Entity, they shall be canceled
and exchanged for the Merger Consideration, if any, payable with respect to
such shares as provided for in Section 1.4. No interest shall accrue or be
paid on any Merger Consideration payable upon the surrender of a Company
Stock Certificate which immediately before the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock.

 

(g) _Undistributed Payment Funds_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
that remains undistributed to Company Stockholders as of the date that is one
year after the date of this Agreement shall be delivered to Parent upon
demand, and Company Stockholders who have not theretofore surrendered their
Company Stock Certificates in accordance with this Section 1.5 shall
thereafter look only to Parent for satisfaction of their claims for the
Merger Consideration payable with respect to the shares of Company Capital
Stock previously represented by such Company Stock Certificates, without any
interest thereon.

 

(h) _Escheat_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
neither Parent nor any other Person shall be liable to any holder of shares
of Company Capital Stock or to any other Person for any amount paid to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property law, escheat law or
similar Legal Requirement. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by Company
Stockholders shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Legal Requirements,
become the property of Parent free and clear of any Encumbrance.

 

(i) _Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent, Parent, the Interim Surviving
Corporation and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from any consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any security
holder or former security holder of the Company such amounts as required to
be deducted or withheld therefrom or in connection therewith under the Code
or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other
applicable Legal Requirement and shall pay over such amounts to the
Governmental Body as required by any Legal Requirement. To the extent such
amounts are so deducted or withheld and paid over, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the
Person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

 

1.6 Further Action. If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further
action is reasonably determined by Parent to be necessary or desirable to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement or to vest the Surviving Entity
or Parent with full right, title and possession of and to all rights and
property of the Merger Subs and the Company, the managers and officers of the
Surviving Entity and Parent shall be fully authorized (in the name of Merger
Subs, the Interim Surviving Corporation, the Surviving Entity, the Company
and otherwise) to take such action.

 

1.7 Reorganization Status. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall report the
Merger for income tax purposes as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Code, including the filing of the statement required by
Treasury Regulations Section 1.368-3, unless otherwise required by a taxing
authority pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of Section 1313(a)
of the Code; _provided_ , _however_ , even though it is intended by the
parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a "reorganization" within the
meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code and, subject to the proviso in the last
sentence of this Section 1.7, no party hereto shall take any action, or fail
to take any action, which could reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with such intent, the parties make no representations or warranties to each
other or to any holder of Company Capital Stock that the Merger will qualify
as a tax-free "reorganization" under the Code (except for Parents
representations in Section 3.1 that Merger Sub I and Merger Sub II are
wholly-owned subsidiaries of Parent). Parent agrees not to take any action,
and will cause its affiliates not to take any action, which would reasonably
be expected to cause the Merger to fail to qualify as a tax-free
"reorganization," provided, however, that the preceding covenant shall not be
considered to be violated by actions of Parent or its affiliates contemplated
under this Agreement.

agreements that are entered into in the ordinary course of business); and

such Contract are exclusive or non-exclusive.

  
  

(c) _Outbound Licenses_. Part 2.10(c) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately

not currently exercisable and including a right to receive a license) or
interest in, any Acquired Company IP other than: (A) agreements between the
Acquired Company and a third party pursuant to a standard form Acquired
Company IP Contract that has been made available to Parent; and (B) non-
disclosure, evaluation and confidentiality agreements that do not differ
in any substantive way from any standard form Company agreement that has been
made available to Parent. No Acquired Company is bound by, and no Acquired
Company IP is subject to, any Contract containing any covenant or other

Acquired Company IP anywhere in the world.

Acquired Company IP.

(iii) employee agreement containing any assignment or license of Intellectual
Property or Intellectual Property Rights or any confidentiality provision;
(iv) consulting or independent contractor agreement containing any assignment
or license of Intellectual Property or Intellectual Property Rights or any
confidentiality provision; (v) confidentiality or nondisclosure agreement; or
(vi) Acquired Company User Agreement. Part 2.10(e) of the Disclosure Schedule
accurately identifies each Acquired Company IP Contract that deviates in any
material respect from the corresponding standard form agreement delivered to
Parent, including any agreement with an employee, consultant or independent
contractor in which the employee, consultant or independent contractor
expressly reserved or retained any Intellectual Property Rights related to
any Acquired Companys business, research or development.

 

(f) _Ownership Free and Clear_. The Acquired Companies exclusively own
all right, title and interest to and in the Acquired Company IP (other

maintain the rights of any Acquired Company in the Registered IP in order to
avoid abandonment have been validly executed, delivered and filed in a timely
manner with the appropriate Governmental Body.

contractor of any of the Acquired Companies who is or was involved in the

Company IP, for the full term of those Intellectual Property Rights, to an
Acquired Company and confidentiality provisions protecting the Acquired
Company IP;

  
 

(iii) each Acquired Company has taken all reasonable steps to maintain the
confidentiality of and otherwise protect and enforce its rights in all
proprietary trade secret information pertaining to the Acquired Companies
other than with regard to proprietary information for which Company has
decided to disclose in Registered IP; and 

 

(iv) the Acquired Companies own or otherwise have sufficient rights in, and
immediately after the Closing the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
will continue to own or otherwise have sufficient rights in, all Intellectual
Property Rights needed to conduct the business of the Acquired Companies as
currently conducted.

 

(g) _Valid and Enforceable_. None of the issued Registered IP is invalid
or unenforceable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

 

(i) no trademark or trade name used by an Acquired Company conflicts or
interferes with any trademark or trade name owned, used or applied for by any
other Person, and each Acquired Company has taken reasonable steps to police
the use of its trademarks; 

 

(ii) Part 2.10(g)(ii) of the Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies and
describes each action, filing, and payment that must be taken or made on or
before the date that is 120 days after the date of this Agreement in order to

(iii) no interference, opposition, reissue, reexamination or other Legal
Proceeding (other than a Legal Proceeding brought by a Governmental Body in
the ordinary course of prosecution or registration of Registered IP) is
pending or, threatened in writing (or, to the Knowledge of the Company, not
in writing), in which the scope, validity or enforceability of any Registered
IP is being contested or challenged. To the Knowledge of the Company, there
is no basis for a claim that any Acquired Company IP is invalid or
unenforceable.

 

(h) _No Third Party Infringement of Acquired Company IP_. To The Knowledge of
the Company, no Person has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated,
and no Person is currently infringing, misappropriating or otherwise
violating, any Acquired Company IP. Part 2.10(h) of the Disclosure Schedule
accurately identifies (and the Company has made available to Parent a
complete and accurate copy of) each letter or other written or electronic
communication or correspondence that has been sent by or to any Acquired
Company or any representative of any Acquired Company to any Person regarding
any actual, alleged or suspected infringement or misappropriation of any
Acquired Company IP.

 

(i) _Effects of This Transaction_. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance of this Agreement or any other agreements referred to in this
Agreement nor the consummation of any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement or any such other agreement will, with or without notice or
lapse of time, result in, or give any other Person the right or option to
cause or declare: (i) a loss of, or Encumbrance on, any Acquired Company IP;
(ii) a breach of or default under any Acquired Company IP Contract; (iii) the
release, disclosure or delivery of any Acquired Company IP by or to any
escrow agent or other Person; or (iv) the grant, assignment or transfer to
any other Person of any license or other right or interest under, to or in
any of the Acquired Company IP.

  
 

(j) _No Infringement of Third Party IP Rights_. No Acquired Company has ever
infringed (directly, contributorily, by inducement or
otherwise), misappropriated or otherwise violated or made unlawful use of any
Intellectual Property Right of any other Person. No Acquired Company Software

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against any Acquired
Company or against any other Person to the extent any Acquired Company has an
obligation to indemnify such Person;

 

(ii) no Acquired Company has ever received any written notice or other
written communication relating to any actual, alleged or suspected
infringement, misappropriation or violation by any Acquired Company, any

written communication suggesting or offering that any Acquired Company obtain
a license to any Intellectual Property Right of another Person; and

 

(iii) no Acquired Company is bound by any Contract to indemnify, defend, hold
harmless or reimburse any other Person with respect to, or otherwise assumed
or agreed to discharge or otherwise take responsibility for, any existing or
potential intellectual property infringement, misappropriation or similar
claim (other than indemnification provisions in the Acquired Companies
standard forms of Acquired Company IP Contracts).

Specified Representations shall survive the Effective Time until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (including any extensions thereof)
applicable to a third party claim, or to a Governmental Body bringing a Legal
Proceeding, that, if successful, would constitute an inaccuracy in or breach
of such Specified Representation as of the date of this Agreement or as of
the Closing; _provided, however,_ that if, at any time prior to the
applicable expiration date referred to in this sentence, any Indemnitee
delivers to the Stockholders Agent a written notice alleging the existence
of an inaccuracy in or a breach of any of such Specified Representations and
asserting a claim for recovery under Section 4.2 based on such alleged
inaccuracy or breach, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive
the Termination Date until such time as such claim is fully and
finally resolved.

 

(c) _Parent Representations_. All representations and warranties made
by Parent and Merger Subs shall terminate and expire as of the Effective
Time, and any liability of Parent or Merger Subs with respect to such
representations and warranties shall thereupon cease.

 

(d) _Willful Misconduct; Fraud_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in Section 4.1(a) or Section 4.1(b), the limitations set
forth in Section 4.1(a) and 4.1(b) shall not apply in the case of claims
based upon fraud or willful misconduct (collectively " _Fraud_ ").

 

(e) _Representations Not Limited_. The representations, warranties, covenants
and obligations of the Company, and the rights and remedies that may be
exercised by the Indemnitees, shall not be limited or otherwise affected by
or as a result of any information furnished to, or any investigation made by
or knowledge of, any of the Indemnitees or any of their Representatives.

 

(f) _Disclosure Schedule_. For purposes of this Agreement, each statement or
other item of information set forth in the Disclosure Schedule or in
any update to the Disclosure Schedule shall be deemed to be a representation
and warranty made by the Company in this Agreement.

   

4.2 Indemnification. 

 

(a) _Indemnification_. From and after the Effective Time (but subject to
Section 4.1), each Major Stockholder (collectively, the " _Indemnitors_ "),
severally and not jointly and _pro rata_ based upon the amount of Merger
Consideration payable to such stockholder (as compared with the Merger
Consideration payable to all Major Stockholders), shall hold harmless
and indemnify each of the Indemnitees from and against, and shall compensate
and reimburse each of the Indemnitees for, any Damages which are suffered
or incurred by any of the Indemnitees or to which any of the Indemnitees
otherwise become subject (regardless of whether or not such Damages relate to
any third party claim) (it being understood that while the Indemnitees may
bring a claim for Damages they may suffer or incur or to which they may
become subject, the Indemnitees shall not recover any such Damages until such
Damages are actually suffered or incurred, or to which the Indemnitee has
actually become subject) and which arise from or as a result of:

 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty made by the
Company in this Agreement (other than representations or warranties related
to Taxes or Tax Returns to the extent the subject matter of claim is the
subject of Section 4.2(a)(iii), which claim shall be brought pursuant to
Section 4.2(a)(iii));

 

(ii) any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or warranty set forth
in the Merger Consideration Certificate or the Working Capital Certificate;

 

(iii) any matter referred to on  _Schedule 4.2(a)(iii);_

 

(iv) any claim by any securityholder of the Company in his/her/its capacity
as a securityholder with respect to events or circumstances occurring prior
to or as of the Effective Time (including claims with respect to (A) the
authorization or approval of the Merger or (B) the distribution of the Merger
Consideration to the extent that Parent makes payments in accordance with the
Merger Consideration Certificate and pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
and the Escrow Agreement);

 

(v) any (A) Taxes of any of the Acquired Companies attributable to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period ("Pre-Closing Taxes"); (B) employment or other payroll
Taxes imposed on the Company in connection with payments to holders of any
compensation payments occurring by reason of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement; and (C) Liability for the payment of any amounts as a result
of any obligation to indemnify any other Person, or any successor or
transferee Liability, in respect of any of the items described in clauses (A)
and (B) except to the extent, in each case, that such Taxes or Liability were
taken into account as a current liability in the calculation of Net Working
Capital (or to the extent the subject matter of claim is the subject of
Schedule 4.2(a)(iii), in which case such claim shall be brought pursuant to
Section 4.2(a)(iii));

 

(vi) any Fraud committed by the Company in connection with this Agreement or
the transactions contemplated hereby; and

 

(vii) subject to Section 4.5(d), third party claims against the Indemnitees
following the Closing, whether or not it is determined that there was a
breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty or any other matter
specified in Section 4.2(a)(i) as a basis for indemnification under this
Agreement, if the facts and circumstances alleged in such third party claim
would give the Indemnitees a right to indemnification under Section 4.2(a)(i)
assuming for this purpose that such facts and circumstances are accurate and
the claims made therein are recoverable by the third party claimant(s) in
accordance therewith; provided, however, that subject to Section 4.5(d),
Indemnitees shall be entitled to recover only 50% of Damages paid, incurred,
suffered or sustained by them resulting from or arising out of such third
party claim unless the Indemnitees recover for such claim pursuant to Section
4.2(a)(i).

  
 

(b) _Damage to Parent_. The parties acknowledge and agree that, if the
Surviving Entity suffers, incurs or otherwise becomes subject to any Damages
as a result of or in connection with any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or obligation, then (without limiting any
of the rights of the Surviving Entity as an Indemnitee) Parent shall also be
deemed, by virtue of its ownership of the stock of the Surviving Entity, to
have incurred Damages as a result of and in connection with such inaccuracy
or breach.

 

4.3 Other Limitations. 

 

(a) _Threshold_. Subject to Section 4.3(b), the Indemnitors will not have any
obligation to indemnify the Indemnitees for any Damages pursuant to this
Section 4 unless and until the aggregate amount of all Damages in respect of
which the Indemnitors are otherwise entitled to indemnification pursuant to
this Section 4 exceeds an amount equal to $1,000,000 (the " _Threshold_ ") at
which point the Indemnitors shall be entitled to indemnification for the
entire amount of Damages, including the Threshold.

 

(b) _Applicability of Threshold_. The limitations set forth in Section 4.3(a)
shall not apply: (i) in the case of Fraud; (ii) to inaccuracies in or
breaches of any of the Specified Representations; (iii) to the matters
referred to in Sections 4.2(a)(ii), 4.2(a)(iii), 4.2(a)(iv), 4.2(a)(v) and
4.2(a)(vi); or (iv) to the matters referred to in Section 4.2(a)(vii) (to the
extent related to breaches of any of the Specified Representations).

 

(c) _Recourse to Escrow_.

 

(i) Subject to Section 4.3(d), recourse by the Indemnitees to the
Escrow Property shall be the Indemnitees sole and exclusive remedy for
monetary Damages resulting from the matters referred to in Section 4.2.

 

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
total amount of indemnification payments that any of the Indemnitors can be
required to make to the Indemnitees pursuant to item 1 of Schedule
4.2(a)(iii) shall be limited to such Indemnitors pro rata portion of
$1,000,000 (based on the pro rata portion of the Merger Consideration payable
to all Indemnitors). 

 

(iii) The Indemnitees first source of recovery for indemnification
claims under Section 4.2 shall be recourse against the Escrow Property (and
the Stockholders Agent may elect, or if no such election is made, Parent may
elect, whether recovery from the Escrow Fund for such claims is in the form
of Escrow Shares, Escrow Cash or a combination thereof, so long as the full
amount of the indemnification obligation is satisfied); claims may only be
made directly against the Indemnitors (to the extent such claims are not
limited to the Escrow Property pursuant to Section 4.3(c)(i)) when the
aggregate value of pending indemnification claims exceeds the value of Escrow
Property then held in the Escrow Fund (and then only to the extent of
excess).

 

(iv) For purposes of this Section 4, each Escrow Share shall be deemed to
have a per share value equal to the average of the closing price of Parent
Class A Common Stock for the 30 consecutive trading days ending on the
trading day immediately before the date satisfaction of a claim for
indemnification hereunder, subject to appropriate adjustments for stock
splits, combinations or similar corporate events affecting the shares of
Parent Class A Common Stock.

 

(d) _Applicability of Liability Cap_. The limitations set forth in Section
4.3(c)(i) shall not apply: (i) in the case of Fraud; or (ii) to inaccuracies
in or breaches of any of the Specified Representations. Except in the case
of Fraud committed by such Indemnitor, the total amount of indemnification
payments that any of the Indemnitors can be required to make to the
Indemnitees pursuant to Section 4.2 shall be limited to the portion of
the Merger Consideration received by such Indemnitor.

  
 

(e) _Other Limitations_. 

 

(i) This Section 4 shall constitute the exclusive remedy after the
Closing for recovery of Damages by the Indemnitees pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement, except in the case of claims for Fraud
against the Indemnitor committing such Fraud; _provided_ , _however_ ,
subject to the limitations set forth herein, nothing in this Agreement shall
limit the rights or remedies of any Indemnitee (A) to specific performance,
injunctive and other equitable relief or (B) pursuant to any other agreement
executed by an Indemnitor.

 

(ii) The amount of any Damages for which indemnification is provided
under this Section 4 shall be net of any amounts actually recovered by the
Indemnitee under insurance policies with respect to such Damages (net of any
costs to recover such insurance payments and the costs of any increased
premiums to the extent resulting therefrom); provided that Parent shall only
have the obligation to seek insurance recovery to the extent commercially
reasonable in light of the circumstances and only with respect to insurance
policies obtained by the Company prior to the Closing for which premiums were
paid in full prior to the Closing.

 

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, under no circumstances will either Party be liable to the other
for any punitive or exemplary damages (except to the extent such punitive or
exemplary damages are awarded to a third party pursuant to a third party
claim).

 

(iv) To the extent required by applicable Legal Requirements, the Indemnitee
shall act in good faith and a commercially reasonable manner to mitigate any
Damages they may pay, incur, suffer or sustain for which indemnification is
available hereunder.

 

(v) For the avoidance of doubt and in order to prevent duplication of
payment by the Indemnitors, the Indemnitors will not have any obligation to
indemnify the Indemnitees for any Damages pursuant to this Section 4 to the
extent that such Damages were previously included in calculating the Closing
Date Net Working Capital or Working Capital Adjustment.

 

4.4 No Contribution. Each Indemnitor waives, and acknowledges and agrees that
he shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or
assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or
remedy against any Merger Sub or any of the Acquired Companies in connection
with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to which he may
become subject under or in connection with this Agreement or any
other agreement or document delivered to Parent in connection with this
Agreement. 

 

4.5 Defense of Third Party Claims. In the event of the assertion or
commencement by any third party of any claim or Legal Proceeding (whether
against any Merger Sub, any of the Acquired Companies, Parent or any other
Person) with respect to which any Indemnitor may become obligated to hold
harmless, indemnify, compensate or reimburse any Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 4, Parent shall have the right, at its election, to proceed with the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding on its own with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Stockholders Agent. If Parent so proceeds with the
defense of any such claim or Legal Proceeding:

 

 **(a)  **subject to the other provisions of Section 4, all reasonable
expenses relating to the defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding shall be
borne and paid exclusively by the Indemnitors to the extent the Indemnitors
are obligated to indemnify under this Section 4 for such claim or Legal
Proceeding;

  
 

(b) each Indemnitor shall make available to Parent any documents
and materials in his possession or control that may be necessary to the
defense of such claim or Legal Proceeding;

 

(c) The Stockolders Agent shall have the right, in its discretion and at
its or the Major Stockholders own expense, to participate in, but not
control, the defense of such claim, and Parent shall keep the Stockolders
Agent reasonably informed as to the defense of such claim; and

 

(d) Parent shall have the right to settle, adjust or compromise such claim
or Legal Proceeding; _provided, however,_ that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the last paragraph of Section 4.2(a)(vii) or Section 4.5, if
Parent settles, adjusts or compromises any such claim or Legal Proceeding
without the consent of the Stockholders Agent (it being understood that if
Parent requests that the Stockholders Agent consent to a
settlement, adjustment or compromise, the Stockholders Agent shall not
unreasonably withhold or delay such consent), such settlement, adjustment or
compromise shall not be conclusive evidence of the amount of Damages incurred
by the Indemnitee in connection with such claim or Legal Proceeding or
whether the Indemnitors are obligated to indemnify the Indemnitors under this
Section 4 for such claim or Legal Proceeding.

 

Parent shall give the Stockholders Agent prompt written notice of the
commencement of any such Legal Proceeding against Parent, any Merger Sub or
any of the Acquired Companies;  _provided, however_ , that any failure on the
part of Parent to so notify the Stockholders Agent shall not limit any of
the obligations of the Indemnitors under Section 4 (except to the extent such
failure materially prejudices the defense of such Legal Proceeding). If
Parent does not elect to proceed with the defense of any such claim or Legal
Proceeding, the Stockholders Agent may proceed with the defense of such
claim or Legal Proceeding with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent;
_provided, however,_ that the Stockholders Agent may not settle, adjust or
compromise any such claim or Legal Proceeding without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent may not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed).

 

4.6 Tax Matters. The parties agree to treat any indemnification payment made
under this Article 4 as an adjustment to the Merger Consideration for all
purposes, including, to the extent permitted under applicable Tax Law, all
federal, state, local and foreign Tax purposes, and the parties agree to, and
shall cause their respective affiliates to, file their Tax Returns
accordingly.

Agent, in its sole and absolute direction, may consider necessary or proper
or convenient in connection with or to carry out the activities described in
paragraphs (i) through (v) above and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby. 

  
 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
or in any other agreement executed in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby: (i) each Indemnitee shall be entitled to deal
exclusively with the Stockholders Agent on all matters relating to any claim
for indemnification, compensation or reimbursement under Section 4 or under
the Escrow Agreement; and (ii) each Indemnitee shall be entitled to rely
conclusively (without further evidence of any kind whatsoever) on any
document executed or purported to be executed on behalf of any Indemnitor by
the Stockholders Agent, and on any other action taken or purported to be
taken on behalf of any stockholder by the Stockholders Agent, as fully
binding upon such stockholder.

 

(d) In dealing with this Agreement and any instruments, agreements or
documents relating thereto, and in exercising or failing to exercise all or
any of the powers conferred upon the Stockholders Agent hereunder or
thereunder, (i) the Stockholders Agent will not assume any, and will incur
no, responsibility whatsoever to any Indemnitors by reason of any error in
judgment or other act or omission performed or omitted hereunder or in
connection with this Agreement or any other agreement contemplated hereby,
unless by the Stockholders Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct,
and (ii) the Stockholders Agent will be entitled to rely on the advice of
counsel, public accountants or other independent experts experienced in the
matter at issue, and any error in judgment or other act or omission of the
Stockholders Agent pursuant to such advice will in no event subject the

Stockholders Agents gross negligence or willful misconduct. The Indemnitors
shall indemnify the Stockholders Agent and hold the Stockholders Agent
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Stockholders Agents
duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses of any legal
counsel retained by the Stockholders Agent.

(f) _Replacement_. If the Stockholders Agent shall die, resign, become
disabled or otherwise be unable to fulfill his responsibilities hereunder,
the Indemnitors shall (by consent of those Persons entitled to at least a
majority of the Merger Consideration), within 10 days after such death,
disability or inability, appoint a successor to the Stockholders Agent (who
shall be reasonably satisfactory to Parent) and immediately thereafter notify
Parent of the identity of such successor. Any such successor shall succeed
the Stockholders Agent as Stockholders Agent hereunder. If for any reason
there is no Stockholders Agent at any time, all references herein to the
Stockholders Agent shall be deemed to refer to the Indemnitors.

 

5.2 Further Assurances. Each party hereto shall execute and cause to be
delivered to each other party hereto such instruments and other documents,
and shall take such other actions, as such other party may reasonably request
(prior to, at or after the Closing) for the purpose of carrying out
or evidencing any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

5.3 Tax Matters.

 

(a) The Stockholders Agent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, at the
expense of the Company Stockholders, and shall timely file, or cause to be
timely filed, all Tax Returns for the Company that are required to be filed
after the Closing Date for any Tax period ending on or prior to the Closing
Date with respect to which the items of income, gain, loss, deduction and
other Tax items pass through to the Company Stockholders (the " _Income
Tax Returns_ "). All Income Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with
applicable Law and consistent with past practices. Each Income Tax Return
shall be provided to Parent for its review and comment at least fifteen (15)
days prior to the due date for filing, and the Stockholders Agent shall
consider in good faith such revisions as are reasonably requested by Parent.
The Company Stockholders shall be solely responsible for and shall timely pay
when due any Taxes of the Company Stockholders in connection with the Income
Tax Returns.

  
 

(b) Parent shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely
filed, all Tax Returns other than Income Tax Returns for the Company required
to be filed after the Closing Date, and shall timely remit, or cause to be
remitted, to the appropriate Governmental Body all Taxes reflected on such
Tax Returns, subject to its right to be indemnified for Pre-Closing Taxes
pursuant to Article IV. To the extent such Tax Returns include any Pre-
Closing Tax Period, (i) such Tax Returns shall be prepared consistent with
the past practices of the Company, as applicable, in all material respects,
except as otherwise required by applicable law and (ii) any such Tax Return
that reports any tax for which indemnification is required under this
Agreement, along with a statement setting forth the amount of Taxes for which
the Company Stockholders are responsible with respect thereto, shall be
provided to the Stockholders Agent for its review and comment at least
fifteen (15) days prior to the due date for filing such Tax Return,
and Parent shall consider in good faith such revisions as are reasonably
requested by the Stockholders Agent.

 

(c) All liability for transfer, sales, use, value added, excise, stamp,
recording, registration and any similar Taxes that become payable in
connection with consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be borne by the Company Stockholders,
on the one hand, and the Parent, on the other hand. The party required by law
to file to file a Tax Return with respect to such Transfer Taxes shall do so
in the time and manner prescribed by law, and the non-filing party shall
promptly reimburse the filing party for its share of any Transfer Taxes upon
receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory to the non-filing party of the
amount of such Transfer Taxes.

 

(d) The Company and the Company Stockholders on one hand, and Parent on the
other, shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns and any audit,
examination, claim, dispute or controversy by any Governmental Body relating
to Taxes (including the Tax-related matters referred to in Section
4.2(a)(iii) (each a " _Tax Contest_ "). Parent shall promptly notify the
Stockholders Agent upon receipt by Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
(including the Company after the Closing Date) of written notice of any Tax
Contest with respect to an Income Tax Return or relating to Pre-Closing
Taxes, _provided_ , that the failure to promptly deliver any such notice will
not relieve the Company Stockholders of their obligations under this
Agreement, except to the extent the Stockholders are materially prejudiced as
a result thereof. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
in the case of any Tax Contest concerning an Income Tax Return , the
Stockholders Agent shall have the right, at the expense of the Company
Stockholders, using the counsel and representatives of the Stockholders
Agents choice, to represent the interests of the Company in such Tax Contest
and control the conduct of such Tax Contest, provided, however, Parent shall
have the right to participate at its own expense in any proceeding, or
portion thereof, relating to the Company that the Stockholders Agent
controls. All other Tax Contests shall be governed by Section 4.5. In the
event of any inconsistency between this Section 5.3 and Section 4.5, this
Section 5.3 shall govern.

 

(e) Parent shall not amend or cause to be amended any Tax Return of the
Company (or file any new Tax Return) for any Pre-Closing Tax Period
(including the portion of any Tax Return for a tax period that includes but
does not end on the Closing Date that relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period)
if such amendment (or new filing) would result in an increase of Taxes of the
Company Stockholders or for which Parent is indemnified pursuant to this
Agreement, without the written consent of the Stockholders Agent, such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. For the
avoidance of doubt, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, Parent and the Company shall not file any IRS Form 1099-K for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period unless such filing is required by a Governmental Body
in connection with a Tax Contest.

  
 

5.4 Fees and Expenses. Subject to Sections 1.4, 1.9 and Article 4, the
Escrow Agreement and _Exhibit F_ , each party to this Agreement shall bear
and pay all fees, costs and expenses that have been incurred or that are
incurred in the future by such party in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including all fees, costs and expenses
incurred by such party in connection with or by virtue of: (a)
the negotiation, preparation and review of this Agreement (including the
Disclosure Schedule) and all agreements, certificates, opinions and other
instruments and documents delivered or to be delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (b) the preparation and
submission of any filing or notice required to be made or given in connection
with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and the
obtaining of any Consent required to be obtained in connection with any of
such transactions; and (c) the consummation of the Merger. _ _

 

5.5 Attorneys Fees. Subject to Section 4.2 and Section 4.5, if any Legal
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the enforcement of any provision of
this Agreement is brought against any party hereto, each party shall be
responsible for its own attorneys fees.

 

5.6 Notices. Any notice or other communication required or permitted to be
delivered to any party under this Agreement shall be in writing and shall be
deemed properly delivered, given and received: (a) if delivered by hand, when
delivered; (b) if sent via facsimile with confirmation of receipt, when
transmitted and receipt is confirmed; (c) if sent by electronic mail,
telegram, cablegram or other electronic transmission, upon delivery; (d) if
