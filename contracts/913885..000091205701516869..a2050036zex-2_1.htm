 1.2 _Effective Time; Closing._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Florida in accordance with the relevant provisions of Florida Law (the "Articles of Merger") (the time of such filing (or such later time as may be agreed in writing by Company and Parent and specified in the Articles of Merger) being the "Effective Time") as soon as practicable on or after the Closing Date (as hereinafter defined). Unless the context otherwise requires, the term "Agreement" as used herein refers collectively to this Agreement and Plan of Reorganization and the Articles of Merger. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of Wilson Sonsini Goodrich and Rosati, Professional Corporation, at a time and date to be specified by the parties, which shall be no later than the third business day after the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI, or at such other time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing (the "Closing Date"). 

  

 1.3 _Effect of the Merger._ At the Effective Time, the effect of the Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions of Florida Law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

 (a) The Bylaws of Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be, at the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended. 

  

  

 1.5 _Directors and Officers._ The initial directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly appointed. 

  

 1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, Company or the holders of any of the following securities: 

  

  

 (a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Common Stock, $0.0005 par value per share, of Company (the "Company Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant

Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of the Parent (the "Parent
Common Stock") upon surrender of the certificate representing such share of
Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7 (or in the case of
a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit (and
bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 1.9). If any shares of
Company Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are
unvested or are subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other
condition under any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement with the Company, then the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in
exchange for such shares of Company Common Stock will also be unvested and
subject to the same repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition,
and the certificates representing such shares of Parent Common Stock may
accordingly be marked with appropriate legends. The Company shall take all
action that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or other right
set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement.

  

 (b) _Cancellation of Parent-Owned and Company-Held Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock held by Company or owned by Merger Sub, Parent or any direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Company or of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion thereof. 

  

 (c) _Stock Options; Employee Stock Purchase Plans._ At the Effective Time, all options to purchase Company Common Stock then outstanding under Company\'s 1983 Stock Option Plan (the "1983 Plan"), Company\'s Second Stock Option Plan (the "1996 Plan"), Company\'s Stock Option Plan for Acquired Companies (the "1998 Plan") and Company\'s 1996 Stock Purchase Plan (the "1996 ESPP", and together with the 1983 Plan, the 1996 Plan and the 1998 Plan, the "Company Stock Option Plans") shall be assumed by Parent in accordance with Section 5.8 hereof. Rights outstanding under Company\'s 1996 ESPP shall be treated as set forth in Section 5.8. 

  

 (d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub._ Each share of Common Stock, $0.001 par value per share, of Merger Sub (the "Merger Sub Common Stock") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of Common Stock, $0.0005 par value per share, of the Surviving Corporation. Each certificate evidencing ownership of shares of Merger Sub Common Stock shall evidence ownership of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 (e) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio._ The Exchange Ratio shall be adjusted to reflect appropriately the effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock occurring on or after the date hereof and prior to the Effective Time. 

  

 (f) _Fractional Shares._ No fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof each holder of shares of Company Common Stock who would otherwise be entitled to a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after aggregating all fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that otherwise would be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i) such fraction, multiplied by (ii) the average of the closing price of the Parent Common Stock on the Nasdaq National Market ("NASDAQ") on the two trading days immediately preceding the Effective Time. 

  

  1.7 _Surrender of Certificates._

  

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent._ Parent shall select a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to Company to act as the exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the Merger. 

  

 (b) _Parent to Provide Common Stock._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall make available to the Exchange Agent for exchange in accordance with this Article I, the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to Section 1.6 in exchange for outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, and cash in an amount sufficient for payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions to which holders of shares of Company Common Stock may be entitled pursuant to Section 1.7(d). 

  

 (c) _Exchange Procedures._ Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates (the "Certificates"), which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were converted into shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.6, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d), (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and shall contain such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash in lieu of any fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or other distributions pursuant to Section 1.7(d). Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock into which their shares of Company Common Stock were converted at the Effective Time, payment in lieu of fractional shares which such holders have the right to receive pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, subject to Section 1.7(d) as to the payment of dividends, to evidence only the ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such shares of Company Common Stock shall have been so converted and the right to receive an amount in cash in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d). 

  

 (d) _Distributions With Respect to Unexchanged Shares._ No dividends or other distributions declared or made after the date of this Agreement with respect to Parent Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Certificates with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock represented thereby until the holders of record of such Certificates shall surrender such Certificates. Subject to applicable law, following surrender of any such Certificates, the Exchange Agent shall deliver to the record holders thereof, without interest, certificates representing whole shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor along with payment in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.6(f) hereof and the amount of any such dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock. 

  

 (e) _Transfers of Ownership._ If certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock are to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificates surrendered in exchange therefor are registered, it will be a condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificates so surrendered will be 

  

    

 properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
persons requesting such exchange will have paid to Parent or any agent
designated by it any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the
issuance of certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock in any
name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificates surrendered,
or established to the satisfaction of Parent or any agent designated by it
that such tax has been paid or is not payable.

  

 (f) _Required Withholding._ Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having been paid to the person to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid. 

  

 (g) _No Liability._ Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 1.7, neither the Exchange Agent, Parent, the Surviving Corporation nor any party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock for any amount properly paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law. 

  

  

 1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All shares of Parent Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid in respect thereof pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and 1.7(d)) shall be deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If after the Effective Time Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article I. 

   

 1.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates._ In the event that any Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock into which the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificates were converted pursuant to Section 1.6, cash for fractional shares, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 1.6(f) and any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 1.7(d); _provided, however,_ that Parent may, in its discretion and as a condition precedent to the issuance of such certificates representing shares of Parent Common Stock, cash and other distributions, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. 

  

 1.10 _Tax and Accounting Consequences._

  

  

 (a) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368 of the Code. The parties hereto adopt this Agreement as a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and 1.368-3(a) of the United States Income Tax Regulations. 

   

 (b) It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger shall be treated as a pooling of interest for accounting purposes as set forth in APB 16\. 

  

  

 1.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action._ If, at any time after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of Company and Merger Sub, the officers and directors of Company and Merger Sub will take all such lawful and necessary action. Parent shall cause Merger Sub to perform all of its obligations relating to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby. 

      

    
ARTICLE II 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF COMPANY 

  

 Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub, subject to such exceptions as are specifically disclosed in writing in the disclosure letter (referencing the appropriate section and paragraph numbers) delivered by Company to Parent on or prior to the date of this Agreement and certified by a duly authorized officer of Company (the "Company Disclosure Letter"), as follows: 

  

 2.1 _Organization and Qualification; Subsidiaries._ Each of Company and its subsidiaries is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation and has the requisite corporate power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and properties and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted. Company has delivered to Parent a complete and correct list of all of Company\'s direct and indirect subsidiaries as of the date of this Agreement, indicating the jurisdiction of organization of each subsidiary and Company\'s equity interest therein. Each of Company and its subsidiaries is in possession of all franchises, grants, authorizations, licenses, permits, easements, consents, certificates, approvals and orders ("Approvals") necessary to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate or lease and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect (as defined in Section 8.3(c)) on Company. Each of Company and its subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as a foreign corporation to do business, and is in good standing, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not, either individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Company. Other than wholly owned subsidiaries, Company does not directly or indirectly own any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for, any equity or similar interest in, any corporation, partnership, joint venture or other business, association or entity. 

  

 2.2 _Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws._ The Company has previously furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Company and equivalent organizational documents of each of its subsidiaries, as amended to date.

 (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties agrees to use all reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all reasonable acts necessary to cause the conditions precedent set forth in Article VI to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations, declarations and filings (including registrations, declarations and filings with Governmental Entities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to avoid any suit, claim, action, investigation or proceeding by any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers from third parties, (iv) the defending of any suits, claims, actions, investigations or proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed and (v) the execution or delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement. In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to the Merger, this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, use all reasonable efforts to ensure that the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to minimize the effect of such statute or regulation on the Merger, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Parent or Company or any subsidiary or affiliate thereof to agree to any divestiture by itself or any of its affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property, or the imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to conduct their businesses or to own or exercise control of such assets, properties and stock. 

  

     

  

 (b) Company shall give prompt notice to Parent of any representation or warranty made by it contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any failure of Company to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.3(a) or 6.3(b) could not be satisfied, _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

  

 (c) Parent shall give prompt notice to Company of any representation or warranty made by it or Merger Sub contained in this Agreement becoming untrue or inaccurate in any material respect, or any failure of Parent or Merger Sub to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it under this Agreement, in each case, such that the conditions set forth in Section 6.2(a) or 6.2(b) could not be satisfied, _provided, however_ , that no such notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement. 

  

  

 5.7 _Third Party Consents._ As soon as practicable following the date hereof, Parent and Company will each use all reasonable efforts to obtain any consents, waivers and approvals under any of its or its subsidiaries\' respective agreements, contracts, licenses or leases required to be obtained in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or necessary to enable the surviving corporation to conduct and operate the business of Company and its subsidiaries substantially as presently conducted and as contemplated to be conducted. 

  

 5.8 _Stock Options and 1996 ESPP._

  

  

 (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock under Company\'s Stock Option Plans, whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested, shall by virtue of the Merger and without any further action on the part of Company or the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent, all outstanding options under the Company Stock Option Plans (each a "Company Stock Option" and collectively the "Company Stock Options"), whether or not exercisable and whether or not vested, shall, and without any further action on the part of the Company or the holder thereof, be assumed by Parent, in such manner (with respect to all such option assumptions) that Parent (i) is "assuming a stock option in a transaction to which Section 424(a) applied" within the meaning of Section 424(a) of the Code, or (ii) to the extent that Section 424 of the Code does not apply to any such Company Stock Options, would be a transaction within Section 424 of the Code. Each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this Agreement will continue to have, and be subject to, the same terms and conditions set forth in the applicable Company Stock Option Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, any repurchase rights or vesting provisions), except that (1) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable (or will become exercisable in accordance with its terms) for the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole number of shares of Parent Common Stock and (2) the per share exercise price for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock at which such Company Stock Option was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Exchange Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. In addition, each Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement between Company or an Affiliate and an employee of such entity shall be assumed by Parent, and the number of shares subject to such Restricted Stock Purchase Agreement will be adjusted as described above. 

  

    

  (b) It is intended that Company Stock Options assumed by Parent shall
qualify following the Effective Time as incentive stock options as defined in
Section 422 of the Code to the extent such Company Stock Options qualified as
incentive stock options immediately prior to the Effective Time and the
provisions of this Section 5.8 shall be applied consistent with such intent.

  

 (c) Company shall take actions as are necessary to cause the "Purchase Date" (as such term is used in the 1996 ESPP) applicable to the then current Offering (as such term is used in the 1996 ESPP) to be the last trading day on which the Company Common Stock is traded on NASDAQ immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Final Company Purchase Date"); provided, that such change in the Purchase Date shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. On the Final Company Purchase Date, Company shall apply the funds credited as of such date under the 1996 ESPP within each participant\'s payroll withholdings account to the purchase of whole shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of the 1996 ESPP. Any such shares purchased under the 1996 ESPP shall be automatically converted on the same basis as all other shares of Company Common Stock (other than shares canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(b)), except that such shares shall be converted automatically into shares of Parent Common Stock without the issuance of certificates representing issued and outstanding shares of Company Common Stock to 1996 ESPP participants. 

  

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Company shall not incur any obligations under the 1996 ESPP after the Final Company Purchase Date and the Company shall take any steps necessary to terminate the 1996 ESPP after the Final Company Purchase Date unless directed in writing no less than five (5) days prior to the Effective Time that such termination shall not take place. 

  

  

 5.9 _Form S-8._ Parent agrees to file a registration statement on Form S-8 for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable with respect to assumed Company Stock Options and the ESOP as to which Form S-8 is available within ten (10) business days of the Effective Time and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement thereafter for so long as any of such options or other rights remain outstanding. 

  

 5.10 _Indemnification._

  

  

 (a) Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to fulfill and honor in all respects the obligations of Company pursuant to any indemnification agreements between Company and its present and former directors and officers in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "Indemnified Parties") and any indemnification provisions under Company\'s Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws as in effect on the date hereof. The Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of Company as in effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period of six years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were directors, officers, employees or agents of Company, unless such modification is required by law. 

  

 (b) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain in effect the current policies of directors\' and officers\' liability insurance maintained by the Company and its subsidiaries. Parent may substitute therefor policies of substantially similar coverage containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous, in all material respects to the Indemnified Parties; _provided, however_ , that in no event will Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by Company for such coverage (or such coverage as is available for such 200% of such annual premium). 

  

    

  (c) The provisions of this Section 5.10 are intended to be in addition
to the rights otherwise available to the Indemnified Parties by law, charter,
statute, bylaw, resolution of the Board of Directors of Company or agreement,
and shall operate for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the
Indemnified Parties, their heirs and their representatives.

 5.13 _Regulatory Filings; Reasonable Efforts._ As soon as may be reasonably practicable, Company and Parent each shall file with the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice ("DOJ") Notification and Report Forms relating to the transactions contemplated herein as required by the HSR Act, as well as comparable pre-merger notification forms required by the merger notification or control laws and regulations of any applicable jurisdiction, as agreed to by the parties. Company and Parent each shall promptly (a) supply the other with any information which may be required in order to effectuate such filings and (b) supply any additional information which reasonably may be required by the FTC, the DOJ or the competition or merger control authorities of any other jurisdiction and which the parties may reasonably deem appropriate; _provided, however_ , that Parent shall not be required to agree to any divestiture by Parent or Company or any of Parent\'s subsidiaries or affiliates of shares of capital stock or of any business, assets or property of Parent or its subsidiaries or affiliates or of Company, its affiliates, or the 

    imposition of any material limitation on the ability of any of them to

Each Continuing Employee shall be eligible to receive welfare benefits (such as medical benefits) maintained for employees of Parent on substantially the same terms and conditions in the aggregate as provided to a similarly situated employee of Parent. 

  

 (b) Except with respect to Parent service awards, each Continuing Employee shall be given credit, for the purpose of any service requirements for participation eligibility, or vesting, for his or her period of continuous service with the Company prior to the Effective Time to the extent permitted by Parent\'s benefit programs and consistent with Parent\'s employee benefit plans. No Continuing Employee, or any of his or her eligible dependents, who, at the Effective Time, are participating in a Company group health plan shall be excluded from Parent\'s group plan, or limited in coverage thereunder, by reason of any waiting period restriction or pre-existing condition limitation. Each Continuing Employee shall receive credit for any deductibles that such individual has paid or has been charged with under any Company group health plan during the calendar year in effect. 

  

 (c) Company agrees and acknowledges that the selling group (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-3(a)) of which it is a part (the "Selling Group") will continue to offer a group health plan to employees after the Closing Date and, accordingly, that Company and the Selling Group shall be solely responsible for providing continuation coverage under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA") to those individuals who are MandA qualified beneficiaries (as defined in Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-4(a)) with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (collectively, the "MandA Qualified Beneficiaries"). Company shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless Parent for, from and against any and all claims, liabilities, losses, costs and expenses (including attorney\'s fees) relating to, arising out of, or resulting from any and all COBRA obligations, liabilities and claims related to MandA Qualified Beneficiaries and all other qualified beneficiaries (as defined in Code Section 4980B(g)(1)) with respect to Company\'s group health plans. Company further agrees and acknowledges that in the event that the Selling Group ceases to provide any group health plan to any employee prior to the expiration of the continuation coverage period for all MandA Qualified Beneficiaries (pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 54.4980B-9, QandA-8(c)), then Company shall provide Parent with (i) written notice of such cessation as far in advance of such cessation as is reasonably practicable (and, in any event, at least thirty (30) days prior to such cessation), and (ii) all information necessary or appropriate for Parent to offer continuation coverage to such MandA Qualified Beneficiaries. 

  

  

 5.15 _Severance Plans._ Effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time, the Company and its Affiliates, as applicable, shall each terminate any and all group severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements (collectively, the "Company Severance Plan"). Unless Parent provides such written notice to the Company no later than five business days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall provide Parent with evidence that such Company Severance Plans(s) have been terminated (effective as of the day immediately preceding the Effective Time) pursuant to resolutions of the Company\'s Board of Directors. The form and substance of such resolutions shall be subject to review and approval of Parent. The Company also shall take such other actions in furtherance of terminating such Company Severance Plan(s) as Parent may reasonably require. 

     5.16 _Company ESOP._

  

  

 (a) Parent and Company acknowledge and agree that Company previously has entered into the 2000 Implementation Agreement, 2000 Modified ESOP Loan Agreement, and 2000 Renewal ESOP Note (collectively, the "2000 Stretch Out Agreements") with HSBC Bank U.S.A., as trustee of the SAWTEK Inc. Employee Stock Ownership and 401(k) Plan and Trust (the "KSOP"). Subsequent to the Effective Date, neither the Company nor the Parent shall take any action, fail to take any action or fail to make any contribution, as may be required by the 2000 Stretch Out Agreements. 

  

 (b) Subsequent to the Effective Time, the Parent shall have the right to terminate the KSOP, provided that upon such termination is in accordance with ERISA and the Code, and in accordance with Section 4 of the 2000 Implementation Agreement, all remaining shares of Company common stock (the "ESOP Stock") then held in the KSOP\'s "suspense account" pending release and allocation, shall be released from suspense and allocated to the employees of the Company and Parent who are then active participants in the KSOP immediately prior to such termination. 

  

 (c) Subsequent to the Effective Time, the ESOP Stock remaining in the suspense account of the KSOP shall be allocated in accordance with the "Current Allocation Schedule" as provided in Section 5 of the 2000 Implementation Agreement (as adjusted to reflect the share exchange provided herein), unless an earlier allocation is required upon termination of the KSOP, or by ERISA or the Code. 

  

 (d) Employees of the Company, Parent or any Affiliate thereof, who were employees of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall continue to participate in the KSOP after the Effective Time, regardless of whether the employee then works for the Company, Parent or any Affiliate thereof, it being the intention that the KSOP benefit those individuals (and true, new hires of the Sawtek business unit) who benefited immediately prior to the Effective Time. No individual who was an employee of the Parent or any Affiliate thereof immediately prior to the Effective Date ever shall become a participant in the KSOP unless approved by the Administrator (as defined below), it being the intention that the benefits of the KSOP not be diluted by the inclusion of current employees of the Parent and its Affiliates. Newly hired employees of the Sawtek business unit (i.e., those who never worked for Parent or its Affiliates prior to the Effective Time) shall be permitted to participate in the KSOP in accordance with its terms. For purposes of the KSOP and this provision, time spent with the Parent shall be considered time spent with the Company, and compensation earned from the Parent shall be considered compensation earned from the Company for those employees who shall participate in the KSOP pursuant to this provision. 

   

 (e) Except to the extent required by ERISA, or as a result of a stock dividend, stock split or some other form of recapitalization, Parent shall not be obligated to contribute any further shares of Parent common stock to the KSOP. 

  

 (f) Except for the elimination of the single life annuity and/or joint and survivor annuity forms of distribution currently in the KSOP, neither the Parent nor Company shall eliminate or amend any form of distribution (including without limitation, the normal retirement distribution, in-service distribution, loan and hardship distribution provisions of the KSOP) or vesting provision, except to accelerate the vesting schedule, reduce the waiting period for a distribution to commence, or expand or liberalize the distribution options available under the KSOP. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent the KSOP shall be required to be amended to bring it into compliance with the Code, ERISA or any administrative regulation or ruling thereunder, the Parent and Company shall be permitted to amend the KSOP accordingly in a manner that is least intrusive to the current provisions of the KSOP. 

  

    

  (g) For a minimum period of five (5) years after the Effective Date, the
"Administrator" (as defined in Section 1.4 of the KSOP) and "Investment
Advisory Committee" (as provided in Section 8.1(c) of the KSOP) shall be
committees comprised of a majority of members who then are active participants
or former participants in the KSOP. During such time period, all votes of the
Administrator and Investment Advisory Committee shall require a majority vote
of the members thereof who then are active participants or former participants
of the KSOP.

  

 (h) Subsequent to the Effective Time, both the Parent and the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless any officer or employee of the Parent or Company, or any active participant or former participant of the KSOP elected or appointed to serve as a member of a committee serving as the KSOP Administrator and/or Investment Advisory Committee pursuant to the preceding subsection, against all liability and expenses (including attorney, paralegal and professional fees and court costs) arising from any threatened, pending or completed action, suit, proceeding (including administrative proceedings or investigations) or appeal, incurred by reason of the fact that such individual is or was a member of the Administrator committee Investment Advisory Committee of the KSOP, provided that such individual (i) acted, or failed to act, in good faith and in a manner he or she reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the Parent and Company as well as the participants and beneficiaries of the KSOP, or (ii) with respect to any criminal action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe his or her conduct was unlawful. 

  

  

 5.17 _Export Laws._ Promptly after the execution of this Agreement but in any event prior to the Effective Time, if it has not already done so, Company shall apply to the U.S. Commerce Department\'s Bureau of Export Administration for export classification determinations for all of Company\'s products which (a) incorporate any encryption functions, features or characteristics; or (b) include an interface to any other software products with encryption functions, features or characteristics in order to confirm that all such products may be exported from the United States without an export license, under authority of a license exception, in accordance with the Export Administration Regulations, 15 C.F.R. Parts 730-774. 

  

 5.18 _FIRPTA._ At or prior to the Closing, Company shall deliver to the IRS a notice that Company Common Stock is not a "U.S. Real Property Interest" as defined and in accordance with the requirements of Treasury Regulation Section 1.897-2(h)(2). 

  

 5.19 _Action by Board of Directors._ Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent, or an appropriate committee of non-employee directors thereof, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretative guidance of the SEC so that (i) the assumption of Company Stock Options by Company Insiders (as defined below) pursuant to this Agreement, and (ii) the receipt by Company Insiders of Parent Common Stock in exchange for Company Common Stock pursuant to the Merger, shall in each case be an exempt transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act by any officer or director of Company who may become a covered person of Parent for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act (a "Company Insider"). 

  

 5.20 _Company Representatives on Parent Board of Directors._ At the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of Parent shall amend its bylaws to increase the size of its Board of Directors from seven to nine persons and shall appoint two representatives of Company (the "Sawtek Directors") to fill such vacancies. In addition at the following two annual meetings of stockholders of Parent after the Effective Time, Parent agrees to use its best efforts to include the Sawtek Directors in the slate proposed by its board of directors for election to the Parent\'s Board of Directors in connection with any meeting of the Parent\'s stockholders for the purpose of electing directors; provided that each of the Sawtek Directors is able and willing to serve as a director. Each Sawtek Director who is not an employee of Parent or one of its subsidiaries shall be entitled to participate in the compensation and benefits plans to the same extent as other nonemployee directors of Parent and shall become a party to an indemnification 

    agreement with Parent that is substantially similar to the indemnification
agreements between Parent and its nonemployee directors who were not formerly
directors of the Company.

  

 5.21 _Company Liens and Taxes._ The title for property occupied by the Company located in Apopka, Florida ("Apopka Property") is currently held by the Orange County Industrial Development Authority ("Industrial Development Authority") as reflected in the Official Records of Orange County, Florida, Book 3247, page 2049 and Book 3515, page 1453 (the location of which property is further described therein). Although the Company has repaid in full the industrial development revenue bonds used to finance the purchase of the Apopka Property and the Company is entitled to have title to the Apopka Property transferred to the Company without further consideration, the record title to the Apopka property resides in the Industrial Development Authority. The Company agrees to cause title to the Apopka Property to be transferred to the Company, free and clear of all liens, on or before that date which is earlier of (i) thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement or (ii) the Closing Date. In addition, the Company agrees that all real and personal property taxes past due and owing on the real and personal property owned by the Company (including, without limitation, the Apopka Property) shall be paid in full on or before the Closing Date.

In the event of the termination of this Agreement as provided in Section 7.1, this Agreement shall be of no further force or effect, except (i) as set forth in this Section 7.2, Section 7.3 and Article 8, each of which shall survive the termination of this Agreement, and (ii) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any willful breach of this Agreement. No termination of this Agreement shall affect the obligations of the parties contained in the Confidentiality Agreement, all of which obligations shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with their terms. 

  

 7.3 _Fees and Expenses._

  

  

 (a) _General._ Except as set forth in this Section 7.3, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses whether or not the Merger is consummated; _provided, however_ , that Parent and Company shall share equally all fees and expenses, other than attorneys\' and accountants fees and expenses, incurred in relation to (i) the printing and filing (with the SEC) of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (including any preliminary materials related thereto) and the S-4 (including financial statements and exhibits) and any amendments or supplements thereto and (ii) the filing of any notices required to be filed for HSR Approval or comparable filing requirements with other Governmental Entities. 

  

 (b) _Company Payments._

    

 (i) In the event that (A) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.1(e), or (B) this Agreement shall be terminated (x) pursuant to Section 7.1(b) (except in circumstances under which Parent was prohibited by the proviso to Section 7.1(b) from terminating this Agreement thereunder) or (y) pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) and (1) in the case of clauses (x) or (y), at or prior to such termination, there shall exist or have been proposed an Acquisition Proposal that in either case shall not have been unconditionally and irrevocably withdrawn and (2) in the case of clause (x), within 12 months after such termination, Company shall enter into a definitive agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition or any Company Acquisition shall be consummated, then, in the case of (A) and (B)(y), promptly after such termination, or in the case of (B)(x), immediately prior to the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation of, as applicable, such Company Acquisition, Company shall pay to Parent an amount in cash equal to $39.2 million (the "Termination Fee"). 

   

     

  (ii) In the event that Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to
Section 7.1(g), then Company shall promptly reimburse Parent for Parent\'s
reasonable costs and expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby ("Parent\'s Expenses"), and if within twelve
months of such termination of this Agreement Company shall enter into a
definitive agreement with respect to any Company Acquisition or any Company
Acquisition involving Company shall be consummated, then immediately prior to
the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation
of, as applicable, such Company Acquisition, Company shall pay to Parent an
amount in cash equal to the amount by which the Termination Fee exceeds the
amount of Parent\'s Expenses previously reimbursed by Company pursuant hereto.

    

 (c) _Payments in the Event of Stockholder Vote Not Received._

    

 (i) Company shall pay Parent a cash termination fee of $1.5 million (the "Expense Fee") in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(i) as a result of the failure to receive the Company Shareholder Vote if the Parent Stockholder vote has been obtained. The Expense Fee will, to the extent paid by the Company or on its behalf, be credited against the Termination Fee payable under Section 7.3(b). 

  

 (ii) Parent shall pay Company the Expense Fee in the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 7.1(d)(ii) as a result of the failure to receive the Parent Stockholder Vote if (A) the Company Shareholder Vote has been obtained and (B) this Agreement is not terminable by Parent pursuant to Section 7.1(e). 

    

 (d) The Termination Fee or Expense Fee, as the case may be, shall be paid no later than one business day after the date of such termination. Each party acknowledges that the agreements contained in this Section 7.3 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other party would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if either party fails promptly to pay the amounts due pursuant to this Section 7.3, and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party commences a suit which results in a judgment against such party for the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3, such party shall pay to the other party its reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys\' fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 7.3 at the prime rate of Wells Fargo Bank N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made. 

  

 (e) Payment of the fees and expenses described in Sections 7.3(b) and 7.3(c) shall be in lieu of damages incurred in the event of breach of this Agreement other than willful breaches of this Agreement. 

  

  

 7.4 _Amendment._ Subject to applicable law, the parties may amend this Agreement hereto at any time by execution of an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of Parent and Company. 

  

 7.5 _Extension; Waiver._ At any time prior to the Effective Time any party hereto may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto and (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. Delay in exercising any right under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.

 8.3 _Interpretation; Knowledge_. 

  

  

 (a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to Exhibits, such reference shall be to an Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. When a reference is made in this Agreement 

  

    

 to Sections, such reference shall be to a Section of this Agreement. Unless
otherwise indicated the words "include," "includes" and "including" when used
herein shall be deemed in each case to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement
are for reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning
or interpretation of this Agreement. When reference is made herein to "the
business of" an entity, such reference shall be deemed to include the
business of all direct and indirect subsidiaries of such entity. Reference to
the subsidiaries of an entity shall be deemed to include all direct and
indirect subsidiaries of such entity.

   

 (b) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse Effect" when used in connection with an entity means any change, event, violation, inaccuracy, circumstance or effect that is or could reasonably be expected to be materially adverse to the business, assets (including intangible assets), capitalization, financial condition, results of operations or prospects of such entity and its parent (if applicable) or subsidiaries taken as a whole (provided, however, that none of the following shall be deemed, in and of itself, to be a Material Adverse Effect: (A) a change that directly and primarily results from conditions generally affecting the United States economy or the world economy and which does not disproportionately affect such party; and (B) a change that directly and primarily results from conditions generally affecting the semiconductor industry with respect to Parent and the wireless handset component industry with respect to Company and which does not disproportionately affect such party). For purposes of this condition, changes in the trading price of the Parent Common Stock or the Company Common Stock, each as reported on NASDAQ, shall not constitute a Material Adverse Effect, whether occurring at any time or from time to time. 

  

 (c) For purposes of this Agreement, the term "person" shall mean any individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation), general partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership, joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise, association, organization, entity or Governmental Entity. 

  

  

 8.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all parties need not sign the same counterpart. 

  

 8.5 _Entire Agreement; Third Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto as contemplated by or referred to herein, including Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter (a) constitute the entire agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this Agreement; and (b) are not intended to confer upon any other person any rights or remedies hereunder, except as specifically provided in Section 5.10. 

  

 8.6 _Severability_. In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such provision to other persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such void or unenforceable provision. 

     8.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_. Except as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred
hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of
any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The
parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any
of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is accordingly agreed that
the parties shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions hereof in any court of the United States or any state having
jurisdiction, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity.

  

 8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law thereof; provided that issues involving the corporate governance of any of the parties hereto shall be governed by their respective jurisdictions of incorporation. Each of the parties hereto irrevocably consents to the exclusive jurisdiction of any state or federal court within the State of Oregon, in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of this Agreement or the matters contemplated herein, other than issues involving the corporate governance of any of the parties hereto, agrees that process may be served upon them in any manner authorized by the laws of the State of Oregon for such persons and waives and covenants not to assert or plead any objection which they might otherwise have to such jurisdiction and such process. 

  

 8.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation, holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or document. 

  

 8.10 _Assignment_. No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written approval of the other parties. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.
