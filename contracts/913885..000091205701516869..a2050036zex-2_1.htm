its business as it is now being conducted, except where the failure to have such Approvals would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Each of Parent and its

or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or licensing necessary, except for such failures to be so duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that would not, either individually
or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. Other than Merger Sub and those entities listed on Exhibit&nbsp;21.1 or in the Parent Disclosure Letter, Parent does not directly or
