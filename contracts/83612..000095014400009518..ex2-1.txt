2.07    ARTICLE 2  THE MERGER   SECTION 2.01. The Merger. (a) At the
Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary shall be merged (the "MERGER") with and
into the Company in accordance with Delaware Law, whereupon the separate
existence of Merger Subsidiary shall cease, and the Company shall be the
surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION").   (b) As soon as
practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted hereunder, waiver
of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger Subsidiary will file
a certificate of merger with the Delaware Secretary of State and make all
other filings or recordings required by Delaware Law in connection with the
Merger. The Merger shall become effective at such time (the "EFFECTIVE TIME")
as the certificate of merger is duly filed with the Delaware Secretary of
State or at such later time as is specified in the certificate
of merger.    C-4  9   (c) From and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation shall possess all the rights, powers, privileges and
franchises and be subject to all of the obligations, liabilities,
restrictions and disabilities of the Company and Merger Subsidiary, all as
provided under Delaware Law.   SECTION 2.02. Conversion of Shares. (a) At
the Effective Time:   (i) except as otherwise provided in Section
2.02(a)(ii)  or Section 2.04, each Share outstanding immediately prior to
the  Effective Time, together with the associated Right, shall be converted 
into the right to receive $30.00 in cash, without interest (the "MERGER 
CONSIDERATION"), prorated for fractional shares;   (ii) each Share held by
the Company as treasury stock or  owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the  Effective Time shall be canceled, and no payment
shall be made with  respect thereto; and   (iii) each share of common stock
of Merger Subsidiary  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted  into and become one share of common stock of the
Surviving Corporation  with the same rights, powers and privileges as the
shares so converted  and shall constitute the only outstanding shares of
capital stock of  the Surviving Corporation.   (b) In the event that (i)
the NA Merger Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms,
(ii) Parent has not terminated this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01, and
(iii) a transaction has been consummated wherein the Company has received, in
its capacity as a stockholder of NA, more than $55 per NA share in such
transaction, then the Merger Consideration shall be increased by one-half of
the difference between the Net Proceeds and $11.729 billion divided by the
number of then-outstanding Shares. For purposes of this Agreement, "NET
PROCEEDS" is defined as the cash amount received by the Company in such
transaction after deducting (A) any costs and expenses (including, without
limitation any termination fees) incurred by the Company in connection with
the termination of the NA Merger Agreement, including, without limitation
pursuant to the NA Merger Agreement or the NA Voting Agreement and (B) the
amounts by which the following items increase as a result of such transaction
or the increase in the Merger Consideration pursuant to this Section 2.02(b):
(w) the costs and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby,(x) amounts payable by Parent (other than
the Merger Consideration) pursuant to this Agreement, (y) liabilities assumed
or retained by Parent and the Company, and (z) Taxes incurred by Parent and
the Company.   SECTION 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an agent (the "EXCHANGE AGENT")
reasonably acceptable to the Company for the purpose of exchanging
certificates representing Shares (the "CERTIFICATES") for the Merger
Consideration. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will cause to be
deposited with the Exchange Agent the Merger Consideration to be paid in
respect of the Shares. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent will send,
or will cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each holder of record of Shares
at the Effective Time a letter of transmittal and instructions (which shall
specify that the delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent)
for use in such exchange.   (b) Each holder of Shares that have been
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration will be entitled
to receive, upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together
with a properly completed letter of transmittal, and all other documents the
Exchange Agent may reasonably require, the Merger Consideration payable for
each Share represented by such Certificate. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only
the right to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or
will accrue on the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to the provisions of
this Article 2.    (c) If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to such payment that the
Certificate so    C-5  10  surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required
as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of
such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such tax has
been paid or is not payable.   (d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company will be closed and there shall be no further
registration of transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time,
Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation, they shall be
canceled and exchanged for the Merger Consideration provided for, and in
accordance with the procedures set forth, in this Article 2.   (e) Any
portion of the Merger Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent
pursuant to Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon)
that remains unclaimed by the holders of Shares one year after the Effective
Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has
not exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration in accordance with this
Section 2.03 prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such Shares without
any interest thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be
liable to any holder of Shares for any amount paid to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Any
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares three years after the
Effective Time (or such earlier date immediately prior to such time when the
amounts would otherwise escheat to or become property of any governmental
authority) shall become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the
property of Parent free and clear of any claims or interest of any Person
previously entitled thereto.   (f) Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for
Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.   SECTION 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding
Section 2.02, Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
held by a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented
thereto in writing and who has demanded appraisal for such Shares in
accordance with Delaware Law shall not be converted into a right to receive
the Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws or
otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective
Time into a right to receive the Merger Consideration. The Company shall give
Parent prompt notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of
Shares. Except as required by applicable law or with the prior written
consent of Parent, the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to settle, any such demands.   SECTION 2.05. Stock Options.
(a) At or immediately prior to the Effective Time, each employee or director
stock option to purchase Shares outstanding under any stock option or
compensation plan or arrangement of the Company, whether or not vested or
exercisable ("COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS"), shall be canceled, and the Company
shall pay each holder of any such option at or promptly after the Effective
Time for each such option an amount in cash equal to (i) the excess, if any,
of the Merger Consideration per Share over the applicable exercise price of
such options multiplied by the number of Shares such holder could have
purchased (assuming full vesting of all Company Stock Options) had such
holder exercised such option in full immediately prior to the Effective Time
(the "SPREAD") or (ii) in the case of each Company Stock Option specified in
Section 2.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule, the greater of the Spread or
the Black-Scholes value of such option, determined using the assumptions set
forth on Section 2.05 of the Company Disclosure Schedule.   (b) Prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall (i) use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain any consents from holders of Company Stock Options and (ii) make any
amendments to the terms of such stock option or compensation plans or
arrangements that, in the case of either clauses (i) or (ii), the Company
deems reasonably necessary to give effect to the transactions contemplated by
Section 2.05(a). Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section, payment
may be withheld in respect of any employee stock option until such necessary
consents are obtained.    C-6  11   SECTION 2.06. Adjustments. If,
during the period between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time,
any change in the outstanding Shares shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split or combination, exchange or
readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend (or dividend payable in any other
securities) thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger
Consideration and any other amounts payable pursuant to this Agreement shall
be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Shares the same
economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event.  
SECTION 2.07. Trust Originated Preferred Securities. Reference is made to the
Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust of Nabisco Group Holdings Capital
Trust II (formerly called RJR Nabisco Holdings Capital Trust II) dated as of
September 16, 1998, as amended by Amendment No. 1 thereto dated as of
July 12, 1999 (the "DECLARATION") and all related documentation, including
the Terms of the Preferred Securities and of the Common Securities (all
such documentation, together with the Declaration, the "TOPRS
DOCUMENTS"). Capitalized terms used in this Section 2.07 but not defined
elsewhere in this Agreement shall have the meanings assigned to such terms in
the Declaration. After the date hereof, the Company shall exercise its option
under the Declaration to cause the Trustees to (i) dissolve the Trust and
(ii) cause the Debentures to be distributed to Holders of the Preferred
Securities and Common Securities in exchange therefor (and comply with all
applicable provisions of the TOPrS Documents in respect of such exercise
(including to seek a listing, if required, of the Debentures)), which in each
case shall occur prior to the Effective Time. In addition, the Company will
prior to the Effective Time (x) deliver an irrevocable notice to the
Debenture Trustee stating that all outstanding Debentures are to be redeemed
on September 30, 2003 and (y) take all necessary action to cause the
conditions set forth in Section 10.1(C) of the Indenture to be satisfied such
that a "covenant defeasance" under such section will occur concurrently with
the above-described dissolution of the Trust and distribution of the
Debentures. All of the actions set forth in this Section 2.07 shall be
carried out in accordance with the terms of the TOPrS Documents.   SECTION
2.08. Withholding Rights. Each of the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall
be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required to
deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
any provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law. If the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, made such deduction and
withholding.   SECTION 2.09. Lost Certificates. If any Certificate shall
have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of
a bond, in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Certificate, the Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate, the Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of
the Shares represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article.   SECTION 2.10. Associated Rights. References in Article 1 and
Article 2 of this Agreement to Shares shall include, unless the context
requires otherwise, the associated Rights.   ARTICLE 3  THE SURVIVING
CORPORATION   SECTION 3.01. Certificate of Incorporation. The certificate
of incorporation of the Company in effect at the Effective Time shall be
the certificate of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until amended
in accordance with applicable law, provided that, at the Effective Time,

majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of NA in connection with
the consummation of the NA Merger, have been duly authorized by all necessary
corporate action on the part of NA. The affirmative vote of the holders of a
majority of the outstanding shares of common stock of NA is the only vote of

Document filed pursuant to the 1934 Act contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make
the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.   (d) No Company SEC Document filed
pursuant to the 1933 Act, as amended or supplemented, if applicable, as of
the date such document or amendment became effective, contained any untrue

on adoption of this Agreement, the Company Proxy Statement, as supplemented
or amended, if applicable, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to

18, 1999 by Parent to the  Company of all of the outstanding shares of the

Parent arising out  of the distribution on June 14, 1999 by the Company to
the holders of  its common stock of all of the outstanding common stock of
Parent, or  (2) a material increase in the tax liability of the Company
resulting  from the NA Merger as compared to the tax liability that would

Board Determination and the Company, prior to such termination pursuant to
this clause (g), pays to Parent in immediately available funds the fee

either party to perform a covenant hereof, such party shall be fully liable
for any and all liabilities and damages incurred or suffered by the other
party as a result of such failure. The provisions of Sections 7.01, 11.04,

successors and assigns, provided that no party may assign, delegate or
otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement without the consent of each other party hereto, except that Parent
or Merger Subsidiary may transfer or assign, in whole or from time to time in
part, to one or more of its Affiliates, the right to enter into the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, but no such transfer or
assignment will relieve Parent or Merger Subsidiary of its obligations
hereunder.   SECTION 11.06. Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed
by and construed in accordance with the law of the State of Delaware, without
regard to the conflicts of law rules of such state.   SECTION 11.07.

action or proceeding and irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the
venue of any such suit, action or proceeding in any such court or that any
such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient form. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of    C-28    33    any such court. Without limiting

Effectiveness; Benefit. This Agreement may be signed in any number of

counterparts hereof signed by all of the other parties hereto. Except as
provided in Section 7.03, no provision of this Agreement is intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies, obligations, or liabilities
hereunder upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns.   SECTION 11.10. Entire Agreement. This Agreement
and the Confidentiality Agreement constitute the entire agreement between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supersedes
all prior agreements and understandings, both oral and written, between the
parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Confidentiality Agreement is hereby amended to delete the

to pursue any Acquisition Proposal with respect to the Company that would be

11.11. Captions. The captions herein are included for convenience of
reference only and shall be ignored in the construction or interpretation
hereof.   SECTION 11.12. Severability. If any term, provision, covenant
or restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction
or other authority to be invalid, void, unenforceable, the remainder of the
terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions of this Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or
invalidated so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
party. Upon such a determination, the parties shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties
as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the fullest
extent possible.   SECTION 11.13. Specific Performance. The parties hereto

specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof in any
federal court located in the State of Delaware or any Delaware state court,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity.    C-29    34     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto
