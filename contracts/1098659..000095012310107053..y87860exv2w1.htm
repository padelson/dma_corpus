COMMISSO, the sole member and manager of Merger Sub (" _Parent_ " and, together with Merger Sub and their respective Affiliates, the " _RBC Stockholders_ "), and MEDIACOM COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ " and, collectively with Merger Sub and Parent, the " _Parties_ "). Certain terms used in this Agreement are used as defined in Section 8.11. 

  

RECITALS 

  

 WHEREAS, as of the date hereof, (a) Merger Sub owns of record 1,000,000 issued and outstanding shares of Class B common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Class B Common Stock_"), and (b) in addition to his beneficial ownership of such shares held by Merger Sub, Parent owns of record 213,910 issued and outstanding shares of Class A common stock, par value $.01 per share, of the Company (the " _Class A Common Stock_" and, together with the Class B Common Stock, the " _Common Stock_ "), and 25,789,722 issued and outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock; 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors, based on the recommendation of a special committee thereof consisting solely of disinterested directors of the Company (the " _Special Committee_ "), has determined that a business combination with the RBC Stockholders, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein, is fair to, and in the best interests of, the holders of Common Stock other than the RBC Stockholders (the " _Public Stockholders_ "); and 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors, based on the unanimous recommendation of the Special Committee, has (a) approved this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and declared their advisability and (b) recommended adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company. 

  

 WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the RBC Stockholders are entering into a voting agreement with the Company, substantially in the form of Exhibit C (the " _Voting Agreement_ "), pursuant to which, among other things, such stockholders agree to vote the shares of Common Stock held by them in favor of the adoption of this Agreement. 

  

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

The Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger

the Merger, except as set forth in Section 1.04 of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 1.02 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place as soon as practicable, but in no event later than the third Business Day (the " _Closing Date_ ") after the satisfaction or, subject to applicable Law and the terms of this Agreement, waiver (other than in the case of Section 6.01(b) which may not be waived by any Party hereto) of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing but subject to the satisfaction of those conditions), unless this Agreement has been theretofore terminated pursuant to its terms or unless another date is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The Closing shall be held at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., 30 Rockefeller Plaza, New York, New York 10112, at 10:00 a.m., New York City time, or at such other place and time as Parent and the Company shall agree in writing. At the Closing, the Company shall file a certificate of merger and such other appropriate documents and instruments (collectively, the " _Merger Certificate_ "), executed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the DLLCA and DGCL, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware in respect of the Merger, and the Merger shall become effective upon such filing or at such later time as is agreed to by the Company and Parent and specified in the Merger Certificate (the " _Effective Time_ ").

At the Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and the by-laws of the Company shall be amended in the Merger to read in their entirety in the form of Exhibit A (in the case of the certificate of incorporation) and Exhibit B (in the case of the by-laws), and, as so amended, shall be the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance with their respective terms and the DGCL. 

  

 Section 1.05 _Directors_. The manager of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial director of the Surviving Corporation, to hold office, subject to the applicable provisions of the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until his respective successor is duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, or until his earlier death, resignation or removal, or as otherwise provided by Law. 

  

 Section 1.06 _Officers_. The officers of the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, from and after the Effective Time, be the initial officers of the Surviving Corporation, subject to the applicable provisions of the by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the Surviving Corporation, or until their earlier death, resignation or removal, or otherwise as provided by Law. 

   ##### 

  

  

 Section 1.07 _Conversion of Shares_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Parties hereto or any holder of Common Stock: 

  

 (a) Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $8.75 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). As of the Effective Time, all shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares) shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such share of Common Stock (a " _Certificate_ ") and each holder of uncertificated shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock represented by such Certificate or uncertificated share, to be paid in consideration therefor, without interest, upon surrender of such Certificate or uncertificated share in accordance with Section 2.02(b). 

  

 (b) Each outstanding Excluded Share immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a Certificate or uncertificated share that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

  

 (c) All of the outstanding membership interests of Merger Sub, in the aggregate, shall be converted into 1,000 shares of newly issued common stock of the Surviving Corporation. 

  

 Section 1.08 _Stock Options; Restricted Stock and ESPP_. (a) The Board of Directors (and its Compensation Committee) shall take any and all actions necessary to carry out the provisions of this Section 1.08, effective as of the Effective Time. 

  

 (b) Each option to purchase shares of Common Stock (in each case, an " _Option_ ") that has been granted pursuant to an Employee Incentive Plan or the Director Stock Plan and remains outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be immediately cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into an obligation of the Surviving Corporation to make a cash payment, if any, to the holder of such Option in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.08(b). 

   

 (i) To the extent an Option issued pursuant to an Employee Incentive Plan is outstanding and is vested and exercisable by its terms as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holder thereof (other than Parent) a cash payment promptly following the Effective Time (but no later than the payroll date following the Effective Time) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock underlying the vested and exercisable portion of such Option immediately prior to the cancellation of such Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option, without any interest for delayed payment and subject to applicable tax withholding. 

    

 (ii) To the extent an Option issued pursuant to an Employee Incentive Plan is outstanding as of the Effective Time and is not vested and exercisable by its terms as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holder thereof (other than

   ##### 

  

    

Parent) a cash payment on each date following the Effective Time as of which
all or a portion of such Option would have become vested and exercisable
pursuant to the terms of such Option in effect immediately prior to the
cancellation of such Option (the " _Option Vesting Date_ ") equal to the
product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock underlying such Option to
the extent it would have become vested and exercisable on such Option Vesting
Date multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration
over the exercise price per share of such Option, without any interest for
delayed payment and subject to applicable tax withholding. 

   

 (iii) To the extent an Option issued pursuant to the Director Stock Plan is outstanding as of the Effective Time (whether or not such Option is vested and exercisable), the Surviving Corporation shall pay the holder thereof (other than Parent) a cash payment promptly following the Effective Time (but no later than three Business Days) equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock underlying such Option multiplied by (y) the excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the exercise price per share of such Option, without any interest for delayed payment and subject to applicable tax withholding. 

   

 (iv) For the avoidance of doubt any Option issued pursuant to an Employee Incentive Plan or the Director Stock Plan that (x) has an exercise price per share which equals or exceeds the Merger Consideration or (y) is held by Parent shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment of any consideration to the holder of such Option. 

  

 (c) Any right to receive shares of Common Stock in the future subject to performance or time-based vesting conditions that has been issued pursuant to an Employee Incentive Plan or the Director Stock Plan and that remains outstanding and unvested as of the Effective Time (in each case, a " _Restricted Stock Award_ ") shall be immediately cancelled as of the Effective Time and converted into an obligation of the Surviving Corporation to make a cash payment to the holder of such Restricted Stock Award in accordance with the provisions of this Section 1.08(c). 

   

 (i) The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holder (other than Parent) of a Restricted Stock Award issued pursuant to an Employee Incentive Plan a cash payment on each date following the Effective Time as of which all or a portion of such Restricted Stock Award would have become vested (the " _RSA Vesting Date_ "), an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock that would have become vested or would have been delivered on such RSA Vesting Date pursuant to such Restricted Stock Award multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration, without any interest for delayed payment and subject to applicable tax withholding. 

   

 (ii) The Surviving Corporation shall pay the holder (other than Parent) of a Restricted Stock Award issued pursuant to the Director Plan a cash payment promptly following the Effective Time (but no later than three Business Days) an amount in cash equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Common Stock underlying such Restricted Stock Award and (y) the Merger Consideration, without interest for delayed payment and subject to applicable tax withholding. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (iii) For the avoidance of doubt any Restricted Stock Award held by an RBC Stockholder shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time without payment of any consideration to such RBC Stockholder. 

  

 (d) The Company shall terminate the Mediacom Communications Corporation 2010 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _ESPP_ ") effective as of the date which is three days prior to the Effective Time (the " _ESPP Termination Date_ ") in accordance with Section 18(c) of the ESPP. The ESPP Termination Date shall be designated as a new "Exercise Date" (as defined in the ESPP) for the Offering Period (as defined in the ESPP) ending on the ESPP Termination Date. Any funds accumulated under the ESPP on behalf of any employee of the Company (or any of its Subsidiaries) during such Offering Period will be used to purchase shares of Common Stock at the per share Purchase Price (as defined in the ESPP) in effect during such Offering Period under the terms of the ESPP. Any shares of Common Stock issued under the ESPP pursuant to this Section 1.08(d) will be treated for purposes of this Agreement in the same manner as any other outstanding shares of Common Stock as of the Effective Time. 

  

 Section 1.09 _Stockholders  Meeting; Proxy Materials and Other SEC Filings_. (a) The Company shall (i) duly take all lawful action to call, give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders on a date as soon as reasonably practicable after the SECs review of the Proxy Statement has been completed (the " _Company Stockholders Meeting_ "), for the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval and the Minority Approval with respect to the adoption of this Agreement and (ii) use reasonable best efforts to solicit the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholder Approval and the Minority Approval; _provided_ that, in the event of a Change in the Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.07(c), notwithstanding clause (ii) of this Section 1.09(a), (x) the Company shall disclose the fact of such Change in the Company Recommendation in any solicitation made by the Company to its stockholders and (y) the Company shall not be required to solicit in favor of the Company Stockholder Approval or the Minority Approval. The Board of Directors shall recommend adoption of this Agreement by the stockholders of the Company as set forth in Section 3.03(b) (the " _Company Recommendation_ "), and shall not withdraw, modify or qualify (or propose to withdraw, modify or qualify) in any manner adverse to Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates such recommendation or take any action or make any statement in connection with the Company Stockholders Meeting inconsistent with such recommendation, including approving or recommending or proposing to approve or recommend a third-party Takeover Proposal with respect to the Company or failing to recommend the adoption of this Agreement (collectively, a " _Change in the Company Recommendation_ "); _provided_  that the Special Committee may make a Change in the Company Recommendation pursuant to Section 5.07(c) hereof; and _provided_ , _further_ , that the provision of factual information by the Company to its stockholders shall not be deemed to constitute a Change in the Company Recommendation so long as the disclosure through which such factual information is conveyed, taken as a whole, is not contrary to or inconsistent with the Company Recommendation. 

  

 (b) As promptly as practicable following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement on Schedule 14A relating to the adoption of this Agreement by the Companys stockholders (as amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and the Parties shall prepare and file with the SEC a Schedule 13E-3 (as amended or supplemented, the " _Schedule 13E-3_"). The Parties shall cooperate with each other in connection 

   ##### 

  

    

with the preparation of the foregoing documents. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that the Proxy Statement and the Schedule
13E-3 do not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, other than with respect to statements made
based on information supplied in writing by either RBC Stockholder
specifically for inclusion therein. Each RBC Stockholder shall use its
reasonable best efforts to ensure that none of the information it supplies in
writing specifically for inclusion in the Proxy Statement or Schedule 13E-3
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements contained therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to have the SECs review of the Proxy Statement, and the Parties
shall use their reasonable best efforts to have the SECs review of the
Schedule 13E-3, completed as promptly as practicable. 

  

 (c) The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed to the Companys stockholders as promptly as practicable after the SECs review of the Proxy Statement is completed. 

  

 (d) The Company shall promptly notify the RBC Stockholders of the receipt by the Company of any oral or written comments from the SEC relating to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3. The Company shall cooperate with the RBC Stockholders with respect to, and provide the RBC Stockholders with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, drafts of the Proxy Statement (including each amendment or supplement thereto), and the Parties shall cooperate with respect to, and provide each other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on, the draft Schedule 13E-3 (including each amendment or supplement thereto) and all responses to requests for additional information by, and replies to comments of, the SEC, prior to filing such with or sending such to the SEC, and the Parties shall provide each other with copies of all such filings made and correspondence with the SEC. 

  

 (e) If at any time prior to the Effective Time, any information should be discovered by any Party that should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3 so that the Proxy Statement or the Schedule 13E-3, as the case may be, would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other Parties and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by the appropriate Party with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the stockholders of the Company. 

  

 Section 1.10 _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of any Party, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of any Party, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

ARTICLE II 

   

DISSENTING SHARES; PAYMENT FOR SHARES 

  

 Section 2.01 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by stockholders (i) who shall have neither voted for adoption of this Agreement nor consented thereto in writing and (ii) who shall be entitled to and shall have demanded properly in writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Dissenting Shares_ "), shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration at the Effective Time, and the holders of Dissenting Shares, if any, shall be entitled only to such rights as are granted by Section 262 of the DGCL;  _provided_ , _however_ , that if any holder of Dissenting Shares shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw, or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL, or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then, at the Effective Time or the occurrence of such event, whichever last occurs, such holders Dissenting Shares shall cease to be Dissenting Shares and shall be converted or deemed to have been converted, as the case may be, into the right to receive the Merger Consideration in the manner provided in Section 1.07. The Company shall give Merger Sub (i) prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal, withdrawals (or attempted withdrawals) of demands for appraisal and any other instruments served pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL and received by the Company and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal. The Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of the RBC Stockholders, make any payment with respect to any demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands. 

  

 Section 2.02 _Payment Fund_. (a) _Payment Fund_. As soon as practicable after the execution of this Agreement, the Company shall enter into an agreement (the " _Paying Agent Agreement_ ") with a bank or trust company selected by the Company (subject to the Special Committees approval not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed) and reasonably satisfactory to the RBC Stockholders to act as paying agent hereunder for the purpose of exchanging Certificates and uncertificated shares for the Merger Consideration (the " _Paying Agent_ "). As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in trust for the benefit of holders of shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares), an amount of cash representing the aggregate cash consideration payable pursuant to Section 1.07. Any cash deposited with the Paying Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the " _Payment Fund_." 

  

 (b) _Payment Procedures_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of (i) a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time evidenced outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) or (ii) shares of Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares) represented by book-entry (" _Book-Entry Shares_ "), (A) a form letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent or, in the case of Book-Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the letter of transmittal, and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as the Surviving 

   ##### 

  

    

Corporation may reasonably specify) and (B) instructions for use in effecting
the surrender of such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the
Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 1.07. Upon surrender of such a
Certificate or Book-Entry Share for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to
such other agent or agents as may be appointed by the Surviving Corporation,
together with a letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other
customary documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions
(collectively, the " _Transmittal Documents_ "), the holder of such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock formerly
represented by such Certificate or Book-Entry Share, without any interest
thereon, less any required withholding of taxes, and the Certificate or Book-
Entry Share so surrendered shall thereupon be cancelled. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued and paid in
accordance with this Article II to the transferee of such shares if the
Certificate or Book-Entry Share evidencing such shares is presented to
the Paying Agent and is properly endorsed and/or otherwise in proper form for
transfer. In such event, the signature on the Certificate or Book-Entry Share
or any related stock power must be properly guaranteed and the Person
requesting payment of the Merger Consideration must either pay any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of the Certificate or Book-Entry Share so surrendered or
establish to the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not
applicable. The Merger Consideration will be delivered by the Paying Agent as
promptly as practicable following surrender of such a Certificate or Book-
Entry Share and the related Transmittal Documents. Cash payments may be made
by check unless otherwise required by a depositary institution in connection
with delivery of Book-Entry Shares. No interest will be payable on any Merger
Consideration. Until surrendered in accordance with this Section 2.02, each
Certificate or Book-Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after
the Effective Time to evidence only the right to receive, upon such
surrender, the Merger Consideration for each share of Common Stock (other
than Excluded Shares and any Dissenting Shares) formerly represented by such
Certificate or Book-Entry Share. The Payment Fund shall not be used for
any purpose other than as set forth in this Article II. Any interest,
dividends or other income earned on the investment of cash held in the
Payment Fund shall be for the account of the Surviving Corporation. The
Merger Consideration delivered upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been
paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares represented
by such Certificates or Book-Entry Shares. 

  

 (c) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains undistributed to the Public Stockholders for six months following the Effective Time shall be delivered by the Paying Agent to the Surviving Corporation. Any Public Stockholders who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Merger Consideration. 

  

 (d) _No Liability_. None of the Company, the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any Person for any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. 

  

 (e) _Investment of the Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest any cash included in the Payment Fund as directed by the Surviving Corporation on a daily basis and in accordance with the Paying Agent Agreement; _provided_ that any gain or loss thereon shall not 

   ##### 

  

    

affect the amounts payable to the stockholders of the Company pursuant to
Article I or this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investments shall promptly be paid to the Surviving Corporation. If for
any reason (including as a result of losses) the cash in the Payment Fund
shall be insufficient to fully satisfy all of the payment obligations to be
made in cash by the Paying Agent hereunder, the Surviving Corporation shall
promptly deposit cash into the Payment Fund in an amount which is equal to
the deficiency in the amount of cash required to fully satisfy such cash
payment obligations. 

  

 (f) _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Common Stock such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the Common Stock in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. 

  

 (g) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the holder of such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall execute an affidavit of that fact upon request. The holder of any such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate shall also deliver a reasonable indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed. The affidavit and any indemnity which may be required hereunder shall be delivered to the Paying Agent (or, after the six-month anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation), which shall be responsible for making payment for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates pursuant to the terms hereof. 

  

 Section 2.03 _Stock Transfer Books_. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing shares of Common Stock shall cease to have any rights with respect to such shares, except as provided in this Agreement or by applicable Law. Any Certificate or Book-Entry Share presented to the Paying Agent or the Surviving Corporation for any reason at or after the Effective Time shall be canceled and, in the case of any Certificates or Book-Entry Shares representing Common Stock (other than Excluded Shares and Dissenting Shares), exchanged for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the terms of this Article II. 

  

 Section 2.04 _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take such steps, to the extent required and permitted, to cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispositions of equity securities (including derivative securities) of the Company by each individual who is or will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 

  

 Section 2.05 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that prior to the Effective Time, solely as a result of a reclassification, combination, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or stock distribution which in any such event is made on a pro rata basis to all holders of Common Stock, there is a change in the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding or issuable upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of securities or rights 

   ##### 

  

    

convertible or exchangeable or exercisable for shares of Common Stock, then
the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to eliminate the
effects of such event.

 Section 5.03 _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_. 

  

 (a) Parent and the Company agree that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation now existing in favor of each individual who, as of the Effective Time, is a present or former director or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnified Person_ ") as provided in the Constituent Documents of the Company or any of such Subsidiaries, in effect as of the date hereof, shall, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect after the Effective Time. Until the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time, the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporation and the Constituent Documents of its Subsidiaries shall, with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, contain provisions no less favorable with respect to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation of the Indemnified Persons than are set forth in the Companys Constituent Documents or in the Constituent Documents of the Surviving Corporations Subsidiaries in effect as of the date of execution of this Agreement, and 

   ##### 

  

    

such provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified prior to
the sixth anniversary of the Effective Time (or, with respect to any
proceeding commenced prior to such sixth anniversary, prior to the final
disposition of such proceeding) in any manner that would adversely affect
the rights thereunder, as of the Effective Time, of any Indemnified Person,
with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time. Parent and the
Company further agree that all rights to indemnification or advancement of
expenses now existing in favor of Indemnified Persons in any indemnification
agreement between such person and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
the case may be, or under Law shall survive the Merger and continue in full
force and effect in accordance with the terms of such agreement or Law. 

  

 (b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, obtain and maintain directors and officers liability insurance policies for the Indemnified Persons with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time for a period of six years from the Effective Time (or, with respect to any proceeding commenced during such period, until the final disposition of such proceeding) on terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable than those of the applicable policies in effect on the date hereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) in no event shall Parent and the Surviving Corporation be obligated to expend in order to obtain or maintain insurance coverage pursuant to this Section 5.03(b) any amount per annum in excess of 200% of the aggregate premiums currently paid or payable by the Company in 2009 (on an annualized basis) for such purpose (the " _Cap_ "), and (ii) if equivalent coverage cannot be obtained, or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the Cap, Parent and the Surviving Company shall only be required to obtain as much coverage as can be obtained by paying an annual premium equal to the Cap. 

  

 (c) In the event the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation (or their respective successors or assigns) assume the obligations of the Surviving Corporation (or their respective successors or assigns) as contemplated by this Section 5.03. The Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 5.03. The provisions of this Section 5.03 shall survive the consummation of the Merger and expressly are intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, it is agreed that the rights of an Indemnified Person under this Section 5.03 shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the Companys Constituent Documents, any other indemnification arrangements, the DGCL, or otherwise, and nothing in this Section 5.03 shall have the effect of, or be construed as having the effect of, reducing the benefits to the Indemnified Persons under the Companys Constituent Documents, any other indemnification arrangements, the DGCL or otherwise with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time.

request, including all material information regarding the amount and

that until the Effective Time it shall, and shall use its reasonable best
efforts to cause its respective Representatives to, hold in strict confidence

breach of this covenant) public or readily ascertainable from public or

Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to the receipt of the Company Stockholder Approval and Minority Approval, the Company may, in response to a _bona fide_ written Takeover Proposal that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.07(a), and subject to compliance with Section 5.07(c): 

   

 (x) furnish information or data with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to and in accordance with a confidentiality agreement containing customary terms and conditions,  _provided_ that (I) such confidentiality agreement shall include a customary "standstill" provision that restricts such Person from acquiring outstanding securities of the Company and shall not provide such Person with any exclusive right to negotiate with the Company or contain any provisions that would prevent the Company from complying with its obligations under this Agreement, and (II) all such information provided to such Person has previously been provided to Parent or Merger Sub or is provided to Parent and Merger Sub prior to or concurrently with the time it is provided to such Person; and 

   

 (y) participate in discussions or negotiations with such Person or its Representatives regarding such Takeover Proposal; 

 

 _provided_ , in each case, that the Special Committee determines in good
faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside legal
counsel and a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that (i)
the failure to furnish such information or participate in such discussions or
negotiations would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of
its fiduciary duties to the Public Stockholders under applicable Law and (ii)
such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to lead to
a Superior Proposal. The Company shall promptly inform its Representatives of
the obligations undertaken in this Section 5.07. Without limiting the
foregoing, any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section 5.07 by
any Representative of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries whether or not
such Person is purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 5.07 by the
Company; _provided_ that notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
in this Agreement, in no event shall any action taken by, or at the direction
of, Parent constitute a violation by the Company of this Section 5.07.
Nothing contained in this 

  ##### 

  

   

Section 5.07 shall prohibit the Company from responding to any unsolicited
proposal or inquiry solely by advising the Person making such proposal or
inquiry of the terms of this Section 5.07.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any Takeover Proposal or inquiry is made, or any other information with respect to such Takeover Proposal or inquiry is provided, solely to Parent, the Company shall have no obligations to Parent or Merger Sub under this Section 5.07(b) with respect to such Takeover Proposal, inquiry or other information. 

  

 (c) Neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof (including the Special Committee) shall, directly or indirectly, (i) effect a Change in the Company Recommendation or (ii) approve any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, merger agreement or other agreement, arrangement or understanding relating to any Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to the Company Stockholder Approval and Minority Approval, the Special Committee may in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, effect a Change in the Company Recommendation, _provided_ that the Special Committee determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, that such action is required to comply with its fiduciary duties to the Public Stockholders of the Company under applicable Law, and _provided_ , _further_ , that the Board of Directors and/or the Special Committee may not effect a Change in the Company Recommendation unless (i) the Special Committee shall have first provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger Sub that it is prepared to effect a Change in the Company Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal or an Intervening Event, which notice shall, in the case of a Superior Proposal, specify the material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identify the Person making such Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, describe such event and its effect or potential effect on the Company and/or the Companys securities, and (ii) Parent or Merger Sub does not make, within four Business Days after the receipt of such notice, a proposal that the Special Committee determines in good faith, after consultation with a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, is at least as favorable to the Public Stockholders as such Superior Proposal or obviates the need for a Change in the Company Recommendation as a result of an Intervening Event, as the case may be. The Company agrees that, during the four Business Day period prior to its effecting a Change in the Company Recommendation, the Company (as directed by the Special Committee) and its Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub and their respective Representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the transaction contemplated by this Agreement proposed by Parent and Merger Sub. No Change in the Company 

   ##### 

  

    

Recommendation shall (x) relieve the Company of its obligations under Section
1.09 of this Agreement to, among other things, submit this Agreement to the

state takeover statute or other state law to be inapplicable to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

  

 (d) The Company agrees that it will deliver to Parent and Merger Sub a new written notice of Takeover Proposal with respect to each Takeover Proposal that has been materially revised or modified prior to taking any action to recommend or agreeing to recommend such Takeover Proposal to the stockholders of the Company and that a new period shall commence for purposes of this Section 5.07 with respect to each such materially revised or modified Takeover Proposal from the time Parent receives the written notice of the Takeover Proposal with respect thereto; provided that such new period shall expire on the later of four Business Days after notice of the original Takeover Proposal or four Business Days after notice of such revised or modified Takeover Proposal. 

  

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 5.07 shall prohibit the Company from complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act in respect of any Takeover Proposal or making any disclosure to the stockholders of the Company if the Special Committee determines in good faith, by resolution duly adopted after consultation with its outside counsel, that the failure to make such disclosure would reasonably be expected to constitute a breach of its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Board of Directors nor any committee thereof shall, except as expressly permitted by Section 5.07(c), effect a Change in the Company Recommendation.

 " _Takeover Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer in respect of (i) a tender or exchange offer, merger, consolidation, business combination, share exchange, reorganization, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution, or similar transaction involving the Company (any of the foregoing, a " _Business Combination Transaction_ ") with any Person other than Parent, Merger Sub or any Affiliate thereof (a " _Third Party_ "), (ii) the Companys acquisition of any Third Party in a Business Combination Transaction in which the stockholders of the Third Party immediately prior to consummation of such Business Combination Transaction will own more than 20% of the Companys outstanding capital stock immediately following such Business Combination Transaction, including the issuance by the Company of more than 20% of any class of its equity securities as consideration for assets or securities of a Third Party, or (iii) any direct or indirect acquisition by any Third Party of 20% or more of the outstanding capital stock of the Company or of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, in a single transaction or a series of related transactions.

of the voting power of the Companys capital stock or (iii) at least 66% of
the consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, which Business
Combination Transaction or other purchase or acquisition contains terms and
conditions that the Special Committee determines in good faith, by resolution
duly adopted after consultation with its outside counsel and a financial
advisor of nationally recognized reputation, would result in a transaction
that if consummated would be more favorable to the Public Stockholders than
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement (including
any proposal by Parent to amend the terms of this Agreement); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such Business Combination Transaction shall not be deemed to
be a "Superior Proposal" unless the Special Committee determines in good faith
that any financing required to consummate such Business Combination
Transaction is capable of being, and is reasonably likely to be, obtained. 

  

 Section 5.08 _Stockholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, whether commenced prior to or after the execution and delivery of this Agreement.

ARTICLE VII 

   

LIMITATION ON LIABILITY AND INDEMNIFICATION 

  

 1. _Limitation On Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL or any other applicable laws presently or hereafter in effect, no director of the Corporation shall be personally liable to the Corporation or its stockholders for or with respect to any acts or omissions in the performance of his or her duties as a director of the Corporation. If the DGCL is hereafter amended to authorize, with the approval of a corporations stockholders, further reductions in the liability of the Corporations directors for breach of fiduciary duty, then a director of the Corporation shall not be liable for any such breach to the fullest extent permitted by the DGCL, as so amended. Any repeal or modification of this Article VII shall not adversely affect any right or protection of a director of the Corporation existing immediately prior to such repeal or modification. 

  

 2. _Indemnification_.

the Corporation as a director, officer, employee, representative or agent
of another corporation or of a partnership, joint venture, limited liability
company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity, including service with
respect to employee benefit plans, against all liability and loss suffered
and expenses (including attorneys fees) incurred by such person. Such right
of indemnification will inure whether or not the claim asserted is based on
matters that antedate the adoption of this Article VII. The Corporation will
be required to indemnify or make advances to a person in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such person only if the proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the board of directors of the Corporation
(except as otherwise provided in Section 2(c) of this Article VII).

 (c) _Claims_. If a claim for indemnification or payment of expenses under this Section is not paid in full within 30 days after a written claim therefor has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may file suit to recover the unpaid amount of such claim and, to the extent permitted by law, will be entitled to be paid the expense of prosecuting such claim. In any such action the Corporation will have the burden of proving that the claimant was not entitled to the requested indemnification or payment of expenses under applicable law. 

   

 (d) _Non-Exclusivity of Rights_. The rights conferred on any person by this Section will not be exclusive of any other rights which such person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of this Certificate of Incorporation, the Bylaws, agreement, vote of stockholders or resolution of disinterested directors or otherwise. 

   

 (e) _Insurance_ _._ The board of directors of the Corporation may, to the full extent permitted by applicable law as it presently exists, or may hereafter be amended from time to time, authorize an appropriate officer or officers to purchase and maintain at the Corporations expense insurance: (i) to indemnify the Corporation for any obligation which it incurs as a result of the indemnification provisions of this Article VII; and (ii) to indemnify or insure directors and officers against liability in instances in which they may not otherwise be indemnified by the Corporation under the provisions of this Article VII. 

   

 (f) _Other Indemnification_. The Corporations obligation, if any, to indemnify any person who was or is serving at its request as a director, officer, employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company, trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity will be reduced by any amount such person may collect as indemnification from 

      ##### 

  

    

such other corporation, partnership, joint venture, limited liability company,
trust, enterprise or nonprofit entity. 

   

 3. _Amendment or Repeal_.

removal only for cause or (2) If the Corporation has cumulative voting and

without cause if the votes cast against such persons removal would
be sufficient to elect such person if then cumulatively voted at an election
of the entire Board, or, if there be classes of directors, at an election of
the class of directors which such person is a part. 

   

 _Section 8_. _Meetings by Telephone._ Members of the Board may participate in and act at any meeting of the Board through the use of a conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the meeting can hear each other.
