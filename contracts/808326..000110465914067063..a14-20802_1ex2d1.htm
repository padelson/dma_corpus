Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank account
designated by Seller in writing not fewer than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date an amount in cash equal to $150,000,000 (the " _Preliminary
Purchase Price_ "). The Final Purchase Price is the Preliminary Purchase
Price, as it may be adjusted in accordance with _Section 3.2_.

 



 

3.2 _Working Capital Adjustment_.

 



 

(a) _Preparation of the Final Net Working Capital Statement._

 



 

(i) As soon as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Purchaser shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement (the "
_Proposed Net Working Capital Statement_ ") setting forth Purchasers
calculation of the Net Working Capital as of immediately prior to the Closing
(the " _Closing Working Capital_ ").

 



 

(ii) If Seller disagrees with Purchasers calculation of Closing Working
Capital, Seller shall promptly, but in no event later than thirty (30) days
after receiving the Proposed Net Working Capital Statement (the " _Review
Period_ "), deliver to Purchaser written notice describing in reasonable
detail and with appropriate supporting documentation its calculation of the
Net Working Capital and its dispute by specifying those items or amounts as to
which Seller disagrees, together with Sellers determination of such disputed
items and amounts (a " _Dispute Notice_ "); _provided_ that Seller shall be
deemed to have agreed with all items and amounts that are not disputed in the
Dispute Notice. If Seller fails to deliver a Dispute Notice within the Review
Period, Seller and Purchaser agree that the Proposed Net Working Capital
Statement shall be deemed to set forth the Final Net Working Capital. If
Seller delivers a Dispute Notice to Purchaser within the Review Period,
Purchaser and Seller will use reasonable good faith efforts to resolve the
dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date Seller delivers the
Dispute Notice to Purchaser. If Seller and Purchaser are not able to resolve
all disputed items within such 30-day period, then the items remaining in
dispute shall be submitted immediately to McGladrey LLP or, if such firm is
unable or unwilling to serve in such capacity, then such jointly selected
independent nationally recognized firm with no existing or former business
relationship with any Party hereto mutually agreeable to Seller and Purchaser
(the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The Accounting Firm shall be given reasonable
access to all relevant

 



      
 

 



 

records of Purchaser and Seller to calculate the Closing Working Capital. If
any remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution, each of Seller and Purchaser will be afforded an opportunity to
present to the Accounting Firm any material relating to the determination of
the matters in dispute and to discuss such matters with the Accounting Firm.
The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to
calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Seller, on the one hand,
and Purchaser, on the other, and not by independent investigation, the Net
Working Capital and shall be instructed that its calculation (A) must be made
in accordance with GAAP applied in accordance with Sellers accounting
practices and on a basis consistent with the preparation of the Statement of
Net Working Capital attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ , and (B) with respect to
each item in dispute, must be within the range of values established for such
amount as determined by reference to the value assigned to such amount by
Seller in the Dispute Notice and by Purchaser in the Proposed Net Working
Capital Statement. The Accounting Firm shall submit such calculation to
Purchaser and Seller as soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty
(30) days after the remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the
Accounting Firm. The determination by the Accounting Firm of the Closing
Working Capital, as set forth in a written notice delivered to Seller and
Purchaser by the Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement absent
manifest error will be binding and conclusive on Seller and Purchaser. Closing
Working Capital as finally determined in accordance with this _Section
3.2(a)(ii)_ is referred to herein as the " _Final Net Working Capital_."

 



 

(iii) In the event Seller and Purchaser submit any unresolved objections to an
Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_ above, the
fees and expenses of such Accounting Firm will be shared equally between
Seller and Purchaser.

 



 

(iv) Purchaser shall make its financial records available to Seller and its
accountants and other representatives, and Seller shall make its financial
records available to Purchaser and its accountants and other representatives,
in each case, at reasonable times during the period beginning on the Closing
Date and ending on the date of the final determination of Final Net Working
Capital pursuant to _Section 3.2(a)(ii)_ above, subject to customary
indemnification and other agreements that may be requested by representatives
of the Parties.

 



 

(b) _Net Working Capital Adjustment_.

 



 

(i) If (A) the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)(ii)_ above equals or exceeds the Reference Net Working Capital or (B)
the Reference Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Net Working Capital, in
either case by an amount equal to or less than the Collar Amount, then, in
either case, there shall be no adjustment of the Preliminary Purchase Price
pursuant to this _Section 3.2(b)_ ;

 



 

(ii) If the Final Net Working Capital as determined pursuant to _Section
3.2(a)(ii)_ above is greater than the Reference Net Working Capital by more
than the Collar Amount or less than the Reference Net Working Capital by more
than the Collar Amount, the Preliminary Purchase Price will be adjusted as
follows:

 



 

(A) If the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the Reference Net Working Capital
by more than the Collar Amount, Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
Seller, the amount

 



       
 

 



 

by which the Final Net Working Capital exceeds the sum of (x) the Reference
Net Working Capital _plus_ (y) the Collar Amount; and

 



 

(B) If the Reference Net Working Capital exceeds the Final Net Working Capital
by more than the Collar Amount, Seller shall pay to Purchaser, by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to one or more accounts designated by
Purchaser, the amount by which the Reference Net Working Capital exceeds the
sum of (x) the Final Net Working Capital _plus_ (y) the Collar Amount.

 



 

3.3 _Transferred Employee Accrual_.

 



 

(a) As soon as practicable, but no later than ninety (90) days after the
Closing Date, Seller shall prepare and deliver to Purchaser a statement (the "
_Proposed Transferred Employee Accrual Statement_ ") setting forth Sellers
calculation of the Transferred Employee Accrual as of immediately prior to the
Closing (the " _Closing Transferred Employee Accrual_ ").

 



 

(b) If Purchaser disagrees with Sellers calculation of the Closing
Transferred Employee Accrual, Purchaser shall promptly, but in no event later
than thirty (30) days after receiving the Proposed Transferred Employee
Accrual Statement (the " _Transferred Employee Accrual Review Period_ "),
deliver to Seller written notice describing in reasonable detail and with
appropriate supporting documentation its calculation of the Transferred
Employee Accrual and its dispute by specifying those items or amounts as to
which Purchaser disagrees, together with Purchasers determination of such
disputed items and amounts (a " _Transferred Employee Accrual Dispute Notice_
"); _provided_ that Purchaser shall be deemed to have agreed with all items
and amounts that are not disputed in the Transferred Employee Accrual Dispute
Notice. If Purchaser fails to deliver a Transferred Employee Accrual Dispute
Notice within the Transferred Employee Accrual Review Period, Purchaser and
Seller agree that the Proposed Transferred Employee Accrual Statement shall be
deemed to set forth the Final Transferred Employee Accrual. If Purchaser
delivers a Transferred Employee Accrual Dispute Notice to Seller within the
Transferred Employee Accrual Review Period, Seller and Purchaser will use
reasonable good faith efforts to resolve the dispute during the 30-day period
commencing on the date Purchaser delivers the Transferred Employee Accrual
Dispute Notice to Seller. If Purchaser and Seller are not able to resolve all
disputed items within such 30-day period, then the items remaining in dispute
shall be submitted immediately to the Accounting Firm. The Accounting Firm
shall be given reasonable access to all relevant records of Seller and
Purchaser to calculate the Closing Transferred Employee Accrual. If any
remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm for
resolution, each of Purchaser and Seller will be afforded an opportunity to
present to the Accounting Firm any material relating to the determination of
the matters in dispute and to discuss such matters with the Accounting Firm.
The Accounting Firm shall act as an expert and not as an arbitrator to
calculate, based solely on the written submissions of Purchaser, on the one
hand, and Seller, on the other, and not by independent investigation, the
Transferred Employee Accrual and shall be instructed that its calculation (A)
must be made in accordance with GAAP applied in accordance with Sellers
accounting practices and on a basis consistent with the preparation of the
Financial Statements, and (B) with respect to each item in dispute, must be
within the range of values established for such amount as determined by
reference to the value assigned to such amount by Purchaser in the Transferred
Employee Accrual Dispute Notice and by Seller in the Proposed Transferred
Employee Accrual Statement.

 



      
 

 



 

The Accounting Firm shall submit such calculation to Seller and Purchaser as
soon as practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days after the
remaining issues in dispute are submitted to the Accounting Firm. The
determination by the Accounting Firm of the Closing Transferred Employee
Accrual, as set forth in a written notice delivered to Purchaser and Seller by
the Accounting Firm in accordance with this Agreement absent manifest error
will be binding and conclusive on Purchaser and Seller. The Closing
Transferred Employee Accrual as finally determined in accordance with this
_Section 3.3(b)_ is referred to herein as the " _Final Transferred Employee
Accrual_." Purchaser shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one or more accounts designated by Seller, the amount of
the Final Transferred Employee Accrual.

 



 

(c) In the event Seller and Purchaser submit any unresolved objections to an
Accounting Firm for resolution as provided in _Section 3.3(b)_ above, the fees
and expenses of such Accounting Firm will be shared equally between Seller and
Purchaser.

 



 

(d) Seller shall make its financial records available to Purchaser and its
accountants and other representatives, and Purchaser shall make its financial
records available to Seller and its accountants and other representatives, in
each case, at reasonable times during the period beginning on the Closing Date
and ending on the date of the final determination of the Final Transferred
Employee Accrual pursuant to _Section 3.3(b)_ above, subject to customary
indemnification and other agreements that may be requested by representatives
of the Parties.

 



 

3.4 _Purchase Price Adjustment_. The Preliminary Purchase Price shall be
adjusted in accordance with the aggregate amount paid (i) to Seller pursuant
to _Section 3.2(b)(ii)(A)_ and/or _Section 3.3(b)_ , which amount shall
increase the Preliminary Purchase Price, or (ii) to Purchaser pursuant to
_Section 3.2(b)(ii)(B)_ , which amount shall reduce the Preliminary Purchase
Price. The Preliminary Purchase Price as it may be adjusted pursuant to this
_Section 3.4_ is referred to herein as the " _Final Purchase Price_."

 



 

3.5 _Purchase Price Allocation_.

 



 

(a) Within thirty (30) Business Days after the later to occur of the
determination of the Final Net Working Capital and the Final Transferred
Employee Accrual in accordance with the provisions of _Sections 3.2(a)_ and
_3.3_ , respectively, Purchaser shall provide to Seller an allocation of the
Final Purchase Price among the Purchased Assets (the " _Allocation_ "). The
Allocation shall be prepared by Purchaser in accordance with Section 1060 of
the Code. Seller shall be entitled to review and comment on such schedule for
thirty (30) Business Days, and Purchaser shall consider such comments in good

of the Seller Disclosure Schedule pertaining to representations and warranties
shall be deemed disclosure with respect to any other section or subsection of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule pertaining to representations and warranties to
which the relevance of such item is reasonably apparent), Seller hereby
represents and warrants to Purchaser as follows:

 



 

5.1 _Organization, Authority and Qualification_.

 



 

(a) Seller is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of New Jersey and has all necessary
corporate power and authority to enter into, execute and deliver this
Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Seller Shareholder Approval (as
defined herein), to carry out its obligations hereunder and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution, delivery and performance by
Seller of this Agreement and the consummation by Seller of the transactions
contemplated hereby are within Sellers corporate powers and have been duly
authorized and approved by the board of directors of Seller, and except for
obtaining the Seller Shareholder Approval, no other corporate action on the
part of Seller is necessary to authorize and approve the execution, delivery
and performance by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation by it of the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by Seller, and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery
by Purchaser, constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Seller,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, subject in each case to
the effect of any applicable bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency,
moratorium, rehabilitation, liquidation, fraudulent conveyance, preferential
transfer or similar Laws now or hereafter in effect relating to or affecting
creditors rights and remedies generally and subject, as to enforceability, to
the effect of general equitable principles (regardless of whether enforcement
is sought in a proceeding in equity or at law).

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The board of directors of Seller, at a meeting duly called and held,
acting unanimously, has (i) approved the execution, delivery and performance
by Seller of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser,
(ii) determined that it is in the best interests of Seller and its
shareholders to enter into this Agreement, (iii) resolved, subject to _Section
7.4_ hereof, to recommend that the shareholders of Seller approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the sale of the
Purchased Assets to Purchaser (the " _Seller Board Recommendation_ ") and (iv)
directed that such matters be submitted to Sellers shareholders for their
approval.

 



 

(c) The affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the votes cast by the
holders of the outstanding shares of Common Stock of Seller (" _Common Stock_
") at the meeting of Sellers shareholders to be held in connection with the
sale of the Purchased Assets to Purchaser (the " _Seller Shareholder Meeting_
"), voting together as a single class, entitled to vote on the approval of
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, including the sale of
the Purchased Assets to Purchaser (the " _Seller Shareholder Approval_ "), is
the only vote or approval of the holders of any class or series of capital
stock of Seller or any of its Affiliates which is necessary to approve this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. The Common Stock is the
only class of capital stock of Seller entitled to vote on the sale of the
Purchased Assets and the transactions contemplated hereunder. Neither Seller
nor any of its Subsidiaries has any outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or
other obligations, the holders of which have the right to vote (or that are
convertible into or exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with
the holders of the Common Stock on any matter. None of the holders of any
class or series of capital stock of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries has a
right to dissent pursuant to the New Jersey Business Corporation Act in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereunder.

respect to each Purchased Subsidiary, its authorized capital stock or other
equity interests and the amount of such capital stock or other equity
interests validly issued and outstanding as of the date of this Agreement
(such issued and outstanding equity interests, the " _Purchased Subsidiaries
Equity Interests_ "). All of the Purchased Subsidiaries Equity Interests are
owned by Seller, and no other Person has any right or claim to any of the
Purchased Subsidiaries Equity Interests whether through ownership of
securities, Contract or otherwise. All outstanding Purchased Subsidiaries
Equity Interests have been duly authorized and validly issued and are free of
preemptive rights.

Schedule, none of the Purchased Subsidiaries has any assets, liabilities or

and that all Consents and other actions described in _Section 5.3_ and
_Section 5.10(a)_ have been obtained and except as may result from any facts

reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material
Adverse Effect.

review and analysis of the Business and the Purchased Assets and acknowledges
that Purchaser has been provided access to the personnel, properties, assets,
premises, books and records, and other documents and data of Seller and its
Affiliates for this purpose. In entering into this Agreement, Purchaser has
relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis, and Purchaser
acknowledges that, except for the representations and warranties of Seller
expressly set forth in _Article 5_ , neither Seller nor any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents or advisors or any other Person makes any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any of the information provided or made available to Purchaser
or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, except for the representations and
warranties of Seller expressly set forth in _Article 5_. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, neither Seller nor any of its directors,
officers, employees, agents or advisors or any other Person makes any
representation or warranty, either express or implied, as to the accuracy or
completeness of any of the information provided or made available to Purchaser
or any of its directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, neither Seller nor any of its
directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors or any other Person has
made a representation or warranty to Purchaser with respect to any material,
documents or information relating to the Purchased Assets made available to
Purchaser or its directors, officers, employees, agents or advisors in any

except as expressly and specifically covered by a representation or warranty

 ** _ARTICLE 7_**

 



 

 ** _ADDITIONAL COVENANTS AND AGREEMENTS_**

 



 

7.1 _Seller Shareholder Meeting_. Seller shall, as promptly as practicable
following the execution of this Agreement, establish a record date for, duly
call, give notice of, convene and hold the Seller Shareholder Meeting. Subject
to _Section 7.4_ , Seller shall, through its board of directors, recommend to
its shareholders approval of this Agreement and the sale of the Purchased
Assets and shall include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Sellers obligations pursuant to the
first sentence of this _Section 7.1_ shall not be affected by (i) the
disclosure or communication (publicly or otherwise) to Seller of any
Alternative Transaction Proposal or (ii) the withdrawal or modification by the
board of directors of Seller or any committee thereof of such board of
directors or such committees approval or recommendation of this Agreement or
the sale of the Purchased Assets. If a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change
shall have occurred and thereafter the board of directors shall recommend this
Agreement and the sale of the Purchased Assets (a " _Reinstated
Recommendation_ "), Seller shall not hold or shall adjourn the Seller
Shareholder Meeting until not less than ten (10) calendar days after the date
of such Reinstated Recommendation. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, Seller may postpone or adjourn the Seller Shareholder Meeting
(a) with the prior written consent of Purchaser, (b) for the absence of a
quorum, (c) with Purchasers prior written consent, to allow reasonable
additional time for any supplemental or amended disclosure which Seller has
determined in good faith (after consultation with outside counsel) is
reasonably necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or amended
disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by Sellers shareholders prior to
the Seller Shareholder Meeting or (d) with Purchasers prior written consent,
to allow additional solicitation of votes in order to obtain the Seller
Shareholder Approval.

 



 

7.2 _Proxy Statement_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
execution of this Agreement (and, in any case, within twenty (20) Business
Days), Seller shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement relating
to the approval by the shareholders of Seller of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby (the " _Proxy Statement_ ") and Seller and
Purchaser shall use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to
cooperate with each other in connection with the preparation of the Proxy
Statement. Seller and Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any comments received from
the SEC or its staff concerning the Proxy Statement and Seller shall cause the
Proxy Statement to be mailed to the shareholders of Seller as promptly as
practicable after the resolution of any such comments. Purchaser shall furnish
all information as may be reasonably requested by Seller in connection with
the preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, and no filing
of, or amendment or supplement to, the Proxy Statement, or any response to any
comments of the SEC with respect thereto, will be made by Seller, in each case
without providing Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
thereon. If at any time prior to the Closing any information relating to
Purchaser, or any of its Affiliates, directors

 



      
 

 



 

or officers, should be discovered by Seller which should be set forth in an
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement, so that such document would
not include any misstatement of material fact or omit to state any material
fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances
under which they are made, not misleading, Seller shall promptly notify
Purchaser and an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such
information shall be promptly filed with the SEC and, to the extent required
by Applicable Law or the SEC, disseminated to the shareholders of Seller.
Seller shall notify Purchaser promptly of the receipt of any comments from the
SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy
Statement or for additional information and shall supply Purchaser with copies
of all correspondence between it or any of its Representatives, on the one
hand, and the SEC or staff of the SEC, on the other hand, with respect to the
Proxy Statement or the sale of the Purchased Assets.

this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or as otherwise waived or consented
to in writing by Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

Purchased Assets, except for the acquisition of assets in the ordinary course
of business consistent with past practice;

 



 

(iii) (A) increase the compensation or fringe benefits of any present or

pay to any present or former officer or employee of the Business (except in

the date of this Agreement;

a whole; (B) voluntarily terminate any Material Contract that has not expired

connection with any change of insurance coverage by Seller that applies to
Seller as a whole, or to one of more of the Sellers business units, or that
otherwise is not directed at the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities ( _provided_ that such change does not result in a material gap in
coverage of the Business, the Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities);

 



 

(vi) pay, release, discharge, settle, compromise or satisfy any claim,

value exceeding $150,000; or (B) that would reasonably be expected to

 _provided_ , _however_ , except as expressly provided in this _Section 7.3_ ,
nothing in this _Section 7.3_ shall (A) prohibit Seller or its Affiliates from
conducting their businesses, including the Business, in their reasonable
discretion or (B) give Purchaser, directly or indirectly, the right to control
or direct the operations of Seller prior to Closing.

 



 

7.4 _No Solicitation; Change in Recommendation_.

 



 

(a) Seller and its Subsidiaries shall, and shall direct their respective
Representatives to, cease and cause to be terminated any discussions or
negotiations with any Person conducted heretofore with respect to an
Alternative Transaction Proposal. Except as otherwise expressly permitted by
this _Section 7.4_ , Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not, and shall use
their reasonable best efforts to cause their Representatives not to, directly
or indirectly (A) initiate, solicit or encourage (including by way of
furnishing non-public information), or take any other action to facilitate,
any inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer (including any
proposal or offer to Sellers shareholders) that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to result in, an Alternative Transaction Proposal, (B)
engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding an Alternative Transaction Proposal, (C) agree to,
approve, endorse, recommend or consummate an Alternative Transaction Proposal,
(D) enter into any Seller Acquisition Agreement, (E) take any action to

Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as amended, or (F) resolve, propose or
agree, or authorize or permit any Representative, to do any of the foregoing.
Seller acknowledges and agrees that doing any of the foregoing by any
Representative of Seller or any of its Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a
breach by Seller of this _Section 7.4(a)_. Seller shall, within two (2)
Business Days after the date of this Agreement, promptly request each Person
that has heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with
such Persons

 



      
 

 



 

consideration of acquiring the Purchased Assets to return (or, if permitted by
the applicable confidentiality agreement, destroy) all information required to
be returned (or, if applicable, destroyed) by such Person under the terms of
the applicable confidentiality agreement and, if requested by Purchaser, to
enforce such Persons obligation to do so and Seller shall immediately
terminate all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to
any such Person or its Representatives.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.4(a)_ ,
but subject to Sellers compliance in all material respects with the other
provisions of this _Section 7.4_ , if the board of directors of Seller
receives an unsolicited, written bona fide Alternative Transaction Proposal
from a Person, that did not arise from a breach of this _Section 7.4_ , after
the date of this Agreement and prior to the date Seller obtains the Seller
Shareholder Approval that the board of directors of Seller (or a committee
thereof) determines, after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel and
an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation,
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal,
then, prior to obtaining the Seller Shareholder Approval, Seller may (i)
furnish pursuant to an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement any information
with respect to Seller and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such
Alternative Transaction Proposal, provided that any such information must be
provided to Purchaser simultaneously with or promptly following its provision
to such Person to the extent reasonably practicable and not previously made
available to Purchaser, and (ii) participate in discussions and negotiations
with such Person regarding an Alternative Transaction Proposal if, but only
if, prior to taking the actions described in either of clause (i) or (ii), the
board of directors of Seller (or a committee thereof) (A) after receiving
advice from Sellers outside legal counsel, determines in good faith that the
failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
Seller and its shareholders under applicable Law and (B) obtains from such
Person an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and, substantially
simultaneously with its execution, delivers to Purchaser a copy of such
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, "
_Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any confidentiality agreement
entered into after the date of this Agreement that contains confidentiality
and standstill provisions that are no less favorable in the aggregate to
Seller than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined
herein).

 



 

(c) Seller shall promptly (and in any event within one (1) Business Day after
receipt by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives), notify Purchaser of the receipt of any Alternative
Transaction Proposal or any inquiries relating to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal or any request for information from, or any negotiations sought to be
initiated or continued with, either Seller or its Representatives concerning
an Alternative Transaction Proposal. Sellers notice shall include (i) a copy
of any written Alternative Transaction Proposal and any other documents
provided to Seller or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such Alternative
Transaction Proposal or (ii) in respect of any Alternative Transaction
Proposal, any inquiry relating to an Alternative Transaction Proposal or any
request for information relating to an Alternative Transaction Proposal not
made in writing, a written summary of the material terms of such Alternative
Transaction Proposal, inquiry or request, including the identity of the Person
or group of Persons making the Alternative Transaction Proposal, inquiry or
request. Seller shall keep Purchaser reasonably informed on a prompt basis
(and in any event within one (1) Business Day) of the status or developments
regarding any Alternative Transaction Proposal, inquiry or request, including
any discussions with respect to or

 



      
 

 



 

amendments or proposed amendments thereto. Other than a Seller Acquisition
Agreement entered into in accordance with this Agreement, none of Seller or
any of its Subsidiaries shall, after the date of this Agreement, enter into
any agreement, including an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, that would
prohibit it from satisfying its obligations under this Agreement or grant any
Person exclusive rights to negotiate with Seller. Seller shall provide
Purchaser with at least forty-eight (48) hours prior written notice of any
meeting of the board of directors of Seller (or a committee thereof) at which
the board of directors of Seller (or a committee thereof) is reasonably
expected to consider any proposal, inquiry, offer or request with respect
thereto (or any lesser advance notice otherwise provided to members of the
board of directors of Seller (or a committee thereof) in respect of such
meeting).

 



 

(d) Except as expressly permitted by _Section 7.4(e)_ and subject to _Section
7.4(f)_ , the board of directors of Seller (or a committee thereof) shall not
(i) (A) change, qualify, withdraw, modify or fail to make, or propose to
change, qualify, withdraw or modify (publicly or otherwise), in a manner
adverse to Purchaser, the Seller Board Recommendation, (B) make any public
statement or take any public action inconsistent with the Seller Board
Recommendation, (C) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to approve or
recommend to the shareholders of Seller an Alternative Transaction Proposal or
(D) take formal action or make any recommendation or public statement in
connection with a tender offer or exchange offer not conditioned on the sale
of the Business pursuant to this Agreement other than (1) a recommendation, in
a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against such offer
within ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such offer and in any
event within two (2) Business Days prior to the Seller Shareholder Meeting or
(2) a "stop, look and listen" communication by the Seller Board pursuant to
Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a " _Seller Adverse Recommendation Change_ "); _provided_
, _however_ , that any public statement other than a "stop, look and listen"
statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or
a recommendation against acceptance of such tender or exchange offer shall be
deemed to be a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change or (ii) authorize Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into any letter of intent, term sheet,
merger, acquisition or other agreement or arrangement with respect to, or
which may reasonably be expected to lead to or otherwise further, any
Alternative Transaction Proposal (other than an Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement permitted under _Section 7.4(b)_ ) (a " _Seller Acquisition
Agreement_ ").

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, but subject to the
provisions of _Section 7.4(f)_ , prior to obtaining the Seller Shareholder
Approval, the board of directors of Seller (or a committee thereof) may make a
Seller Adverse Recommendation Change (i) if the board of directors of Seller
receives an unsolicited, written bona fide Alternative Transaction Proposal
that did not arise or result from any breach of this _Section 7.4_ and that
has not been withdrawn that the board of directors of Seller (or a committee
thereof), after receiving the advice of outside legal counsel, determines in
good faith (A) after also receiving the advice of independent financial
advisors of nationally recognized reputation, constitutes a Superior Proposal
and (B) that the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
shall not enter into a Seller Acquisition Agreement unless this Agreement
shall have been terminated by Seller in accordance with _Section 11.1(i)_ and
the Seller Termination Fee has been paid in accordance with _Section 11.3(b)_
; or (ii) if an Intervening Event shall have occurred, if the board of
directors of

 



      
 

 



 

Seller (or a committee thereof), after receiving the advice of outside legal
counsel, determines in good faith that, in light of such Intervening Event,
the failure to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) Seller shall not be entitled to effect a Seller Adverse Recommendation
Change, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(i)_ or enter into a
Seller Acquisition Agreement unless (i) Seller has complied in all material
respects with this _Section 7.4_ , (ii) Seller has provided written notice (a
" _Notice of Seller Adverse Recommendation Change_ ") to Purchaser that Seller
intends to take such action and describing the material terms and conditions
of the purported Superior Proposal or the event constituting an Intervening
Event, as applicable, that is the basis of such action, including, if
applicable, with such Notice of Seller Adverse Recommendation Change a copy of
the relevant proposed transaction agreements with the party making such
purported Superior Proposal and other material documents, including any equity
and debt commitment letters and any other material documents related to the
financing of such Superior Proposal, and (iii) following the end of the four
(4) Business Day period following Purchasers receipt of the Notice of Seller
Adverse Recommendation Change, (x) if such proposed Seller Adverse
Recommendation Change is in response to a purported Superior Proposal, the
board of directors of Seller shall have determined in good faith, taking into
account any changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed by Purchaser to
Seller in response to the Notice of Seller Adverse Recommendation Change or
otherwise (the " _Revised Transaction Proposal_ "), after having received the
advice of an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and outside counsel, that such Alternative Transaction Proposal remains a
Superior Proposal with respect to the Revised Transaction Proposal and (y) if
such proposed Seller Adverse Recommendation Change is in response to an
Intervening Event, the board of directors of Seller, after consultation with
Sellers outside legal counsel, shall have determined in good faith that
failure to make a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change would be inconsistent
with the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that
during any such four (4) Business Day period (or any extension thereof),
Seller shall negotiate in good faith with Purchaser (to the extent Purchaser
desires to negotiate) regarding any Revised Transaction Proposal. Any
substantive amendment to the terms of such Superior Proposal shall require a
new Notice of Seller Adverse Recommendation Change and Seller shall be
required to comply again with the requirements of this _Section 7.4(f)_ (
_provided_ , _however_ , that references to the four (4) Business Day period
above shall be deemed to be references to a three (3) Business Day period).

 



 

(g) Nothing in this _Section 7.4_ shall prohibit the board of directors of
Seller (or a committee thereof) from taking and disclosing to the shareholders
of Seller a position on any tender or exchange offer, if the board of
directors of Seller (or a committee thereof) determines, after consultation
with outside legal counsel, that failure to so disclose such position would
constitute a violation of applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
board of directors of Seller (or a committee thereof) shall not recommend that
the shareholders of Seller tender their shares in connection with any tender
or exchange offer (or otherwise approve or recommend any Alternative
Transaction Proposal) or effect a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change, unless
in each case the applicable requirements of _Section 7.4(f)_ shall have been
satisfied. In addition, it is understood and agreed that, for purposes of this
Agreement (including _Article 11_ ), a factually accurate public statement by
Seller that describes Sellers receipt of an Alternative Transaction Proposal
and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto, or any "stop, look
and listen"

 



       
 

 



 

communication or any similar communication to the shareholders of Seller,
shall not, in and of itself, constitute a Seller Adverse Recommendation Change
or an approval or recommendation with respect to any Alternative Transaction
Proposal.

 



 

(h) As used in this Agreement, " _Alternative Transaction Proposal_ " shall
mean any bona fide proposal or offer from any Person or group (as defined
under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) (other
than Purchaser and its Affiliates) relating to, in a single transaction or
series of related transactions, any (i) acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or
more of the Purchased Assets or Purchased Assets to which twenty percent (20%)
or more of Sellers revenues or earnings associated with the Business are
attributable, (ii) acquisition of twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of
Common Stock or other equity securities of Seller, (iii) tender offer or
exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any Person or group
beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of Common Stock
or other equity securities of Seller, or (iv) merger, consolidation, share
exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction involving Seller.

 



 

(i) As used in this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any
unsolicited, written bona fide Alternative Transaction Proposal on terms which
the board of directors of Seller determines in good faith, after having
received the advice of Sellers outside legal counsel and independent
financial advisors of nationally recognized reputation, to be more favorable,
from a financial point of view, to the holders of Common Stock than the sale
of the Purchased Assets pursuant to this Agreement, taking into account all of
the terms and conditions of such proposal (including all legal and regulatory
aspects of such proposal, including the likelihood and timing of consummation
thereof) and this Agreement (including any Revised Transaction Proposal);
provided, however, that for purposes of the definition of "Superior Proposal,"
the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the definition of Alternative
Transaction Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty percent
(50%)." For purposes of this Agreement, Raymond James and Associates, Inc. shall
be deemed to be an independent financial advisor of nationally recognized
reputation.

 



 

(j) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 7.4(a)_ ,
but subject to Sellers compliance in all material respects with the other
provisions of this _Section 7.4_ , (i) upon receipt by Seller of an
Alternative Transaction Proposal from a Person, Seller and its Representatives
may contact such Person solely in order to clarify and understand the terms
and conditions of any Alternative Transaction Proposal made by such Person so
as to determine whether such Alternative Transaction Proposal constitutes or
would reasonably be expected to result in a Superior Proposal.

 



 

(k) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this _Section 7.4_
or elsewhere in this Agreement, the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ shall not
apply to (i) the sale or disposition by way of asset sale (including a sale of
equity securities of any Subsidiary) of any part, or all, of Sellers Other
Businesses so long as clause (i) of the definition of Alternative Transaction
Proposal is not satisfied or (ii) any transaction that is conditioned on the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including,
without limitation, any investment in or tender offer for Common Stock or
other equity securities of Seller or any merger, consolidation,
recapitalization or other business combination involving Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries or any sale of all or substantially all of the assets of Seller
and its Subsidiaries.

 



      
 

 



 

7.5 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the Closing, upon reasonable notice, Seller
shall: (i) afford Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources, the Mezzanine
Financing Sources and their respective Representatives reasonable access to
the properties and Books, Records and Files of the Business (including access
to conduct Phase I environmental site assessments but not intrusive soil
testing), and (ii) furnish to the Representatives of Purchaser, the Debt
Financing Sources and the Mezzanine Financing Sources such additional
financial and operating data and other information regarding the Business (or
copies thereof) as Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources or the Mezzanine
Financing Sources may from time to time reasonably request; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any such access or furnishing of information shall be
conducted at Purchasers expense, during normal business hours and in such a
manner as not to interfere with the normal operations of the Business or any
of Sellers Other Businesses. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, Seller shall not be required to disclose any information to
Purchaser, the Debt Financing Sources or the Mezzanine Financing Sources if
such disclosure would be reasonably likely to (x) cause significant
competitive harm to the Business if the transactions contemplated hereby are
not consummated, (y) jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege
(but only if such privilege is asserted in good faith and after using
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not
waive such privilege) or (z) contravene any applicable Laws, fiduciary duty or
binding agreement entered into prior to the date hereof (after using
reasonable best efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not
contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement), and in no
event shall Seller or any of its respective Affiliates be required to provide
access to or copies of any income Tax Returns of Seller or any such Affiliate.

 



 

(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, dated as of February 20, 2014,
between Purchaser and Seller (as amended, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_
"), shall continue in full force and effect until the Closing, at which time
such Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations of Purchaser under this
_Section 7.5(b)_ shall terminate; _provided_ , _however_ , that, from and
after the Closing, except as would have been permitted under the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its officers,
directors, employees, authorized representatives and Affiliates to, treat and
hold as confidential, and not disclose to any Person the Confidential
Information relating to Seller and the Excluded Assets and Sellers Other
Businesses. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the
Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force and
effect.

 



 

(c) Nothing provided to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_ shall in any
way amend or diminish Purchasers obligations under the Confidentiality
Agreement. Purchaser acknowledges and agrees, subject to _Section 7.5(b)_ ,
that any Evaluation Material (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement)
provided to Purchaser pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_ or otherwise by or on
behalf of Seller or any officer, director, employee or authorized
representative shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 



 

(d) For a period of three (3) years after the Closing, for so long as the
information or data retained by Seller and its Affiliates and primarily
relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed Liabilities
constitutes confidential or proprietary information (the " _Business
Proprietary Information_ "), Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
treat and

 



      
 

 



 

hold as confidential all such Business Proprietary Information. If Seller or
any of its Affiliates is required (by written request for information or
documents in any legal proceeding, interrogatory, subpoena, civil
investigative demand or similar process or by Law) to disclose any Business
Proprietary Information, it shall notify Purchaser promptly of the request or
requirement so that Purchaser, at its expense, may seek an appropriate
protective order or waive compliance with this _Section 7.5(d)_. If, in the
absence of a protective order or receipt of a waiver hereunder, Seller or any
of its Affiliates is legally compelled to disclose such Business Proprietary
Information, Seller or any such Affiliates shall (x) furnish only that portion
of the Business Proprietary Information that is legally required to be
disclosed and (y) request that confidential treatment be accorded such
Business Proprietary Information. From and after the Closing, except as
otherwise permitted by the terms of this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement,
Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, cease all use of the Business
Proprietary Information. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
_Section 7.5(d)_ shall not prohibit the disclosure of the Business Proprietary
Information by Seller or its Affiliates to the extent reasonably required (i)
to prepare or complete any required Tax Returns or financial statements; (ii)
in connection with audits or other proceedings by or on behalf of a
Governmental Authority; (iii) to comply with Law; or (iv) in connection with
asserting any rights or remedies or performing any obligations under this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this _Section
7.5(d)_ shall not apply to information that (A) has been, is or becomes
publicly available other than as a result of a disclosure by Seller or its
Affiliates; or (B) is or becomes available to Seller or such Affiliates on a
non-confidential basis from a source that, to Sellers Knowledge, or such
Affiliates knowledge, is not prohibited from disclosing such information by a
legal, contractual or fiduciary obligation.

 



 

7.6 _Regulatory and Other Authorizations; Notices and Consents_.

 



 

(a) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain promptly all Consents of all Governmental Authorities that may be or
become necessary for the performance of its and the other Partys obligations
pursuant to, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements including, without limitation, Consents
that may be required under the HSR Act or other Competition Law. Seller and
Purchaser shall cooperate with one another in promptly seeking to obtain all
such Consents. If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Competition Law or if any suit or proceeding is
instituted or threatened by any Governmental Authority or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Competition Law, each of Purchaser and Seller shall use its reasonable best
efforts to promptly resolve such objections. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this _Section 7.6_ , except as otherwise may be mutually agreed to
by the Parties, nothing in this Agreement shall require or obligate Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates to, and Seller shall not and shall not permit their
Subsidiaries to, without the prior written consent of Purchaser, agree or
otherwise be required to sell, divest, dispose of, license, hold separate, or
take or commit to take any action that limits in any respect its freedom of
action after the Closing with respect to, or its ability to retain after the
Closing, any businesses, products, rights, services, licenses, or assets of
Purchaser, Seller or any of their respective Affiliates, as applicable.

 



 

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, to the extent
required by applicable Competition Law, each party hereto agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a

 



      
 

 



 

notification and report form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby (which filing shall request early termination
of the waiting period under the HSR Act) as promptly as practicable and in any
event within ten (10) Business Days from the date hereof, or such other time
as mutually agreed to by the parties, and to supply as promptly as practicable
any additional information and documentary material that may be requested
pursuant to the HSR Act and use its commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all other actions consistent with this _Section 7.6_
necessary to cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting
periods under the HSR Act (including any extensions thereof) as soon as
practicable. Filing fees with respect to such filings and notifications shall
be borne by Purchaser.

 



 

(c) Each Party shall promptly notify the other Party of any communication it
or any of its Affiliates receives from any Governmental Authority relating to
the matters that are the subject of this Agreement and permit the other Party
to review in advance any proposed communication by such Party to any
Governmental Authority relating to the matters that are the subject of this
Agreement. Neither Party shall agree to participate in any meeting with any
Governmental Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other
inquiry related to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including
any proceedings under or relating to the HSR Act or other Competition Law)
unless it consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other Party the
opportunity to attend and participate at such meeting. Subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties shall coordinate and cooperate fully
with each other in exchanging such information and providing such assistance
as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the foregoing;
_provided_ that, notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party to
this Agreement shall be under an obligation to disclose confidential
information with respect to its Affiliates to (x) any other Party or (y) any
Governmental Authority except where such confidential information is afforded
confidential treatment. Subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, the Parties
shall provide each other with copies of all correspondence, filings or
communications between them or any of their representatives, on the one hand,
and any Governmental Authority or members of its staff, on the other hand,
with respect to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall have the primary responsibility for securing the transfer,
reissuance or procurement of the Permits listed on _Schedule 2.1(f)_ of the
Seller Disclosure Schedule effective as of the Closing Date. Seller shall
cooperate with Purchasers efforts in this regard, assist in any transfer or
reissuance of such Permits held by Seller or the procurement of any other such
Permits when so requested by Purchaser and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to ensure that all such Permits are available to Purchaser without a
disruption to the Business, including, without limitation, all export and
import licenses that are required for the ongoing operation of the Business.
Sellers commercially reasonable efforts shall include, but not be limited to,
providing copies of all such Permits to Purchaser, providing Purchaser with
all information it requires about unshipped balances and other terms and
conditions of and compliance with such Permits, and engaging with Governmental
Authorities with or as required by Purchaser to secure the transfer or
reissuance of the Permits to Purchaser.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, "reasonable best efforts," "commercially
reasonable efforts" or any substantially similar undertakings shall not
require Purchaser to (i) pay (or agree to pay) more for the Debt Financing or
the Mezzanine Financing (whether in interest

 



      
 

 



 

rate, fees or otherwise) than the terms set forth in the Debt Commitment
Letter or Mezzanine Commitment Letter, as applicable, and any fee letter
entered into by Purchaser in connection with such Debt Commitment Letter or
Mezzanine Commitment Letter, as applicable (after giving effect to any
increase in interest rate, fees or otherwise resulting from any lender
exercising flex provisions contained in such fee letter), (ii) seek more
equity capital than is committed in the Equity Commitment Letter or (iii)
waive any condition or agree to any changes to the Debt Commitment Letter,
Mezzanine Commitment Letter or Equity Commitment Letter.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, "reasonable best efforts," "commercially
reasonable efforts" or any substantially similar undertakings shall not
require Seller to pay (or agree to pay) any fees for obtaining any Consents
other than as specifically set forth herein.

 



 

(g) Seller will cooperate and take all required steps to (i) promptly after
the date hereof file with the U.S. State Department, Directorate of Defense
Trade Controls (" _DDTC_ ") written notice of the transactions contemplated
hereby in accordance with Section 122.4 of the ITAR and (ii) promptly prepare
any amendments or take any other necessary steps, if requested by Purchaser,
to transfer current Permits, including U.S. Government export and import
licenses, agreements and other approvals, to Purchaser or such entity as it
shall designate.

 



 

7.7 _Notifications_. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall give prompt
notice to Purchaser, and Purchaser shall give prompt notice to Seller, of (a)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or from any
Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, (b) any actions, suits,
claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of such
party, threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting
such party or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the transactions
contemplated hereby, (c) in the case of Seller, the occurrence of any event
that would reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Material Adverse Effect, (d) the occurrence of any event or the existence of
any circumstance that would reasonably be expected to result in the failure of
the notifying Party to satisfy a condition specified in Article 10 hereof and
(e) any notice or other communication received by such party relating to any
default under or breach of any Material Contract to which Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party; _provided_ that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 7.7_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 



 

7.8 _Release of Indemnity Obligations_.

 



 

(a) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to replace, effective
as of the Closing, Seller and its Affiliates, to the extent permitted under
Law and applicable financing agreements to which Purchaser is subject, in
respect of all obligations of the Seller and any such Affiliate as obligor
under any Financial Support Arrangements obtained or entered into by Seller or
any such Affiliate for the benefit of the Business. To the extent such
substitution has been effected, Seller and such Affiliates shall from and
after the Closing cease to have any obligation whatsoever arising from or in
connection with such Financial Support Arrangements. To the extent such
substitution has not been effected as of the Closing, Seller shall, and shall
cause such Affiliates to, use commercially reasonable efforts to cause such
Financial Support

 



      
 

 



 

Arrangements to remain in effect, and Purchaser shall promptly reimburse and
indemnify, defend and hold harmless Seller and such Affiliates with respect to
any such Financial Support Arrangements.

 



 

(b) After the Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser, at the request of the
other Party, shall use, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to use,
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent, substitution or
amendment required to novate or assign all Assumed Liabilities to Purchaser
and any Excluded Liabilities to Seller, and obtain in writing the
unconditional release of Seller and its Affiliates with respect to the Assumed
Liabilities and the unconditional release of Purchaser with respect to the
Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

7.9 _Intellectual Property Matters_.

 



 

(a) Except as expressly set forth in this _Section 7.9_ , no interest in or
right to use the name "EMCORE" or any derivation thereof or any other
Trademarks of Seller other than the Trademarks listed on _Schedule 2.1(d)_ of
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (the " _Retained Marks_ "), is being
transferred or licensed to Purchaser pursuant to the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement. Seller hereby grants to Purchaser a limited, worldwide,
non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable, royalty-free license to
use any materials bearing Retained Marks and to sell, transfer and ship any
products or related materials bearing Retained Marks only to the extent: (a)
requested to do so by Seller, (b) displayed on the hardcopy (non-electronic)
form or the softcopy electronic form of such materials delivered to Purchaser
at the Closing or (c) required under Assigned Contracts with customers. The
foregoing license shall expire upon the earliest occurrence of (i) Purchaser
having qualified the use of its Trademarks with each customer, (ii) the end of
life of the applicable product, and (iii) six (6) months after the Closing
Date. The foregoing license is subject to Sellers standard Trademark usage
guidelines, a copy of which has been provided to Purchaser. Within six (6)
months following the expiration of the foregoing license, all materials
bearing any Retained Mark in the possession of Purchaser, any of its
subsidiaries or any of their respective agents shall be promptly destroyed.
Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 7.9_ to the contrary, Purchaser and
its Affiliates shall have the right (A) to retain records and other historical
or archived documents containing or referencing the Retained Marks to the
extent used in the Business or related to the Purchased Assets; (B) when
advisable or necessary, to refer to the historical relationship between the
Business and Purchaser and its Affiliates, on the one hand, and Seller and its
Affiliates, on the other hand (whether in documents or correspondence with
third parties concerning Purchased Assets, regulatory matters, or otherwise);
and (C) to indicate, when advisable or necessary, the Businesss historical
name(s), regardless of whether such name(s) include any of the Retained Marks.

 



 

(b) Promptly after the date hereof, Seller shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to correct the ownership or chain of title discrepancies or errors
identified in the footnotes in _Schedule 5.15(a)_ with the object of
correcting any such discrepancies or errors on or prior to the Closing.

 



 

7.10 _Transition Services_. Seller shall enter into a transition services
agreement with Purchaser and, to the extent applicable, its Affiliates, in
substantially the form attached hereto as _Exhibit F_ and on such other terms
and provisions as the Parties shall mutually agree in writing (the "
_Transition Services Agreement_ ").

 



      
 

 



 

7.11 _Further Action_.

 



 

(a) With respect to any Government Contract or Government Bid listed in
_Schedule 5.10(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, at Purchasers written
request, the Seller shall communicate to the appropriate representative for
each Governmental Authority, prime contractor, and/or higher-tier
subcontractor, as applicable, the fact that the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are pending. Such communications shall be made as soon as
practicable after the Purchasers written request and prior to the Closing
Date and shall be made in such manner as Purchaser reasonably determines in
consultation with Seller.

 



 

(b) Prior to and after Closing, each of Seller and Purchaser shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all appropriate
action, to do or cause to be done all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law and the agreements included in the Purchased Assets, and
to execute and deliver such documents and other papers and any other
agreements, as may be necessary to carry out the provisions of this Agreement
and the Ancillary Agreements and consummate and make effective the sale,
transfer and conveyance of the Purchased Assets (including the Government
Contracts and Government Bids listed in _Schedule 5.10(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule) and the assignment of the Assumed Liabilities or the
exclusion of the Excluded Liabilities pursuant to this Agreement and to
consummate and make effective the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements, including using commercially
reasonable efforts to ensure satisfaction of the conditions precedent to each
Partys obligations hereunder and thereunder and including, to the extent
practicable, using commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all required
Consents from third parties, including novation approval or other Consent from
any Governmental Authority. The Parties shall commence their efforts to obtain
such Consents promptly after the execution of this Agreement. The Parties
shall keep the other fully informed, on a current and timely basis, as to the
progress of such Consents and provide copies of all letters, correspondence,
and other material documents to or from any third party with respect thereto.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, neither Seller nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall agree to any modification of any term of or
condition in any Assigned Contract or commit on behalf of Purchaser or the
Business to any post-Closing obligation, in each case, in order to obtain
consent for the transactions contemplated hereby, except with the prior
written consent of Purchaser.

 



 

(c) Promptly following Closing and in accordance with FAR 42.1204, Seller, on
behalf of itself, all applicable Subsidiaries of Seller, and Purchaser, shall
submit to the appropriate contracting officer the documentation required for
novation of each Government Contract with a Governmental Authority of the
United States Government (as listed in _Schedule 5.3_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule). Seller shall prepare the initial drafts of any required novation
requests and furnish all of the information and documents required in
connection with any subsequent requests or requirements of the Governmental
Authority. Purchaser shall provide to Seller promptly any information
regarding Purchaser that is reasonably required in connection with any
subsequent requests or requirements of the Governmental Authority.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement
shall not constitute an agreement to assign, license, sublicense or otherwise
provide rights with respect to any Purchased Asset or any right thereunder if
an attempted assignment,

 



      
 

 



 

license or other provision, without the Consent of, or other action by, any
third party, would constitute a breach or other contravention of a Contract
with such third party or would in any way adversely affect the rights of
Purchaser or Seller or any of their respective Affiliates relating to such
Purchased Assets.

 



 

(e) For the novation and/or assignment of each Government Contract and each
Government Bid and to the extent that any of the other transfers,
distributions, licenses, deliveries, assumptions, or assignments required to
be made in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
shall not have been so consummated at Closing, the Parties shall cooperate and
use their commercially reasonable efforts after the Closing to effect such
consummation as promptly thereafter as reasonably practicable, including
executing and delivering such further instruments of transfer and taking such
other actions as the Parties may reasonably request in order to effectuate the
purposes of this Agreement or to more effectively transfer to Purchaser or
confirm Purchasers right, title to or interest in, all of the Purchased
Assets, to put Purchaser in actual possession and operating control thereof
and to permit Purchaser to exercise all rights with respect thereto (including
rights under Contracts and other arrangements as to which the Consent of any
third party to the transfer thereof shall not have previously been obtained);
_provided_ that Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for any and all Losses
incurred by Seller as a direct result of Sellers guarantee obligation
required to be given to the United States Government with respect to
Purchasers performance of any novated Government Contract after the effective
date of such novation.

 



 

(f) In the event and to the extent that Seller and Purchaser are unable to
obtain any required Consents, Seller shall (i) continue to be bound thereby
pending assignment to Purchaser, (ii) at the direction and expense of
Purchaser, pay, perform and discharge fully all of its obligations thereunder
from and after the Closing and prior to assignment to Purchaser and (iii)
without further consideration therefor, pay, assign and remit to Purchaser
promptly all monies, rights and other consideration received in respect of
such agreements. Seller shall exercise or exploit its rights and options under
all such agreements, leases, licenses and other rights and commitments when
and only as reasonably directed by Purchaser. In furtherance of this
obligation, Seller and Purchaser will execute at Closing the Pre-Novation
Agreement, which shall apply to all Government Contracts and Government Bids
for which assignment to Purchaser has not been completed, including any
Government Contracts or Government Bids with a Governmental Authority of the
United States Government for which novation may be required. If and when any
such Consent shall be obtained (the cost of obtaining any such Consent, if
any, shall be borne by Seller) or such agreement, lease, license or other
right shall otherwise become assignable or sublicensable, Seller shall
promptly assign or sublicense its agreed-to rights and obligations thereunder
to Purchaser without payment of further consideration and Purchaser shall,
without the payment of any further consideration therefor, assume such rights
and obligations.

 



 

(g) In the event that the Parties determine that certain assets, rights or
properties which properly constitute Purchased Assets were not transferred to
Purchaser at Closing, Seller shall promptly take all steps reasonably
necessary to transfer and deliver any and all of such assets to Purchaser
without the payment by Purchaser of any further consideration therefor. In the
event that the Parties determine that certain Excluded Assets were transferred
to Purchaser at Closing, then Purchaser shall promptly take all steps
reasonably necessary to

 



      
 

 



 

transfer and deliver any and all of such Excluded Assets to Seller without the
payment by Seller of any further consideration therefor.

 



 

7.12 _Affiliate Transactions; Intercompany Arrangements_. No later than
immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, terminate all agreements or arrangements, written or unwritten, of any
kind (other than any Ancillary Agreements), between Seller or any of its
Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Business, on the other hand, without
liability or cost to Purchaser or any of its Affiliates.

 



 

7.13 _Release_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Seller, on behalf of itself and each of its
Subsidiaries, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally releases and forever
discharges the Business and Purchaser and their respective current and former
directors, officers, Affiliates, employees and fiduciaries from all actions,
causes of action, suits, Liabilities, debts, claims and demands which Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries has or may have in the future that arise out of or
relate to facts or circumstances in existence prior to the Closing, including
those claims that are unknown, unanticipated or unsuspected or that may
hereafter arise as a result of the discovery of new and/or additional facts;
provided, however, that such releases and discharges shall not affect any
claims by Seller or its Subsidiaries which Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
has or may have in the future against the Business or Purchaser arising under
this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreements or that arise out of acts, events,
conditions or omissions that occur or come into existence after the Closing.

 



 

(b) Seller acknowledges and understands the significance and potential
consequences of its release of unknown claims in _Section 7.13(a)_. In
addition, Seller, on behalf of itself and its current Subsidiaries, hereby
irrevocably and forever waives all rights it and they may have arising under
California Civil Code Section 1542 (or any analogous requirement of law) with
respect to the foregoing releases in _Section 7.13(a)_. Seller, on behalf of
itself and its current Subsidiaries, understands that Section 1542 provides
that: "A GENERAL RELEASE DOES NOT EXTEND TO CLAIMS WHICH THE CREDITOR DOES NOT
KNOW OR SUSPECT TO EXIST IN HIS OR HER FAVOR AT THE TIME OF EXECUTING THE
RELEASE, WHICH IF KNOWN BY HIM OR HER MUST HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED HIS OR HER
SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR." Seller, on behalf of itself and its current
Subsidiaries, acknowledges that it has been fully informed by its counsel
concerning the effect and import of this Agreement under California Civil Code
Section 1542 and other requirements of Law.

 



 

7.14 _Books, Records and Files_. Purchaser and Seller agree that Seller may
maintain copies of any Books, Records and Files that are included in the
Purchased Assets and that are delivered to Purchaser hereunder and Seller may
prepare a comprehensive index and file plan of such Books, Records and Files.
Purchaser agrees to retain and maintain such Books, Records and Files for a
period of at least seven (7) years after the Closing (plus any additional time
as required by Law or during which Purchaser has been advised by Seller that
(i) there is an ongoing Tax audit with respect to periods prior to the Closing
or (ii) any such period is otherwise open to assessment; _provided_ that only
such Books, Records and Files reasonably related to the appropriate Tax audit
or period as advised by Seller shall be subject to such time extension).

 



      
 

 



 

During such period, Purchaser agrees to give Seller and its representatives
reasonable cooperation, access (including copies) and staff assistance, as
needed, during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, with respect
to the Books, Records and Files delivered to Purchaser hereunder, and Seller
agrees to give Purchaser and its representatives reasonable cooperation,
access and staff assistance, as needed, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable notice, with respect to the Books, Records and Files relating to
the Business and retained by Seller, in each case as may be necessary for
general business purposes, including the defense of litigation, the
preparation of Tax returns and financial statements and the management and
handling of Tax audits; _provided_ that such cooperation, access and
assistance does not unreasonably disrupt the normal operations of Purchaser or
Seller or their respective Affiliates. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, neither Seller nor any of its respective
Affiliates shall be required to provide access to or copies of any income Tax
Returns of Seller or any such Affiliate.

 



 

7.15 _Non-Compete_. Subject to the provisions of this _Section 7.15_ , Seller
agrees that for a period of three (3) years from and after the Closing Date,
none of Seller or any of its Affiliates shall compete, directly or indirectly,
with the Business as conducted as of the Closing Date (a " _Competitive
Activity_ "); provided, however, that it shall not be deemed to be a violation
of this _Section 7.15_ for Seller to, directly or indirectly: (i) invest in or
own any non-voting or non-convertible debt securities or other debt
obligations of any Person; (ii) make any equity investments in publicly-traded
companies that may compete with the Business, ( _provided_ that such
investments are passive in nature and do not exceed 5% of the outstanding
voting power of such public companies); or (iii) own any interests in any
Person through any Employee Benefit Plan. Purchaser acknowledges that Seller
engages in Sellers Other Businesses and, notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, Purchaser agrees that Seller shall not be in breach of any
provision of this _Section 7.15_ solely as a result of Seller continuing to
engage in Sellers Other Businesses as conducted as of the Closing Date
following the Closing Date. The Parties recognize that the Laws and public
policies of the various states of the United States and other jurisdictions
may differ as to the validity and enforceability of covenants similar to those
set forth in this _Section 7.15_. It is the intention of the Parties that the
provisions of this _Section 7.15_ shall not render unenforceable, or impair,
the remainder of the provisions of this _Section 7.15_. Accordingly, if any
provision of this _Section 7.15_ shall be determined to be invalid or
unenforceable, such invalidity or unenforceability shall be deemed to apply
only with respect to the operation of such provision in the particular
jurisdiction in which such determination is made and not with respect to any
other provision or jurisdiction, and _Section 13.4_ shall apply to substitute
a valid and enforceable provision thereof. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 7.15_ to the contrary, in the event of an acquisition of the stock,
business or assets of Seller and/or any of its Affiliates (by asset purchase,
stock purchase, merger, consolidation or otherwise) by any Person who is not a
current Affiliate of the Seller, this _Section 7.15_ shall neither prohibit
nor apply to the business of such Person as conducted prior to such
acquisition.

 



 

7.16 _Insurance Cooperation_.

 



 

(a) From and after the Closing Date, to the extent that any insurance policy
owned or controlled by Seller (" _Seller Insurance Policies_ ") covers any
losses from Assumed Liabilities or the Purchased Assets arising out of an
occurrence prior to the Closing Date (" _Purchaser Claims_ "), at Purchasers
sole cost and expense (including reasonable out-of-pocket

 



       
 

 



 

costs and expenses of Seller), Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser in
submitting Purchaser Claims on behalf of and for the benefit of Purchaser
under any Seller Insurance Policy; _provided that_ Purchaser acknowledges and
agrees that (A) Seller shall not be responsible for any losses from Assumed
Liabilities or the Purchased Assets that are "self-insured" by Seller prior to
or at the Closing Date or that are within any applicable deductible or
retention amounts under any Seller Insurance Policy, (B) Seller shall not be
liable to Purchaser for any losses or other amounts hereunder if any insurance
company that has issued any Seller Insurance Policy fails to pay such losses
or amounts for any reason and (C) except with respect to any Seller Insurance
Policy under which any Purchaser Claim is pending, Seller may, at any time,
without liability or obligation to Purchaser, amend, commute, terminate, buy-
out, extinguish liability under or otherwise modify any Seller Insurance
Policy.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall not have access to the Seller Insurance Policies except as
provided in this _Section 7.16_. This Agreement shall not be construed to
waive any right or remedy of the Seller in respect of any Seller Insurance
Policy. No covenant or agreement by any party hereto to indemnify any other
party hereto shall release, or be deemed to release, any insurer with respect
to any claim made under any Seller Insurance Policy, nor shall the inclusion
of this _Section 7.16_ be deemed to limit in any way the indemnification
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

 



 

(c) Seller shall assign, to the extent assignable, to Purchaser the right to
receive any future proceeds (including any proceeds in respect of business
interruption insurance for any period after the Closing) relating to any such
Purchaser Claim following the Closing. Any Party receiving a notice with
respect to any Purchaser Claim shall promptly notify all other parties hereto.
To the extent that Seller and Purchaser have competing claims that will
exhaust the limits of a Seller Insurance Policy, the limits of such Seller
Insurance Policy shall be apportioned between the Parties in proportion to
their respective bona fide losses covered thereunder without regard to policy
limits.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, in the event
that Seller (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall
not be the continuing or surviving company or entity of such consolidation or
merger; (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets
to any Person; or (iii) winds up its business, in each case, resulting in a
cessation or termination of Sellers insurance, then, subject to the terms of

(ii) and (iii) to elect to purchase at Purchasers own cost and subject to the
terms of and conditions set forth in the Seller Insurance Policies, a "tail"

7.18 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in the "market flex" provisions of any Financing
Commitment, Purchaser shall not permit any amendment or modification to be
made to, or any waiver of any provision or remedy pursuant to, the Financing
Commitments without the prior written consent of Seller if such amendment,
modification or waiver would or would reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the
aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or the Mezzanine Financing, as
applicable, unless the Equity Financing is increased by an equivalent amount
or Purchaser obtains commitments for Alternative Financing for such increase;
(ii) impose new or additional conditions or otherwise expand, amend or modify
any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing in a manner that would
reasonably be expected to delay or prevent in any material respect the ability
of Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or
(iii) adversely impact the ability of Purchaser to enforce its rights against
the other parties to the Financing Commitments. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
assignments consummated pursuant to the terms of the Financing Commitments are
permitted.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary,
proper and advisable to arrange and obtain the Financing on the terms
(including the "flex" provisions applicable thereto) and conditions described
in the Financing Commitments, including using commercially reasonable efforts
to (i) maintain in effect the Financing Commitments in accordance with the
terms and subject to the conditions (including the "flex" provisions) thereof;
(ii) negotiate, execute and deliver definitive agreements with respect to the
Financing contemplated by the Financing Commitments on the terms and
conditions (including the flex provisions) contemplated by the Financing
Commitments; (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions to funding that
are applicable to Purchaser in the Financing Commitments and/or definitive
agreements for the Financing; (iv) upon satisfaction of the conditions set
forth in each of the Financing Commitments and this Agreement, including the
expiration of the waiting period, consummate the Financing at or prior to
Closing; and (v) comply in all material respects with its obligations pursuant
to the Financing Commitments; _provided_ , _however_ , that, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Agreement, under no circumstances shall
Purchaser or any of its Affiliates be required to commence or sustain a legal
proceeding against (x) any of the Debt Financing Sources in connection with
this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated herein or the Debt
Commitment; or (y) any of the Mezzanine Financing Sources in connection with
this Agreement or the other transactions contemplated herein or the Mezzanine
Commitment. At the written request of Seller, Purchaser shall provide Seller
with such information and material documentation as shall be reasonably
requested by Seller to allow Seller to monitor the progress of such financing
activities.

 



 

(c) In the event any portion of the debt financing contemplated in the Debt
Financing Commitment becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions
(including any "flex" provisions) contemplated in the Debt Financing
Commitment or any portion of the Mezzanine Financing contemplated in the
Mezzanine Financing Commitment becomes unavailable on the terms (including any
"flex" provisions) and conditions contemplated in the Mezzanine Financing

 



      
 

 



 

Commitment, Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary or advisable to arrange to obtain alternative debt financing (the "
_Alternative Financing_ ") from alternative sources in an amount sufficient to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and on terms and
conditions no less favorable, in the aggregate, to Purchaser than those in the
Debt Financing Commitment or the Mezzanine Financing Commitment, as
applicable, as promptly as practicable following the occurrence of such event.

 



 

(d) Purchaser shall promptly (and in any event, within two (2) Business Days)
notify the Seller in writing (i) of any material breach or default (or any
event or circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both,
could reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default)
by Purchaser under the Financing Commitments or any definitive agreements
related thereto or, to the Knowledge of Purchaser, any other party to any
Financing Commitment or definitive agreement related thereto, and (ii) of the
receipt by Purchaser or any of its Affiliates or Representatives of any
written notice or communication, or to the actual knowledge of Purchaser, oral
notice or other communication from any Person with respect to any (A) actual
or purported material breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party
to any Financing Commitment or any definitive agreement related thereto or any
provision of the financing contemplated pursuant to the Financing Commitments
or any definitive agreement related thereto (including any proposal by any
lender named in the Debt Financing Commitment or the Mezzanine Financing
Commitment, as applicable, to withdraw, terminate, reduce the amount of
financing (to the extent not (x) included within the "flex" provisions or (y)
replaced by an equivalent amount of Equity Financing or Alternative Financing)
or delay the timing of financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitment
or the Mezzanine Financing Commitment, as applicable) or (B) material dispute
or disagreement between or among any parties to any Financing Commitment or
any definitive agreement related thereto, in the case of clauses (A) and (B)
above, that would reasonably be expected to result in Purchaser not receiving
the proceeds of the Financing on the Closing Date; _provided_ , that in no
event shall Purchaser be required to disclose any information that is subject
to a legally-binding confidentiality restriction or attorney-client or similar
privilege if Purchaser shall have used its commercially reasonable efforts to
disclose such information in a way that would not waive such privilege or
would (in the opinion of outside counsel) contravene any applicable Law. In
the event that Purchaser does not provide access or information in reliance on
the proviso to the immediately preceding sentence, Purchaser shall provide
notice to Seller that such access or information is being withheld and
Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to communicate, to the
extent feasible, the applicable information in a way that would not violate
the applicable obligation or risk waiver of such privilege.

(ix) promptly and in any event at least five (5) Business Days prior to the

that is required by regulatory authorities pursuant to applicable "know your
customer" and anti-money laundering rules and regulations, including the
Patriot Act.

 



 

(b) Nothing in this _Section 7.19_ shall require Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries to (i) waive or amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay
any fees or reimburse any expenses prior to the Closing for which it has not
received prior reimbursement or is not otherwise indemnified by or on behalf
of Purchaser, or to give any indemnities that are effective prior to the
Closing; or (ii) take any action that would unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of Seller and its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Seller hereby consents to the use of Sellers and its Subsidiaries names,
trademarks and logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , _however_
, that such names, trademarks and logos are used solely in a manner that is

Subsidiaries.

 



 

(d) All non-public or other confidential information provided by Seller or any
of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ that
Purchaser shall be permitted to disclose such information to any financing
sources or prospective financing sources and other financial institutions and
investors that are or may become parties to the Debt Financing or the
Mezzanine Financing and to any underwriters, initial purchasers or placement
agents in connection with the Debt Financing or the Mezzanine Financing (and,
in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors) so long as such
Persons (i) agree to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if parties
thereto; or (ii) are subject to other customary confidentiality undertakings
reasonably satisfactory to Seller (it being acknowledged and agreed that the
notices and undertakings in a form customarily used in confidential
information memoranda for senior credit facilities or mezzanine facilities are
reasonably satisfactory to Seller).

 



 

(e) Promptly upon request by Seller, Purchaser shall reimburse Seller (or pay
in advance) for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including outside attorneys fees) incurred by Seller in connection with the
cooperation of Seller contemplated by this _Section 7.19_.

 



      
 

 



 

(f) Seller, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives shall be

from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses (including attorneys fees), interest, awards, judgments, penalties
and amounts paid in settlement suffered or incurred by them in connection with
their cooperation in arranging the Financing pursuant to this Agreement or the
provision of information utilized in connection therewith, except to the
extent resulting from, or by reason of information provided by or at the
direction of Seller, any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives, or to the extent that such liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs or expenses, directly or indirectly, resulted from or arose out
of the willful misconduct, bad faith or gross negligence of Seller, any of its
Subsidiaries or their respective Representatives.

 



 

7.20 _Estoppel Certificate_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain, prior to the Closing, an estoppel certificate from each landlord,
lessor, sublessor or licensor of the Leased Business Real Property or lessee,
sublessee or licensee of the Owned Business Real Property, confirming, among
other things, that no defaults exist thereunder and the status of all payments
associated therewith.

 



 

7.21 _Code Section 338 Election_. Purchaser and Seller shall make an election
under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and, to the extent requested by
Purchaser, any corresponding elections under state or other Tax Laws) (each, a
" _Code Section 338(h)(10) Election_ ") with respect to the purchase and sale
of the stock of any Purchased Subsidiary that is treated as a corporation for
U.S. federal income tax purposes pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser, at its
expense, shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, the forms and schedules
(including IRS Form 8023) and take such other steps that are necessary to
effect the Code Section 338(h)(10) Election. Seller shall execute all forms
and schedules (including, without limitation, IRS Form 8023) required to make
any Code Section 338(h)(10) Election (the " _Section 338 Forms_ ") and return
the same to Purchaser prior to the Closing Date, to the extent that the
Section 338 Forms have been provided to Seller at least five (5) days prior to
the Closing Date and otherwise no more than ten (10) days from the receipt of
the same from Purchaser or its agent. Purchaser will compute the adjusted
grossed up basis of the assets of such applicable Purchased Subsidiaries in
accordance with Code Sections 338 and 1060 (and any similar provision of state
or other Tax Laws, as appropriate) and will prepare a draft schedule,
allocating such basis among such applicable Purchased Subsidiaries assets and
shall provide such draft schedule to Seller. Seller shall, for ten (10)
Business Days thereafter, be entitled to review and comment on such schedule
and Purchaser shall consider such comments in good faith. Thereafter,
Purchaser shall provide to Seller a final allocation schedule. Purchaser and
Seller shall report and file all Tax Returns in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with Purchasers final allocation schedule. Neither
Purchaser nor Seller shall take any position (whether in audits, Tax Returns
or otherwise) that is inconsistent with Purchasers final allocation schedule.
The allocation schedule shall be amended to take into account any adjustment
to Purchase Price under _Section 3.2_ in a manner consistent with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 7.21_. Seller shall include any income,
gain, loss or deduction of the Tax items resulting from each Code Section
338(h)(10) Election on its Tax Returns to the extent required by applicable
Law.

 



 

7.22 _Wells Fargo Facility_. In the event that Seller has not delivered to
Purchaser at least five (5) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing
Date an executed copy of either the consent of Wells Fargo as described in
clause (i) of _Section 10.1(d)_ or an amendment to the

 



      
 

 



 

Credit and Security Agreement as described in clause (ii) of _Section 10.1(d)_
, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser promptly thereafter, but in any event at
least three (3) Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, (i) a
payoff letter executed by Seller (in accordance with Section 2.6 of the Credit
and Security Agreement and otherwise in form and substance reasonably
acceptable to Purchaser) in respect of such indebtedness under the Credit and
Security Agreement and (ii) wire instructions for Purchaser to pay at Closing
a portion of the Preliminary Purchase Price to Wells Fargo (on behalf of
Seller) to pay off any amounts outstanding under the Credit and Security
Agreement as of the Closing.

 



 

7.23 _Tax Clearance_.

 



 

(a) The parties hereby acknowledge that pursuant to P.L. 2007, Chapter 100
(A5002) and the provisions of _N.J.S.A._ 54:50-38, the transactions set forth
herein may be considered a bulk sale by Seller and, therefore, Purchaser shall
file with the Director of the Division of Taxation in the Department of the
Treasury of the State of New Jersey (the " _Division_ ") at least ten (10)
business days prior to Closing, a Notification of Sale, Transfer, or
Assignment in Bulk (Form C-9600)(the " _Bulk Sale Notice_ ") and an executed
copy of this Agreement, enumerating the purchase price and the terms and the
conditions hereof, as required by law and as necessary to obtain a letter of
clearance from the Division. Seller acknowledges that Seller may be required
by the Division to complete an Asset Transfer Tax Declaration (Form TTD) in
order for the Division to provide a letter of clearance. Seller hereby agrees
to provide such completed declaration to the Division upon the assignment of a
caseworker at the Division following Purchasers filing of the Bulk Sale
Notice with the Division. Seller agrees to cooperate in good faith with
Purchaser with filing the above documents and obtaining a letter of clearance
from the Division.

 



 

(b) Purchaser shall pay into escrow that portion of the Preliminary Purchase
Price equal to the amount which is required by the Division, which amount
(together with interest accrued thereon, if any, the " _Division Escrow_ ")
shall be held in escrow by Sellers counsel, Connell Foley LLP (the " _Escrow
Agent_ "), in its attorney trust account pursuant to a customary escrow
agreement to be entered into by Purchaser, Seller and the Escrow Agent at or
prior to Closing (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Escrow Agent shall hold the
Division Escrow in accordance with this Agreement until such time as this
Agreement provides that it shall be released. If the Division Escrow exceeds
the Preliminary Purchase Price (or net proceeds of the Preliminary Purchase
Price that would otherwise be payable to Seller at Closing), then, at Closing,
Seller shall deliver to the Escrow Agent, in immediately available funds, an
amount equal to the difference between the Division Escrow and the Preliminary
Purchase Price (or net proceeds of the Preliminary Purchase Price that would
otherwise be payable to Seller at Closing). Purchaser and Seller agree to be
bound by the escrow requirements imposed by the Division, including any
adjustment of the Division Escrow amount. Upon Purchasers receipt of a letter
from the Division (a " _Demand Letter_ ") demanding payment to the Division of
all or a portion of the Division Escrow, Purchaser shall promptly direct the
Escrow Agent, by written notice, to disburse to the Division that portion of
the Division Escrow demanded in the Demand Letter. Purchaser shall
simultaneously deliver to Seller a copy of any such notice to the Escrow
Agent, together with a copy of the Demand Letter. Upon any such written notice
from Purchaser to the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent shall promptly disburse
to the Division such amounts from the Division Escrow as the Division demands
in the Demand Letter. However, if the amount of the

 



      
 

 



 

Divisions demand exceeds the amount of the Division Escrow, then Purchaser
shall not be required to direct the Escrow Agent to release the Division
Escrow to the Division until the Division confirms that it will issue a tax
clearance letter upon the receipt of such funds from the Division Escrow. Only
after the Division has issued a written letter of clearance to Purchaser,
which clearance letter Purchaser shall promptly deliver to Seller, and upon
Sellers written request to the Escrow Agent, which written request shall
include a copy of the Divisions letter of clearance, and simultaneous notice
to Purchaser of such request, any remaining balance of funds in the Division
Escrow shall be disbursed to Seller by the Escrow Agent.

 



 

(c) Seller agrees to pay in a timely manner any and all amounts of Sellers
outstanding tax obligations owed to the Division; _provided_ , _however_ ,
Seller reserves the right to dispute any such amounts claimed to be owed to
the Division in accordance with applicable Law.

 



 

(d) The provisions of this _Section 7.23_ shall survive the Closing.

 



 

7.24 _Future Dividends_. Seller covenants that any dividends it makes in
respect of the Preliminary Purchase Price or Final Purchase Price shall be
made in compliance with applicable Law.

 



 

7.25 _Subsequent Transaction_. In the event that, at any time during the three
(3) years following the Closing, all or substantially all of the remaining
assets of Seller are sold, transferred or otherwise disposed of (a "
_Subsequent Transaction_ "), prior to or concurrently with the consummation of
such Subsequent Transaction, Seller shall deposit immediately available funds
in an amount equal to $15,000,000 into an escrow account (the " _Escrow
Account_ ") with an escrow agent who shall be selected by Purchaser and
reasonably acceptable to Seller, pursuant to an escrow agreement in form and
substance reasonably agreed to by Purchaser (which escrow shall expire on the
third anniversary of the Closing Date); _provided_ that, if Seller shall have
delivered to Purchaser at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the
consummation of such Subsequent Transaction evidence reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser that such subsequent transferee has a net worth, pro forma for such
Subsequent Transaction, equal to or in excess of Sellers net worth
immediately prior to the consummation of such Subsequent Transaction, but in
no event less than $50 million, then such subsequent transferee may assume all
of Sellers obligations under this Agreement pursuant to an assumption
agreement among such subsequent transferee, Seller and Purchaser in a form and
substance reasonably acceptable to Purchaser in lieu of Sellers obligation to
deposit any amounts into the Escrow Account pursuant hereto. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, so long as Seller maintains a net
worth equal to or in excess of $50 million, neither Seller nor any subsequent
transferee shall have any obligations pursuant to this _Section 7.25_.

 



 

7.26 _Medical Claims Reimbursement_. On a periodic basis following the Closing
but not more frequently than once per month, Seller shall provide Purchaser an
invoice which shall specify the Medical Claims Amount and which shall include
reasonable and appropriate documentation (on a redacted basis, as necessary,
to comply with regulations pursuant to the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996) evidencing the aggregate amount paid by Seller
during the applicable invoice period in respect of Transferred Employees for
claims made under Sellers medical, health, dental or similar welfare benefit
plans by such Transferred Employees at any time prior to the Closing, which
invoice shall be paid by Purchaser within thirty (30) days of the date of
receipt of such invoice. Invoices unpaid as of such due date shall accrue
interest at 10% per annum. Payment by Purchaser of invoices with respect to
such Medical Claims Amount shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one or

 



      
 

 



 

more accounts designated by Seller. For purposes hereof, " _Medical Claims
Amount_ " means the amount actually paid by Seller during the applicable
invoice period for claims made under Sellers medical, health or similar
welfare benefit plans by Transferred Employees at any time prior to the
Closing.

offer of employment with Purchaser or one of its Affiliates effective as of
the opening of business on the Closing Date, but subject to the Closing having
occurred.

 



 

(b) _Transfer of Employment_. Not later than five (5) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, Purchaser shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to,

8.2 _Compensation and Employee Benefits_.

 



 

(a) _Compensation and Benefits Comparability_. For a period of one (1) year
following the Closing, Purchaser shall cause (i) each Transferred Employee who
remains in the employment of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to receive
base salary or wage rates, incentive compensation opportunity (excluding any
equity-based compensation) and other cash compensation that, in the aggregate,
are substantially similar to those in effect for such Transferred Employee,
immediately prior to Closing, and (ii) the Transferred Employees who remain in
the employment of Purchaser or any of its Affiliates to receive employee

Affiliates to continue the employment of any specific person.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) _Service Credit_. Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to,
recognize the prior service and seniority of each Transferred Employee as if
such service had been performed with, and such seniority has been earned with,
Purchaser and/or its Affiliate, as applicable, for purposes of eligibility,
vesting, service related level of benefits and benefit accrual under the

Transferred Employees following the Closing, to the same extent such service
and seniority is recognized by Seller or its Affiliates immediately prior to
the Closing.

 



 

(c) _Welfare Plans_. With respect to any welfare plan maintained by Purchaser
or any of its Affiliates in which Transferred Employees are eligible to
participate after the Closing, Purchaser shall, and shall cause its Affiliates
to, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, (i) waive all limitations as to

shall, and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to, comply with all
applicable Laws, directives and regulations relating to the Transferred
Employees, including without limitation providing any required notice under
the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act of 1988, as amended, and
any similar foreign, state or local law.

Purchaser or its Affiliates shall have in effect as of the Closing Date
flexible spending reimbursement accounts under a cafeteria plan qualifying

each Transferred Employee who participates in a cafeteria plan maintained by
Seller or one of its Affiliates (the " _Seller FSA Plan_ ") immediately prior
to the Closing; (ii) Purchaser shall cause the Purchaser FSA Plan to accept a
spin-off of the flexible spending reimbursement accounts of each Transferred
Employee under the Seller FSA Plan in respect of 2015 and to honor and
continue through December 31, 2015 the elections made by each Transferred
Employee under the Seller FSA Plan in respect of such flexible spending
reimbursement accounts that are in effect immediately prior to the Closing;
(iii) as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, Seller shall cause to
be transferred from the Seller FSA Plan to the Purchaser FSA Plan the excess,
if any, of the aggregate accumulated contributions to the flexible spending
reimbursement accounts made by Transferred Employees prior to the Closing
during 2015 over the aggregate reimbursement payouts paid or payable to the

 



       
 

 



 

Transferred Employees in respect of claims incurred during 2015 from such
accounts; and (iv) from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall assume and be
solely responsible for all claims by Transferred Employees under the Seller
FSA Plan incurred at any time during 2015, whether incurred prior to, on or
after the Closing Date, that have not been paid in full as of the Closing
Date. Seller shall maintain and continue to process claims related to the 2014
plan year for such Seller FSA Plan.

 



 

8.3 _Defined Contribution Plans_.

 



 

(a) Effective as of the Closing, Purchaser shall create or designate one or
more defined contribution pension plans (collectively, the " _Purchaser DC
Plans_ ") for the benefit of the Transferred Employees who participated in the
defined contribution pension plan maintained by Seller or its Affiliates that
is intended to be qualified under Code Section 401(a) immediately prior to the
Closing (collectively, the " _Seller DC Plan_ "). Such Transferred Employees

on the part of or by Seller or any of its Subsidiaries, in the event this
Agreement has been terminated and the Seller Termination Fee is payable and
paid to Purchaser pursuant to this _Section 11.3(a)_ , receipt of the Seller
Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy (under the
circumstances where such Seller Termination Fee is payable) of Purchaser and
its Affiliates against any Seller Party for any loss, damage, liability,
claim, obligation or Action (whether in law or in equity and whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this
Agreement (including any breach or alleged breach hereof), the negotiation,
execution or performance hereof or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or in respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in
respect of any oral or written representations made or alleged to be made in
connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. The parties acknowledge and agree that in no event shall
Seller be required to pay the Seller

 



       
 

 



 

Termination Fee on more than one occasion and in no event shall Purchaser be
entitled to collect the Seller Termination Fee on more than one occasion. In
no event shall the Seller Parties be liable to Purchaser, any Purchaser Party
or any Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of Purchaser in excess
of an aggregate amount equal to the Seller Termination Fee for any loss,
damage, liability, claim, obligation or Action (whether in law or in equity
and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) based upon, arising out of
or relating to this Agreement (including any breach or alleged breach hereof),
the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or in respect of any other document or theory
of law or equity or in respect of any oral or written representations made or
alleged to be made in connection herewith or therewith, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to
_Section 11.1(d)_ or _11.1(j)_ , then Purchaser shall pay to Seller the
Purchaser Termination Fee, by wire transfer of same day funds, it being
understood that in no event shall Purchaser be required to pay the Purchaser
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. For purposes of this Agreement, "
_Purchaser Termination Fee_ " shall mean an amount equal to $8,000,000. The
Purchaser Termination Fee shall be paid no later than three (3) Business Days
after the termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section 11.1(d)_ or
_11.1(j)_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but
subject to _Section 13.11_ , the sole and exclusive remedies of Seller, any
Seller Party or any Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of Seller
against any Purchaser Party for any loss, damage, liability, claim, obligation
or Action (whether in law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Guarantee, the Financing or the Financing Commitments (including any breach or
alleged breach hereof or thereof), the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral or written representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise shall be (i) receipt of the Purchaser Termination Fee from Purchaser
in the event this Agreement has been terminated and the Purchaser Termination
Fee is payable to Seller pursuant to this _Section 11.3(b)_ , (ii) receipt
from the Guarantor of any monetary amounts due and payable by the Guarantor
under, and subject to all of the terms and conditions of, the Guarantee and
(iii) receipt of whatever remedies Seller may have under or in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement against the other Person party thereto. The
parties acknowledge and agree that in no event will Purchaser be required to
pay the Purchaser Termination Fee on more than one occasion and in no event
shall Seller be entitled to collect the Purchaser Termination Fee on more than
one occasion. Without limitation of the generality of the foregoing or of any
other provision of this Agreement, (A) in no event shall the Purchaser Parties
be liable to Seller, any Seller Party or any Person claiming by, through or
for the benefit of Seller in excess of an aggregate amount equal to the
Purchaser Termination Fee for any loss, damage, liability, claim, obligation
or Action (whether in law or in equity and whether based on contract, tort or
otherwise) based upon, arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
Guarantee, the Financing or the Financing Commitments (including any breach or
alleged breach hereof or thereof), the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or in
respect of any other document or theory of law or equity or in respect of any
oral or written representations made or alleged to be made in connection
herewith or therewith, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, (B) upon payment of the Purchaser Termination Fee, none of Seller,
any Seller Party or any Person claiming by, through or for the

 



      
 

 



 

benefit of Seller shall have any rights or claims against any Purchaser Party
under this Agreement, the Guarantee, the Financing, the Financing Commitments,
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (whether in law or
in equity and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) or for any breach
or alleged breach hereof or thereof and (C) none of Seller, any Seller Party
or any Person claiming by, through or for the benefit of Seller shall have any
rights or claims against any Purchaser Party under or in connection with this
Agreement, the Guarantee, the Financing, the Financing Commitments, or any of
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (whether in law or in equity
and whether based on contract, tort or otherwise) or for any breach or alleged
breach hereof or thereof for any damages of any kind or nature or for any
other monetary amounts, except as otherwise set forth in the Guarantee.

 



 

(c) Any amount that becomes payable pursuant to _Section 11.3(a)_ or _Section
11.3(b)_ shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated by Purchaser or Seller, as applicable.

 



 

(d) For purposes of this Agreement, (i) " _Seller Party_ " shall mean,
collectively, Seller and its Subsidiaries and any of their respective former,
current or future directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited
partners, managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates or assignees or any
former, current or future director, officer, employee, agent, general or
limited partner, manager, member, shareholder, Affiliate or assignee of any of
the foregoing; and (ii) " _Purchaser Party_ " shall mean, collectively,
Purchaser, Guarantor, the Equity Financing Sources, the Debt Financing
Sources, the Mezzanine Financing Sources and any of their respective former,
current or future directors, officers, employees, agents, general or limited
partners, managers, members, shareholders, Affiliates or assignees or any

 ** _ARTICLE 12_**

 



 

 ** _INDEMNIFICATION AND SURVIVAL_**

 



 

12.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. Except for the Surviving
Reps (defined below), none of the representations and warranties in this
Agreement or in any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant to this
Agreement shall survive the Closing (other than for purposes of the RandW
Insurance Policy). The representations and warranties contained in _Sections
5.1_ (Organization, Authority and Qualification), _5.14_ (Tax Matters),
_5.6(a)_ (Title to and Sufficiency of Asset) and _5.25_ (Brokers)
(collectively, " _Seller Surviving Reps_ ") and in _Sections 6.1_
(Organization and Authority of Purchaser) and _6.8_ (Brokers) (collectively, "
_Purchaser Surviving Reps_ " and, together with the Seller Surviving Reps, the
" _Surviving Reps_ ") shall survive the Closing indefinitely unless a statute
of limitations applies to claims of third parties in any such case, and with
respect to such claims, and with respect to any and all representations and
warranties with respect to matters covered by _Section 5.14_ (Tax Matters),
such representations and warranties shall expire ninety (90) days following
the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations (including any
extensions thereof) provided by Applicable Law (the " _Survival Date_ "). As
of the Survival Date for each of the Surviving Reps, such representations and
warranties shall automatically terminate and be of no further force or effect,
and except for fraud, no claims of any type whatsoever arising out of, based
upon or relating any

 



      
 

 



 

way to such representations and warranties may be brought by any party after
the applicable Survival Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
representations or warranties shall survive beyond such period with respect to
(but only with respect to) any inaccuracy therein or breach thereof, notice of
which shall have been duly given prior to the Survival Date in accordance with
_Sections 12.5_ and _12.6_. Furthermore, except for fraud and intentional
misrepresentation, the Parties (i) intend that the preceding sentence relating
to the expiration and automatic termination of the Surviving Reps as of the
applicable Survival Date shall operate as a contractual statute of limitations
relating to any and all claims of any type whatsoever arising out of, based
upon or relating in any way to such representations and warranties and shall
replace and supplant any statute of limitations which may otherwise apply
thereto, and (ii) agree and acknowledge that such replacement and supplanting
of the statute of limitations by the contractual statute of limitations in
this _Section 12.1_ is reasonable and appropriate. All covenants or other
agreements in this Agreement shall survive the Closing until fully satisfied.

 



 

12.2 _Indemnification by Purchaser_. Subject to the other provisions of this
_Article 12_ , from and after the Closing, Purchaser shall indemnify, hold
harmless and reimburse Seller and its Affiliates, officers, directors, agents,
successors and assigns (each, a " _Seller Indemnified Party_ ") from and
against and in respect of any and all losses, damages, costs, expenses
(including any reasonable and documented attorneys fees), fines, penalties,
disbursements and amounts paid in settlement (collectively, " _Losses_ ")
which any Seller Indemnified Party may actually suffer or incur to the extent
arising out of or related to:

 



 

(a) the failure of any Purchaser Surviving Rep to be true and correct as of
the date hereof or as of the Closing Date (or as of the date made, where such
Purchaser Surviving Rep by its terms is made as of a specified date);
_provided_ , that any inaccuracy in or breach of any Purchaser Surviving Rep
shall be determined without giving effect to any qualification as to
"materiality" or "material adverse effect" set forth therein;

 



 

(b) any breach by Purchaser of, or failure by Purchaser to perform, any of its
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement;

 



 

(c) the Assumed Liabilities; and

 



 

(d) any other obligations or Liabilities undertaken or assumed by Purchaser
pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

12.3 _Indemnification by Seller_. Subject to the other provisions of this
_Article 12_ , from and after the Closing, Seller shall indemnify, hold
harmless and reimburse Purchaser and its Affiliates, officers, directors,
agents, successors and assigns (each, a " _Purchaser Indemnified Party_ ")
from and against and in respect of any and all Losses which any Purchaser
Indemnified Party may actually suffer or incur to the extent arising out of or
related to:

 



 

(a) the failure of any Seller Surviving Rep to be true and correct as of the
date hereof or as of the Closing Date (or as of the date made, where such
Seller Surviving Rep by its terms is made as of a specified date); _provided_
, that any inaccuracy in or breach of any Seller Surviving Rep shall be
determined without giving effect to any qualification as to "materiality" or
"material adverse effect" set forth therein;

 



      
 

 



 

(b) any breach by Seller of, or failure by Seller to perform, any of its
covenants or other agreements set forth in this Agreement; and

 



 

(c) the Excluded Liabilities.

 



 

12.4 _R andW Insurance Policy_. Except as set forth in _Section 12.9_ , from and
after the Closing, the RandW Insurance Policy shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties for any and all Losses that are
sustained or incurred by any of the Purchaser Indemnified Parties by reason
of, resulting from or arising out of any breach of or inaccuracy in any of
Sellers representations or warranties contained in this Agreement (other than
the Seller Surviving Reps). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
any rights of any issuer of the RandW Insurance Policy, including any rights of
subrogation, do not affect, expand or increase any liability or obligation of
Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

12.5 _Limitations on Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) The aggregate amount required to be paid to Purchaser pursuant to
_Sections 12.3(a)_ and _12.3(b)_ shall not exceed the Purchase Price, as
adjusted pursuant to _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
amounts shall be payable as a result of any claim in respect of a Loss arising
under _Section 12.2_ or _Section 12.3_ :

 



 

(i) to the extent any matter forming the basis for such Loss was taken into
consideration in the computation of Net Working Capital, but only to the
extent it resulted in a reduction of the Final Net Working Capital; or

 



 

(ii) except to the extent any such damages are owed to a third party pursuant
to a Third-Party Claim, to the extent an Indemnified Party asserts a claim for
any punitive, exemplary, special, unforeseen or other consequential damages or
any damages measured by lost profits or a multiple of earnings.

 



 

(c) Each Party agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Loss which forms the basis of a claim for indemnification hereunder to the
extent required by Applicable Law.

 



 

12.6 _Claims for Indemnification_. All claims for indemnification by any
Indemnified Party shall be asserted and resolved as set forth in this _Section
12.6_ :

 



 

(a) _Third-Party Claims_. In the event that any written claim or demand for
which an Indemnifying Party may be liable to any Indemnified Party hereunder
is asserted against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a
third party, such Indemnified Party shall promptly, but in no event later than
twenty (20) Business Days following such Indemnified Partys receipt of such
claim or demand (including a copy of any related written third party demand,
claim or complaint) (the " _Third-Party Claim_ "), deliver a Claim Notice to
the Indemnifying Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that failure to deliver a
Claim Notice shall not affect the

 



      
 

 



 

indemnification provided hereunder except in the event the Indemnifying Party
shall have been actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such
failure. If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party shall wish, to assume the defense thereof (which
shall conclusively establish thereby the Indemnifying Partys responsibility
to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of such Third-Party Claim
subject to the limitations in this _Article 12_ ), and, after notice from the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party of such election to so assume the
defense thereof, the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the Indemnified
Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other expenses
subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with the defense
thereof. The Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the Indemnifying
Party and its counsel in the defense against any such Third-Party Claim. The
Indemnified Party shall have the right to participate at its own expense in
the defense of any Third-Party Claim. Neither the Indemnifying Party, on the
one hand, nor the Indemnified Party, on the other hand, shall admit liability
to, or settle, compromise or discharge any Third-Party Claim without the prior
consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; _provided_ , _however_ , the Indemnifying Party may
settle, compromise or discharge any Third-Party Claim the defense of which was
assumed by the Indemnifying Party if such Third-Party Claim provides only for
the payment of monetary damages. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects
not to defend any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall defend
against such Third-Party Claim in good faith and in a commercially reasonable
manner at the cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying
Party shall have the right to participate in such defense at its own expense.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Indemnifying Party shall
not have the right to assume the defense of any Third-Party Claim and the
Indemnified Party may elect to assume the defense to the extent (i) such
Third-Party Claim constitutes a claim for non-monetary, equitable or
injunctive relief against the Indemnified Party which, if awarded, would be
reasonably expected to have a material and adverse impact on the business of
the Indemnified Party (after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement); or (ii) if an actual or potential conflict of interest exists
or would reasonably be expected to potentially arise (as determined by outside
counsel) in respect of the matters subject to such Third-Party Claim as
determined by the conflict-of-interest rules restricting attorney conduct in
the applicable jurisdiction if counsel for the Indemnifying Party were to act
as counsel for the Indemnified Party.

 



 

(b) In the event of any claim for indemnity under _Section 12.2_ or _Section
12.3_ , (i) Purchaser agrees to give Seller and its representatives reasonable
access to the books and records and employees of Purchaser in connection with
the matters for which indemnification is sought to the extent Seller
reasonably deems necessary in connection with its rights and obligations under
this _Article 12_ ; and (ii) Seller agrees to give Purchaser and its
representatives reasonable access to the books and records and employees of
Seller in connection with the matters for which indemnification is sought to
the extent Purchaser reasonably deems necessary in connection with its rights
and obligations under this _Article 12_.

 



 

12.7 _Tax Effect_. The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under
this Agreement shall be reduced by the amounts of any net tax benefits that
have been actually received by the Indemnified Party in the year such Loss is
incurred or in the following year and that results from such indemnifiable
Loss. As used in this _Section 12.7_ , "tax benefit" shall mean

 



      
 

 



 

the net Tax savings attributable to any deduction, expense, loss, credit or
refund to the Indemnified Party, when actually received. The amount of any tax
benefit actually received shall be equal to the actual reduction in Taxes of
the Indemnified Party paid in cash determined with the applicable Tax items
and the indemnity payment made or to be made taken into account as compared
with the Taxes that would have been payable without the applicable Tax items.

 



 

12.8 _Insurance Offset_. If any Losses sustained by an Indemnified Party are
covered by an insurance policy or an indemnification, contribution or similar
obligation of another Person (other than an Affiliate of such Indemnified
Party), the Indemnified Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
collect such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar
payments. If the Indemnified Party receives such insurance proceeds or
indemnity, contribution or similar payments prior to being indemnified, held
harmless and reimbursed under _Section 12.2_ or _Section 12.3_ , as
applicable, with respect to such Losses, the payment by an Indemnifying Party
under this _Article 12_ with respect to such Losses shall be reduced by the
net amount of such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution or similar
payments to the extent related to such Losses, less reasonable attorneys fees
and other expenses incurred in connection with such recovery. If the
Indemnified Party receives such insurance proceeds or indemnity, contribution
or similar payments after being indemnified and held harmless by an
Indemnifying Party with respect to such Losses, the Indemnified Party shall
pay to the Indemnifying Party the net amount of such insurance proceeds or
indemnity, contribution or similar payment to the extent related to such
Losses, less reasonable attorneys fees and other expenses incurred in
connection with such recovery.

 



 

12.9 _Exclusive Remedy_. After the Closing, the indemnities set forth in this
_Article 12_ (and, with respect to Purchaser, the RandW Insurance Policy) shall
be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parties, their successors and assigns,
and their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and Affiliates
with respect to this Agreement, the events giving rise to this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, except for claims grounded in fraud or
intentional misrepresentation. The indemnities set forth in this _Article 12_
apply only to matters arising out of this Agreement. Any Loss arising under or
pursuant to an Ancillary Agreement shall be governed by the indemnification
obligations, if any, contained in such Ancillary Agreement. The parties shall
not be entitled to a rescission of this Agreement or to any further
indemnification rights or claims of any nature whatsoever in respect thereof
(whether by contract, common law, statute, law, regulation or otherwise,
including under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, all of
which the parties hereto hereby waive).

 



 

12.10 _Treatment of Indemnification Payments_. To the extent permitted by Law,
any amounts payable pursuant to this _Article 12_ shall be considered
adjustments to the Final Purchase Price for all income Tax purposes and the
Parties and their respective Affiliates agree to take no position inconsistent
with such treatment in any Tax Return or proceeding before any Governmental
Authority.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE 13_**

 



 

 ** _MISCELLANEOUS_**

 



 

13.1 _Assignment_. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the
benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no assignment shall be made by either Party
without the prior written consent of the other Party, except that Purchaser
may assign any or all of its rights or benefits under this Agreement without
the prior written consent of Seller (whereupon Purchaser shall provide written
notice thereof to Seller), as a collateral assignment, to Purchasers or its
Affiliates lenders or other Debt Financing Sources. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, either Party may assign its rights and obligations under this
Agreement without such consent to an Affiliate or in connection with a sale,
merger or other transaction involving a transfer of substantially all of its
assets; _provided_ that such assigning Party shall remain liable for its
obligations hereunder.

 



 

13.2 _Public Announcements_. Neither Party shall issue or make any public
announcement, press release or other public disclosure regarding this
Agreement or its subject matter without the other Partys prior written
consent, except for any such disclosure that is, in the opinion of the
disclosing Partys counsel, required by applicable Law or the rules of a stock
exchange on which the securities of the disclosing party are listed. In the
event a Party is, in the opinion of its counsel, required to make a public
disclosure by applicable Law or the rules of a stock exchange on which its
securities are listed, such Party shall, to the extent practicable, submit the
proposed disclosure in writing to the other Party prior to the date of
disclosure and provide the other Party a reasonable opportunity to comment
thereon.

 



 

13.3 _Expenses_. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, and except as otherwise specified herein, each Party shall bear
its own expenses with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

13.4 _Severability_. Each of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall
be severable, and the unenforceability of one shall not affect the
enforceability of any others or of the remainder of this Agreement. In event
it is determined that a provision of this Agreement is prohibited by or
invalid under Law, the Parties agree to negotiate in good faith to modify this
Agreement to fulfill as closely as possible the original intents and purposes
hereof. To the fullest extent permitted by Law, the Parties hereby to the same
extent waive any provision of Law that renders any provision hereof prohibited
or unenforceable in any respect.

 



 

13.5 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the Parties hereto and their permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or
implied (including _Article 12_ ), shall give or be construed to give to any
Person, other than the Parties hereto and their permitted assigns, any legal
or equitable rights hereunder, except for _Article 12_ , which is for the
benefit of the Indemnified Parties covered thereby; _provided_ that the
provisions of _Section 7.5(a)_ , _Section 7.18_ , _Section 7.19_ , _Section
11.2_ , _Section 11.3(b)_ , _Section 11.3(d)_ , _Section 13.1_ , this _Section
13.5_ , _Section 13.6_ , _Section 13.8_ , _Section 13.9(b)_ , _Section 13.10_
, _Section 13.11_ and _Section 13.17_ shall be enforceable against all parties
to this Agreement by each Debt Financing Source, each Mezzanine Financing
Source and their respective successors and assigns.

 



      
 

 



 

13.6 _Financing Sources_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
except for the third-party beneficiary rights of Seller under the Equity
Commitment Letter and rights of Seller under the Guarantee, subject to the
terms and conditions thereunder and under this Agreement, no Seller Party
shall have any rights or claims against any Equity Financing Source, any Debt
Financing Source or any Mezzanine Financing Source in connection with this
Agreement, the Financing, the Financing Commitments or any transaction
contemplated hereby or thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise. In furtherance of the foregoing, Seller (on its behalf and on
behalf of each other Seller Party) agrees not to commence (and if commenced
agrees to dismiss or otherwise terminate) any action or proceeding against any
Equity Financing Source (other than in connection with any action expressly
permitted in accordance with the preceding sentence), any Debt Financing
Source or any Mezzanine Financing Source in connection with this Agreement,
the Financing, the Financing Commitments or any transaction contemplated
hereby or thereby.

 



 

13.7 _Waiver_. The failure of any Party to enforce any condition or part of
this Agreement at any time shall not be construed as a waiver of that
condition or part, nor shall it forfeit any rights to future enforcement
thereof. Any waiver hereunder shall be effective only if delivered to the
other Party hereto in writing by the Party making such waiver.

 



 

13.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed and enforced in
accordance with and governed by the Laws of the State of Delaware without
regard to the conflicts of Laws provisions thereof except with respect to
matters under the New Jersey Business Corporation Act relating to the approval
of the transactions contemplated hereunder, which shall be governed by the
laws of the State of New Jersey; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , the provisions of
this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the laws of the State of New York with respect to any action, suit or
proceeding arising out of or related to the Debt Financing, the Debt Financing
Commitment or the performance thereof or the Mezzanine Financing, the
Mezzanine Financing Commitment or the performance thereof.

 



 

13.9 _Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) The Parties hereto agree that any Action seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought in any
state or federal court of competent jurisdiction in the State of Delaware, so
long as such court shall have subject matter jurisdiction over such Action,
and that any cause of action arising out of this Agreement shall be deemed to
have arisen from a transaction of business in the State of Delaware, and each
of the Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such court
(and of the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and
irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection that
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in
any such court or that any such Action which is brought in such court has been
brought in an inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on
any Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service of
process on such Party as provided in _Section 13.15_ shall be deemed effective
service of process on such Party.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each of the parties
hereto agrees that it will not bring or support any proceeding, suit,
litigation, investigation, action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or
third party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity,
whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any of the Debt Financing
Source or any Mezzanine Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, including but not limited to
any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Debt Financing, the
Debt Commitment Letter or the performance thereof or the Mezzanine Financing,
the Mezzanine Commitment Letter or the performance thereof, in any forum other
than the courts of the State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan
in New York County, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof) and that in
connection with any such suit, litigation, investigation, action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third party claim the governing law specified
the Debt Commitment Letter or the Mezzanine Commitment Letter, as applicable,
shall govern.

 



 

13.10 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO WAIVES TO THE FULLEST
EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY
WITH RESPECT TO ANY LITIGATION DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR
IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS
AGREEMENT, THE DEBT FINANCING, THE DEBT FINANCING COMMITMENT, THE MEZZANINE
FINANCING OR THE MEZZANINE FINANCING COMMITMENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO
HEREBY (A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF THE OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD
NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, AND (B)
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT, AS APPLICABLE, BY, AMONG OTHER
THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 13.10_.

 



 

13.11 _Specific Performance_.

 



 

(a) The Parties acknowledge that, in view of the uniqueness of the Business,
the Purchased Assets and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
Party would not have an adequate remedy at Law for money damages in the event
that this Agreement has not been performed in accordance with its terms, and
therefore agrees that the other Party shall be entitled to seek specific
enforcement of the terms hereof in addition to any other remedy to which it
may be entitled, at Law or in equity. Each of the parties agrees that it will
not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific performance and other
equitable relief on the basis that the other parties have an adequate remedy
at law or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for
any reason at law or equity. Any party seeking an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or
