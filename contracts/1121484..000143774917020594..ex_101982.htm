NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
intending to be legally bound hereby, the Parties agree as follows:

  



  

 **Article I 
 THE ACQUISITION**

  



  

Section 1.1 _ Purchase and Sale of the Shares_. At the Closing, on the
terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, the Seller shall sell,
assign, transfer and convey to the Buyer, and the Buyer shall purchase and
acquire from the Seller, all of Seller's rights, title and interest in and to
the Shares free and clear of all Liens other than Liens created by or on
behalf of the Buyer.

  



  

Section 1.2 _ Purchase Price_.

  



  

(a) The total consideration for the Shares (as may be adjusted in
accordance with this Agreement, the " _Total Consideration_ ") shall be equal
to the sum of (x) the Aggregate Stock Closing Consideration, (y) the Seller's
Note and (z) the aggregate cash purchase price, as adjusted (the " _Aggregate
Cash Purchase Price_ "), which Aggregate Cash Purchase Price shall be equal to
the sum of:

  



  

(i) $300,000,000;

  



  

(ii) _plus_ an amount equal to the Working Capital Excess (or _minus_ an
amount equal to the Working Capital Deficit);

  



  

(iii) _plus_ an amount equal to the Closing Cash;

  



  

(iv) _minus_ an amount equal to the Closing Indebtedness (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid by the Buyer pursuant to Section
_1.3(a)_ ); and

  



  

(v) _minus_ an amount equal to the Transaction Expenses (including, for
the avoidance of doubt, any amounts paid by the Buyer pursuant to Section
_1.3(b)_ ).

  



  

(b) At least five business days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a certificate of a duly authorized
officer of the Company (the " _Estimated Aggregate Cash Closing Price
Certificate_ ") setting forth the Seller's good faith estimate of the
Aggregate Cash Purchase Price (the " _Estimated Aggregate Cash Purchase Price_
"), which shall include a reasonably detailed calculation of the good faith
estimated amount, calculated in accordance with the worksheet attached hereto
as _Exhibit A_ (the " _Worksheet_ "), of (i) Closing Working Capital, (ii)
Closing Cash, (iii) Closing Indebtedness, and (iv) Transaction Expenses. An
amount equal to the Estimated Aggregate Cash Purchase Price shall be payable
at the Closing as described in Section _1.3_ below and shall be subject to
adjustment as provided in _Section 1.4_. Without limiting any of the Buyer's
other rights or remedies, the Buyer may object that any of the foregoing has
not been calculated in a manner consistent with the terms hereof by delivering
to the Seller a written notice of its disagreement at least two business days
prior to the Closing Date (the " _Buyer 's Notice of Disagreement_"),
specifying in reasonable detail the nature of its objections to the Estimated
Aggregate Cash Purchase Price. The Seller and the Buyer in good faith shall
seek to resolve any objections set forth in the Buyer's Notice of Disagreement
prior to the Closing, and the Seller shall make such revisions to the
Estimated Aggregate Cash Closing Price Certificate as may be mutually agreed
between the Seller and the Buyer; provided, that if and to the extent that the
Buyer and the Seller have not resolved all such differences by the close of
business on the business day prior to the anticipated Closing Date, the
Parties shall proceed to close based upon the Estimated Aggregate Cash Closing
Price Certificate as prepared by the Seller (with such modifications as may
have been mutually agreed between the Seller and the Buyer prior to the
Closing Date in accordance with this _Section 1.2_ ) or as otherwise agreed to
by the Seller and the Buyer before the Closing. For the avoidance of doubt,
any failure of the Buyer to raise any objection or dispute in the Buyer's
Notice of Disagreement shall not in any way prejudice Buyer's right to raise
any matter in the Closing Statement.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 1.3 _ Delivery of Aggregate Stock Closing Consideration, Payment
of the Estimated Aggregate Cash Purchase Price and Other Amounts_. At the
Closing, subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the conditions
specified in _Article VI_ :

  



  

(a) On behalf of the Acquired Entities, and at the direction of the
Seller, the Buyer shall deliver payment to the appropriate parties in respect
of the Indebtedness of the Acquired Entities as of immediately prior to the
Closing to be paid at Closing, if any, pursuant to payoff letters or invoices
delivered by such parties to the Buyer and the Company in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Buyer and the Seller.

  



  

(b) On behalf of the Acquired Entities, and at the direction of the
Seller, the Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, deliver payment to the
appropriate parties in respect of Transaction Expenses in the amounts
indicated in writing by the Seller at or prior to the Closing, by wire
transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds to the accounts
designated by the Seller. The Parties acknowledge that the Transaction
Expenses are obligations of the Acquired Entities incurred on or before the
Closing Date, and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to make them
obligations of the Buyer. Payment of such Transaction Expenses by the Buyer on
behalf of the Acquired Entities on the Closing Date is being made for
convenience only.

  



  

(c) The Buyer shall, or shall cause Buyer Parent to, issue and deliver the
Aggregate Stock Closing Consideration and pay the Estimated Aggregate Cash
Purchase Price as follows:

  



  

(i) The Buyer shall, or shall cause the Buyer Parent to, deliver to the
Seller the Aggregate Stock Closing Consideration free and clear of all Liens,
other than Liens arising under applicable securities Laws.

  



  

(ii) The Buyer shall deliver to the Seller an amount of cash equal to the
aggregate of the Estimated Aggregate Cash Purchase Price by paying or causing
to be paid to the Seller, by wire transfer or other delivery of immediately
available funds to the account of the Seller (which shall be provided by the
Seller to the Buyer at least two business days prior to the Closing Date).

  



  

(iii) The Buyer shall deliver to Seller the Seller's Note.

  



  

   

  



  

(iv) The parties shall reasonably cooperate to provide that amounts due to
the Seller Optionholders and the Seller Phantom Unitholders in respect of the
termination of Seller Options or Seller Phantom Units, as applicable, shall be
funded to the Company by the Seller from the Total Consideration received from
the Buyer (including, for the avoidance of doubt, from any payment pursuant to
the last sentence of _Section 1.4(c)_ ) and shall be paid by the Company,
which shall cause such amounts to be paid, less any applicable Taxes, to the
Seller Optionholder or Seller Phantom Unitholder, as applicable, through the
Company's payroll system.

  



  

(d) On behalf of the Acquired Entities, the Buyer shall, or shall cause
the Company to, deliver payment to the appropriate parties in respect of the
DandO Tail Premium, at or prior to the Closing, by wire transfer or delivery of
other immediately available funds.

  



  

Section 1.4 _ Purchase Price Adjustments_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that, so long as any distributions made are
reflected in Closing Working Capital and in any adjustments to the Aggregate
Cash Purchase Price under _Section 1.4(c)_ , the Seller shall have the right,
at or prior to the Closing, to cause the Acquired Entities to distribute cash,
accounts receivable and any other working capital items to the Seller or their
Affiliates, by one or more dividends and/or other distributions.

  



  

(b) Within 90 calendar days following the Closing, the Buyer shall
prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to the Seller a statement (the "
_Closing Statement_ "), which shall include (i) a balance sheet of the Company
as of the Closing Date, (ii) a calculation of the total Working Capital of the
Company determined in accordance with the Worksheet from such balance sheet
(the " _Closing Working Capital_ "), (iii) a calculation of the Working
Capital Deficit or the Working Capital Excess, as the case may be, (iv) a
calculation of Closing Cash, (v) a calculation of Closing Indebtedness, (vi) a
calculation of Transaction Expenses and (vi) the Buyer's determination of the
final Aggregate Cash Purchase Price (the " _Final Aggregate Cash Purchase
Price_ ") resulting therefrom. The Seller shall have a period of 30 calendar
days after delivery of the Closing Statement to review (and cause the Seller's
auditors to review) such documents and make any objections it may have in
writing to the Buyer. For purposes of the Seller's evaluation of the Closing
Statement, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Company to, make available or
provide reasonable access to the Seller and its Representatives, upon advance
notice and during normal business hours, all information, books, records, data
and working papers created or used in connection with the preparation of the
Closing Statement; and shall permit reasonable access, upon advance notice and
during normal business hours, to the facilities and personnel of the Acquired
Entities as may be reasonably requested by the Seller and its Representatives
to analyze the Closing Statement. If the Seller delivers written objections to
the Buyer within such 30-day period, then the Buyer and the Seller shall
attempt to resolve the matter or matters in dispute. If no written objections
are made by the Seller within such 30-day period, then such Closing Statement
shall be final and binding on the Parties. If disputes with respect to such
Closing Statement cannot be resolved by the Buyer and the Seller within 30
calendar days after timely delivery of any objections thereto, then, at the
request of the Buyer or the Seller, the specific matters in dispute (but no
others) shall be submitted to a nationally recognized independent accounting
firm as may be approved by the Seller and the Buyer (the " _Auditors_ "),
which firm shall render its opinion as to such specific matters. If no such
referral is made within 45 calendar days after the delivery of the objections,
then such Closing Statement shall be final and binding on the Parties. The
matters to be resolved by the Auditors shall be limited to the remaining
unresolved disputes between the Buyer and the Seller. The Auditors shall
promptly deliver to the Buyer and the Seller a written report setting forth
their resolution of the disputes along with their determination of the Final
Aggregate Cash Purchase Price, which determination shall be made in accordance
with the Worksheet and the definitions and principles set forth in this
Agreement and shall be final and binding on the Parties. As to each disputed
item, the Auditors shall be limited to awarding only one or the other of the
Buyer's proposal, on the one hand, or the Seller's proposal, on the other
hand, and shall have no authority to select or propose to the Parties any
resolution other than as set forth in one of such two proposals originally
submitted to the Auditors. Judgment may be entered upon the determination of
the Auditors in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against which
such determination is to be enforced. The fees and expenses of the Auditors
shall be borne by the Parties as designated by the Auditors, which designation
shall be based upon the inverse proportion of the amount of disputed items
resolved in favor of such Party ( _i.e._ , so that the prevailing Party bears
a lesser amount of such fees and expenses).

  



  

   

  



  

(c) If the Estimated Aggregate Cash Purchase Price is greater than the
Final Aggregate Cash Purchase Price, then within five business days following
the final determination thereof, the Seller shall pay to the Buyer by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated
by the Buyer the amount of such excess. If the Final Aggregate Cash Purchase
Price is greater than the Estimated Aggregate Cash Purchase Price, then within
five business days following the final determination thereof, the Buyer shall
pay to the Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the
account or accounts designated by the Seller the amount of such excess.

  



  

Section 1.5 _ Time and Place of the Closing_. Upon the terms and subject
to the conditions of this Agreement, the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at the
offices of Strasburger and Price, LLP, 909 Fannin Street, Suite 2300, Houston,
Texas 77010, on the second business day after the date on which the
satisfaction or, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, waiver of all
conditions to the obligations of the Parties set forth in _Article VI_ (other

or on the Closing Date, but subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those
conditions) shall occur, or at such other time or on such other date as the
Parties agree in writing (the " _Closing Date_ ").

provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law; _provided, however_ , that to

and the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith and at the Seller's
expense with the Seller's efforts to minimize, to the extent permissible under
applicable Law, the amount of any such deduction or withholding, including by
providing any certificates or forms that are reasonably requested by the
Seller to establish an exemption from (or reduction in) any deduction or
withholding. Any amounts that are so deducted and withheld shall be paid to

binding upon the Seller or (iii) any Law applicable to the Seller or by which
the Shares are bound, except in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such
violations, breaches or defaults that would not, individually or in the

ability of the Seller to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents to which it is, or will be as of the Closing, a party, or prevent or
materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents.

  



  

(d) Except for (i) any filings required to be made under the Hart-Scott-

party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, other than those notices, authorizations, approvals, orders,
permits or consents: (x) as have been given or obtained prior to the date
hereof; (y) the failure of which to give or obtain would not reasonably be
expected to impair in any material respect the ability of the Seller to
perform its obligations under the Transaction Documents to which it is, or
will be as of the Closing, a party, or prevent or materially delay
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction Documents; or
(z) as may be required solely as a result of the business activities of the

of the issued and outstanding Capital Stock of the Company. The Seller has the
power to sell and to transfer the Shares to the Buyer as contemplated by this

not with a view to the distribution of such OIS Common Shares in violation of
applicable securities Laws. The Seller understands that the offering and
issuance of the OIS Common Shares hereunder has not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities Act_ "), and that the

hereunder will bear the following or substantially similar legend thereon:

  



  

"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or any state securities laws. The shares
have been acquired for investment and may not be sold or transferred in the
absence of an effective registration statement for the shares under such Act

registration is not required under such Act or any applicable state securities
laws."

including any report or notice, with any Governmental Authority, in connection
with the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party, the enforcement against the Company of its
obligations thereunder or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by

and the Buyer Parent is duly qualified and licensed, as may be required, and
in good standing to do business in each jurisdiction in which the business it
is conducting, or the operation, ownership or leasing of its properties, makes
such qualification and licensing necessary, other than in such jurisdictions

Material Adverse Effect.

  



  

Section 4.2 _ Authorization; Enforceability; Absence of Conflicts;
Required Consents_.

  



  

(a) Each of the Buyer and Buyer Parent has the requisite organizational
power and authority to enter into and deliver each Transaction Document to
which it is a party, and to carry out its obligations and the transactions

of the Buyer and the Buyer Parent of the Transaction Documents to which it is
a party, the performance by each of the Buyer and the Buyer Parent of its

(b) Each of the Transaction Documents to which the Buyer or the Buyer
Parent is or will be a party are, or when executed and delivered by the
parties thereto, will be, duly executed and delivered by the Buyer or the

considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

  



  

   

  



  

(c) The execution and delivery by each of the Buyer and the Buyer Parent
of the Transaction Documents to which it is a party, the performance by each
of the Buyer and the Buyer Parent of its obligations under each Transaction
Document to which it is a party in accordance with their respective terms and

the Buyer Parent, except for such violations, breaches or defaults under
clauses (ii) and (iii) that would not result in a Buyer Material Adverse

securities or "blue sky" laws, neither Buyer nor the Buyer Parent is required

party or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, other than those notices, authorizations, approvals, orders,
permits or consents: (x) as have been given or obtained prior to the date

expected to impair in any material respect the ability of either of the Buyer
and the Buyer Parent to perform its obligations under the Transaction
Documents to which it is, or will be as of the Closing, a party, or prevent or
materially delay consummation of the transactions contemplated by the
Transaction Documents; or (z) as may be required solely as a result of the
business activities of the Seller or its Affiliates (other than the business
activities of the Company prior to the Closing).

(as that term is defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities
Act). The Buyer has such knowledge and experience in business and financial
matters so that the Buyer is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an

Section 4.8 _ Acquisition of Shares for Investment_. The Buyer is
acquiring the Shares for investment and not with a view toward, or for sale in
connection with, any distribution thereof, nor with any present intention of

has been issued, and no proceedings for such purpose are, to the Buyer's

in violation of any preemptive right, purchase option, call option, right of
first refusal or similar options or rights or, assuming the accuracy of the
representations in _Section 2.6_ , in violation of the Securities Act and any
applicable state securities Laws. The Buyer Parent has, and on the Closing

prohibits such attendance;

  



  

(iv) promptly furnish the other Party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers

(vi) deliver to the other Party's outside counsel complete copies of all
documents furnished to any Governmental Authority as part of any filing.

  



  

(c) The Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to eliminate any
concern on the part of any Governmental Authority regarding the legality of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement under the HSR Act.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer and Buyer Parent
shall not be required by this Section to take or agree to undertake any
action, including entering into any consent decree, hold separate order or
other arrangement, that would (i) require the divestiture of any assets of the
Buyer, the Buyer Parent, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates,

businesses or (iii) limit the Buyer's ability to acquire or hold, or exercise
full rights of ownership with respect to, the Shares.

  



  

   

  



  

(d) The Buyer, the Buyer Parent and the Seller shall proceed with the

Governmental Authority has issued an injunction or other order prohibiting the
closing of the transactions and that injunction or order has been upheld by an
appellate court or other appellate Governmental Authority.

  



  

(e) In addition to the foregoing, the Buyer agrees to provide such
assurances as to financial capability, resources and creditworthiness as may
be reasonably requested by any third party whose consent or approval is sought
under this Agreement.

  



  

(f) Whether or not the Acquisition is consummated, the Buyer and the
Seller shall each be responsible for 50% of all filing or application fees
payable in connection with any filings or submissions to, or obtaining any
consents, authorizations, orders, approvals or waivers from, any Governmental
Authority under the HSR Act pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ , provided that any
such amount required to be paid by the Company prior to Closing that remains
unpaid at the Closing shall be deemed a Transaction Expense for purposes of
this Agreement.

  



  

Section 5.5 _ Director and Officer Insurance_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall, for a period of not
less than six years, cause the Acquired Entities to continue to indemnify,
defend and hold harmless, to the same extent as provided in the Acquired
Entities' Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof, the
individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were directors, officers,
employees or agents of an Acquired Entity, against any costs or expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims,
damages or liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, action, suit,
Proceeding or investigation with respect to any acts or omissions by them in
their capacities as such or taken at the request of an Acquired Entity at any
time on or prior to the Closing Date. The Buyer agrees that all rights of such
Persons to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the
Organizational Documents of the applicable Acquired Entity as currently in
effect, and any indemnification agreements or arrangements of the Acquired
Entities, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than six years.
Such rights shall not be amended or otherwise modified in any manner that
would adversely affect the rights of such Indemnified Parties unless such
modification is required by applicable Law. In addition, the Buyer shall cause
the Company to pay any expenses of any such Indemnified Party under this
_Section 5.5_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under applicable
Law; _provided_ that the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides a
written undertaking to repay all of such advances in full and immediately to
the extent it is determined such Person is not entitled to indemnification
pursuant to such Applicable Entity's Organizational Documents or Law, as the
case may be.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) The Parties agree that the Buyer (or a third party at the direction of
the Buyer), at the Buyer's sole expense, will obtain at the Closing "tail"
coverage for a period of six years following the Closing Date under the
directors and officers liability insurance policy of the Company, as in effect
on the Closing Date; _provided, however_ , that the Buyer will not be required
to pay an amount that exceeds 300% of the last annual premium paid by the
Company for such insurance policy prior to the date of this Agreement for such
"tail" coverage. The aggregate amount necessary to purchase such "tail"
coverage shall be referred to as the " _D andO Tail Premium_."

  



  

(c) In the event the Buyer or the Company or any of their respective
Subsidiaries, successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving Entity of such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, the Buyer shall use its best efforts to
ensure that proper provisions shall be made so that the successors and assigns
of the Buyer, the Company or their respective Subsidiaries (as applicable)
assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.5_.

  



  

(d) This _Section 5.5_ , which shall survive the Closing and shall
continue for the periods specified herein, is intended to benefit any Person
referenced in this _Section 5.5_ or indemnified hereunder, each of whom may
enforce the provisions of this _Section 5.5_ (whether or not Parties to this
Agreement). The obligations of the Buyer under this _Section 5.5_ shall not be
terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified
Party to whom this _Section 5.5_ applies without the express written consent
of such affected Indemnified Party (it being expressly agreed that the
indemnitees to whom this _Section 5.5_ applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 5.5_ ), unless such termination or modification
is required by Law.

  



  

Section 5.6 _ Exclusivity_. Between the date of this Agreement and the
earlier of the Closing and the termination of this Agreement, the Seller and
the Company shall not, and shall take all action necessary to ensure that none
of their respective Affiliates or Representatives shall, directly or
indirectly:

  



  

(a) solicit, initiate, consider, encourage or adopt any other proposals or
offers from any Person (i) relating to any direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase of all or any portion of the Capital Stock or other equity or
ownership interest of the Seller, Company or Acquired Entities, other than
inventory or obsolete equipment to be sold in the Ordinary Course of Business
consistent with past practice and, in the case of Capital Stock of the Seller,
upon the redemption or exercise of Seller Warrants, Seller Options or Seller
Phantom Units, (ii) to enter into any merger, consolidation or other business
combination relating to the Seller, Company or Acquired Entities or (iii) to
enter into a recapitalization, reorganization or any other extraordinary
business transaction involving or otherwise relating to the Seller, Company or
Acquired Entities; or

  



  

(b) participate in any discussions, conversations, negotiations or other
communications regarding, or furnish to any other Person any information with
respect to, or otherwise cooperate in any way, assist or participate in,
facilitate or encourage any effort or attempt by any other Person to seek to
do any of the foregoing. The Seller immediately shall cease and cause to be
terminated all existing discussions, conversations, negotiations and other
communications with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any of
the foregoing.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 5.7 _ Amendment of Disclosure Letters_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer agrees that, with respect to representations and warranties
of the Seller and the Company contained in this Agreement, the Seller and the
Company shall have the continuing right (but not the obligation) until the
Closing to add, supplement or amend the Seller Disclosure Letter to their
respective representations and warranties with respect to any matter arising
or discovered after the date hereof which, if existing at the date hereof or
thereafter, would have been required to be set forth or described in such
Seller Disclosure Letter. Any such additional, supplemental or amended
disclosure shall not be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation
or warranty for purposes of the termination rights contained in _Section
7.1(d)_ or of determining whether the conditions set forth in _Section 6.2_
have been satisfied; _provided, however_ , that (i) if such additional,
supplemental or amended disclosures would give rise to a right of the Buyer to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)_ , assuming (x) all other
conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ had been satisfied, and (y) the Closing
were scheduled to occur on the date that such additional, supplemental or
amended disclosures were received by the Buyer, then the Buyer shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement within 15 business days of its receipt of
such additional, supplemental or amended disclosure and (ii) if the Buyer does
not so elect to terminate this Agreement, then the Buyer shall be deemed to
have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect to
such matters and, _provided further_ , that after the Closing, any such
supplemental, additional or amended disclosure shall be taken into account
both for determining whether a breach of a representation or warranty has
occurred and for determining the amount of Damages for purposes of
indemnification under _Article VIII_. For the avoidance of doubt, any such
supplemental, additional or amended disclosure shall not limit the Buyer's
right to make a Claim under, and subject to the provisions of, _Article VIII_
for breach of representation or warranty, and such supplemental, additional or
amended disclosure shall not supplement, add or amend any representation or
warranty of the Seller for purposes of _Article VIII_.

  



  

(b) The Seller agrees that, with respect to representations and warranties
of the Buyer and the Buyer Parent contained in this Agreement, the Buyer and
the Buyer Parent shall have the continuing right (but not the obligation)
until the Closing to add, supplement or amend the Buyer Disclosure Letter to
their respective representations and warranties with respect to any matter
arising or discovered after the date hereof which, if existing at the date
hereof or thereafter, would have been required to be set forth or described in
such Buyer Disclosure Letter. Any such additional, supplemental or amended
disclosure shall not be deemed to have cured any breach of any representation
or warranty for purposes of the termination rights contained in Section
_7.1(c)_ or of determining whether the conditions set forth in Section _6.3_
have been satisfied; _provided, however_ , that (i) if such additional,
supplemental or amended disclosures would give rise to a right of the Seller
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section _7.1(c)_ , assuming (x) all
other conditions set forth in _Section 6.1_ had been satisfied, and (y) the
Closing were scheduled to occur on the date that such additional, supplemental
or amended disclosures were received by the Seller, then the Seller shall have
the right to terminate this Agreement within 15 business days of its receipt
of such additional, supplemental or amended disclosure and (ii) if the Seller
does not so elect to terminate this Agreement, then the Seller shall be deemed
to have irrevocably waived any right to terminate this Agreement with respect
to such matters and, _provided further_ , that after the Closing, any such
supplemental, additional or amended disclosure shall be taken into account
both for determining whether a breach of a representation or warranty has
occurred and for determining the amount of Damages for purposes of
indemnification under _Article VIII_. For the avoidance of doubt, any such
supplemental, additional or amended disclosure shall not limit the Seller's
right to make a Claim under, and subject to the provisions of, _Article VIII_
for breach of representation or warranty, and such supplemental, additional or
amended disclosure shall not supplement, add or amend any representation or
warranty of the Buyer and the Buyer Parent for purposes of _Article VIII_.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 5.8 _ Affiliate Arrangements_ _._ The Seller shall cause the
accounts or contracts between an Acquired Entity, on the one hand, and the
Seller, a Seller Shareholder or any Related Party of the Company, on the other
hand, set forth on Schedule 5.8 of the Seller Disclosure Letter to be
cancelled without any consideration or further liability to any party
immediately prior to the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.9 _ Termination of Indebtedness_. The Company and each
applicable Acquired Entity shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
negotiate debt payoff letters for all Indebtedness to be paid at Closing as
described in _Section 1.3_. The Company and each applicable Acquired Entity
shall deliver all notices and take all other actions reasonably requested by
the Buyer to facilitate the termination of all Contracts relating to such
Indebtedness, the termination of the commitments provided thereunder, the
repayment in full of all obligations then outstanding thereunder (using funds
provided by the Buyer) and the release of all Liens in connection therewith on
the Closing Date; _provided, however,_ that in no event shall this _Section
5.9_ require the Company or any of the Acquired Entities to cause the
termination of any Contracts related to such Indebtedness other than as part
of the Closing.

  



  

Section 5.10 _ Tax Matters_.

  



  

(a) _Tax Returns_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section 5.10(g)_ with
respect to Transfer Taxes:

  



  

(i) The Seller shall prepare and timely file (taking into account all
valid extensions), or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed (taking into
account all valid extensions), any and all income and franchise Tax Returns of
an Acquired Entity covering a Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date
that are required to be filed after the Closing Date (each, a " _Seller
Prepared Tax Return_ "), and each such Seller Prepared Tax Return shall be
prepared in a manner consistent with past custom and practice except as
otherwise required by applicable Law or fact. Subject to the indemnification
obligations of the Seller pursuant to _Section 8.2_ _(e)_ , the Buyer shall be
responsible for timely paying or causing the applicable Acquired Entity to
timely pay all Taxes reflected on a Seller Prepared Tax Return required to be
paid by the applicable Acquired Entity to the applicable Governmental
Authority.

  



  

(ii) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file (taking into account all
valid extensions), or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed (taking into
account all valid extensions), any and all (A) non-income and franchise Tax
Returns of an Acquired Entity covering a Tax period ending on or before the
Closing Date that are required to be filed after the Closing Date, and (B) Tax
Returns of an Acquired Entity covering a Tax period beginning on or before the
Closing Date and ending after the Closing Date (each, a " _Buyer Prepared Tax
Return_ "), and each Buyer Prepared Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with past custom and practice except as otherwise required by
applicable Law or fact. The Buyer shall provide a copy of each such Buyer
Prepared Tax Return, together with all supporting documentation and
workpapers, to the Seller for the Seller's review and reasonable comment at
least 30 days prior to the due date (taking into account all valid extensions)
for filing such Buyer Prepared Tax Return. The Buyer shall include any
reasonable comments provided in writing by the Seller to the Buyer at least
five days prior to the due date (taking into account all valid extensions) for
filing such Buyer Prepared Tax Return. Subject to the indemnification
obligations of the Seller pursuant to _Section 8.2_ _(e)_ , the Buyer shall be
responsible for timely paying, or causing the applicable Acquired Entity to
timely pay, all Taxes reflected on a Buyer Prepared Tax Return required to be
paid by the applicable Acquired Entity to the applicable Governmental
Authority.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) _Amended Tax Returns_. The Buyer shall not, and shall not cause or
permit any of its Affiliates, any Acquired Entity, or any of their Affiliates
to, (i) amend, modify, or re-file any Tax Return of an Acquired Entity that
covers a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (ii) grant an extension of any applicable
statute of limitations with respect to any Tax Return of an Acquired Entity
that covers a Pre-Closing Tax Period, (iii) make or change any Tax election
that affects any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (iv) take any action or position
that results in any increased Tax liability (including a reduction in a
refund) or reduction of any Tax attribute of an Acquired Entity with respect
to Pre-Closing Tax Periods, in each case without the prior written consent of
the Seller.

  



  

(c) _Determination of Straddle Period Taxes_. In the case of a Straddle
Period, the portion of Taxes attributable to such Straddle Period that are
allocated to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period shall be
determined as follows:

  



  

(i) the amount of any Taxes based on or measured by income, gains, or
receipts, or any Taxes other than Property Taxes, of the Acquired Entities
attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period will be
determined based on an interim closing of the close of business on the Closing
Date; _provided, however_ , that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including, but not limited to, depreciation and
amortization deductions) will be allocated between the period ending on the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number
of days in each such period, and

  



  

(ii) the amount of any real property, personal property, ad valorem, or
similar Taxes (" _Property Taxes_ ") of the Acquired Entities attributable to
the Pre-Closing Tax Period of such Straddle Period will be deemed to be the
total amount of such Property Taxes for the entire Straddle Period _multiplied
by_ a fraction, (A) the numerator of which is the number of days in the
Straddle Period up to and including the Closing Date, and (B) the denominator
of which is the total number of days in such Straddle Period.

  



  

(d) _Re funds_. The amount or economic benefit of any refund (whether in
cash or as a credit against or offset to any Tax) of any Tax of the Acquired
Entities attributable to any Pre-Closing Tax Period received by the Buyer, any
Acquired Entity, or any of their respective Affiliates, but only if and to the
extent such refund of Taxes exceeds the amount, if any, taken into account in
the final and binding Closing Working Capital, shall be for the account of the
Seller. Any such amount (including any interest received thereon) shall be
paid by the Buyer to the Seller within five days after any such refund is
received, credited or applied as an offset, as the case may be.

  



  

   

  



  

(e) _Tax Cooperation_. Each party shall (and shall cause its Affiliates)
to provide the other parties with such assistance as may reasonably be
requested by the other such party in connection with the preparation of any
Tax Return of or with respect to an Acquired Entity or during the course of
any audit, investigation, or other examination by a Tax authority or any
judicial or administrative proceeding relating to Taxes of or attributable to
an Acquired Entity including any tax work papers or memoranda related to or
addressing the Transaction Tax Deductions. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the request of another party) the provision of records and
information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Returns or audit,
examination, or other proceeding and making employees available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder. The Buyer agrees (i) to retain, and, following
the Closing, to cause the Acquired Entities to retain, all books and records
with respect to Tax matters relating to the Acquired Entities for any Tax
period (or portion thereof) beginning on or before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the
Seller, any extensions thereof) of the respective Tax period, and to abide by
all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental Authority,
and (ii) to give the Seller reasonable written notice prior to transferring,
destroying, or discarding any such books and records and, if the Seller so
requests, the Buyer or such Acquired Entity, as the case may be, shall allow
the Seller to take possession of such books and records. Each party further
agrees, upon reasonable request by another party, to use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other document from any Tax
authority or any other Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce, or
eliminate any Tax that could be imposed on the Seller or any Seller
Shareholder, the Buyer or any Acquired Entity (including, but not limited to,
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby).

  



  

(f) _Tax Contests_.

  



  

(i) The Buyer agrees to give prompt written notice to the Seller if it or
any Buyer Indemnitee receives any communication or notice with respect to any
audit, review, examination, assessment, or any other administrative or
judicial proceeding with the purpose or effect of re-determining Taxes of or
with respect to an Acquired Entity (including any administrative or judicial
review of any claim for refund) for which the Seller may be required to
provide indemnification pursuant to this Agreement (a " _Tax Contest_ ").

  



  

(ii) The Seller shall have the right to control and defend the conduct of
any Tax Contest covering any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date
(a " _Pre-Closing Tax Contest_ ") with counsel (including, for the avoidance
of doubt, accountants) of its choice; _provided_ , that (A) the Seller shall
keep the Buyer reasonably informed regarding the progress and substantive
aspects of the Pre-Closing Tax Contest, (B) the Buyer may monitor and observe
(and retain separate counsel at its sole cost and expense to monitor and
observe) the defense of the Pre-Closing Tax Contest, including, to the extent
the circumstances allow, having an opportunity to review any written materials
prepared in connection with the Pre-Closing Tax Contest and the right to
attend any conferences relating thereto, and (C) the Seller will not settle or
consent to the entry of any order, ruling, decision, or other similar
determination or finding with respect to such Pre-Closing Tax Contest without
the prior written consent of the Buyer (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

  



  

   

  



  

(iii) The Buyer shall have the right to control and defend any Tax Contest
covering any Straddle Period, any Tax Contest that is not a Pre-Closing Tax
Contest, or any Pre-Closing Tax Contest for which the Seller has not assumed
its right to control and defend such Pre-Closing Tax Contest as contemplated
by _Section 5.10(f)(ii)_ (an " _Other Tax Contest_ ") with counsel (including,
for the avoidance of doubt, accountants) of its choice; _provided_ , that,
with respect to any Tax items in the Other Tax Contest for which the resulting
Tax liability the Seller would be required to provide indemnification pursuant
to this Agreement, (A) the Buyer shall keep the Seller reasonably informed
regarding the progress and substantive aspects of such Tax items in the Other
Tax Contest, (B) the Seller may assume joint control and retain separate co-
counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in the defense of such
Tax items in the Other Tax Contest, including having an opportunity to review
and comment on any written materials prepared in connection with such Tax
items in the Other Tax Contest and the right to attend and participate in any
conferences relating thereto, and (C) the Buyer will not settle or consent to
the entry of any order, ruling, decision, or other similar determination or
finding with respect to such Tax items in the Other Tax Contest without the
prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned, or delayed).

  



  

(g) _Transfer Taxes_. Any and all transfer, sales, use, value added,
excise, filing, recording, documentary, stamp, or other similar Taxes
applicable to, imposed upon, or arising out of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (" _Transfer Taxes_ ") shall be the responsibility of and
borne by the Seller. The Seller shall at its own expense file, or cause to be
filed, all necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with respect to any
Transfer Taxes. The Buyer shall cooperate with the Seller in the preparation
of any necessary Tax Returns and other related documentation with respect to
Transfer Taxes. Each party agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate, reduce, or eliminate any Transfer Taxes.

  



  

(h) _Transaction Tax Deduct ions_. Notwithstanding _Section 5.10(c)_ or
anything else contained herein to the contrary, (i) to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable Law, only the Acquired Entities shall be entitled to

Acquired Entities covering a Pre-Closing Tax Period and (ii) any Transaction
Tax Deductions shall be allocated solely to the Pre-Closing Tax Period.

with respect to the purchase of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement.

this _Section 5.10_ and any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions
of this _Section 5.10_ shall control.

  



  

Section 5.11 _ Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, if any
further action is necessary to carry out the purposes of this Agreement, the
Parties shall take such further action (including the execution and delivery
of such further documents and instruments) as any Party may reasonably
request, all at the sole expense of the requesting Party (except as otherwise
expressly set forth in this Agreement).

  



  

   

  



  

Section 5.12 _ Retention of Books and Records_. The Seller may retain a
copy of any or all of the books and records relating to the Acquired Business
prior to the Closing. In addition, the Buyer shall cause the Acquired Entities

other material documents pertaining to the Acquired Entities in existence at
the Closing that are required to be retained under current retention policies
for a period of not less than seven years from the Closing Date, and to make

or its Representatives at the Seller's expense, during regular business hours
and upon reasonable request and upon reasonable advance notice.

the transactions contemplated hereby or any of the foregoing relationships
without the prior written consent of the Seller.

  



  

Section 5.14 _ Prior Knowledge._ The representations, warranties,
covenants, agreements and conditions of the Seller under this Agreement shall
not be affected or deemed waived for any purpose under this Agreement by
reason of any investigation made by or on behalf of the Buyer (including by
any of its Representatives) or by reason of the fact that the Buyer or any of
its Representatives knew or should have known of such breach or of the threat
of such breach or the circumstances giving rise to such breach; and the claims
and recourse of the Buyer or any Buyer Indemnitee against the Seller or its
respective directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons,
agents, advisors or Representatives with respect to a breach under Article
VIII of this Agreement or otherwise, shall not be impacted, by reason of any

Section 5.15 _Employee Matters_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer will cause the Acquired Entities, as applicable, to continue
to employ immediately after the Closing all of the then-current Company
Employees (including such persons on disability or leave of absence, whether
paid or unpaid) (the " _Continuing Employees_ "); _provided, however_ , that
the foregoing does not give any person the right to be employed or restrict in
any way the right of the Buyer to terminate any person's employment.

  



  

(b) For the one-year period beginning on the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
cause the Acquired Entities or any successor or Affiliate of the Buyer that
employs any of the Continuing Employees to provide base salary and bonus and
other incentive compensation opportunity at least as favorable as the base
salary and bonus and other incentive compensation opportunity that each
Continuing Employee was entitled to receive immediately before the Closing
Date and employee benefits that in the aggregate are at least as favorable as
the employee benefits provided to each Continuing Employee immediately before
the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer shall provide to
any Continuing Employee whose employment is terminated for reasons other than
cause during the one-year period beginning on the Closing Date with severance
payments at least as favorable as the severance payments for which such
Continuing Employee would have been eligible for a termination of employment
immediately before the Closing Date.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with
the Acquired Entities and their respective predecessors under any employee
benefit plan, program or arrangement of the Buyer or its Affiliates in which
such Continuing Employee is eligible to participate, including any such plans
providing vacation, sick pay, severance and retirement benefits maintained by
the Buyer or its Affiliates for purposes of eligibility, vesting and
entitlement to benefits, including for severance benefits and vacation
entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits), to the same extent as
if such service had been performed for the Buyer or any of its Affiliates. In
the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Continuing
Employees following the Closing and in the plan year in which the Closing
occurs, the Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Entities to, as
applicable, (i) waive all limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions
and waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements
applicable to the Continuing Employees under any such welfare plan provided to
the Continuing Employees, except to the extent that such conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would apply in the absence of such change, and
(ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit, in the calendar year in
which the Closing occurs, for any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
any such change in satisfying any applicable deductible or out of pocket
requirements after such change. Following the Closing, each Continuing
Employee will be eligible to use any accrued but unused vacation or other paid
time off benefits in place as of the Closing.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.15_ or otherwise in this
Agreement to the contrary, no provision of this Agreement is intended to, or
does, constitute the establishment or adoption of, or amendment to, any
employee benefit plan (within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA), and no
person shall have any claim or cause of action, under ERISA or otherwise, in
respect of any provision of this Agreement as it relates to any such employee
benefit plan or otherwise.

  



  

(e) The Buyer and Seller acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in
this _Section 5.15_ shall not (i) create any right in any person to any
continued employment with Buyer (except as may be set forth in an Employment
Agreement entered into by such person and Buyer) or (ii) limit the right of
Buyer to terminate any person or to change the terms and conditions of his or
her respective Employment Agreement (except as provided in _Section 5.15_
_(b)_ and Section _5.15(c)_ or as may be set forth in an Employment Agreement
entered into by such person and Buyer).

data processing, accounting, insurance, banking, personnel, legal, tax,
communications, information technology, human resources, health, safety and
environment and corporate and other products and services (i) provided to the

narrowly drawn as so not to be invalid or unenforceable, and such invalidity
or unenforceability shall not affect or render invalid or unenforceable any
other provision of this Agreement.

(a) each Party shall treat all documents, work papers and other materials
of the other Party relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, whether obtained before or after the execution of this Agreement,
in accordance with the obligations set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement;

  



  

   

  



  

(b) all filings, applications and other submissions made pursuant hereto
shall, at the discretion of the Seller, and to the extent practicable, be
withdrawn from the agency or other person to which made; and

  



  

(c) there shall be no liability or obligation under this Agreement on the
part of the Seller, the Company or the Buyer or any of their Affiliates or any
of their respective Representatives, except (i) that nothing in this _Section
7.2_ shall relieve any Party from liability for Fraud, a willful breach hereof
or willful failure to perform its obligations hereunder and (ii) the
provisions of _Section 5.1(c)_ , this _Section 7.2_ and _Article VIII_ shall
survive any such termination. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting
the foregoing, any failure of the Buyer or the Seller to close the Acquisition
following the satisfaction or waiver of such Parties' conditions to closing
set forth in _Article VI_ shall be considered a willful breach by the
applicable Parties of such Parties' covenants hereunder.

  



  

 **Article VIII 
 SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION; 
 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION AND CLAIMS**

  



  

Section 8.1 _ Survival_.

  



  

(a) The representations and warranties of each of the Seller, the Company
and the Buyer contained in this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date until
5:00 p.m. Fort Worth, Texas time on the date that is 18 months following the

Fundamental Representations, the representations and warranties of the Company
set forth in _Section 3.17_ and the Buyer Fundamental Representations shall
survive the Closing Date until 5:00 p.m., Fort Worth, Texas time, on the date
that is three years following the Closing Date, whereupon in each case such
representations and warranties will terminate and expire (such applicable
periods referred to above, the " _Survival Period_ "). The Parties intend to
control for the length of the statute of limitations by specifying the
survival periods in this Agreement. This _Section 8.1_ shall not limit any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement which contemplates performance after
the Closing; _provided_ that the covenants in _Section 5.10_ shall survive the
Closing Date only until 5:00 p.m., Fort Worth, Texas time, on the date that is
three years following the Closing Date, whereupon such covenant will terminate
and expire.

  



  

(b) Following the expiration of the applicable Survival Period, no Claim
will or may be made or prosecuted through a Proceeding or otherwise, and no
indemnification will or may be sought under this _Article VIII_ , by any
Person who would have been entitled to Damages under this Agreement or to
indemnification under this _Article VIII_ on the basis of that representation
and warranty prior to its termination and expiration, unless the Party seeking
indemnification hereunder delivers a valid Claim Notice to the other Party or
Parties, as applicable, prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival
Period.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the foregoing, nothing in
this _Section 8.1_ will limit or otherwise restrict in any respect any claim
for Fraud.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 8.2 _ Indemnification of the Buyer Indemnitees_. Subject to the
applicable provisions of this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing, the
Seller shall indemnify and hold harmless each Buyer Indemnitee against all
Third-Party Claims and all Damages that arise from, are based on or relate or
otherwise are attributable to, without duplication (each such Third-Party
Claim or Damage referred to in clauses (a) through (g) below being a " _Buyer
Indemnified Loss_ "): (a) any breach of any representations and warranties of
the Seller set forth in _Article II_ of this Agreement (but in any event with
respect to this _Section 8.2_ _(a)_ , disregarding any qualifications as to
"materiality," "Seller Material Adverse Effect," "material adverse effect" or
words of similar import contained in any such representation or warranty for
purposes of determining both a breach and the amount of any Damages); (b) any
breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or agreement on the part of the
Seller under this Agreement; (c) any breach of any representations and
warranties of the Company set forth in _Article III_ of this Agreement (but in
any event with respect to this _Section 8.2_ _(c)_ , disregarding any

amount of any Damages); (d) any breach or nonfulfillment of any covenant or
agreement on the part of the Company under this Agreement that by its terms is
to be performed by the Company at or prior to the Closing; (e) (i) any and all

determined in accordance with _Section 5.10(c)_ for Straddle Periods) and (ii)
all Taxes of any member of an affiliated, consolidated, combined or unitary
group of which any of the Acquired Entities (or any predecessor of any of the
foregoing) is or was a member on or prior to the Closing Date, including
pursuant to Treasury Regulation §1.1502-6 or any analogous or similar state,
local, or foreign Law, and (iii) any and all Taxes of any Person (other than
the Acquired Entities) imposed on any of the Acquired Entities as a transferee
or successor, by contract or pursuant to any Law, which Taxes relate to an
event or transaction occurring before the Closing; _provided, however_ , (x)
only if and to the extent that such Taxes are not taken into account in the
final and binding Closing Working Capital, Closing Indebtedness, or
Transaction Expenses, and (y) the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be indemnified
and held harmless from and against any Damages incurred as a result of or
relating to any Taxes arising from transactions occurring on the Closing Date
after the Closing outside the Ordinary Course of Business; (f) any (i)
Transaction Expenses to the extent not paid pursuant to Section _1.3(b)_ or

made to the Seller on or before the date that is one year following the
Closing Date; and (g) if a valid Claim Notice is made to the Seller on or
before the date that is 18 months following the Closing Date, the Specified
Matters. Any assignment by the Seller of its rights or obligations pursuant to
this Agreement shall not relieve the Seller of its liabilities or obligations
under this Agreement. **The indemnification provisions in this**
****_**Section**_ _ **8.2**_ **are expressly intended to apply notwithstanding
the negligence or gross negligence (whether sole, concurrent, active or
passive) or strict liability or illegal conduct on the part of the Buyer
Indemnitees or whether Damages are asserted in contract, quasi-contract,
breach of representation and warranty (express or implied), personal injury or
other tort, under law or otherwise** **.**

  



  

Section 8.3 _Indemnification of the Seller Indemnitees_. Subject to the
applicable provisions of this _Article VIII_ , from and after the Closing, the
Buyer will indemnify and hold harmless each Seller Indemnitee against all
Third-Party Claims and all Damages that arise from, are based on or relate or
otherwise are attributable to, without duplication: (a) any breach by the
Buyer or Buyer Parent of its representations and warranties set forth in
_Article II_ (but in any event with respect to this _Section 8.3_ ,
disregarding any qualifications as to "materiality," "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect," "material adverse effect" or words of similar import contained in any
such representation or warranty for purposes of determining both a breach and
the amount of any Damages); or (b) any breach or nonfulfillment of any
covenant or agreement on the part of the Buyer or Buyer Parent and, from and
after the Closing, the Acquired Entities under this Agreement (each such
Third-Party Claim or Damage referred to in this sentence being a " _Seller
Indemnified Loss_ "). Any assignment by the Buyer of its rights or obligations
pursuant to this Agreement shall not relieve the Buyer of its liabilities or
obligations under this Agreement. **The indemnification provisions in this** _
**Section 8.3**_ **are expressly intended to apply notwithstanding the
negligence or gross negligence (whether sole, concurrent, active or passive)
or strict liability or illegal conduct on the part of the Seller Indemnitees
or whether Damages are asserted in contract, quasi-contract, breach of
representation and warranty (express or implied), personal injury or other
tort, under law or otherwise.**

  



  

   

  



  

Section 8.4 _ Conditions of Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) All Claims for indemnification under _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_
shall be asserted and resolved as this _Section 8.4_ provides.

  



  

(b) In the event a Party (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") (i) believes in good
faith that it has suffered or incurred Damages or (ii) learns of or receives
notice of any commencement of any Proceeding, the written assertion of any
Third-Party Claim or the imposition of any penalty, assessment or judgment, in
each case for which indemnity may be sought pursuant to _Section 8.2_ __ or
_Section 8.3_ , and such Party intends to seek indemnity from another Party
(the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") pursuant to _Section 8.2_ or _Section 8.3_ ,
such Indemnified Party shall provide the Indemnifying Party (or, if the
Indemnifying Party is the Seller, the Seller) with written notice describing
the Claim in reasonable detail (a " _Claim Notice_ ") of such Proceeding,
Third-Party Claim, penalty, assessment or judgment promptly (and in no event
later than 30 days) after the Indemnified Party learns of or receives notice
of such Proceeding, Third-Party Claim, penalty, assessment or judgment;
_provided, however_ , that any Claim Notice must be received by the
Indemnifying Party (or, if the Indemnifying Party is the Seller, the Seller)
prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period. Each Claim Notice
shall describe, with as much detail as is reasonably practicable, the basis of
the Third-Party Claim, a copy of all papers served with respect to that Claim
(if any) and all other material written evidence thereof, an estimate of the
amount of damages attributable to that Claim to the extent feasible (which
estimate will not be conclusive of the final amount of that Claim) and the
basis for the Indemnified Party's request for indemnification under this
Agreement. The failure to promptly deliver a Claim Notice will not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations to the Indemnified Party with respect to
the related Third-Party Claim (i) unless the Indemnified Party fails to
deliver a valid Claim Notice prior to expiration of the applicable Survival
Period or (ii) unless and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is
materially prejudiced thereby.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Upon receipt of a Claim Notice from an Indemnified Party with respect
to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may elect to assume and control
the defense of any such Third-Party Claim or any Proceeding resulting
therefrom. After notice from the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Person
of its election to assume and control the defense of a Third-Party Claim or
any Proceeding resulting therefrom, the Indemnifying Party shall not, so long
as the Indemnifying Party diligently conducts such defense, be liable to the
Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_ for any fees of other counsel or
any other expenses with respect to the defense of such Third-Party Claim, in
each case subsequently incurred by the Indemnified Party in connection with
the defense of such Third-Party Claim. In the event that an Indemnifying Party
assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnifying Party will
have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim
in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party, and the Indemnified Party
will furnish the Indemnifying Party with all information in its possession,
custody or control with respect to such Third-Party Claim and otherwise
cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party in all aspects of any
investigation, defense, pretrial activities, trial, compromise, settlement or
discharge of such Third-Party Claim, including by providing the party with all
reasonably requested information and reasonable access to employees and
officers (including as witnesses) and the right to inspect and copy documents
and records or other information; _provided, however_ , the Indemnifying Party
will not consent to any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect to
any Third-Party Claim that does not include as an unconditional term thereof
the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such Indemnified Party of a full
and unconditional release from all liability in respect of such claim or
litigation. Neither the Indemnifying Party nor the Indemnified Party shall
settle, compromise or make any other disposition of any Third-Party Claim
which would or might result in any liability to the Indemnified Party or the
Indemnifying Party, respectively, under this _Article VIII_ without the
written consent of such other Party (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) unless the sole relief provided is monetary damages
that are paid in full by the Party agreeing to such settlement, compromise or
disposition. All costs and expenses incurred by the Indemnifying Party in
defending any Third-Party Claim shall be counted in calculating the amounts
set forth in _Section 8.7(a)_ if the Third-Party Claim relates to a matter to
which _Section 8.7(a)_ applies. The Indemnified Party may participate in, but
not control, any defense or settlement of any Third-Party Claim the
Indemnifying Party controls under this _Section 8.4(c)_ and will bear its own
costs and expenses with respect to that participation; _provided, however_ ,
that if the named parties to any such action (including any impleaded parties)
include both the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party, and the
Indemnified Party has been advised in writing by outside counsel that there is
a conflict of interest which renders it inadvisable for one firm to represent
the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party
may employ separate counsel at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying
Party ( _provided_ , that such counsel is limited to one separate firm of
attorneys, in addition to one local counsel firm), and, on its written
notification of that employment, the Indemnifying Party will not have the
right to assume or continue the defense of that action on behalf of the
Indemnified Party. The provisions of this _Section 8.4(c)_ shall not apply to
Tax Contests, which shall be governed by the provisions of _Section 5.10(f)_.

  



  

(d) If the Indemnifying Party (i) elects not to defend the Indemnified
Party under this _Article VIII_ or (ii) fails to notify the Indemnified Party
that the Indemnifying Party elects to defend the Indemnified Party under
_Section 8.4(c)_ , then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend,
at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying Party (if the Indemnified
Party is entitled to indemnification hereunder), the Third-Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings the Indemnified Party must promptly
and vigorously prosecute to a final conclusion or settle. The Indemnified
Party will have full control of such defense and proceedings; _provided,
however_ , the Indemnified Party will not enter into any settlement with
respect to any Third-Party Claim that would result in payment of an amount for
which the Indemnifying Party would be liable under this _Article VIII_ without
the prior consent of that Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
if it is determined that the Indemnifying Party does not have liability to the
Indemnified Party under this _Article VIII_ , the Indemnifying Party will not
be required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnified Party's defense
under this _Section 8.4_ or of the Indemnifying Party's participation therein
at the Indemnified Party's request, and the Indemnified Party will reimburse
the Indemnifying Party in full for all reasonable costs and expenses of that
litigation. The Indemnifying Party may participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement the Indemnified Party controls under this _Section
8.4(d)_ , and the Indemnifying Party will bear its own costs and expenses with
respect to that participation. The provisions of this _Section 8.4(d)_ shall
not apply to Tax Contests, which shall be governed by the provisions of
_Section 5.10(f)_.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 8.5 _ Payments by an Indemnifying Party_. Payments of all amounts
owing by an Indemnifying Party under this _Article VIII_ relating to a Third-
Party Claim will be made within 30 days after the latest of (a) the settlement
of that Third-Party Claim, (b) the expiration of the period for appeal of a
final adjudication of that Third-Party Claim or (c) the expiration of the
period for appeal of a final adjudication of the Indemnifying Party's
liability to the Indemnified Party under this Agreement in respect of that
Third-Party Claim.

  



  

Section 8.6 _ Procedures for Direct Claims_.

  



  

(a) Except as otherwise may be ordered by a court of competent
jurisdiction and notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Buyer
Indemnitees and the Seller Indemnitees shall bear their own costs, including
counsel fees and expenses, incurred in connection with direct claims for
indemnification against the Buyer or the Seller, respectively, hereunder that
are not based upon Third-Party Claims (" _Direct Claims_ "). The Indemnifying
Party shall have 60 days after its receipt of a Claim Notice with respect to a
Direct Claim to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. If the Indemnifying
Party does not so respond within such 60-day period, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such Direct Claim, in which case the
Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to
the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement. The Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying Party and its
representatives to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to have
given rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist
the Indemnifying Party's investigation by making available such reasonably
requested information and assistance (including reasonable access to the
premises and personnel of the Acquired Entities and the right to inspect and
copy any accounts, documents, records or other information) of the Acquired
Entities as the Indemnifying Party or any of its representatives may
reasonably request.

  



  

(b) Payments of all amounts owing by a Party pursuant to _Section 8.6(a)_
will be made within 30 days after the settlement, agreement or expiration of
the period for appeal of a final adjudication of such Party's liability with
respect to such amount under this Agreement.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 8.7 _ Certain Limitations on Indemnification for Third-Party
Claims and Direct Claims_.

  



  

(a) No indemnification shall be made by the Seller pursuant to Section
8.2(a), _Section 8.2_ _(c)_ or _Section 8.2_ _(d)_ (i) unless such individual
Buyer Indemnified Loss or series of related Buyer Indemnified Losses exceeds
the Threshold Amount (and any such Losses relating to or arising out of any
individual event, matter or occurrence, or series of related events, matters
or occurrences for an amount less than or equal to the Threshold Amount shall
not be considered "Losses" for purposes of this Agreement and shall be
excluded from the calculation of Losses for purposes of determining whether or
not Losses exceeding the Deductible has occurred for purposes of Section
_8.7(a)_ _(ii)_ , but the amount of any Losses relating to or arising out of
any individual event, matter or occurrence, or series of related events,
matters or occurrences for an amount greater than the Threshold Amount shall
be considered Losses for their full amount), and (ii) unless and until the
aggregate amount of Buyer Indemnified Losses exceeding the Threshold Amount
that would otherwise be subject to indemnification exceeds the Deductible,
and, in such event, indemnification shall only be made by the Seller to the
extent that the Buyer Indemnified Losses exceed the Deductible. The Seller's
obligation to indemnify the Buyer under Section _8.2_ _(a)_ for a breach of
the Company's representations and warranties set forth in Section _3.17_ shall
not be subject to (A) the Threshold Amount or (B) the Deductible, and such
Buyer Indemnified Losses shall be paid from the first dollar, subject to the
Damages Cap. The Seller's obligation to indemnify the Buyer under Section
_8.2_ _(a)_ for a breach of the Company's representations and warranties set
forth in Section _3.16_ shall not be subject to (A) the Threshold Amount or
(B) the Deductible, and such Buyer Indemnified Losses shall be paid from the
first dollar that exceeds $300,000, subject to the Damages Cap. The maximum
amount that the Seller shall be required to pay pursuant to _Section 8.2_
_(a)_ , _Section 8.2_ _(c)_ and _Section 8.2_ _(d)_ in respect of all Buyer
Indemnified Losses shall not exceed the Damages Cap, after which point the
Seller shall have no obligation to indemnify the Buyer Indemnitees from and
against further Buyer Indemnified Losses. The Seller's obligation to indemnify
the Buyer under _Section 8.2_ _(g)_ shall not be subject to (A) the Threshold
Amount or (B) the Deductible, and such Buyer Indemnified Losses shall be paid
from the first dollar, subject to an aggregate limit at the Specified Matters
Damages Cap. The Seller's obligation to indemnify the Buyer under _Section
8.2_ _(b)_ , _Section 8.2_ _(e)_ , _Section 8.2_ _(f)_ or _Section 9.13_ shall
not be subject to any of the limitations in this _Section 8.7_.

  



  

(b) No indemnification shall be made by the Buyer pursuant to _Section
8.3_ _(a)_ (i) unless such Seller Indemnified Loss or series of Seller
Indemnified Losses exceeds the Threshold Amount, (and any such Losses relating
to or arising out of any individual event, matter or occurrence, or series of
related events, matters or occurrences for an amount less than or equal to the
Threshold Amount shall not be considered "Losses" for purposes of this
Agreement and shall be excluded from the calculation of Losses for purposes of
determining whether or not Losses exceeding the Deductible has occurred for
purposes of _Section 8.7(b)_ _(ii)_ , but the amount of any Losses relating to
or arising out of any individual event, matter or occurrence, or series of
related events, matters or occurrences for an amount greater than the
Threshold Amount shall be considered Losses for their full amount), and (ii)
unless and until the aggregate amount of Seller Indemnified Losses exceeding
the Threshold Amount that would be subject to indemnification exceeds the
Deductible, and, in such event, indemnification shall only be made by the
Buyer to the extent that the Seller Indemnified Losses exceed the Deductible.
The maximum amount that the Buyer shall be required to pay pursuant to
_Section 8.3_ _(a)_ in respect of all Seller Indemnified Losses shall not
exceed the Damages Cap, after which point the Buyer shall have no obligation
to indemnify the Seller Indemnitees from and against further Seller
Indemnified Losses. The Buyer's obligations to pay and deliver to the Seller
the Total Consideration and the Buyer's obligations to indemnify the Seller
under _Section 8.3_ _(b)_ or _Section 9.13_ shall not be subject to any of the
limitations in this _Section 8.7_.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) (i) The limitations set forth in _Section 8.7(a)_ and _Section 8.7(b)_
shall not apply to Buyer Indemnified Losses or Seller Indemnified Losses,
respectively, based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of any
inaccuracy in or breach of any Seller Fundamental Representation, Company
Fundamental Representation or Buyer Fundamental Representation and (ii) the
limitations set forth in _Section 8.7(a)_ and _Section 8.7(b)_ shall not apply
to any Claim for Fraud.

  



  

(d) The amount of any Buyer Indemnified Losses shall be reduced by (i) any
amount actually received by a Buyer Indemnitee with respect thereto under any
insurance coverage (other than self-insurance or insurance coverage provided
by any captive insurance company that is an Affiliate of a Buyer Indemnitee)
or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor and (ii) the amount
of any Tax Benefit directly or indirectly available to the Buyer Indemnitee
relating thereto. Any Indemnified Party having a claim under this _Article
VIII_ shall make a good faith effort to recover any Damages from insurers of
such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates under applicable insurance policies,
in each case as to reduce the amount of any indemnifiable Damages hereunder.
If such a recovery or benefit is received or enjoyed by an Indemnified Party
after it receives payment or other credit under this Agreement with respect to
any Damages, then a refund equal in aggregate amount of such recovery,
reduction or setoff (net of reasonable expenses and Tax or other costs
incurred in obtaining such recovery or benefit) will be made promptly to such
Indemnifying Party. For purposes of this _Section 8.7(d)_ , a " _Tax Benefit_
" shall mean a reduction in the Buyer Indemnitee's Taxes (calculated net of
any Tax detriment resulting from the receipt of any indemnification payment,
including the present value of any Tax detriment resulting from the loss of
any depreciation and amortization deductions over time, calculated using a
discount rate of 3.5%) arising out of any Damages that create a Tax deduction,
credit or other Tax benefit. In computing the amount of any such Tax Benefit,
the Buyer Indemnitee shall be deemed to recognize all other items of income,
gain, loss, deduction or credit before recognizing any item arising from the
receipt of any indemnity payment hereunder or the incurrence or payment of any
Buyer Indemnified Losses.

  



  

(e) The amount of any Seller Indemnified Losses shall be reduced by any
amount actually received by a Seller Indemnitee with respect thereto under any
insurance coverage (other than self-insurance or insurance coverage provided
by any captive insurance company that is an Affiliate of a Seller Indemnitee)
or from any other party alleged to be responsible therefor. Any Indemnified
Party having a Claim under _Article VIII_ shall make a good faith effort to
recover any Damages from insurers of such Indemnified Party or its Affiliates
under applicable insurance policies, in each case as to reduce the amount of
any indemnifiable Damages hereunder. If such a recovery or benefit is received
or enjoyed by an Indemnified Party after it receives payment or other credit
under this Agreement with respect to any Damages, then a refund equal in
aggregate amount of such recovery, reduction or setoff (net of reasonable
expenses and Tax or other costs incurred in obtaining such recovery or
benefit) will be made promptly to such Indemnifying Party.

  



  

   

  



  

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the Buyer Indemnitees shall not be
entitled to any indemnification under this _Article VIII_ if any Tax
attributes of the Company or any other Acquired Entity (including net
operating loss carryovers, capital loss carryovers, adjusted basis, or
credits) are not available to the Company or any other Acquired Entity or any
other Person for any Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the
Closing Date.

  



  

Section 8.8 _ No Special Damages_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, from and after the Closing no Party nor any of its Affiliates
shall be liable under this _Article VIII_ , otherwise under this Agreement or
under any other Transaction Document or otherwise for exemplary, special,
punitive, indirect, remote, speculative or consequential damages, whether in
tort (including negligence or gross negligence), strict liability, by contract
or statute, except to the extent any Indemnified Party suffers such damages
(i) for Fraud or (ii) to an unaffiliated third party in connection with a
finally adjudicated Third-Party Claim, in which case such damages shall be
recoverable (to the extent recoverable under this _Article VIII_ _)_ without
giving effect to this _Section 8.8_.

  



  

Section 8.9 _ Sole and Exclusive Remedy_.

  



  

(a) FROM AND AFTER THE CLOSING, THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF ANY
PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ITS AFFILIATES WITH RESPECT TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE
EVENTS GIVING RISE TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT AND CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUIRED ENTITIES AND THEIR
OPERATIONS SHALL BE LIMITED TO THE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS SET FORTH IN
THIS _ARTICLE VIII_ , AND, IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, EACH OF THE
PARTIES, ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND OF ITS AFFILIATES, HEREBY WAIVES, RELEASES
AND DISCHARGES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE OTHER
PARTIES TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES FROM ANY AND ALL
BUYER INDEMNIFIED LOSSES OR SELLER INDEMNIFIED LOSSES (OTHER THAN THOSE
ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO FRAUD), AS THE CASE MAY BE, OF ANY KIND (WHETHER
AT LAW OR IN EQUITY OR OTHERWISE, FORESEEN OR UNFORESEEN, MATURED OR
UNMATURED, KNOWN OR UNKNOWN, ACCRUED OR NOT ACCRUED OR BASED ON ANY LAW OR
RIGHT OF ACTION OR OTHERWISE) EXCEPT AS PROVIDED IN THIS AGREEMENT
NOTWITHSTANDING THE STRICT LIABILITY, GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR NEGLIGENCE OF A
RELEASED PARTY (WHETHER SOLE, JOINT OR CONCURRENT OR ACTIVE OR PASSIVE).

  



  

(b) The Parties intend that, even though indemnification obligations
appear in various sections and articles of this Agreement, the indemnification
procedures, limitations, express negligence and other provisions contained in
this _Article VIII_ shall apply to all indemnity obligations of the Parties
under this Agreement, except to the extent expressly excluded in this _Article
VIII_.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the sole
and exclusive rights and remedies of the Parties with respect to the
determination of the Aggregate Cash Purchase Price are set forth in _Section
1.2_ and _Section 1.4_.

  



  

Section 8.10 _ Buyer's Investigation; Disclaimer of Representations and
Warranties_. The Buyer has conducted its own independent review and analysis
of the Acquired Entities, including the operations, assets, liabilities,
results of operations, financial condition, software, technology and prospects
of the Acquired Entities, and acknowledges that the Buyer has been provided
access to the personnel, properties, premises and records of the Acquired
Entities for such purpose. In entering into this Agreement, the Buyer has
relied solely upon its own investigation and analysis, and the Buyer: (A)
acknowledges that neither the Seller nor the Company nor any of their
respective Representatives makes or has made any representation or warranty,
either express or implied, as to the accuracy or completeness of any of the
information provided or made available to the Buyer or its Representatives
(including any information provided or made available to the Buyer in any
"data room"); and (B) agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, that,
other than in the case of Fraud, neither the Seller nor the Company nor any of
their respective Representatives shall have any liability or responsibility
whatsoever to the Buyer or its Representatives on any basis (including in
contract, quasi-contract, breach of representation and warranty (express or
implied), personal injury, or other tort, under Law or otherwise) based upon
any information provided or made available, or statements made, to the Buyer
or its directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, controlling persons,
advisors, agents or other Representatives (or any omissions therefrom),
including in respect of the specific representations and warranties of the
Seller and the Company set forth in this Agreement, except that the foregoing
limitations shall not apply to the extent the Seller and the Company make the
specific representations and warranties set forth in _Article II_ and _Article
III_ , but always subject to the limitations and restrictions contained
herein. The Buyer has relied on no representation or warranty other than as
described in the preceding sentence. Except as specifically set forth in
_Article II_ and _Article III_ , (1) Neither the Seller nor the Company make
any representation or warranty, express or implied, at Law or in equity, in
respect of or otherwise in any way relating to themselves, the Acquired
Entities or their liabilities or operations, including with respect to value,
condition (including environmental condition) or performance or
merchantability, noninfringement or fitness for any purpose (both generally or
for any particular purpose) and with respect to future revenue, profitability
or the success of the Acquired Entities and (2) any such other representations
or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 8.11 _ No Multiple Recoveries_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in the event any
Party (or any other indemnitee) is entitled to a payment or other benefit
under more than one provision of this Agreement arising out of or resulting
from the same set of facts or circumstances and such Person has already been
made whole by payment or another benefit under one of those provisions, in no
event shall such Person be entitled to receive a subsequent payment or benefit
under any other provision of this Agreement. In furtherance of the foregoing,
any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be without duplication (
_i.e._ , without allowing the claiming Party (or other indemnitee) to receive
more than its Damages) by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

  



  

(b) The Buyer Indemnitees shall not be entitled to recover under this
_Article VIII_ for Buyer Indemnified Losses to the extent such Buyer
Indemnified Losses were taken into account in the determination of the
adjustment provisions in accordance with _Section 1.2_ or _Section 1.4_.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 8.12 _ Setoff; Payments by the Seller_. Neither the Buyer nor the
Seller shall have any right to set off any amounts owed to a Buyer Indemnitee
or a Seller Indemnitee, respectively, under this _Article VIII_ against any
payments to be made by either of them under any other provisions of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document, except the Buyer shall, prior to
receiving any cash payment for Claims under this _Article VIII_ from the
Seller, first setoff any amounts owed to a Buyer Indemnitee under this
_Article VIII_ against any unpaid amount of the Seller's Note as provided
herein and therein.

  



  

Section 8.13 _ Subrogation_. The Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated
to the rights of the Indemnified Party in respect of any insurance (other than
self-insurance or insurance coverage provided by any captive insurance company
that is an Affiliate of any Party) relating to Buyer Indemnified Losses or
Seller Indemnified Losses, as the case may be, to the extent of any
indemnification payments made hereunder, and the Indemnified Party shall
provide all reasonably requested assistance to the Indemnifying Party in
respect of such subrogation, including executing any instrument reasonably
necessary to evidence such subrogation rights.

  



  

Section 8.14 _ Amount of Losses_. The determination of the dollar amount
of any Buyer Indemnified Losses or Seller Indemnified Losses, as the case may
be, shall be based solely on the actual dollar value thereof, on a dollar-for-
dollar basis, and shall not take into account any multiplier valuations,
including any multiple based on earnings or other financial indicia.

  



  

Section 8.15 _ Mitigation_. Each Party shall, and shall cause its
applicable Affiliates and Representatives to, take all reasonable steps to
mitigate any Buyer Indemnified Losses or Seller Indemnified Losses, as
applicable, upon and after becoming aware of any fact, event, circumstance or
condition that has given rise to, or would reasonably be expected to give rise
to, any Buyer Indemnified Losses or Seller Indemnified Losses, as applicable,
that are indemnifiable hereunder and shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to avoid any costs or expenses associated with such claim and, if such costs
and expenses cannot be avoided, to minimize the amount thereof.

  



  

Section 8.16 _ Purchase Price Adjustment_. Unless otherwise required by
applicable Law, for all Tax purposes, the Parties agree to treat (and will
cause each of their respective Affiliates to treat) any indemnification
payment made under this Agreement as an adjustment to the Aggregate Cash
Purchase Price.

  



  

 **Article IX 
 GENERAL PROVISIONS**

  



  

Section 9.1 _ Amendment and Modification_. This Agreement may be amended,
modified or supplemented at any time by the Parties, pursuant to an instrument
in writing signed by all of the Parties. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement, this Agreement, including _Article VIII_ hereof, may be amended or
modified at any time by the Parties without the need or requirement of any
consent or approval of any other Buyer Indemnitee or Seller Indemnitee and any
amendment or modification agreed to by the Parties shall be binding on all
Buyer Indemnitees and all Seller Indemnitees.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 9.2 _ Entire Agreement; Assignment_. This Agreement (including
the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), the Confidentiality Agreement and the
other Transaction Documents (a) constitute the entire agreement among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede
other prior agreements and understandings both written and oral among the
Parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof and (b) shall
not be assigned, by operation of Law or otherwise, by a Party, without the
prior written consent of the other Parties. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this _Section 9.2_ shall be void and without effect; _provided,
however_ , that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Buyer may, without the
consent of the Seller, assign its right to purchase all or any portion of the
Shares to any wholly owned Subsidiary of the Buyer; _provided, further_ , that
no such assignment shall limit or affect the Buyer's obligations hereunder.

  



  

Section 9.3 _ Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be
deemed severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision
hereof shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions
hereof. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any
Person or any circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and
equitable provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so
far as may be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 9.4 _ Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 5.4_ and as
otherwise provided in this Agreement, all costs and expenses (including legal,
accounting and financial advisory fees and expenses) incurred in connection
with, or in anticipation of, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, shall be paid by the Party incurring such expenses.

  



  

Section 9.5 _ Waiver_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, no failure to exercise, delay in exercising, or single or partial
exercise of any right, power or remedy by any Party, and no course of dealing
between the Parties, shall constitute a waiver of any such right, power or
remedy. No waiver by a Party of any default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder, whether intentional or not, shall be deemed to
extend to any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation or breach of
warranty or covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by
virtue of any prior or subsequent such occurrence. No waiver shall be valid
unless in writing and signed by the Party against whom such waiver is sought
to be enforced.

  



  

Section 9.6 _ Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed
simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed by each of the Parties and delivered to the other Parties. Signatures
to this Agreement transmitted by electronic mail in "portable document format"
(.pdf) form, or by any other electronic means intended to preserve the
original graphic and pictorial appearance of a document, will have the same
effect as physical delivery of the paper document bearing the original
signature.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 9.7 _ Governing Law_. This Agreement and the legal relations
between the Parties shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the
Laws of the State of Texas, without regard to any principles of conflicts of
Laws of any other Jurisdiction.

  



  

Section 9.8 _ Exclusive Jurisdiction_. Each of the Parties hereto hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for itself and its property, to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Texas located in the
County of Harris, or of the United States of America sitting in the Southern
District of Texas, and any appellate court from any thereof, in any Proceeding
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document
or any agreements contemplated hereby or thereby for any reason other than the
failure to serve process in accordance with this _Section 9.8_ , and
irrevocably waive the defense of an inconvenient forum or an improper venue to
the maintenance of any such Proceeding. Any service of process to be made in
such Proceeding may be made by delivery of process in accordance with the
notice provisions contained in _Section 9.10_. The consents to jurisdiction
set forth in this _Section 9.8_ shall not constitute general consents to
service of process in the State of Texas and shall have no effect for any
purpose except as provided in this _Section 9.8_ and shall not be deemed to
confer rights on any Person other than the Parties. The Parties agree that a
final judgment in any such Proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced
in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided
by applicable Law. In addition, each of the Parties hereto agrees that it will
not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or other
request for leave from any such court.

  



  

Section 9.9 _ Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each Party acknowledges and agrees
that any controversy which may arise under this Agreement is likely to involve
complicated and difficult issues, and therefore each of the Parties hereby
irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any Proceeding arising out of
or relating to this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or any
agreements contemplated hereby or thereby. The Parties also waive any bond or
surety or security upon such bond that might, but for this waiver, be
required. The scope of this waiver is intended to be all encompassing of any
and all disputes that may be filed in any court and that relate to the subject
matter of this transaction, including contract claims, tort claims, breach of
duty claims and all other common law and statutory claims. This waiver is
irrevocable, meaning that it may not be modified either orally or in writing,
and the waiver shall apply to any subsequent amendments, renewals, supplements
or modifications to this Agreement. In the event of litigation, this Agreement
may be filed as a written consent to a trial by the court.

to be given hereunder will be in writing and will be given if delivered by
hand or sent by registered or certified mail (postage prepaid, return receipt
requested) or by overnight courier (providing proof of delivery) or by e-mail

or in any case to such other address or addresses as hereafter shall be
furnished as provided in this _Section 9.10_ by any Party to the other Party.

  



  

   

  



  

Section 9.11 _ No Partnership; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Nothing in
this Agreement shall be deemed to create a joint venture, partnership, tax
partnership or agency relationship between the Parties. This Agreement is
solely for the benefit of (a) the Seller (and its successors and permitted
assigns), with respect to the obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement;
and (b) the Buyer (and its successors and permitted assigns), with respect to
the obligations of the Seller under this Agreement. Except as provided in (i)
_Section 5.5_ , (ii) Section _5.18_ , (iii) _Article VIII_ , and (iv) _Section
9.16_ (the provisions in clauses (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), the " _Third-Party
Provisions_ "), this Agreement shall not be deemed to confer upon or give to
any other third Person any remedy, claim of liability or reimbursement, cause
of action or other right. The Third-Party Provisions may be enforced by the
beneficiaries thereof.

  



  

Section 9.12 _ Negotiated Transaction_. The Parties, each represented by
legal counsel, have each participated in the negotiation and drafting of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation should
arise, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted by all Parties and no
presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or burdening any Party by
virtue of the authorship of any of the provisions of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.13 _ Brokers and Agents_.

  



  

(a) The Seller agrees to pay any broker's or finder's fee, sales
commission or similar form of compensation to any broker, finder or similar
agent engaged by or on behalf of the Seller or the Company in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and, without
regard to the Deductible, Damages Cap or any other limitation _Article VIII_
sets forth, to indemnify the Buyer against all Claims arising out of claims
for any and all such broker's or finder's fee, sales commission or similar
form of compensation.

  



  

(b) The Buyer agrees to pay any such broker's or finder's fee, sales
commission or similar form of compensation to any broker, finder or similar
agent engaged by or on behalf of the Buyer in connection with this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby and, without regard to the
Deductible, Damages Cap or any other limitation _Article VIII_ sets forth, to
indemnify the Seller against all Claims arising out of claims for any and all
such broker's or finder's fee, sales commission or similar form of
compensation.

  



  

Section 9.14 _ Time of the Essence_. With regard to all dates and time
periods set forth or referred to in this Agreement, time is of the essence.

  



  

Section 9.15 _ Specific Performance_.

  



  

(a) The Parties agree that if any of the provisions of this Agreement were
not performed in accordance with their specific terms on a timely basis or
were otherwise breached, irreparable damage would occur, no adequate remedy at
law would exist (even if damages would be available) and damages would be
difficult to determine, and that, unless this Agreement has been terminated in
accordance with its terms, the Parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement and to compel
performance by the Parties of their respective obligations set forth in this
Agreement, without the necessity of proving the inadequacy of money damages as
a remedy, in addition to any other remedy at law or in equity.

  



  

   

  



  

(b) Without limiting the general right to specific performance set forth
in _Section 9.15(a)_ , each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that, due
to the nature of the Acquired Entities, including the unique nature of the
customer relationships and other facts and circumstances, a non-breaching
Party would be damaged irreparably if a Party breaches its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required
hereunder, _provided_ that all of the conditions to Closing set forth
hereunder have been satisfied or waived by the Party seeking to enforce this
Agreement (other than the covenants in _Section 1.3_ and _Section 1.6_ , which
the Party seeking enforcement would be otherwise prepared to satisfy).
Accordingly, in the event of any such breach of a Party's obligation to
consummate the Closing, _provided_ that all of the conditions to Closing set
forth hereunder have been satisfied or waived by the Party seeking to enforce
this Agreement (other than the covenants in _Section 1.3_ and _Section 1.6_ ,
which the Party seeking enforcement would be otherwise prepared to satisfy),
then the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Party seeking to enforce this
Agreement shall be entitled, at its election, to specifically enforce the
performance of the other Party's obligation to consummate the Closing as
required hereunder in any Proceeding, including a Proceeding for injunctive
relief.

  



  

(c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there
is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason in equity or at law, other than on the basis
that such remedy is not expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Parties hereto hereby irrevocably waive any right of
rescission they may otherwise have or to which they may become entitled.

  



  

Section 9.16 _ Transaction Privilege_.

  



  

(a) The Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that Baker Botts L.L.P. ("
_Baker Botts_ ") has represented the Company, the Sellers and one or more of
their Affiliates prior to the date of this Agreement, including in connection
with the negotiation, documentation and consummation of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that the Sellers and such
Affiliates and their respective Representatives (each a " _Seller Entity_ "
and collectively, the " _Seller Entities_ ") have a reasonable expectation
that, after the Closing, Baker Botts will, if the Seller Entities so wish,
represent them in connection with any pending or possible or threatened Claim
or any other matter or Proceeding involving any Seller Entity or their
Representatives, on the one hand, and any other Party to this Agreement
(including the Company from and after the Closing) (an " _Other Party_ ") or
any of their respective Affiliates and Representatives (each an " _Other Party
Group Member_ " and collectively the " _Other Party Group Members_ "), on the
other hand, arising under or relating to this Agreement.

  



  

(b) Each Other Party, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Other Party
Group Members (which includes the Acquired Entities and those other Persons
that are or after Closing will be Affiliates of such Other Party), hereby
agrees to all of the matters and consents to the potential future
representations described in this _Section 9.16_ and specifically expressly
waives and agrees not to assert any conflict of interest that may arise or be
deemed to arise under applicable Laws or standard of professional
responsibility if, after the Closing, Baker Botts represents any Seller
Entities or other Persons in connection with any Claim or Proceeding arising
under or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement whether or not such matter is one in which Baker Botts may have
previously advised the Seller Entities or in respect of any other matters.

  



  

   

  



  

(c) Each Other Party, on its own behalf and on behalf of the Other Party
Group Members (which includes those Persons that are or after Closing will be
Affiliates of such Other Party), hereby consents to the disclosure by Baker
Botts to the Sellers or any of their Affiliates, directors, members, partners,
officers or employees of any information learned by Baker Botts in the course
of its representation of the Sellers or their Affiliates, whether or not such
information is subject to attorney client privilege or Baker Botts' duty of
confidentiality

  



  

(d) In addition, each of the Parties irrevocably acknowledges and agrees
that, from and after the Closing, the attorney-client privilege arising from
communications prior to the Closing between any one or more of the Seller
Entities and the Company (which, for the avoidance of doubt, includes for
purposes hereof any Representatives of the Seller Entities and the Company),
on the one hand, and Baker Botts, on the other hand, to the extent related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be
excluded from the assets or any other property, rights, privileges, powers,
franchises and other interests held by any Other Party Group Members, that
such attorney-client privilege shall be deemed held solely by the Seller
Entities, and that no Other Party Group Member shall have any right to assert,
waive or otherwise alter any such attorney-client privilege at any time after
the Closing. All communications between the Seller Entities or the Company, on
the one hand, and Baker Botts, on the other hand, relating to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by the Agreement shall be deemed to be privileged and to belong
solely to the Seller Entities (and not Other Party Group Members). The Other
Party Group Members shall not have access to any such communications, files,
records or other documents (as used herein whether in electronic form or
otherwise), of Baker Botts relating to such engagement. The Other Parties, to
the fullest extent allowed by Law, agree (i) that no waiver of any privilege
or right of the Seller Entities is intended or will be claimed by any Other
Party as a result of any communications, files, records or other documents
being maintained within the records or files, of any Other Party Group Member
or otherwise in its possession or control, (ii) all Other Party Group Members
shall endeavor to locate and delete or destroy all such documents and
information in their possession or control and (iii) no Other Party Group
Member will review, offer into evidence or otherwise attempt to use any such
communications, files, records or documents (whether or not so maintained) in
any claim or Proceeding arising under or relating to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

(e) The Buyer and its respective Affiliates (including the Acquired
Entities after the Closing) further covenant and agree that, from and after
the Closing, each shall not assert any claim against Baker Botts in respect of
legal services provided to the Company, the Sellers or their Affiliates by
Baker Botts in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby.

  



  

   

  



  

(f) The Buyer hereby agrees that it shall cause any Person that is or
after the Closing an Affiliate of the Buyer to execute any document or
instrument reasonably requested from time to time by the Seller Representative
**** in order to evidence or effectuate the intentions of the Parties
reflected in this _Section 9.16_.

  



  

(g) This _Section 9.16_ shall be irrevocable, and no term of this _Section
9.16_ may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior written consent of
Baker Botts, the Sellers **** and their respective Affiliates affected
thereby.

  



  

Section 9.17 _ Buyer Parent Guaranty_. The Buyer Parent hereby
unconditionally and irrevocably guarantees to the Seller the performance in
full by the Buyer of the obligations of the Buyer hereunder and under the
Seller's Note, including the obligations under _Article I_ , _Article V_ and
_Article VIII_. The Buyer Parent hereby waives all defenses as a surety
including notice, and agrees that its obligations under this _Section 9.17_
shall not be impaired, diminished or discharged by any extension of time
granted by the Seller, by any course of dealing between the Parties, or by any
events or circumstances which might operate to discharge a guarantor. Subject
to the foregoing provisions of this _Section 9.17_ , the Buyer Parent waives
the right to require the Seller to first proceed against the Buyer with
respect to any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or related to
this Agreement, and agrees that any such dispute, controversy, or claim may be
brought directly against the Buyer Parent, the Buyer, or against any one or
more of them.

the Transaction Tax Deductions) on a consolidated basis as of such date minus
the Acquired Entities' total current liabilities (excluding Indebtedness,
unearned profit on land sale, Transaction Expenses and any deferred Tax
liabilities) on a consolidated basis as of such date, in each case prepared in
accordance with the accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications and estimation methodologies (whether with regard

calculated using the same procedures, using the same methodologies, as the
applicable line items on the Balance Sheet, in accordance with GAAP and (ii)
