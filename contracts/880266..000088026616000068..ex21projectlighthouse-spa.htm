Each Warranty is given subject to the Disclosed Matters and to the limitations
in Schedule 6 provided that none of the provisions in Schedule 6 shall apply
if any Warrantor fraudulently makes or fraudulently omits to make a disclosure
in the Disclosure Letter in such a way as to render any Warranty (when read
with the Disclosure Letter) inaccurate, misleading or deceptive. For this
purpose and for all purposes under this Agreement, the expression "Disclosed"
means fairly disclosed with sufficient detail (including, where a value is
attributed to a disclosure contained in the Disclosure Letter, the
Warrantors\' reasonable estimate of such value as at the date of the
Disclosure Letter based on the information actually known to the Warrantors as
at such date) to enable the Buyer to make a reasonably informed assessment at
the date of such disclosure of the nature and scope of the matter concerned.

The Warranties shall continue in full force and effect notwithstanding
Completion. 

| 
---|--- 

9.4

|

Where any statement is expressly qualified in the Warranties by the expression
"to the best of the knowledge, information and belief of the Warrantors" or
"so far as the Warrantors are aware" or any similar expression, each Warrantor
shall be deemed only to have knowledge of anything of which he is actually
aware, having also actually made reasonable enquiry of each other Warrantor
(and any other constructive or implied knowledge of any Warrantor shall be
expressly excluded from such statement or expression). 

| 
---|--- 

9.5

|

In applying any Warranty to any Target Group Company, any reference to any
legal term for an action, remedy, method of judicial proceeding, legal
document, legal status, court, official or any legal concept or thing which
refers to or relates to a specific jurisdiction shall be deemed to include or
refer to what most nearly approximates to that legal term in the relevant
jurisdiction and any reference to any statute, regulation, order or other
statutory provision of a specific jurisdiction shall be deemed to include what
most nearly approximates to that statute, regulation, order or other statutory
provision in the relevant jurisdiction.

undertakings contained in clause 10.1 are reasonable and necessary for the
protection of the legitimate interests of the Buyer and the Company and any
other Target Group Company and that these restrictions do not work harshly on
him. It is nevertheless agreed that, if any such undertaking is found to be

enforceable. The parties further agree that, without prejudice to any other
remedy which may be available to the Buyer, the Buyer shall be entitled to
seek injunctive or other equitable relief in relation to any breach or
prospective breach of the undertakings in clause 10.1, it being acknowledged

* * *





Agreement and the other Transaction Documents. In particular, stamp duty and

|

POST-COMPLETION ARRANGEMENTS 

| 
---|--- 

15.1

|

As soon as reasonably practicable following Completion, the Buyer shall
procure that a DandO run-off insurance policy (the "Run-off Policy") is placed
by the Target Group providing a minimum of six years coverage from the
Completion Date in relation to the Outgoing Directors in amounts which are not
less than, and otherwise on terms which are no less favourable to the DandO
insurance cover maintained by the Target Group immediately before Completion.
The Buyer shall provide the Outgoing Directors with a copy of the insurance
terms and conditions and proof of the premium payment. The Buyer undertakes
that it shall not take or omit to take (and shall procure that each Buyer
Group Company shall not take or omit to take) any action which has the effect
of invalidating such insurance policy provided that the Buyer can replace the
Run Off Policy with an alternative DandO run off insurance policy on
substantially the same terms. 

| 
---|--- 

15.2

|

The Buyer shall (and shall ensure that each Target Group Company shall), from
and after Completion and to the fullest extent permitted in accordance with
Applicable Law, waive, release, and discharge the Outgoing Directors from any
and all claims (other than claims for fraud or criminal conduct), demands,
proceedings, causes of action, orders, obligations and liabilities arising out
of their capacity as a director of any Target Group Company and, solely in
such capacity, any cause or event occurring on or before Completion (each a
"Pre-Closing Event") which each Target Group Company has or may at any time
have had against any Outgoing Director. The Buyer shall ensure that each
Target Group Company shall not, directly or indirectly, assert any claim or
demand, or commence, institute or cause to be commenced, any proceedings of
any kind relating to any Pre-Closing Event against any Outgoing Director. 

| 
---|--- 

15.3

|

The provisions of clauses 15.1 and 15.2 are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that the
Outgoing Directors may have at law, by contract or otherwise. 

| 
---|--- 

15.4

|

The Sellers shall not (if a claim is made against any of them in connection
with the sale of the Shares to the Buyer) make any claim against any Target
Group Company or against any director, employee, agent or officer of any
Target Group Company on whom any of the Sellers may have relied before
agreeing to any term of the Transaction Documents or authorising any statement
in the Disclosure Letter. The Sellers acknowledge that they have no rights to
make any such claim. This shall not prevent any Seller from claiming against
any other Seller under any right of contribution or indemnity to which he may
be entitled. The rights of each Target Group Company and any director,
employee, agent or officer of any Group Company under this Clause are subject
to the provisions of clause 18.16.

logo, design, symbol, get-up, trade dress or domain name that consists of or
includes the words "Cimbria" or any other words which, in the reasonable
opinion of the Buyer, are confusingly similar (together, the "Target Company
IPR"); and 

| 
---|--- 

15.6.2

|

any goods, stock, products, product literature, product labels, packaging,
signage, stationery or other marketing, promotional, advertising or public
