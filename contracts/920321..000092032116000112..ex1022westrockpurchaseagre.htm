STOCK AND MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT





STOCK AND MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT (together with

International Ltd., a Mauritius private company with limited liability
("Cadmus Knowledge" and, together with Cenveo Corp and Cadmus Printing, the

WHEREAS, Buyer desires to purchase all of the outstanding (x) membership

conditions hereinafter set forth;



WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and
as a condition and inducement to the willingness of the Sellers to enter into

has delivered to the Sellers a guarantee, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, in favor of the Sellers with respect to the obligations of Buyer

closing of the sale of the Sellers' equity interests in the applicable entity
under this Agreement, such Minority Holder to sell to a Person designated by

record by such Minority Holder; and



WHEREAS, the definitions of certain defined terms used herein are set forth in
Exhibit A

hereto.



Accordingly, in consideration of the premises and of the respective covenants
and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto hereby agree as follows: 



ARTICLE I



PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES AND MEMBERSHIP INTERESTS



1.1 Purchase and Sale; Working Capital.



(a)Sale by Cenveo Corp. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, Cenveo Corp shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase
from Cenveo Corp: (i) 100% of the membership interests (as defined in the
Colorado Act) of Cenveo Commercial (the "Cenveo Commercial Membership
Interests"); (ii) 100% of the membership interests (as defined in the Florida
Act) of Rex 2010 (the "Rex 2010 Membership Interests"); (iii) 100% of the
limited liability company interests (as defined in the Delaware Act) of 136
Eastport (the "136 Eastport Membership Interests" and, collectively with the
Cenveo Commercial Membership Interests and Rex Membership Interests, the
"Transferred Membership Interests"); and (iv) 100% of the issued and
outstanding common shares of MMT (the "MMT Common Shares" and, collectively
with the Transferred Membership Interests, the "Cenveo Corp Transferred
Equity").



(b)Sale by Cadmus Printing. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Cadmus Printing shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall
purchase from Cadmus Printing, 100% of the issued and outstanding shares of
the common stock of Washburn Graphics, par value $1.00 per share (the
"Washburn Graphics Shares").



(c)Sale by Cadmus Knowledge. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, Cadmus Knowledge shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall
purchase from Cadmus Knowledge, 100% of the outstanding preferred shares of
MMT (the "MMT Preferred Shares" and, together with the MMT Common Shares, the
"MMT Shares" and, together with the Cenveo Commercial Membership Interests,
the Rex 2010 Membership Interests, the 136 Eastport Membership Interests and
the Washburn Graphics Shares, the "Transferred Securities").



(d)The applicable Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from
the applicable Seller, the Transferred Securities for an aggregate purchase
price equal to the Final Purchase Price.



(e)No less than five (5) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Cenveo Corp
shall prepare and deliver to Buyer a schedule (the "Estimate Schedule")
setting forth the Estimated Closing Working Capital (which may, in Cenveo
Corp's sole discretion, be updated (subject to the proviso to the final
sentence of this Section 1.1(e)) to reflect the results of the physical
inventory of certain sites to be jointly conducted by Buyer and Cenveo Corp to
the extent completed immediately prior to the Closing) and the Note Liability.
Cenveo Corp shall give Buyer and its representatives reasonable access to the
work papers used in connection with the preparation of the Estimate Schedule;
provided that if Cenveo Corp employs a firm of independent accountants in
connection with the preparation of the Estimate Schedule, then Cenveo Corp
shall cause such independent accountants to give Buyer and its representatives
reasonable access to any computations and work papers used in the preparation
of the Estimate Schedule (provided, that Buyer and any of its representatives
requesting any computations or 

work papers prepared by any independent accounting firm shall have executed
and delivered any non-reliance release or other agreements reasonably required
by the independent accounting firm that has prepared such computations or work
papers). Cenveo Corp and its representatives will consider in good faith
Buyer's comments to the Estimate Schedule (if any) and arrange for a
meaningful consultation with Buyer and its representatives with respect
thereto prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that the failure to
include in the Estimate Schedule any changes proposed by Buyer (including any
update or change in connection with the jointly conducted physical inventory),
or the acceptance by Buyer of the Estimate Schedule, or the consummation of
the Closing, shall not limit or affect Buyer's remedies under this Agreement
(other than in respect of the determination of the Estimated Closing Working
Capital), including Buyer's right to include such changes or other changes in
the Buyer's Closing Schedule or constitute an acknowledgement by Buyer of the
accuracy of the Estimate Schedule. For the avoidance of doubt, whether or not
the results of the physical inventory are reflected in the Estimated Closing
Working Capital, such results shall be used in calculating the Closing Working
Capital.



1.2 Closing. Unless Cenveo Corp and Buyer shall agree in writing upon a
different location, time or date, the closing of the sale and purchase of the
Transferred Securities (the "Closing") shall take place at the offices of
Hughes Hubbard and Reed LLP, One Battery Park Plaza, New York, New York 10004 at
10:00 a.m. on the date which is: (i) five (5) Business Days after the
satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions required to be satisfied
or waived pursuant to ARTICLE VI and ARTICLE VII hereof (other than those
requiring the delivery of a certificate or other document, or the taking of
other action, at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver in
accordance herewith of those conditions) if such date of such satisfaction or
waiver is more than ten (10) calendar days prior to the end of the then-
current calendar month; or (ii) the date which is the first Business Day of
the next calendar month following the date that is no less than two (2)
calendar days after the satisfaction or waiver of the last of the conditions
required to be satisfied or waived pursuant to ARTICLE VI and ARTICLE VII
hereof (other than those requiring the delivery of a certificate or other
document, or the taking of other action, at the Closing, but subject to the
satisfaction or waiver in accordance herewith of those conditions) if such
date of satisfaction or waiver is within ten (10) calendar days of the end of
the then-current calendar month (provided that the Closing shall not be prior
to February 1, 2016 without the mutual agreement of Cenveo Corp and Buyer), or
on such other date as is mutually agreed to by Cenveo Corp and Buyer. If on
any date set for the Closing pursuant to the prior sentence or pursuant to
this sentence the Closing is not consummated because all of such conditions to
the obligations of the parties hereto have not been satisfied or waived, then
Cenveo Corp and Buyer shall agree upon a new date for the Closing in
accordance with such prior sentence. The transactions consummated at the
Closing shall be deemed effective at 12:01 a.m. on the Closing Date (the
"Effective Time").

1.4 Closing Working Capital Adjustment.



(a) As promptly as practicable after the Closing Date, but in no event later
than sixty (60) days thereafter, Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Cenveo
Corp a schedule (the "Buyer's Closing Schedule") setting forth in reasonable
detail Buyer's calculation of the Closing Working Capital along with a copy of
the computations used in connection therewith. Buyer shall give Cenveo Corp
and its representatives reasonable access to the work papers used in
connection with the preparation of the Buyer's Closing Schedule; provided that
if Buyer employs a firm of independent accountants in connection with the
preparation of the Buyer's Closing Schedule, then Buyer shall cause such
independent accountants to give Cenveo Corp and its representatives reasonable
access to any computations and work papers used in the preparation of the
Buyer's Closing Schedule (provided, that Cenveo Corp and any of its
representatives requesting any computations or work papers prepared by any
independent accounting firm shall have executed and delivered any non-reliance
release or other agreements reasonably required by the independent accounting
firm that has prepared such computations or work papers). Buyer and its
representatives will also give, upon reasonable prior notice, Cenveo Corp and
its representatives reasonable access, during the normal business hours of
Buyer and the Companies and Company Subsidiaries, to personnel responsible
for, or with knowledge regarding, information used in the preparation of the
Buyer's Closing Schedule and books and records of the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries used in the preparation or reasonably related to the calculation
of Closing Working Capital, in each case, as reasonably requested by Cenveo
Corp to assist it (if necessary) in the preparation of the Sellers' Dispute
Notice. Cenveo Corp will notify Buyer in writing (the "Sellers' Dispute
Notice") within thirty (30) days after receiving the Buyer's Closing Schedule
if Cenveo Corp disagrees with Buyer's calculation of the Closing Working
Capital as set forth in the Buyer's Closing Schedule, which notice shall set
forth in reasonable detail the name of the Company(ies) or Company
Subsidiary(ies) to which the disputed calculation relates, the basis for such
disagreement and dollar amount of each dispute and Cenveo Corp's calculation
of the Closing Working Capital. If no Sellers' Dispute Notice is received by
Buyer within such thirty (30)-day period, then Buyer's calculation of the
Closing Working Capital as set forth in the Buyer's Closing Schedule shall be
final and binding upon the parties hereto.



(b) Upon receipt by Buyer of the Sellers' Dispute Notice, Cenveo Corp and
Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any disagreement with respect
to Closing Working Capital as set forth in the Sellers' Dispute Notice (each
such disagreement being referred to as a "Disputed Item"). Any Disputed Item
resolved and agreed to in writing by Buyer and Cenveo Corp shall be deemed
final and binding when such writing is executed by Buyer and Cenveo Corp. To
the extent Buyer and Cenveo Corp are unable to agree with respect to the
Closing Working Capital within thirty (30) days after receipt by Buyer of the
Sellers' Dispute Notice, Buyer and Cenveo Corp shall promptly engage McGladrey
LLP or, if McGladrey LLP is unable or unwilling to accept such engagement,
then an internationally recognized independent accounting firm mutually and
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Cenveo Corp (the "Accounting Firm"), and
submit their dispute to the Accounting Firm for a binding resolution. The fees
and expenses of the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.4 shall be
borne, in their entirety, by the party whose calculation of the Final Purchase
Price based upon its calculation of Closing Working Capital as initially
submitted to the Accounting Firm (in accordance with Section 1.4(c) below) is
furthest away from the Final Purchase Price based upon 

the Closing Working Capital as determined by the Accounting Firm. The fees and
expenses of Buyer's independent auditors (if any), attorneys (if any) or any
other advisors incurred in connection with the issuance of the Buyer's Closing
Schedule and any dispute resolution procedure relating thereto shall be borne
by Buyer, and the fees and expenses of the independent auditors (if any),
attorneys (if any) or any other advisors of Cenveo Corp incurred in connection
with their review of the Buyer's Closing Schedule and issuance of the Sellers'
Dispute Notice and any dispute resolution procedure relating thereto shall be
borne by Cenveo Corp.



(c) Not later than thirty (30) days after the engagement of the Accounting
Firm (as evidenced by its written acceptance by facsimile or otherwise to the
parties), unless other procedures are agreed upon at such time, Cenveo Corp
and Buyer shall submit simultaneous briefs to the Accounting Firm (with a copy
to the other party or parties) setting forth their respective positions
regarding any Disputed Item, and not later than thirty (30) days after the
submission of such briefs, Cenveo Corp and Buyer shall submit simultaneous
reply briefs (with a copy to the other party or parties). If an additional
briefing, a hearing or other information is required by the Accounting Firm,
the Accounting Firm shall give notice thereof to the parties as soon as
practicable before the expiration of such thirty (30)-day period, and the
applicable parties shall promptly respond with a view to minimizing any delay
in the decision date. Cenveo Corp and Buyer shall instruct the Accounting Firm
to render its decision resolving such dispute within thirty (30) days after
submission of the reply briefs or, in the event an additional briefing, a
hearing or other information is required, within thirty (30) days after the
completion of such additional briefing, the completion of such hearing, or the
submission of such additional information, as the case may be. In resolving
any Disputed Item, the Accounting Firm: (i) shall act as an accounting expert
and not as an arbitrator; (ii) shall be bound by the provisions of this
Section 1.4 and the definitions of Closing Working Capital and the definitions
included therein; (iii) shall limit its review to matters still in dispute as
specifically set forth in the Sellers' Dispute Notice (and only to the extent
such matters are still in dispute at the commencement of such thirty (30)-day
period, it being understood that matters covered in offers made in proposed
settlement shall be treated as in "dispute" unless the proposed settlement
offer specifies otherwise at the time made); and (iv) shall further limit its
review solely to whether the Buyer's Closing Schedule has been prepared in
accordance with this Section 1.4. The determination of any item that is a
component of Closing Working Capital, and is the subject of a dispute cannot,
however, be in excess of, or less than, the greatest or lowest value,
respectively, claimed for any particular item in the Buyer's Closing Schedule
or the Sellers' Dispute Notice (or, if closer to the value claimed in the
Sellers' Dispute Notice or the Buyer's Closing Schedule, respectively, the
value claimed by the relevant party at the commencement of such thirty (30)-
day period (it being understood and agreed that any value for any item
proposed in an effort to reach an agreement with respect to the value of such
item shall not be deemed to be "claimed" for purposes of this sentence if the
proposing party specifies so at such time). The Sellers and Buyer each agree
that judgment may be entered upon the determination of the Accounting Firm in
any court having jurisdiction over the party against which such determination
is to be enforced. Closing Working Capital as agreed upon by Cenveo Corp and
Buyer, as deemed agreed upon pursuant to the last sentence of Section 1.4(a)
or as determined by the Accounting Firm in accordance with Sections 1.4(b) and
1.4(c), shall be termed the "Final Closing Working Capital."



(d) Buyer and Cenveo Corp agree to make the payments, as applicable, set
forth below in Section 1.4(d)(i) or 1.4(d)(ii), as the case may be. Buyer and
Cenveo Corp agree that any payment required to be made pursuant to Section
1.4(d)(i) or 1.4(d)(ii), as the case may be, shall be made within five (5)
Business Days after the Final Closing Working Capital becomes final and
binding on the parties hereto (the date the Final Closing Working Capital
becomes final and binding being referred to as the "Final Closing Working
Capital Date") by wire transfer in immediately available funds to a bank
account or bank accounts designated by Cenveo Corp or Buyer, as the case may
be, to the other party or parties, as applicable.



(i) Cenveo Corp shall pay to Buyer the excess, if any, of the Estimated
Closing Working Capital over the Final Closing Working Capital together with
interest at the Applicable Rate compounded daily beginning on the date that is
five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Working Capital Date.



(ii) Buyer shall pay to Cenveo Corp the excess, if any, of the Final Closing
Working Capital over the Estimated Closing Working Capital together with
interest at the Applicable Rate compounded daily beginning on the date that is
five (5) Business Days after the Final Closing Working Capital Date.



(iii) Any interest payable pursuant to subsections (d)(i) and (d)(ii) hereof
shall be due and payable at the same time as the payment as to which it
relates is paid and shall be calculated daily based on a year of three hundred
sixty-five (365) days and the actual number of days elapsed.



(e) Buyer agrees that, following the Closing through the Final Closing Working
Capital Date, it shall not, and will cause each such Company and Company
Subsidiary, not to, take any actions with respect to any accounting books,
records, policies or procedures on which the Closing Working Capital is to be
based that would make it impossible or impracticable to calculate the Closing
Working Capital in the manner and utilizing the methods required hereby.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, for purposes of calculating
the Closing Working Capital, no changes shall be made in any reserve or other
account existing as of the Interim Balance Sheet Date except (i) as a result
of events occurring after such date and, in such event, only in a manner
consistent with practices of the applicable Companies or Company Subsidiaries
prior to the Closing Date and (ii) as necessary to correct any computational
error or errors in applying the Accounting Principles.



1.5 Withholding Rights. Subject to Section 10.6, each Seller acknowledges that
Buyer will deduct and withhold from any consideration otherwise payable to any
Person pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as it is required to deduct and
withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any
provision of applicable Laws, and Buyer shall timely pay over to the
appropriate Governmental Authority any amounts so withheld. To the extent that
such amounts are so withheld and timely paid over to or deposited with the
relevant Governmental Authority by Buyer and the amount and reason for such
deduction and withholding is promptly reported to the Person to whom such
amounts would otherwise have been paid, such withheld amounts will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the applicable
Person in respect to which such deduction and withholding was made. 



1.6 Sale by Washburn Graphics. Immediately prior to the purchase and sale of
the Transferred Securities, but subject to the consummation of the Closing,
Cadmus Printing shall cause Washburn Graphics to sell to one or more Persons
designated by Buyer, 996 shares of the outstanding capital stock of Cadmus
Packaging Company Limited, such amount being 100% of the equity in Cadmus
Packaging Company Limited owned beneficially and of record by Washburn
Graphics (i.e., other than the Minority Holders' equity), and such portion of
the Purchase Price as Cenveo and Buyer shall agree (based on an independent
valuation) shall be paid by the Person or Persons designated by Buyer to
Washburn Graphics for such capital stock, and Washburn Graphics shall
immediately distribute such proceeds to Cadmus Printing prior to the Closing.

the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries to use) commercially reasonable
efforts: (i) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions necessary, proper or
advisable to comply promptly with all legal requirements which may be imposed
on such party with respect to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and, subject to the conditions set forth in
ARTICLE VI and ARTICLE VII (as applicable) to consummate such transactions as
promptly as practicable; and to promptly prepare and file all necessary

after the date hereof (such filing, the "HSR Filing"); (ii) use commercially
reasonable efforts to timely provide all supplemental information requested by
the FTC or DOJ in connection with any investigation of the transactions

of any Company or Company Subsidiary was not included in the Listed
Intellectual Property and is not a "Cenveo," "CMS" or "Cadmus" mark,
reasonably promptly after Buyer's written request: (i) if such Intellectual
Property is used only in connection with the Companies' and Company
Subsidiaries' business, then the Sellers (at their sole expense) shall execute
any documents necessary to transfer and assign such Intellectual Property to
Buyer free and clear of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens); and (ii) if
such Intellectual Property is used in connection with the Companies' and
Company Subsidiaries' business and in other of the Sellers' business, then the
Sellers shall execute any documents necessary to permit the use of such
Intellectual Property by the Companies and Company Subsidiaries; provided
however, that Sellers shall not be obligated to transfer, assign or permit the
use of any Intellectual Property hereunder to the extent a third party consent
to such action is necessary or such action is not permitted under Law; and

of-pocket costs or expenses in connection with any such action requested by
Buyer.



5.3 Access; Continuing Confidentiality.

Company Subsidiaries, (y) provide to Buyer and its representatives reasonable
access to the facilities of the Companies and Company Subsidiaries and make an

to the SSP facilities, provided, that Buyer and its representatives sign a
confidentiality agreement with substantially the same protections as the
Confidentiality Agreement for the benefit of such SSP; and (z) furnish
promptly such information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as Buyer may reasonably request; provided, that in each case of subclauses
(x), (y) and (z), such access and information shall be provided at reasonable
times and upon reasonable notice under the supervision of the Sellers'
personnel and Buyer and its representatives shall conduct any such activities
in such a manner as not to unreasonably or unnecessarily interfere with the
normal operation of the businesses of the Sellers, Companies or Company
Subsidiaries and their employees duties (it being agreed that such access
shall in no way include any Phase II environmental investigation or other
invasive procedure or investigation, including any sampling, testing or the
removal of materials from the offices or properties of any Company or Company
Subsidiary). Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary,
no Seller shall be required to provide access to or to disclose information
if, in such Seller's 

reasonable discretion, such access or disclosure would: (i) cause significant
competitive harm (including if the value of any trade secret would be
compromised) to any Seller, Company or Company Subsidiary or their respective
businesses if the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are not
consummated; (ii) violate or prejudice the rights of its or any Company's or
Company Subsidiary's customers, suppliers or employees (including with respect
to any disclosure of personnel records of any Seller, Company or Company
Subsidiary relating to medical histories); (iii) violate a third-party
confidentiality obligation; (iv) jeopardize any work product privilege or
attorney-client privilege (or similar privilege) of the institution in
possession or control of such information; (v) contravene any Law (including

this Agreement or otherwise in accordance with Section 5.1. The Sellers shall,
and shall cause the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries to, cooperate in
good faith with Buyer to identify and implement alternative means for Buyer to
be granted access to any senior officers, properties, books and records, data
or information to which Buyer is not granted access pursuant to this Section
5.3(a) due to limitations under applicable Law, attorney-client privilege or
other privilege or the terms of any confidentiality or similar agreements,
including, for example and without limitation, entering into a common interest
agreement, seeking third-party consent under contracts, establishing a process
that, through the use of steps such as targeted redactions, provision of
information to counsel to review and, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, to summarize for its client or use of a "clean room" environment for
analysis and review of information accessible to limited Persons (such as
external advisors) which will be designed to the extent feasible to provide
Buyer with timely access to the substance of the information described in this
Section 5.3(a) in a manner that allows compliance with contracts and
applicable Law and preserve the attorney-client or other privilege, as the
case may be. No investigation by Buyer of other information received by Buyer
or its Affiliates or representatives shall operate as a waiver or otherwise
affect any representation, warranty or agreement given or made by the Sellers
hereunder. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, prior to the Closing, without the prior written consent of Cenveo
Corp, which may be withheld, conditioned or delayed for any reason or no
reason, neither Buyer, nor any of its Affiliates or representatives, shall
engage in any discussion with any suppliers to, or customers of, any Company
or Company Subsidiary, except in the ordinary course of such Person's business
unrelated to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other
Transaction Documents, without reference to or use of any Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement), and without
referencing Cenveo or any of its Subsidiaries (including any Company, Company
Subsidiary or the Sellers). Notwithstanding the foregoing, from and after the
date hereof until the earlier of the Closing or the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms, Sellers will reasonably cooperate with
Buyer to make introductions to the customers, suppliers, lessors, licensors
and other business associates maintaining business relationships with the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries (or with the Sellers on behalf of the
Company or Company Subsidiaries) prior to the date of this Agreement in order
to facilitate the transition of the business conducted by the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries to the Buyer from and after the Closing.



(b) The terms of the Confidentiality Agreement between Rock-Tenn Company and
Cenveo, dated June 12, 2015 (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), are hereby
incorporated herein by reference and shall continue in full force and effect
until the consummation of the Closing, at which time the Confidentiality
Agreement and the obligations of Buyer under this Section 5.3 shall terminate;
provided, however, that the Confidentiality 

Agreement shall terminate only in respect of that portion of the Confidential
Information (as defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) relating to the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries. If this Agreement is, for any reason,
terminated prior to the Closing, then the Confidentiality Agreement shall
nonetheless continue in full force and effect.



(t)From and after the Closing, each of the Sellers shall not disclose, and
shall cause their Affiliates (for the avoidance of doubt, other than the
Companies or the Company Subsidiaries) to not disclose, any confidential and
proprietary information of the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries,
including the Companies' and the Company Subsidiaries' customer lists,
supplier lists, details of consultant and employment contracts, pricing
policies, operational methods, marketing plans or strategies, product
development techniques or plans, business acquisition plans (including
identified acquisition targets), technical processes, designs and design
projects, processes, trade secrets, inventions, software, source codes, object
codes and research projects, to any other Person other than Cenveo or any of
its Subsidiaries; provided, however, this Section 5.3(c) shall not apply to
any information: (i) which is or becomes generally available to the public
other than as a result of disclosure in violation of this Section 5.3(c); (ii)
lawfully received by a Seller after the Closing Date from a third-party not
known to such Seller (after reasonable inquiry) to be under any obligation of
confidentiality with respect to such information; or (iii) which is required
to be disclosed by applicable Law, or in connection with any legal proceeding,
discovery, any subpoena or civil investigative demand, or the use of which is
reasonably necessary to the defense of such Seller in any such proceeding, in
which case, unless prohibited by Law, such Seller shall provide Buyer with
reasonably prompt notice of such required disclosure so that Buyer may seek
(at its sole cost) to obtain a protective order or other reasonable assurance
that such disclosure shall be treated confidentiality.



5.4 Public Announcements. From the date hereof until the Closing, no party
shall make, or cause to be made, and each party shall not permit its
Affiliates to make, any press release or public announcement in respect of
this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, or otherwise communicate with any news media
with respect thereto without the prior written consent of Buyer and Cenveo
Corp (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and the parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any
such press release or public announcement; provided that a party (or its
Affiliate) may, without the prior written consent of the other parties, make
such press release or public announcement as may be required or advisable
under Law or any listing agreement with or rule of any securities exchange or
association.

constitute a solicitation in violation of this Section 5.5(d), and the hiring
of such Person shall not constitute a hiring in violation of this Section
5.5(d); (y) the restrictions in this Section 5.5(d) do not apply to any
employee whose employment was terminated by the applicable Company or Company
Subsidiary prior to the solicitation (and/or hiring) by the applicable Cenveo
Restricted Party.



(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 5.5, in
no event shall a Cenveo Restricted Party be restricted from: (i)
manufacturing, marketing, selling or distributing envelopes; (ii) taking
actions permitted by the Referral Agreement in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit H (the "Referral Agreement"); (iii) except with respect to the
Business, marketing the businesses of the Cenveo Restricted Parties, or
soliciting clients and customers, through non-targeted general advertisements
(including trade magazines or web- based advertisements via Google Adsense and
similar programs) or Cenveo Restricted Party websites, in each case not
directed at, or targeted to: (1) in connection with the Business, the
Restricted Territory; (2) in connection with cut and stack labels, Canada or
the Continuing Cut and Stack Customers in the United States; or (3) in
connection with commercial print applications or direct mail products, except
for targeted marketing or solicitation of Cenveo US- Sub Customers, Canada,
provided that the Cenveo Restricted Partners do not render any services or
manufacture, sell or distribute any of the specified products (referred to in
Sections 5.5(a)-(c)) in connection with or as a result of such non-targeted
general advertisements or websites in breach the provisions of Sections
5.5(a)-(c) hereof; (iv) holding or purchasing any equity interests in NuLabel
Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("NLT"), and any successor thereto
(provided, that Cenveo Restricted Partners do not participate in the business
of such entity to the extent such business would breach the provisions of
Sections 5.5(a)-(c); provided, further, that Cenveo holding a minority
ownership in, and the participation of a Cenveo representative on the Board of
Directors of, NLT shall not be deemed to constitute participation in the
business in breach of the foregoing clause); (v) the purchase or ownership of
securities in any mutual fund registered under the Investment Company Act of
1940, as amended; and (vi) the purchase or ownership of not more than 5% of
the outstanding equity of any entity; provided, that the Cenveo Restricted
Party does not actively participate in the business of such entity.



(f) For purposes of Section 5.5, the parties acknowledge and agree that the
restrictions contained in this Section 5.5 are a reasonable and necessary
protection of the immediate interests of Buyer, and any violation of these
restrictions would cause substantial injury to Buyer and that Buyer would not
have entered into this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents without
receiving the additional consideration offered by the Cenveo Restricted
Parties in binding themselves to these restrictions, as applicable. In the
event of a breach or a threatened breach by a Cenveo Restricted Party of such
applicable restrictions, Buyer will be entitled to an injunction restraining
such Cenveo Restricted Party(ies) from such breach or threatened breach
(without the necessity of proving the inadequacy as a remedy of money damages
or the posting of a bond); provided, however, that the right to injunctive
relief will not be construed as prohibiting Buyer from pursuing any other
available remedies, whether at law or in equity, for such breach or threatened
breach. The time period during which the prohibitions set forth in this
Section 5.5 are in effect shall be tolled and suspended for a period equal to
the 

aggregate time during which any Cenveo Restricted Party is in violation of
such prohibitions in any respect.



5.6 Indemnification and Exculpation. Buyer agrees that all rights of the
individuals who on or prior to the Closing Date were directors, managers,
officers or employees of any Company or Company Subsidiary (collectively, the
"Indemnitees") to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing Date as provided in the
respective Organizational Documents of any Company or Company Subsidiary as in
effect as of the date of this Agreement, and any indemnification agreements or
arrangements of any Company or Company Subsidiary as in effect as of the date
of this Agreement that are set forth in Section 5.6 of the Company Disclosure
Letter, shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and
effect in accordance with their terms. Such rights shall not be amended, or
otherwise modified in any manner that would materially adversely affect the
rights of the Indemnitees for a period of six (6) years after the Closing
Date, unless such modification is required by Law (or unless Buyer provides
comparable rights to such Indemnitees). Buyer agrees not to and to not permit
any Company or Company Subsidiary to bring any suit, action or proceeding
asserting, any breach of fiduciary duty or any breach of any other duty owed
to any Company or Company Subsidiary against any Indemnitee for acts or
omissions prior to the Closing Date whether filed derivatively on behalf of
any Company or Company Subsidiary or otherwise.



5.7 No Solicitation. From the date of this Agreement until the earlier of: (a)
the Closing; and (b) the termination of this Agreement, the Sellers shall not,
and shall cause the Companies and Company Subsidiaries and their respective
Affiliates to not (and the Sellers shall not, and shall cause the Companies
and Company Subsidiaries to instruct their respective advisors, agents or
other representatives to not), directly or indirectly: (i) solicit, initiate
or encourage any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or enter into any
agreement or accept any offer relating to any: (A) reorganization,
liquidation, dissolution or recapitalization of any of the Companies or
Company Subsidiaries; (B) merger or consolidation involving any of the
Companies or Company Subsidiaries; (C) purchase or sale of the capital stock
or other equity or debt securities of any of the Companies or Company
Subsidiaries or in excess of 5% of the assets of any of the Companies or
Company Subsidiaries; or (D) similar transaction or business combination
involving any of the Companies or Company Subsidiaries (the foregoing items
(A) through (D) collectively referred to herein as a "Business Sale"); or (ii)
discuss, negotiate, authorize, facilitate, or furnish any information with
respect to, assist or participate in any effort or attempt by any Person to do
or seek to do any of the foregoing. Each Seller represents and warrants that:
(x) neither such Seller nor any of the Companies or Company Subsidiaries is
party to or bound by any agreement with respect to a Business Sale other than
this Agreement; and (y) it has terminated all discussions with third parties
regarding any of the foregoing.



5.8 Notice of Certain Matters.



(a) The Sellers shall give prompt notice to Buyer, and Buyer shall give prompt
notice to the Sellers, in each case after obtaining knowledge thereof, of the
occurrence or non-occurrence of: (i) any event the occurrence or non-
occurrence of which would reasonably be expected to result in any
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement made by the Sellers
(with respect to such notice given by the Sellers) or Buyer (with respect to
such notice 

given by Buyer) to be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect (or, in the
case of any representation or warranty qualified by its terms by materiality,
then untrue or inaccurate in any respect); and (ii) any failure of any party
to comply with or satisfy in any material respect any covenant, condition or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however,
that: (x) the breach by any Seller (with respect to such notice given by the
Sellers) or Buyer (with respect to such notice given by Buyer) hereto of the
covenant set forth in the immediately preceding clause (i) shall not permit
any other party hereto to refuse to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement unless the failure of the applicable representation or
warranty to be true and correct would result in the condition set forth in
Section 6.1(a) and Section 7.1(a), as applicable, not being satisfied as of
the Closing Date; and (y) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement including ARTICLE IX, the delivery of, or failure to deliver, any
notice pursuant to this Section 5.8(a) shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving or not receiving such
notice (or any Losses with respect thereto).



(b) Each party shall give prompt notice to the other parties of: (i) any
notice or other communication from any Person alleging that the consent of
such Person is or may be required in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) any notice or other
communication from any Governmental Authority in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (iii) any Action or to the
Sellers' Knowledge, Investigation relating to or involving or otherwise
affecting any of the Sellers, the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries, on
the one hand, or Buyer, on the other hand, that relates to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iv) any change that is likely to impair
in any material respect the ability of any party to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



5.9 Data Room Record. Reasonably promptly after the Closing Date, the Sellers
shall deliver to Buyer a copy of a CD or DVD-ROM containing a true, correct
and complete copy of the Data Room.



5.10 Insurance Matters.



(a) If, following the Closing, any of the Companies or any Company
Subsidiaries suffers any Losses which Buyer reasonably believes are covered
under any of the Policies maintained by the Sellers or any of their Affiliates
that provides coverage with respect to such Losses (collectively, the "Seller
Insurance Policies"), which claim is based on an incident, event, occurrence
or accident that took place prior to the Closing (each, a "Pre-Closing Insured
Event"), then the Sellers agree to provide, and to cause their Affiliates and
their insurance brokers, agents and third party administrators (collectively,
the "Insurance Advisors") to provide, reasonable cooperation and assistance
(at the applicable Company's or Company Subsidiary's expense with respect to
any out-of-pocket costs or expenses but not with respect to any raised
premiums) to the Companies and Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
submission, adjustment and resolution of any claim made by any Company or
Company Subsidiary on or under such Seller Insurance Policies. Such
cooperation by the Sellers, their Affiliates and the Insurance Advisors shall
include providing reasonable access to books, records and documents (including
electronically stored information) as the Companies or Company Subsidiaries
reasonably may require in connection with such claims. At any of the
Companies' or Company 

Subsidiaries' request, pursuant to written notice to the Sellers and/or their
applicable Affiliates and/or the Insurance Advisors shall provide notice or
the Sellers will submit a claim under any such applicable Seller Insurance
Policy on behalf of the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary (and at the
Company's or such Company Subsidiary's sole cost, including with respect to
any deductible thereunder or other out-of-pocket costs or expenses with
respect thereto other than raised premiums), and the Sellers shall, or shall
cause their applicable Affiliates or Insurance Advisors to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to collect claim amounts requested thereunder, and subject
to the terms of the applicable Seller Insurance Policy, to follow the
reasonable and lawful directions of the applicable Company or Company
Subsidiary in the prosecution of such claim and cause any such claim proceeds
collected to be paid to such Company or Company Subsidiary, as applicable. In
addition, the Sellers shall not, and shall cause their Affiliates not to,
amend, modify or terminate any Seller Insurance Policy with respect to any
Pre-Closing Insured Event in any manner detrimental to any Company or Company
Subsidiary or to waive, settle, release or subrogate any claim of any Company
or Company Subsidiary without its consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at
the Sellers' option, in its sole discretion, the Sellers may elect to pay or
reimburse the applicable Company or Company Subsidiary for the claim relating
to a Pre-Closing Insured Event in lieu of a claim being filed with respect to
the applicable Policy. Nothing in this Section 5.10 amends, modifies or limits
the Sellers' indemnification obligations under ARTICLE IX of this Agreement,
provided that in no event shall Buyer, any Company or any Company Subsidiaries
be entitled to a double recovery as to any such claim. The provisions of this
Section 5.10(a) shall not apply to workers' compensation claims or policies
which are instead addressed in Section 5.10(b) hereof.



(b) The Sellers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates to, be fully
responsible for and shall pay, through any applicable workers' compensation
policy of the Sellers or their Affiliates or otherwise, all claims by an
Employee in the United States for workers' compensation which arise out of or
are based on an occupational injury, illness or death occurring or arising
prior to the Closing, without regard to whether such claims were made prior to
or following Closing; except solely to the extent (i) such claims are covered
by an applicable workers' compensation policy maintained by the Companies or
Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing as set forth in Section 3.17 of the
Company Disclosure Letter; provided, however, that Sellers shall be
responsible for any deductible or other out of pocket costs or expenses with
respect to any claim covered by any such policy and for any amounts not
covered by such policy, or (ii) such claims involve injuries occurring after
the Closing.



(c) The Sellers shall, or shall cause their Affiliates (other than the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries) to, be fully responsible for and shall
pay, through the Seller Plans that are group health plans or otherwise, any of
the Companies' or Company Subsidiaries' liabilities with respect to Employee
claims incurred but not reported prior to the Closing under any Seller Plans
that are group health plans.



5.11 Financial Statements; Access to Financial Information. The Sellers shall
furnish to Buyer within ten (10) days after the end of each month and within
fifteen (15) days after the end of each fiscal quarter ending between the date
hereof and the Closing Date the unaudited statement of income and expense of
each operating plant operated by the Companies and Company Subsidiaries for
the applicable month and/or quarter just ended as prepared by the Companies
and Company Subsidiaries in the Ordinary Course of Business (and subject to 

adjustments for estimates included in such statements) and such other
financial information as Buyer may reasonably request and which is prepared in
the Ordinary Course of Business.



5.12 Cooperation on Title Insurance and Surveys.



(a)Prior to the Closing, the Sellers will use their commercially reasonable
efforts to cooperate with Buyer in connection with Buyer's obtaining, at
Buyer's sole cost and expense, title insurance commitments and reports for the
Owned Real Property (to the extent title insurance is available in the
applicable jurisdictions) from a title company designated by Buyer and updated
surveys with respect to the Owned Real Property.



(b)Prior to Closing, the Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the consents to this transaction required by the Real Property Leases
for the Leased Real Property listed in Section 3.13(b) that require written
consent, and cooperate with Buyer's efforts to obtain with respect to such
Leased Real Properties estoppels and/or nondisturbance agreements from lessors
as reasonably required by Buyer (provided that upon making an attempt to
arrange a discussion between such lessor(s) and Buyer or the provision of the
contact information for such lessor to Buyer, Buyer's failure to obtain any
such estoppels or agreements shall not be deemed a breach hereunder and the
Sellers shall have no liability or obligation with respect to such cooperation
if such lessors refuse). Prior to the Closing, the Sellers shall cause the
applicable Company or Company Subsidiary to use commercially reasonable
efforts to transfer and facilitate the transfer of any material Permits to the
extent required by applicable Law in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.



5.13 Obligations of Affiliates. Except for the Transaction Documents or as set
forth in Section 5.13 of the Company Disclosure Letter, on or before the
Closing Date, the Sellers shall terminate, or shall cause their Affiliates to
terminate: (a) any ongoing Contracts or understandings between any Seller,
Cenveo and/or any of their Affiliates on the one hand, and any of the
Companies or Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand, so that following the
Closing Date the Companies and Company Subsidiaries shall have no obligations
of any kind or nature to Cenveo or any of their Affiliates (except pursuant to
the Transaction Documents and including the Note Liability to be paid in
accordance with Section 1.3(b)(i)(B)); and (b) all debts and other
obligations: (i) owed or required to be performed by the Sellers, Cenveo or
their Affiliates to the Companies and Company Subsidiaries; or (ii) owed or
required to be performed by any Company or Company Subsidiary to any Seller,
Cenveo or any of their Affiliates shall be discharged in full (except for the
Note Liability to be paid in accordance with Section 1.3(b)(i)(B)). The
Sellers shall deliver to Buyer at Closing evidence of such terminations
reasonably satisfactory to Buyer.



5.14 Change of Name, Etc.



(a)Buyer acknowledges and agrees (including, without limitation, for purposes
of Section 5.1) that immediately prior to the consummation of the Closing, the
Sellers intend to cause the Companies and Company Subsidiaries to file an
amendment to change their names in their respective jurisdictions of
organization and any jurisdictions where such Company is registered to do
business and with all other applicable Governmental Authorities, to eliminate
any reference to the word "Cenveo," "CMS" or "Cadmus" from their names, and
from and after 

the consummation of the Closing, the Companies, Company Subsidiaries, Buyer
and its Affiliates shall cease and desist from all further use of the name and
mark "Cenveo", "Cadmus" or any name, mark, design or logo similar or related
thereto or employing the words "Cenveo", "Cadmus" or any part or variation or
simulation of any of the foregoing or any confusingly similar marks; provided,
that the Companies and Company Subsidiaries may sell inventory labeled with,
and may operate their businesses with signage including, such names, marks,
designs or logos included on such inventory or signage prior to the Closing
Date, but Buyer shall: (i) within 180 days after the Closing Date, remove from
the inventory of the businesses of the Companies, Company Subsidiaries and
Buyer and its Affiliates all remaining inventory and packaging materials that
include the "Cenveo," "CMS" or "Cadmus" name, mark, design or logo or any
name, mark, design or logo similar or related thereto or employing the words
"Cenveo", "Cadmus" or any part or variation or simulation of any of the
foregoing or any confusingly similar marks; and (ii) within ninety (90) days
after the Closing Date, remove the "Cenveo" and "Cadmus" name, mark, design or
logo, or any name, mark, design or logo similar or related thereto or
employing the words "Cenveo," "Cadmus" or any part or variation or simulation
of any of the foregoing or any confusingly similar marks, from the signage of
all of the Owned Real Properties or Leased Real Properties or other properties
of Buyer; and in no event, shall Buyer advertise or hold itself out (or permit
any Affiliate of Buyer to advertise or hold itself out to be) an affiliate of,
or party of a group with, "Cenveo," "CMS" or "Cadmus".



(b)For the purposes of clarity, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
nothing herein shall prohibit any of the Sellers from using, registering or
otherwise exploiting: (i) the terms "Cenveo" or "Cadmus," whether alone, or in
combination with other words or marks; and (ii) any trademarks, service marks,
trade names, business names, corporate names, copyrights, product names, brand
names, or logos owned or controlled by any of the Sellers or their
Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, without
regard to the "Cenveo," "CMS" or "Cadmus" names) and any derivations thereof.



5.15 Access to Books and Records; Confidential Information.



(a)As soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty (60) days after the
(i) Closing or (ii) with respect to books and records relating to or required
in connection with the TSA, the termination of the TSA, the Sellers shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to deliver or cause to be delivered to Buyer
all of the material books and records then in the possession of any Seller or
any of their Affiliates relating primarily to the business of the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries. If any time thereafter, if any Seller or any of
their Affiliates discovers that it is in possession of any books and records
relating primarily to the business of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries, then such Seller or Affiliate thereof shall deliver or cause to
be delivered to Buyer such discovered books and records. If any of the books
and records to be provided to Buyer pursuant to this Section 5.15 includes
information relating to the business other than the business of the Companies
and the Company Subsidiaries, then the Sellers or their Affiliates may redact
and/or retain such information.



(b)With respect to any confidential or proprietary information of the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries that is in the possession of the Sellers
and their Affiliates, as soon as practicable, but in any event within sixty
(60) days after the termination of the TSA, the Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts, to the extent practical with respect to 

electronic records and in any event in substantially the same manner as Cenveo
Corp effects destruction of records in accordance with its document retention
policies: (i) if such information is not in the possession of any Company or
Company Subsidiary, to deliver such information to a Company or Company
Subsidiary; and (ii) if such information is duplicative of information in the
possession of any Company or Company Subsidiary, to destroy such information.
If any confidential or proprietary information of the Companies or Company
Subsidiaries includes information relating to the Sellers' or their
Affiliates' business other than the business of the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries, then the Sellers and their Affiliates may redact and/or retain
the information that relates to such other business or such permitted use.



(c)For the purposes of clarity, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
nothing in this Section 5.15 shall prohibit any of the Sellers from using,
registering or otherwise exploiting: (i) the terms "Cenveo," or "Cadmus",
whether alone, or in combination with other words or marks; and (ii) any
trademarks, service marks, trade names, business names, corporate names,
copyrights, product names, brand names, or logos owned or controlled by any of
the Sellers or their Subsidiaries (other than the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries, without regard to the "Cenveo," "CMS" or "Cadmus" names) and any
derivations thereof.



5.16 Parent Contracts.



(a)At any time prior to Closing, the Sellers shall have the right to add (upon
delivery of written notice to Buyer including the revised schedule) additional
Parent Contracts to Section 3.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter solely to
provide notice to Buyer of such Parent Contracts for the sole purpose of this
Section 5.16 and, in such case, Buyer shall have the right within five (5)
Business Days of receipt of notice of any such proposed addition to add (upon
delivery of written notice to the Sellers including the revised schedule) such
Parent Contract to Section 1.3(a)(vii)(B) of the Company Disclosure Letter.



(b)The Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, shall, and
shall cause their respective Affiliates to, use their commercially reasonable
efforts to (i) cause the rights and obligations under the Parent Contracts
noted with an asterisk in Section 3.8(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the
"Designated Shared Contracts") that relate to the Companies or Company
Subsidiaries to be assigned to a Company, Company Subsidiary, Buyer or Buyer
Affiliate insofar as they relate to the Companies or Company Subsidiaries or
(ii) if the counterparty to such Designated Shared Contract does not permit
such assignment, cause the counterparty to such Designated Shared Contract to
enter into a replacement Contract with a Company, Company Subsidiary, Buyer or
Buyer Affiliate containing the rights not materially less beneficial and
obligations not materially more burdensome under such Designated Shared
Contract than are currently in effect and, in all cases, necessary in all
material respects for the continued conduct of the businesses of the Companies
and Company Subsidiaries after the Closing in respect of such Designated
Shared Contract as currently conducted (the "Replacement Contracts"). Buyer
and the Sellers shall cooperate and provide each other with reasonable
assistance in effecting such Assignment or separation of the Designated Shared
Contracts into a Replacement Contract prior to the Closing, and if such
Assignments or Replacement Contracts are not obtained on or prior to the
Closing, then the Sellers, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand,
shall continue, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to continue, to
use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain such Assignments or
Replacement Contracts with 

respect to each applicable Designated Shared Contract for the duration of the
term thereof. Buyer and the Sellers shall hold in trust for the benefit of the
other Party, and shall promptly forward to the other Party, any monies or
other benefits received pursuant to such Designated Shared Contracts, or the
Assignments or Replacement Contracts referred to herein relating to the
respective businesses of the other Party (or its respective Affiliates),
including with respect to the business of the Companies or the Company
Subsidiaries, forwarding any monies or other benefits with respect to the
period prior to the Closing to the Sellers, or with respect to the period
following the Closing, to the Buyer.



(c)Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain from the
respective counterparties to the Designated Shared Contracts (insofar as such
obligations under Designated Shared Contracts relate to the Companies or
Company Subsidiaries), and the beneficiary(ies) under any guarantees, sureties
or other credit support or similar obligations provided by Cenveo or its
Subsidiaries (other than the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries) in
connection with or under the Real Property Leases or Parent Contracts that are
set forth in Section 5.16(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter (such
obligations of Cenveo or its Subsidiaries (other than the Companies or the
Company Subsidiaries), collectively, the "Parent Obligations and Guarantees"),
in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Cenveo Corp, valid and
binding written unconditional releases of such applicable Persons (the "Parent
Releases"), including by the provision of a substitute guarantee of Buyer or
WestRock Company (or any of its Affiliates); provided, that Buyer shall have
no Liability for the failure to obtain any Parent Release and the failure to
obtain any Parent Release will not result in the failure of any condition set
forth in ARTICLE VI.



5.17 Environmental Insurance; Escrow Covenant.



(a)The Sellers shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a Qualified
Environmental Insurance Policy covering the Pre-Existing Conditions on the
Real Property set forth in Section 5.17 of the Company Disclosure Letter
("Listed Real Property"), and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to assist the Sellers in connection therewith. If the Sellers do not obtain a
Qualified Environmental Insurance Policy prior to the Closing, then at the
Closing, Five Million Dollars ($5,000,000) of the Purchase Price shall be
deposited into escrow pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit I (the "Escrow Agreement"). In such event, and
subject to the terms of the rest of this Section 5.17, the Sellers shall
continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a Qualified
Environmental Insurance Policy (and Buyer will reasonably cooperate with the
Sellers in connection therewith). If the Sellers do not obtain a Qualified
Environmental Insurance Policy within 90 days after the Closing (such 90-day
period, as it may be extended in accordance herewith, the "Environmental
Insurance Period"), or, if the Sellers have not obtained a policy
notwithstanding such efforts but believe in good faith that they can obtain
such a policy with a 30-day extension, then the Sellers shall have another 30
days to obtain the policy, but if the Sellers do not obtain a Qualified
Environmental Insurance Policy during such extended Environmental Insurance
Period, then (i) Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) of the escrow shall be
released to Buyer as a reduction in the Purchase Price; and (ii) Two Million
Dollars ($2,000,000) shall remain in escrow to reimburse Buyer Indemnified
Parties for any Losses arising out of or based upon the Pre-Existing
Environmental Conditions (and to satisfy any claims for indemnification by
Buyer Indemnified Parties for Losses arising out of or based upon a breach of,
or any inaccuracy in, the 

representations in Section 3.18 or a claim for indemnification pursuant to
Section 9.2(a)(v)) in accordance with the provisions of the Escrow Agreement.
The escrow shall be held until the later of: (x) five (5) years from the
Closing or (y) until each claim made on the escrow during such period is
finally resolved; provided, that at the end of the five-year period, the
balance of the escrow, less any amount that is subject to a pending claim,
will be released to the Sellers. If the Sellers obtain a Qualified
Environmental Insurance Policy during the Environmental Insurance Period, then
the escrow fund, less $500,000, shall be released to the Sellers and the
remaining $500,000 shall remain in escrow throughout the ten-year term of the
Qualified Environmental Insurance Policy to be utilized for the payment of the
retention or deductible amount relating to the first claim made on such
Qualified Environmental Insurance Policy. If Sellers do not obtain a Qualified
Environmental Insurance Policy within the Environmental Insurance Period but
are able to obtain an insurance policy that Buyer is otherwise willing to
accept in its sole discretion, then Sellers and Buyer will negotiate in good
faith a mutually acceptable amendment to the Escrow Agreement to address the
use and release the escrow fund thereunder. If the Sellers obtain a Qualified
Environmental Insurance Policy on or prior to the Closing, then at the Closing
Five Hundred Thousand Dollars ($500,000) of the Purchase Price shall be
deposited into escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement and shall be used to
satisfy the retention under such policy (and the form of Escrow Agreement
attached hereto shall be revised accordingly).



(b)For the avoidance of doubt, the purchase of a Qualified Environmental
Insurance Policy shall not limit any of the indemnification rights of Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to any Losses other than those Losses arising
out of, or based upon, a breach of, or inaccuracy in, the representations in
Section 3.18 as to the Identified Environmental Conditions. It is understood
and agreed that if a Qualified Environmental Insurance Policy is obtained and
thereafter the insurance carrier fails or refuses to pay, or denies coverage
of a claim, Buyer has no recourse to the Sellers, except to the extent that
the insurance carrier's failure or refusal to pay a claim or its denial of
coverage of a claim arises from an act or omission by any of the Sellers,
including the Sellers' failure to pay in a timely manner any deductible or
retention or the Seller's failure to disclose information or data to the
insurance carrier.



5.18 Environmental Permit. As soon as practicable following the date hereof,
Sellers shall retain an environmental consulting firm reasonably acceptable to
Buyer to review Washburn Graphic's 2007 environmental permit application for
the DR Facility and to determine whether such application accurately reflects
the operations at the DR Facility, meets the requirements of all applicable
Laws, and whether the application should be updated, corrected or modified in
any way. Sellers shall cause the consultant to generate a report with such
recommendations and, promptly upon receipt of such report, shall deliver such
report and any related documentation to Buyer. Sellers shall cause Washburn
Graphics to amend the existing environmental permit application, or file a new
application, and/or take such other actions recommended by the consultant
required in order to obtain the permit all in accordance with the
recommendations of the consultant. Any new or amended environmental permit
application filed by the Washburn Graphics or other action taken by Washburn
Graphics based upon the recommendation of the consultant shall be in a form
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and comply with all applicable Laws. Sellers
will take, and will cause Washburn Graphics to take, commercially reasonable
efforts to diligently prosecute the environmental permit application and
obtain such permit prior to the Closing and, if not obtained prior to the
Closing, 

then Sellers, at their cost, will cooperate with Buyer to obtain such permit
following the Closing. At Buyer's request, Sellers shall, jointly with Buyer,
notify appropriate Governmental Authorities having jurisdiction over such
environmental permit application of the contemplated purchase by Buyer or its
Affiliates of the equity of Washburn Graphics pursuant to this Agreement.
Sellers also shall use their commercially reasonable efforts to facilitate
transfer of the environmental permit application process to Buyer as of the
date of Closing, including, without limitation, executing such documents and
providing such correspondence with Government Authorities as Buyer may request
to facilitate such transfer and to complete the application process. Sellers
shall pay any and all consulting fees, filing fees or other costs and expenses
in connection with the foregoing provisions. For the avoidance of doubt, the
foregoing provisions do not limit in any way the indemnification rights of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties under Section 9.2(a)(v) or the rights of Buyer
pursuant to Section 5.17 hereof, including the rights pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement; provided, that in no event shall Buyer, any Company or any Company
Subsidiary be entitled to a double recovery with respect to any amounts paid
by Sellers hereunder.



5.19 Toledo Air Permit Compliance. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, Buyer shall retain (at the Sellers' sole cost and expense) an
environmental consulting firm ("Buyer\'s Consultant") reasonably acceptable to
the Sellers, and, together with Cenveo and/or its environmental consulting
firm (together, "Sellers\' Consultants"), shall perform a review to determine
whether Cenveo Commercial is or has been out of compliance with the Toledo Air
Requirements at any time since 2010. Buyer\'s Consultant and Cenveo\'s
Consultants shall utilize personnel interviews and Toledo Facility records and
data, including, without limitation, operating logs and compliance inspection
reports, to determine whether there have been instances where the emission
control devices failed to control the emissions from the Toledo Facility
resulting in an out-of-compliance condition or instances where Cenveo
Commercial has otherwise failed to comply with the Toledo Air Requirements.
After the review is complete, Buyer\'s Consultant and Sellers\' Consultants
shall notify Buyer and Sellers of the results of the review, and shall
identify specific instances, if any, when Cenveo Commercial is or has been out
of compliance with the Toledo Air Requirements at any time since 2010. If it
is determined that Cenveo Commercial is or has been out of compliance with the
Toledo Air Requirements at any time since 2010 and Sellers have not previously
corrected an out of compliance issue, then Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to complete repairs to the emission control devices and/or
take all such other actions, at the Sellers\' sole cost and expense, required
to ensure that the cause of the out-of-compliance condition at the Toledo
Facility, as identified by Buyer\'s Consultant and Sellers\' Consultants, has
been identified and corrected (the actions needed to correct the condition are
the "Air Permit Remedial Actions") on or before the Closing. If the Air Permit
Remedial Actions cannot be completed on or before the Closing, despite Sellers
using commercially reasonable efforts to do so, Sellers shall be allowed to
continue their work to complete the Air Permit Remedial Actions after Closing.
If Sellers do not continue to use commercially reasonable efforts to complete
the Air Permit Remedial Actions, then Buyer shall undertake to complete them
and shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Sellers for (x) all costs and
expenses (including, for the avoidance of doubt and without limitation, all
repair costs) in connection therewith upon Buyer's demand therefor, and (y)
all Losses, including, without limitations, fines and penalties, arising from
or relating to Cenveo Commercial's failure to comply with the Toledo Air
Requirements. However, Buyer shall first allow Sellers to notify the
appropriate agency to self-report an out-of-compliance condition if such
condition is identified 

by Buyer\'s Consultant and Sellers\' Consultants, and Buyer shall allow
Sellers to finalize an agreement with the appropriate agency as to the amount
of any fines or penalties issued by such agency, whether before or after
Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, unless the resolution of any out-of-
compliance condition involves only the payment of monetary fines and
penalties, Buyer shall have the right with the cooperation of Seller to
monitor the management and to approve the settlement or other resolution of
such out-of-compliance condition. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing
provisions do not limit in any way the indemnification rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties under Section 9.2(a)(vii). Whether or not any out-of-
compliance conditions are identified, prior to the Closing Sellers shall
replace the catalyst where it is utilized in the emission control devices,
using a qualified company experienced in maintaining such an emission control
device.

CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE SELLERS



The obligations of the Sellers under this Agreement to effect the Closing are
subject to the fulfillment of each of the following conditions prior to or at
the Closing, each of which may be waived (as conditions to their obligations)
by the Sellers in writing in their absolute discretion:



6.1 Representations; Warranties; Covenants.



(a)The representations and warranties of Buyer contained in ARTICLE IV of this
Agreement shall be true and correct in all material respects as though such
representations and warranties were made, as written herein, immediately prior
to the Closing (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date); provided, however, that if any such
representation or warranty is already qualified by any concept of "material,"
"in all material aspects," "material adverse effect," "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect" or any similar qualification, for purposes of determining whether this
condition has been satisfied, such representation or warranty as so qualified
shall be true and correct in all respects without giving effect to the
materiality qualification in this Section 6.1(a).



(b)Buyer shall have performed and complied in all material respects with each
covenant and agreement required by this Agreement to be performed or complied
with by it at or prior to the Closing.



(c)On the Closing Date, the Sellers shall have received a certificate, dated
the Closing Date and duly executed by Buyer certifying that the conditions set
forth in subclauses (a) and (b) of this Section 6.1 have been satisfied.



6.2 Proceedings. No Seller shall be subject to any Order or Law restraining or
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



6.3 HSR Act. Any applicable waiting period (and any extensions thereof) under
the HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
have expired or been terminated. 





6.4 Closing Purchase Price Payment. Buyer shall have paid to Cenveo Corp an
amount in cash equal to the Closing Purchase Price by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to a bank account specified in writing by Cenveo
Corp.



6.5 Deliveries. In addition to the payment of the Closing Purchase Price to
Cenveo Corp, Buyer shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to the
applicable Sellers: (i) each of the documents listed in Section 1.3(b); and
(ii) such other documents or instruments as any Seller may reasonably request
and are reasonably necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby.



ARTICLE VII



CONDITIONS TO THE OBLIGATIONS OF BUYER



The obligations of Buyer under this Agreement to effect the Closing are
subject to the fulfillment of each of the following conditions prior to or at
the Closing, each of which may be waived (as conditions to its obligations) by
Buyer in writing in its absolute discretion:



7.1 Representations; Warranties; Covenants.



(a)The Fundamental Representations of the Sellers contained in ARTICLE II and
ARTICLE III of this Agreement shall be true and correct in all material
respects as though such representations and warranties were made, as written
herein immediately prior to the Closing (except to the extent expressly made
as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date); provided, however, that
if any such representation or warranty is already qualified by any concept of
"material," "in all material aspects," "material adverse effect," "Company
Material Adverse Effect" or any similar qualification, for purposes of
determining whether this condition has been satisfied, such representation or
warranty as so qualified shall be true and correct in all respects without
giving effect to the materiality qualification in this Section 7.1(a). The
representations and warranties of the Sellers set forth in Section 3.6(b)
shall be true and correct in all respects as though such representations and
warranties were made, as written herein, immediately prior to the Closing. All
of the other representations and warranties of the Sellers contained in
ARTICLE II and ARTICLE III of this Agreement shall be true and correct
(disregarding for these purposes all qualifications in such representations
and warranties by any concept of "material," "in all material aspects,"
"material adverse effect," "Company Material Adverse Effect" or any similar
qualification) on the Closing Date as if made on and as of the Closing Date
(except for representations and warranties that expressly speak only as of a
specific date or time other than the Closing Date, which need only be true and
correct as of such other date or time), except where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be so true and correct has not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Solely for the purpose of determining whether
the condition set forth in this Section 7.1(a) has been satisfied, the
Identified Environmental Conditions will be deemed to qualify the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 3.18.



(b)Each Seller shall have performed and complied in all material respects with
each covenant and agreement required by this Agreement to be performed or
complied with by such Seller at or prior to the Closing. 

(c)On the Closing Date, Buyer shall have received a certificate, dated the
Closing Date and duly executed by each Seller certifying that the conditions
set forth in subclauses (a) and (b) of this Section 7.1 and Section 7.4 have
been satisfied.



7.2 Proceedings. Buyer shall not be subject to any Order or Law restraining or
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.



7.3 HSR Act. Any applicable waiting period (and any extensions thereof) under
the HSR Act relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall
have expired or been terminated.



7.4 Company Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement, there
has not been a Company Material Adverse Effect or any event, occurrence, fact,
condition or change that is reasonably likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect.



7.5 Deliveries. The Sellers shall have delivered or caused to be delivered to
Buyer: (i) each of the documents listed in Section 1.3(a); and (ii) such other
documents or instruments as Buyer may reasonably request and are reasonably
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.



7.6 Minority Interests in Certain Foreign Subsidiaries. The closing of the
transactions contemplated by the Minority Holder Purchase Agreements shall
have been consummated prior to or simultaneously with the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereby, as applicable.



ARTICLE VIII TERMINATION



8.1 Termination of Agreement.



(a)This Agreement may be terminated at any time on or prior to the Closing:



(i)by the mutual consent of each of the Sellers and Buyer;



(ii)(by Buyer or Cenveo Corp if the Closing has not occurred by May 1, 2016
(the "Initial Termination Date" and, as may be extended pursuant to this
Section 8.1(a)(ii), the "Termination Date") unless the Initial Termination
Date is extended by written agreement of the Sellers and Buyer in which case
the Initial Termination Date shall be the date set forth in such written
agreement; provided, however, that if on the Initial Termination Date, all of
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI and ARTICLE VII have been satisfied
(other than the conditions: (i) set forth in Sections 6.2, 6.3, 7.2 and 7.3
(but for purposes of Section 6.2 and 7.2 only if such Order or Law relates to
the HSR Act); and (ii) that may, by their terms, only be satisfied at the
Closing or on the Closing Date), Buyer or Cenveo Corp may unilaterally, in
their sole discretion, extend the Initial Termination date by ninety (90) days
by delivery of a written notice of such extension to the other of such party
on or prior to the Initial Termination Date, and provided, further, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(a)(ii) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this
Agreement has been 

the primary cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Closing to occur on
or prior to the applicable Termination Date;



(iii)by Buyer or Cenveo Corp, if any court or Governmental Authority of
competent jurisdiction in the United States shall have issued an Order, or
taken any other action, permanently prohibiting the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement through and beyond the Termination Date, and such Order, or
other action, shall have become final and non- appealable;



(iv)by Cenveo Corp, by delivery of written notice of such termination to
Buyer, if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant
made by Buyer in this Agreement such that any condition in Section 6.1(a) or
Section 6.1(b) would not be satisfied and which, if such breach is curable,
has not been cured to the satisfaction of Cenveo Corp by Buyer within fifteen
(15) Business Days after receipt of written notice from Cenveo Corp requesting
such breach be cured; provided, that the right to terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this Section 8.1(a)(iv) shall not be available to Cenveo Corp if
the failure of any of the Sellers to fulfill any of their obligations under
this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, such breach; or



(v)by Buyer, by delivery of written notice of such termination to the Sellers,
if there has been a breach of any representation, warranty or covenant made by
the Companies or the Sellers in this Agreement such that any condition in
Section 7.1(a) or Section 7.1(b) would not be satisfied and which, if such
breach is curable, has not been cured by the Company or the Sellers, as
applicable, within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of written notice
from Buyer requesting such breach to be cured; provided, that the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(a)(v) shall not be
available to Buyer if the failure of Buyer to fulfill any of its obligations
under this Agreement has been the primary cause of, or resulted in, such
breach.



(b)If Buyer or Cenveo Corp shall terminate this Agreement pursuant to the
foregoing provisions of this Section 8.1, such termination shall be effected
by written notice to the other party or parties specifying the provision
pursuant to which such termination is made.



8.2 Liabilities Upon Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to notice delivered in accordance with Section 8.1, this
Agreement shall thereupon terminate and become void and have no effect, and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be abandoned without further action
by the parties hereto and no party shall thereafter have any Liability to the
other parties hereunder, except: (a) for the rights and obligations of the
parties hereto in Sections 5.3(b), 5.4, 8.2 and ARTICLE XII (other than
Sections 12.3 and 12.17); and (b) nothing herein shall relieve any party
hereto of any Liability for fraud or for any willful breach by such party of
any provision in this Agreement occurring prior to such termination. 



ARTICLE IX

SURVIVAL; INDEMNIFICATION



9.1 Survival. Subject to this Section 9.1 and to Section 9.2, and except for
the covenants and agreements contained in Sections 5.2, 5.3(a), 5.4, 5.7, 5.8,
5.11 and 5.12 (which shall terminate immediately upon the consummation of the
Closing), all representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained
in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents shall survive (and not be
affected in any respect by) the Closing. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that the Closing is consummated: (a) the representations and warranties
contained in or made pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate required to
be delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (b) the covenants and agreements
contained in Sections 5.1, 5.9 and 5.14; and (c) the indemnity obligations
relating to the foregoing set forth in the applicable subsections with respect
thereto in Section 9.2 shall terminate on, and no claim or Action with respect
thereto may be brought after, the date that is eighteen (18) months after the
Closing Date, except that: (i) the Fundamental Representations and Sections
3.13 (Real Property) (to the extent they relate solely as to matters of title
of property) and 3.14 (Title; Condition of Assets) (to the extent they relate
solely as to matters of title of property) shall survive indefinitely; (ii)
the representations and warranties contained in Sections 3.9(c), 3.9(d),
3.9(e), 3.9(f), 3.9(h), 3.9(i), 3.9(j), 3.9(k), 3.9(l) (Employee Benefit
Plans), 3.9(n) and Section 3.11 (Taxes) shall terminate thirty (30) days
following the expiration of the applicable statutes of limitation (but without
giving effect to 10 Del C. § 8106(c)) of the underlying subject matter of such
representations (giving effect to any waiver or extension thereof) (and no
claim or Action with respect thereto may be brought after such date); (iii)
the representations and warranties in Section 3.18 (Environmental Matters)
shall terminate five (5) years after the Closing Date (and no claim or Action
with respect thereto may be brought after such date); and (iv) the
representations and warranties in Sections 3.26 (Inventory) and 3.27 (Accounts
Receivable) shall terminate nine (9) months after the Closing Date (and no
claim or Action with respect thereto may be brought after such date).
Notwithstanding the foregoing: (i) the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements and indemnity obligations which terminate pursuant to this Section
9.1, and the liability of any party hereto with respect thereto pursuant to
this ARTICLE IX, shall not terminate with respect to any claim, whether or not
fixed as to liability or liquidated as to amount, with respect to which the
Responsible Party has been given written notice from the Indemnified Party
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period, setting forth with
reasonable specificity (to the extent known at the time) and, if possible, a
good faith estimate of the amount of the claim; and (ii) an Action with
respect to any claim for which the Responsible Party has been given such
written notice in accordance with subclause (i) above prior to the expiration
of the applicable survival period may be commenced after the expiration of the
applicable survival period.



9.2 Indemnification. The parties hereto shall indemnify each other as set
forth below:



(a)Subject to Section 9.1 and the other provisions of this Section 9.2, from
and after the Closing the Sellers hereby jointly and severally agree to
indemnify and hold harmless Buyer and its Affiliates (which, after the
Closing, include the Companies and the Company Subsidiaries) and their
officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, managers, partners
and/or agents (each, a "Buyer Indemnitee" and, together, the "Buyer 

Indemnitees") from and against any and all Losses incurred, sustained,
suffered or paid by, or imposed upon, any of the Buyer Indemnitees based upon
or arising out of:



(i)any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty of any
Seller contained in ARTICLE II or ARTICLE III of this Agreement or in the
certificate delivered pursuant to Section 7.1(c) hereof, as though made, as
written herein or in such certificate, as of immediately prior to the
Effective Time (except to the extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in
which case as of such date); provided, however, that any inaccuracy in or
breach of any representation or warranty, and any Loss resulting therefrom,
shall be determined without regard to and as if all qualifications as to
"materiality", "material adverse effect", "Company Material Adverse Effect" or
other similar qualifications as to materiality contained in or applicable to
such representation or warranty were deleted therefrom, except that the use of
such terms in Sections 3.5(a), 3.5(c), 3.6(b), 3.6(c) (with respect to
language referred to in and incorporated from Section 5.1), 3.8(a),
3.8(d)(iv), 3.9(b), 3.14 (last sentence), 3.16(a), 3.16(f), 3.16(g), the
definition of "Ordinary Course of Business" and all references to "Material
Contracts", shall be given full force and effect;



(ii)any Liability of any Company, Company Subsidiary or any of their
Affiliates for (x) any and all Taxes for any Pre-Closing Tax Period, except as
provided in Section 10.2(a), (y) any and all Taxes of any Person other than a
Company or Company Subsidiary imposed on any Company or Company Subsidiary as
a transferee or successor or by Contract, (but only to the extent that the
Company or Company Subsidiary became a transferee or successor or entered into
the Contract prior to Closing), pursuant to any Law, or otherwise, which Taxes
relate to an event or transaction occurring before the Closing, and (z) any
and all transfer and similar Taxes for which the Sellers are responsible
pursuant to Section 10.5;



| 
---|--- 

(iii)

|

any Funded Indebtedness or the Sellers' Transaction Expenses; 

 

(iv)any breach by any Seller of or failure by any Seller to perform any of its
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement;



(v)(i) the failure of any Company or Company Subsidiary to have a DR Permit at
any time prior to the Closing (including any fines or penalties for any
failure to have such permit), or (ii) obtaining a DR Permit or complying with
(including operating within any restrictions imposed by) the terms of a DR
Permit;



| 
---|--- 

(vi)

|

any of the Actions set forth on Section 9.2(a)(vi) of the Company 

Disclosure Letter; or



(vii)any failure by Cenveo Commercial to comply with the Toledo Air
Requirements at any time prior to the completion of the Air Permit Remedial
Actions or, for the avoidance of doubt, any failure by the Sellers to comply
with their obligations under Section 5.19; 

provided, however, that



(A)the Sellers shall not be responsible for any Losses with respect to Section
9.2(a)(i): (x) (1) until the amount of such Losses relating to any individual
items or aggregated items arising out of the same facts, events or
circumstances exceeds $20,000 (the "Mini-Basket"), in which case the amount of
all such Losses shall then count towards the Seller Basket Amount (or if the
Seller Basket Amount has been exceeded, the Sellers shall be responsible for
such excess in accordance with this Section 9.2); and (2) subject to subclause
(1), the cumulative aggregate amount of such Losses exceeds $1,050,000 (the
"Seller Basket Amount"), in which case the Sellers shall then be liable only
for such Losses in excess of the Seller Basket Amount; or (y) in excess of
$15,750,000;



(B)the cumulative aggregate indemnity obligation of the Sellers under this
Section 9.2(a) (excluding any indemnification obligations pursuant to Section
9.2(a)(ii), 9.2(a)(iii), 9.2(a)(v), 9.2(a)(vi) or 9.2(a)(vii) or arising out
of the covenants and agreements in ARTICLE X) shall in no event exceed the
Final Purchase Price except that the foregoing limitation shall not apply to
indemnification claims for Losses based upon or arising out of fraud;



(C)Buyer's right to indemnification under this Section 9.2(a) for any Losses
for which a specific accrual for a liability with respect to such Loss is
included in the calculation of Final Closing Working Capital shall be reduced
by the amount of such specific accrual;



(D)the limitations set forth in subsection (A) of this proviso in no way apply
to indemnification claims for Losses relating to or otherwise in respect of
any inaccuracy or breach of any of the Sellers' representations and warranties
included in the Fundamental Representations or in Sections 3.9(c), 3.9(d),
3.9(e), 3.9(f), 3.9(h), 3.9(i), 3.9(j), 3.9(k), 3.9(l), 3.9(n) and 3.11 or for
any Losses caused by fraud relating to any representation or warranty
contained in this Agreement (or any certificate delivered pursuant hereto);
and



(E)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Sellers
shall not be responsible for any Remediation Costs (or other Losses) arising
out of or based upon a breach of, or any inaccuracy in, the representations in
Section 3.18 to the extent such Remediation Costs (or other Losses) are based
upon, or arising out of, the Identified Environmental Conditions, but, for
avoidance of doubt, the foregoing does not limit in any way the rights of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 5.17 hereof under the Escrow
Agreement or a Qualified Environmental Insurance Policy.



(b)Subject to Section 9.1 and the other provisions of this Section 9.2, from
and after the Closing, Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each
Seller and its Affiliates from, and to reimburse the Sellers and their
officers, directors, employees, shareholders, members, managers, partners
and/or agents (each, a "Seller Indemnitee") from and against all Losses
incurred, sustained, suffered or paid by, or imposed upon, any of the Seller
Indemnitees based upon or arising out of: 



(i)any inaccuracy in, or breach of, any representation or warranty of Buyer
contained in ARTICLE IV of this Agreement or in the certificate delivered
pursuant to Section 6.1(c) hereof, as though made, as written herein or in
such certificate, as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (except to the
extent expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such date);
provided, however, that any inaccuracy in or breach of any representation or
warranty, and any Loss resulting therefrom, shall be determined without regard
to and as if all qualifications as to "materiality", "Buyer Material Adverse
Effect" or other similar qualifications as to materiality contained in or
applicable to such representation or warranty were deleted therefrom;



(ii)any breach by Buyer of or failure by Buyer to perform any of its covenants
or agreements contained in this Agreement;



(iii)a "plant closing" or "mass layoff" as such terms are defined in the WARN
Act or any similar triggering event under any other similar state Law
effectuated by Buyer (directly or indirectly, including from and after the
Closing by any Company or Company Subsidiary), affecting in whole or in part
any site of employment, facility, operating unit or the Continuing Employees,
or the failure by Buyer (directly or indirectly, including from and after the
Closing by any Company or Company Subsidiary) to provide any required notice
under the WARN Act and any other similar state Law or to otherwise comply with
any such statute with respect to any such events, in each case except to the
extent attributable to employment losses in excess of the Sellers' WARN Cap
occurring prior to the Closing;



(iv)any Designated Shared Contracts, Replacement Contracts or Parent
Obligations and Guarantees, except to the extent attributable to any breach by
Parent or any of its Affiliates (including the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries for all periods prior to the Closing); or



| 
---|--- 

(v)

|

Taxes for which Buyer is responsible pursuant to Section 10.2(a) 

or Section 10.5.



(c)If any Person entitled to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2 (an
"Indemnified Party") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any
Action or Investigation made or brought by any Person who is not a party to
this Agreement, or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or his, her or
its representative (a "Third-Party Claim"), and if such Indemnified Party
intends to seek indemnity with respect thereto under this ARTICLE IX, then
such Indemnified Party shall promptly provide written notice to the party
obligated to indemnify such Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.2 (such
notified party, the "Responsible Party") of such claims in reasonable detail;
provided, that the failure to so notify shall not relieve the Responsible
Party of its obligations, except to and only the extent that the Responsible
Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice shall identify the basis
(with reference to the specific provision of this Agreement) under which
indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 9.2 and enclose copies of any
written document furnished to the Indemnified Party by the Person that
instituted the Third-Party Claim and a summary the material facts and
circumstances with respect to the Third-Party Claim to the extent then known
by the Indemnified Party. The Responsible Party shall have thirty (30) days
after receipt of such notice to assume the conduct and control, through
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party (provided that the 

parties agree that HHR shall be deemed reasonably acceptable to the parties if
the Sellers are the Responsible Party) at the expense of the Responsible
Party, of the settlement or defense of the Third-Party Claim, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith; provided,
that the Responsible Party shall permit the Indemnified Party to participate
in such settlement or defense through counsel chosen by such Indemnified
Party, provided, that the fees and expenses of such counsel chosen by
Indemnified Party shall be borne by such Indemnified Party, unless: (i) the
employment of such counsel has been specifically authorized in writing by the
Responsible Party; (ii) the Indemnified Party shall have been advised by
counsel that the assumption of such defense by the Responsible Party would be
inappropriate due to an actual or potential conflict of interest; or (iii) the
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that one or more defenses
are available to the Indemnified Party that are not available to the
Responsible Party and the unavailability of such defense to the Responsible
Party materially impairs its ability to vigorously pursue such defenses on
behalf of the Indemnified Party (provided, that the Responsible Party shall
not be liable for the fees and expenses of more than one firm or counsel for
all Indemnified Parties, other than local counsel). So long as the Responsible
Party is diligently defending any such Third-Party Claim in good faith, the
Indemnified Party shall not pay or settle any such claim. If the Responsible
Party elects not to settle or defend such Third-Party Claim or fails to
promptly notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend as
provided in this Agreement, then the Indemnified Party may pay, settle and
defend such Third-Party Claim and seek indemnification for any and all Losses
(including attorneys' fees) based upon, arising from or relating to such
Third-Party Claim to the extent permitted under this Agreement. The
Responsible Party conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in
accordance with this Section 9.2(c) shall not, except with the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed), consent to the entry of any judgment on or
enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim unless the
judgment or proposed settlement involves only the payment of monetary damages
for which the Responsible Party is fully responsible and does not impose an
injunction or other equitable relief or include an admission of wrongdoing.
All settlements shall include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by
the Person or Persons asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of an
unconditional release from all Liability with respect to such claim and a
statement that the settlement is not an admission of wrongdoing.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to
pay or settle any such claim, provided that in such event it shall waive any
right to indemnity therefor by the Responsible Party unless the Responsible
Party shall have consented to such payment or settlement in writing. This
Section 9.2(c) shall not apply to the extent that it is inconsistent with
Section 10.2(c).



(d)Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which does not
result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim") shall be asserted by the
Indemnified Party giving the Responsible Party prompt written notice thereof.
The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the
Responsible Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the
extent that the Responsible Party is actually prejudiced thereby. Such notice
by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in reasonable detail
and shall indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of the
Loss that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party and such
notice shall identify the basis (with reference to the specific provision or
provisions of this Agreement) under which indemnification is sought pursuant
to Section 9.2. The Responsible Party shall have thirty (30) days after its
receipt of such notice to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such
thirty (30)-day 

period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Responsible Party and its
professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance alleged to
give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any amount is
payable in respect of the Direct Claim. If the Responsible Party: (i) rejects
the claim; or (ii) does not respond within such thirty (30)-day period (in
which case the Responsible Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim),
then the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.



(e)The Indemnified Party and the Responsible Party shall each cooperate fully
(and shall each cause its Affiliates to cooperate fully) with the other in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim pursuant to Section 9.2(c). Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing, each such Person shall furnish the other such
Person (at the expense of the Responsible Party) with such documentary or
other evidence as is then in its or any of its Affiliates' possession as may
reasonably be requested by the other Person for the purpose of defending
against any such Third-Party Claim; provided, however, that no Person shall be
required to furnish any documentary or other evidence or provide any
information that would: (i) violate a third-party confidentiality obligation;
(ii) jeopardize any work product privilege or attorney-client privilege (or
similar privilege) of the institution in possession or control of such
information; or (iii) contravene any Law (including antitrust laws); provided,
further, however, that any Indemnified Party withholding such evidence or
information shall cooperate in good faith with the Responsible Party to
identify and implement alternative means for such Responsible Party to be
granted access to any senior officers, properties, books and records, data or
information to which such Responsible Party is not granted access pursuant to
this Section 9.2(e) due to limitations under applicable Law, attorney-client
privilege or other privilege or the terms of any confidentiality agreements,
including, for example and without limitation, entering into a common interest
agreement, seeking third-party consent under contracts, establishing a process
that, through the use of steps such as targeted redactions, provision of
information to counsel to review and, to the extent permitted by applicable
Law, to summarize for its client or use of a "clean room" environment for
analysis and review of information accessible to limited Persons (such as
external advisors) which will be designed to the extent feasible to provide
the Responsible Party with timely access to the substance of the information
described in this Section 9.2(e) in a manner that allows compliance with
contracts, rights and applicable Law and preserve the attorney-client or other
privilege, as the case may be.



(f)The Indemnified Party shall use reasonable efforts to mitigate any Losses
for which indemnification is sought hereunder to the extent such mitigation is
required by applicable Law.



(g)A Responsible Party shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnified
Party to the extent of any Losses that a court of competent jurisdiction shall
have determined by final judgment to have resulted from the fraud or willful
misconduct of any such Indemnified Party.



(h)Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
this ARTICLE IX for Remediation Costs (or other Losses) arising out of, or
based upon, a breach of, or inaccuracy in, the representations in Section 3.18
as to the Identified Environmental Conditions, and shall not be entitled to
any recovery for any Remediation Costs (or other 

Losses): (i) to the extent caused, created, aggravated or exacerbated by any
negligent act or omission or willful misconduct of the Buyer Indemnified
Parties from and after the Closing; (ii) for which a Buyer Indemnified Party
receives insurance recovery or reimbursement under any Qualified Environmental
Insurance Policy; or (iii) to the extent triggered by Buyer's post- Closing
closing demolition, decommissioning or demolition of any part of a facility or
structure of the Business; provided, however, Buyer Indemnified Parties shall
not be deemed to have caused, created, aggravated or exacerbated any
environmental condition or triggered such Remediation Costs or Losses: (A) by
continuing to operate the business in a manner consistent with the Sellers'
past practices; (B) by failing to investigate, correct, fix or resolve or
otherwise address any environmental condition to the extent existing as of or
prior to the Closing or violation of applicable Environmental Law that existed
as of the Closing Date; or (C) by taking any action (including any soil,
groundwater, sediment and surface water investigation) that any Buyer
Indemnified Party initiates, performs or causes or permits to be performed,
including any expansion, alteration, demolition, or discontinuation of any
operations on any Real Property taken in good faith for a reasonable business
purpose by any Buyer Indemnified Party that would have been undertaken
irrespective of the indemnification provisions set forth in this ARTICLE IX.
The Buyer Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to indemnification under
this ARTICLE IX for Remediation Costs (or other Losses) arising out of, or
based upon, a breach of, or inaccuracy in, the representations in Section 3.18
that arises out of the migration of any Hazardous Materials onto the Real
Property from other property that is owned or operated by a third party (other
than any Seller or any of its Affiliates), except for Remediation Costs or
Losses arising from acts or omissions by any of the Companies, Company
Subsidiaries, Sellers or their Affiliates that caused, created, aggravated, or
exacerbated such environmental condition.



(i)Buyer shall not make any claim for indemnification under this ARTICLE IX
with respect to the Identified Environmental Conditions. For the avoidance of
doubt, this Section 9.2(i) does not limit in any way the rights of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties pursuant to Section 5.17 hereof under the Escrow Agreement
or a Qualified Environmental Insurance Policy.



(j) The amount of any Loss for which indemnification is provided to an
Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE IX shall be net of any amounts recovered
or realized by such Indemnified Party under insurance policies with respect to
such Loss (other than from any self-insurance programs) and shall be reduced
to take account of any net Tax benefit realizable by the Indemnified Party
arising from the incurrence or payment of any such Loss to the extent such Tax
benefit is realized in the taxable year in which such Loss occurs and is
attributable to any deduction, loss, credit or other Tax benefit resulting
from or arising out of such Loss; provided, that the amount deemed to be
recovered under such insurance policies will be net of the deductible (or
portion thereof) under such policies applicable to such recovery and any
increase in premium (and retro-premium adjustments) for such policies, in each
case, to the extent arising out of or in connection with such Loss and paid or
payable by such Indemnified Party; provided further, however, that the
Indemnified Party shall have no obligation to pursue or continue the pursuit
of any insurance claim or collateral source. In the event any amounts are
recovered under insurance policies (other than any self-insurance programs) or
other collateral sources (including claims against third parties) after any
claim for indemnification is paid pursuant to this ARTICLE IX, then the net
amount of such recovery from such insurance policy or collateral source shall
be applied first, to reimburse the applicable Indemnified Party for its out-
of-pocket expenses (including reasonable attorney's fees and expenses)
expended in 

pursuing such recovery, second, to the Indemnified Party to the extent it has
Losses in excess of any indemnification payment it has received from the
Responsible Party, third, to refund to the Responsible Party any payments or
expenditures made for the benefit of the Indemnified Party in respect of such
Indemnified Party's claim, and fourth, any excess to the Indemnified Party.



(k) Any payment made by Buyer or the Sellers pursuant to this Section 9.2
shall be deemed an adjustment in the Final Purchase Price for U.S., federal,
state, foreign and local income tax purposes, unless otherwise required by
Law.



(l) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Sellers shall have no
obligation to indemnify Buyer Indemnitees for any Taxes for any taxable period
(or portion thereof) after the Effective Time.



(m) Any liability for indemnification under this Agreement shall be determined
without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to
such liability constituting a breach of more than one representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement.



(n) From and after the Closing, except in the case of fraud or any remedy
provided in ARTICLE X, Section 12.13, Section 5.5(f) or Section 5.17, the
remedies of Buyer and the Sellers under this Section 9.2 are exclusive and in
lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which Buyer or the Sellers, as
the case may be, may have against the other, under this Agreement or
otherwise: (i) with respect to: (x) the breach of any representation,
warranty, certification or other statement made (or deemed made) by the
Sellers or Buyer in or pursuant to this Agreement or any certificate required
to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement; or (y) any breach of, or failure
to perform or comply with, any covenant or agreement set forth in this
Agreement; or (ii) otherwise with respect to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. All claims for indemnification must be asserted, if at all, in
good faith and in accordance with the provisions of Section 9.2 and, to the
extent applicable to such claims, within the relevant time period set forth in
Section 9.1. In furtherance of the foregoing, effective as of the consummation
of the Closing, Buyer and each Seller hereby waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable Law, any and all other rights, claims and causes of
action (including rights of contributions, if any) known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, which exist or may arise in the future, that it may have
against a Seller or Buyer, as the case may be, arising under or based upon any
Law (including any Law relating to environmental matters or arising under or
based upon any securities Law, common Law or otherwise) based upon events
occurring prior to the Closing Date (other than rights, claims and causes of
action expressly contemplated by (and enforced in accordance with) this
Section 9.2) and that relate to the subject matter hereof. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 9.2(l) shall not operate to limit the rights of the
parties to seek equitable remedies (including specific performance or
injunctive relief) in accordance with Section 12.13, or to submit for
resolution by the Accounting Firm the matters referred to in Sections 1.4,
10.1(c), 10.3 or 10.4(b) (in accordance therewith).



(o) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the control of any
Tax audit, examination, proceeding or other claim asserted by any Governmental
Authority in respect of Taxes of any Company or Company Subsidiary shall be
governed exclusively by Section 10.2(c) hereof. 





(p) The Sellers acknowledge and agree that, upon and after the Closing, the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries shall not have any liability or
obligation to indemnify, save or hold harmless or otherwise pay, reimburse or
make the Buyer Indemnitees or the Seller Indemnitees whole for or on account
of any Losses for any untruth, inaccuracy or incorrectness of, or other breach
of, any representation or warranty or the nonfulfillment, nonperformance,
nonobservance or other breach or violation of, or default under, any covenant
or agreement of the Sellers and the Sellers shall not have any right of
contribution against the Companies or the Company Subsidiaries.



(q) No representation or warranty of the Sellers contained in this Agreement
(or in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto) shall be affected or deemed
waived or otherwise impaired or limited by reason of any investigation or due
diligence conducted by Buyer or its representatives.



(r) Cenveo Corp shall act on behalf of the Sellers for the purposes of this

Section 9.2.



(s) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, if Buyer determines that
any Remedial Action is required at any of the Real Properties, then Buyer
shall control such Remedial Action subject to the limitations in the
definition of Remedial Action and in this Section 9.2(s); provided, that with
respect to any Remedial Action for which the Sellers are obligated to
indemnify Buyer Indemnified Parties or for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are
entitled to reimbursement under the Escrow Agreement, Buyer shall provide the
Sellers with a reasonable opportunity to provide input with respect to any
remediation plan and budget, which input, if timely made, shall be considered
in good faith by Buyer. The failure by Buyer to accept any part of the
Sellers' input shall have no effect on any of Buyer's remedies or rights under
this Agreement or the Escrow Agreement. The Sellers and their Affiliates shall
not engage in any communications with any Person or Governmental Authority
with respect to any Remedial Action at the Real Property except in
coordination with Buyer and with Buyer's consent.



(t) With respect to indemnification claims for Losses that constitute
Remediation Costs arising out of or based upon a breach of, or any inaccuracy
in, Section 3.18, or for which Buyer Indemnified Parties are entitled to
reimbursement under the Escrow Agreement, Buyer's indemnification or right to
reimbursement shall be limited to Remediation Costs that reflect the Minimum
Reasonable Costs.



(u) Upon payment in full of any Losses pursuant to any Indemnification Claim,
the Responsible Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to
all of the Indemnified Party's rights of recovery against any third party with
respect to the matters to which such Indemnification Claim relates; provided,
however, that Sellers shall not be subrogated to any of the Indemnified
Party's rights and shall not seek to recover from any Buyer Indemnified Party
or any third party that had or has a commercial relationship with any of the
Buyer Indemnified Parties, including any customer, supplier or other
contractual counterparty. For the avoidance of doubt, the term "commercial
relationship" shall not include any multi- employer plan any Company or
Company Subsidiary participates in, or participants in a multi- employer plan
with any Company or Company Subsidiary, neighbors of any Company or 

Company Subsidiary (other than neighbors who are otherwise engaged in
commercial activity with any Company or Company Subsidiary), and similar non-
commercial relationships.



ARTICLE X CERTAIN TAX MATTERS



10.1 Filing Returns.



(a)Consolidated Income Tax Returns. Cenveo Corp agrees that it and Cenveo
shall include the income of Washburn Graphics and its domestic Subsidiaries
(including any deferred items treated as income by Treasury Regulation §
1.1502-13 and any excess loss account taken into income under Treasury
Regulation § 1.1502-19) on Cenveo's consolidated federal Income Tax Returns
for all periods through the Closing Date, and shall also include such income
in any consolidated, combined or unitary state income Tax Returns filed by
Cenveo or Cenveo Corp in which Washburn Graphics and its domestic Subsidiaries
are included, and timely pay all Taxes attributable to such income. All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared and filed in a manner consistent with prior
practice, except as may be required by Law or as would not affect the Tax
Liability of any Company or Company Subsidiary for periods following the
Closing, or in the absence of a prior practice, in a reasonable manner. Buyer
shall furnish within a reasonable period of time Tax information to Cenveo
Corp as reasonably requested by Cenveo Corp to allow Cenveo and Cenveo Corp to
satisfy their obligations under this Section 10.1(a).



(b)Other Tax Returns for Periods Ending on or Before the Closing Date. Cenveo
Corp shall prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns other than Tax
Returns described in Section 10.2(a) of each Company and Company Subsidiary
for all Tax periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date which are required
to be filed after the Closing Date, which Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with prior practice, except as may be required by Law or as
would not affect the Tax Liability of any Company or Company Subsidiary for
periods following the Closing, or in the absence of a prior practice, in a
reasonable manner. Buyer shall then file such Tax Returns or cause such Tax
Returns to be filed. Cenveo Corp shall permit Buyer to review and comment on
each such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to filing; provided, that
Cenveo Corp shall not be required to make any changes to such Tax Returns,
unless such changes are necessary for such Tax Returns to comply with
applicable Law. Cenveo Corp shall advance to Buyer payment for Taxes of any
Company or Company Subsidiary with respect to such periods not later than two
(2) Business Days prior to the due date for payment thereof to the applicable
Governmental Authority, but only to the extent in excess of any amount accrued
for such Taxes and taken into account for purposes of the Final Closing
Working Capital. Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return of any Company or
Company Subsidiary for taxable periods ending on or before the Closing Date,
except as may be required by Law.



(c)Tax Periods Beginning Before and Ending After the Closing Date. Buyer shall
prepare or cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed any Tax Returns
of each Company and Company Subsidiary for all Tax periods which begin before
the Closing Date and end after the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), which
Tax Returns shall be prepared in a manner consistent with prior practice,
except as may be required by Law or as would not 

adversely affect the Tax liability of any Company or Company Subsidiary for
any Pre-Closing Tax Period, or in the absence of a prior practice, in a
reasonable manner. Buyer shall permit Cenveo Corp to review and comment on
each such Tax Return at least thirty (30) days prior to filing in the case of
income Tax Returns and as soon as practicable in the case of all other Tax
Returns; if Cenveo Corp and Buyer are unable to agree upon the proper tax
treatment of any item, the matter shall be referred to the Accounting Firm for
resolution. Cenveo Corp shall advance to Buyer not later than two (2) Business
Days prior to the due date for payment thereof to the applicable Governmental
Authority, an amount equal to the portion of such Taxes which relates to the
portion of such Tax period ending on the Closing Date (a "Pre-Closing Straddle
Period"), but only to the extent in excess of any amount accrued for such
Taxes and taken into account for purposes of the Final Closing Working
Capital. For purposes of this Section 10.1(c), in the case of any Taxes that
are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Straddle Period, the
portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period shall:
(i) in the case of property or ad valorem Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of
such Tax for the entire Tax period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the Tax period ending on the Closing Date and
the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Tax period
(provided that no portion of such Taxes on property acquired after the Closing
shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period); and (ii) in the case
of any Tax other than a property or ad valorem Tax, be deemed equal to the
amount which would be payable if the relevant Tax period ended on the Closing
Date.



10.2 Additional Tax Matters.



(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall
not, and, following the Closing, shall not permit any Company or Company
Subsidiary to, take any action outside the ordinary course of business or make
any tax election (except as contemplated by Section 10.3, and except for any
election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code) after the Closing that would
increase the Tax liability or the taxable income of any Seller or Affiliate of
any Seller (including any Company or Company Subsidiary for any tax period (or
portion thereof) ending on or before the Closing Date), and shall indemnify
and hold harmless the Sellers from and against any liability for Taxes: (i)
resulting from any such action or election; and (ii) resulting from any
election pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code to the extent (and only to the
extent) that such liability is directly attributable to items other than those
related to the recognition of "subpart F income" as defined in Section 952(a)
of the Code derived by any Company or Company Subsidiary with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period.



(b)Any Tax allocation, sharing, reimbursement or similar agreement between any
Company or Company Subsidiary and any Seller, Cenveo, or other Person (other
than any Company or Company Subsidiary) shall terminate as of the Closing Date
and shall have no further effect for any taxable year (specifically excluding
any Tax reimbursement provisions contained in any financing, lease or other
commercial agreements as more specifically described in Section 3.11(i)).



(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 9.2(c)
hereof, Buyer shall not have the right to participate in any Tax audit,
examination, proceeding or claim that involves a consolidated, combined or
unitary group of Cenveo or any of its Affiliates or to consent to the
settlement of any such Tax audit, examination, proceeding or claim. Cenveo 

Corp shall have the right to control, at its own expense, any other Tax audit,
examination, proceeding or claim with respect to a taxable period ending on or
before the Closing Date, and Buyer shall have the right to control, at its own
expense, the defense of any Tax audit, examination, proceeding or claim
relating to a taxable period beginning before, and ending after, the Closing
Date. Except as provided in the first sentence hereof, the non-controlling
party shall have the right to participate at its own expense in the defense of
any such Tax audit, examination, proceeding or claim, and the controlling
party may not settle any such Tax audit, examination, proceeding or claim
without the prior written consent of the non-controlling party, such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.



(d)The Sellers shall be entitled, without duplication, to: (i) any Tax
refunds, including interest paid therewith; and (ii) any amounts attributable
to any Company or Company Subsidiary that are credited against any Tax or to
which any Company or Company Subsidiary becomes entitled, in each case with
respect to any Tax period ending on or before the Closing Date or any Pre-
Closing Straddle Period (in either such case, a "Pre-Closing Tax Period"). Any
excess of the amount of Tax accrued in Final Closing Working Capital for a
Pre-Closing Tax Period over the amount actually due shall be treated as a
refund for purposes of this Section 10.2(d).



(e)Buyer and Cenveo Corp shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent
reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the filing of Tax
Returns pursuant to Section 10.1 and any audit, litigation or other proceeding
with respect to Taxes pursuant to Section 10.2(c). Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to any such Tax Return,
audit, litigation or other proceeding and making employees available on a
mutually convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of
any material provided hereunder. Buyer and Cenveo Corp agree: (i) to retain
all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Company
relating to any taxable period beginning before the Closing Date until the
expiration of the statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Buyer
or Cenveo Corp, any extensions thereof) of the respective taxable periods, and
to abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any Governmental
Authority; and (ii) to give the other party reasonable written notice prior to
transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and, if the
other party so requests, Buyer or Cenveo Corp, as the case may be, shall allow
the other party to take possession of such books and records; provided, that
Cenveo Corp shall not be required to provide any consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Return that includes Cenveo, Cenveo Corp or a Subsidiary of Cenveo
Corp other than the Companies or Company Subsidiaries, except to the extent
necessary for Buyer to determine a Tax attribute or Liability of any Company
or Company Subsidiary with respect to any Tax period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date.



(f)If, after the Closing Date, Buyer or the Company receives any notice,
letter, correspondence, claim or decree relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period
from any Governmental Authority ("Tax Notice"), Buyer shall deliver a copy of
such Tax Notice to Cenveo Corp within ten (10) days after receipt thereof.
Similarly, if Cenveo Corp receives a Tax Notice, Cenveo Corp shall deliver a
copy of such Tax Notice to Buyer within ten (10) days after receipt thereof,
except in the case of any such Tax Notice with respect to consolidated,
combined or unitary Income Tax Returns described in Section 10.1(a) and which
could not adversely affect 

the Tax Liability of any Company or Company Subsidiary for periods following
the Closing (it being understood that Cenveo Corp shall not be required to
deliver any portion of a Tax Notice that could not affect such Tax Liability).



10.3 Allocation of Purchase Price among Entities. Buyer will engage KPMG LLP
(the "Valuation Firm") to determine, in consultation with Buyer and Cenveo
Corp, an allocation of the Closing Purchase Price and any other items
constituting consideration for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes minus the Note
Liability among the Transferred Securities. Once reviewed and adjusted if and
as required by Buyer's independent financial auditors (such allocation, the
"Entity Allocation"), Buyer shall deliver the Entity Allocation to Cenveo Corp
prior to the Closing. So long as the Entity Allocation is reasonably
acceptable to Buyer and Cenveo Corp, the parties hereto agree to report the
federal, state, local and foreign income and other Tax consequences of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner consistent with the
Entity Allocation, as adjusted to reflect any differences between the Closing
Purchase Price and the Final Purchase Price; otherwise (without affecting the
obligations of Buyer and Cenveo Corp to make the Section 338(h)(10) Election
in accordance with Section 10.4(a) below), each of the parties may report such
Tax consequences in the manner it deems appropriate, provided (for the
avoidance of doubt) that Buyer's withholding obligations set forth in Section
10.6 shall be determined based on the Entity Allocation, as is specified
therein.



10.4 Section 338(h)(10) Election.



(a)Buyer and Cenveo Corp agree that Buyer and Cenveo shall make a timely
election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code and any similar provision of
state or local Income Tax Law (each a "Section 338(h)(10) Election") with
respect to Buyer's purchase of Washburn Graphics and the resulting deemed
purchase of Washburn Graphics' domestic Subsidiaries. To facilitate such
elections, at the Closing, Cenveo Corp shall deliver to Buyer, executed by
Cenveo, Internal Revenue Service Form 8023 and any similar forms under
applicable state or local Income Tax Laws), including the schedules required
to be attached thereto (collectively, the "Section 338(h)(10) Forms"). Buyer
shall: (i) cause the applicable Section 338(h)(10) Forms to be duly executed
by an authorized person for Buyer and provide a copy of the executed Section
338(h)(10) Forms to Cenveo Corp; and (ii) duly and timely file the Section
338(h)(10) Forms as prescribed by Treasury Regulation § 1.338(h)(10)-1 or
applicable provision under state or local Income Tax Law.



(b)Assuming that the Allocation has been delivered and accepted pursuant to
the second sentence of Section 10.3, the Valuation Firm shall determine, in
consultation with Buyer and Cenveo Corp, an allocation of the allocable
portion (determined in accordance with Section 10.3) of the Final Purchase
Price and any other items constituting consideration for U.S. federal Income
Tax purposes, among the assets of Washburn Graphics and its domestic
Subsidiaries for which a Section 338(h)(10) Election is made and the assets of
Cenveo Commercial, Rex 2010, and 136 Eastport in accordance with the
requirements of Sections 338 and 1060 of the Code and the Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Once reviewed and adjusted if and as required by Buyer's
independent financial auditors (such allocation, the "Asset Allocation"),
Buyer shall deliver the Asset Allocation to Cenveo Corp within one hundred
eighty (180) days after the Closing Date. So long as the Asset Allocation is
reasonably acceptable to Buyer and Cenveo Corp, Buyer and the Sellers shall
file all Tax Returns and information reports 

(including IRS Forms 8594 and 8883) in a manner consistent with the Asset
Allocation and any increase or decrease in the Final Purchase Price after
Closing shall be allocated in the same manner, and a party may change such
allocations only as may be required by a final determination as defined in
Section 1313 of the Code; otherwise each of the parties may allocate purchase
price among assets in the manner it deems appropriate.



10.5 Transfer Taxes. Buyer and the Sellers will each timely pay or cause to be
timely paid one-half (50%) of any sales, use, transfer, stamp, documentary or
similar Taxes (other than income or franchise taxes) imposed upon the sale of
the Transferred Securities (including with respect to the deemed sale of any
of the assets of any Company or Company Subsidiary) pursuant to this
Agreement. Buyer will be responsible, upon timely receipt of the Sellers'
portion of any such Taxes due, for preparing and timely filing any forms
required with respect to any such Taxes. Buyer will provide to Cenveo Corp a
true copy of each such return as filed and evidence of the timely filing
thereof.



10.6 Canadian Tax Clearance Certificate. If the Sellers do not provide Buyer
with a certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue under subsection
116(2) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) on or before Closing with a certificate
limit at least equal to the portion of the Closing Purchase Price (the "MMT
Price") allocable to the MMT Shares in accordance with the Entity Allocation,
Buyer shall withhold from the Closing Purchase Price an amount equal to 25% of
the MMT Price (the "Retained Amount") and deposit the Retained Amount in
escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement which shall be revised to include
provision for the establishment, investment and release of the Retained Amount
in accordance with the provisions of this Section 10.6 and otherwise in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement (the Escrow Agreement as so
revised, the "Canadian Tax Agreement"). The Retained Amount shall be dealt
with as follows (and the Canadian Tax Agreement shall require the Sellers,
Buyer and the agent appointed by the Sellers and Buyer thereunder (the
"Canadian Tax Agent") to comply with the following terms):



(a)If the Sellers deliver to Buyer, not later than the 27th day of the month
following the month in which the Closing occurs (the "Due Date") a certificate
issued by the Minister of National Revenue pursuant to subsection 116(4) of
the Income Tax Act (Canada) in connection with the sale of the MMT Shares (or
a certificate issued by the Minister of National Revenue under subsection
116(2) in respect of such sale with a certificate limit at least equal to the
MMT Price), the Retained Amount shall be promptly paid to the Sellers;



(b)If the Sellers deliver to Buyer not later than the Due Date a certificate
under subsection 116(2) of the Income Tax Act (Canada) in respect of the
disposition of the MMT Shares with a certificate limit less than the MMT
Price, an amount equal to 25% of the amount by which the MMT Price exceeds
such certificate limit will be paid to the Receiver General for Canada within
30 days after the end of the month in which the Closing occurs and the balance
of the Retained Amount shall be promptly paid to the Sellers;



(c)If a certificate under subsection 116(2) or 116(4) of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) is not delivered as contemplated in paragraphs (a) or (b) above and
no Comfort Letter (as defined below) is provided to Buyer by the Due Date, the
Retained Amount shall be paid to 

the Receiver General for Canada within 30 days after the end of the month in
which the Closing occurs; or



(d)If a certificate under subsection 116(2) or 116(4) of the Income Tax Act
(Canada) is not delivered as contemplated in paragraphs (a) or (b) above but a
Canadian Tax Comfort Letter (as defined below) is provided to Buyer by the Due
Date, the Retained Amount shall continue to be held in escrow under the
Canadian Tax Agreement and in accordance with the terms of the Comfort Letter.



In this Section 10.6, "Canadian Tax Comfort Letter" means a letter from the
Canada Revenue Agency addressed to Buyer confirming to Buyer's satisfaction,
acting reasonably, that Buyer need not remit any amount in respect of the
purchase and sale of the MMT Shares under subsection 116(5) of the Income Tax
Act (Canada) until further notification by the Canada Revenue Agency and until
such further notification will not be liable under the Income Tax Act (Canada)
in respect of income taxes, interest or penalties arising from such sale. The
provisions of this Section 10.6 shall apply mutatis mutandis in respect of
each payment made by Buyer to the Sellers in respect of the purchase and sale
of the MMT Shares pursuant to this Agreement.



ARTICLE XI



CERTAIN EMPLOYEE MATTERS



11.1 Employment and Benefits.



(a)As of the Closing Date, Buyer shall: (i) cause each of the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, to continue to employ on the Closing
Date each person who is an employee of any Company or Company Subsidiary
immediately prior to the Closing (whether or not actively at work and
including those employees on an approved leave of absence or currently
receiving workers' compensation) (the "Company Employees"); and (ii) with
respect to each Offeree Employee (whether or not actively at work and
including those employees on an approved leave of absence or currently
receiving workers' compensation), offer, or cause its applicable Affiliate
(including the Companies and Company Subsidiaries as of the Closing) to offer,
employment to such Offeree Employee, effective as of immediately following the
Closing, in each case, on the terms consistent with this ARTICLE XI. Each
Offeree Employee who accepts such offer of employment and transfers to Buyer
or one of its Affiliates (the "Transferred Employees") shall commence
employment with Buyer or one of its Affiliates immediately following the
Closing. All such Company Employees who continue such employment with the
Companies or Company Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing, together
with the Transferred Employees, shall be referred to herein as the "Continuing
Employees." Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this
Agreement shall limit or restrict the right of Buyer, any of the Companies or
any of the Company Subsidiaries from terminating a Continuing Employee after
the Effective Time.



(b)With respect to each Continuing Employee, subject to the terms of any
applicable collective bargaining agreement and except as otherwise may be
required by applicable Law, for the period commencing at the Closing and
ending on March 31, 2016, Buyer agrees to: (i) provide (or cause its
appropriate Affiliate to provide) compensation and employee



benefits substantially equivalent in the aggregate to that provided under the
Employee Plans in which the Continuing Employees participated immediately
prior to the Closing except for any defined benefit pension benefits or
benefits under the Seller 401(k) Plan, or any equity or equity-based
compensation), provided, however, that the wage rate or base salary level for
each Continuing Employee shall be no less than the wage rate or base salary
level in effect for such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing;
and (ii) provide (or cause its appropriate Affiliate to provide) severance
benefits that are no less favorable than the Continuing Employees would have
received under the terms of the severance plan, policy, practice or
arrangement applicable to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Closing. As of the Closing, Buyer shall credit (or cause its appropriate
Affiliate to credit) the service of each Continuing Employee with the Sellers
and their Affiliates (including any Company or any Company Subsidiary) before
the Closing Date as service with Buyer and its Affiliates for all purposes
(including eligibility, vesting and benefit accrual) under all compensation
and benefit plans maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates for any
Continuing Employee after the Closing to the extent it does not result in any
duplication of compensation or benefits and except with respect to benefits
accruals under any defined benefit plan. Except as otherwise required by
applicable Law, nothing in the preceding sentence shall preclude Buyer from
terminating the employment of any Continuing Employee after the Closing.



Nothing in this Section 11.1(b) shall require that Buyer make the Continuing
Employees eligible to participate in any specific compensation or benefit plan
maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates.



11.2 Employee Benefit Transition.



(a)Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall establish or maintain, or cause to
be established or maintained, one or more group health plans which shall cover
all Continuing Employees and dependents who immediately prior to the Closing
were covered under any group health plan maintained by a Seller. Buyer shall
waive (or cause to be waived) any pre-existing condition requirements,
evidence of insurability provisions, waiting period requirements or any
similar provisions for any Continuing Employees under any medical, dental,
disability or life insurance plan maintained or sponsored by or contributed to
by Buyer for such individuals after the Closing Date. To the extent all
information reasonably necessary to implement such actions has been received
from the Sellers or their Affiliates, Buyer shall also apply toward any
deductible requirements and out-of-pocket maximum limits under such plans any
amounts paid (or accrued) by each Continuing Employee under the comparable
Employee Plans of a Seller during the calendar year in which the Closing
occurs.



(b)Effective as of the Closing, the Sellers shall cause all participants in
the Cenveo 401(k) Savings and Retirement Plan (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") who
are Continuing Employees on the Closing Date to become 100% vested in their
account balances under the Seller 401(k) Plan. Buyer shall take all steps
necessary to permit each Continuing Employee who has received an eligible
rollover distribution (as defined in Section 402(c)(4) of the Code) from the
Seller 401(k) Plan to roll over such eligible rollover distribution and any
associated participant loans as part of any lump sum cash distribution into an
account under a 401(k) plan maintained by Buyer or its Affiliates within
ninety (90) days of the Closing Date. 

11.3 Employee Plans. Except as otherwise provided in this ARTICLE XI or in the
TSA, the Sellers shall be responsible for all benefits and liabilities under
any Seller Plan. Except as may be provided in the TSA, the Sellers shall take
all actions necessary to provide that as of the Closing Date: (a) all
Continuing Employees shall cease to accrue benefits under the Seller Plans;
and (b) the Companies and Company Subsidiaries shall withdraw from
participation in any Seller Plans. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer (and its
Affiliates, including the Company and Companies Subsidiaries) shall continue
to be responsible for any Company Plans, and the Sellers and its Affiliates
shall have no liabilities or obligations with respect to any Company Plans.



11.4 Employment Agreements. With respect to those Continuing Employees whose
services are performed pursuant to an employment agreement, effective as of
the Closing, Buyer shall, and shall cause the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries to, honor the terms of such employment agreement, and Buyer
shall, or shall cause one of its Affiliates to, assume the employment
agreements listed in Section 11.4 of the Company Disclosure Letter.



11.5 Benefits under Collective Bargaining Agreements. From and after the
Closing, Buyer agrees to continue to honor the terms of, and continue to
provide any employee benefits required to be provided under the terms of, any
applicable collective bargaining agreement covering any Continuing Employees.



11.6 Incentive Compensation. Prior to, or in connection with, the Closing, the
Sellers shall pay or cause to be paid to the Continuing Employees,
collectively, such aggregate amount with respect to the Sellers' or any of its
Affiliates' (including the Companies' or any Company Subsidiaries') cash
incentive compensation plans (exclusive of any equity or equity-based
compensation plans) for the plan year in which the Closing occurs (the
"Incentive Compensation Plans") as would be accrued in Estimated Closing
Working Capital if such amounts were not paid prior to Closing, less any
applicable withholding.



11.7 Vacation. Effective as of the Closing, Buyer shall recognize, and assume
all Liabilities for, any earned but not taken paid time off of the Continuing
Employees prior to the Closing Date, to the extent such Liabilities are
accrued in Final Closing Working Capital.



11.8 Cooperation. Upon reasonable request, the Sellers shall provide to Buyer,
and Buyer shall provide to the Sellers, such documents, data and information
as may reasonably be necessary to implement the provisions of this ARTICLE XI.



11.9 Update to Company Disclosure Letter. Not more than ten (10) days prior to
the Closing, the Sellers shall update Section 3.10(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter to reflect any changes to the information contained therein
occurring after the date of this Agreement but prior to the date such update
is made.



11.10 WARN Schedule. Not more than ten (10) days prior to the Closing, the
Sellers shall provide Buyer with a schedule setting forth the number of
Employees at each work location who experienced an "employment loss" as
defined in the WARN Act during the 90-day period prior to the Closing Date;
provided, however, such schedule will not include more than ten (10) Employees
(the "Sellers' WARN Cap").

12.7 Governing Law; Waiver of Jury Trial. THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY DISPUTES
ARISING HEREUNDER WILL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE
DOMESTIC LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OF
LAW OR CONFLICTING PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE LAWS OF ANY JURISDICTION OTHER THAN
THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO BE APPLIED. IN FURTHERANCE OF THE FOREGOING, THE
INTERNAL LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WILL CONTROL THE INTERPRETATION AND
CONSTRUCTION OF THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY DISPUTES ARISING HEREUNDER, EVEN IF
UNDER SUCH JURISDICTION'S CHOICE OF LAW OR CONFLICT OF LAWS ANALYSIS THE
SUBSTANTIVE LAW OF SOME OTHER JURISDICTION WOULD ORDINARILY APPLY. EACH PARTY
HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT
SUCH PARTY MAY LEGALLY AND EFFECTIVELY DO SO, TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING HEREUNDER.



12.8 Waiver of Provisions. The provisions, terms, covenants, representations,
warranties and conditions of this Agreement may be waived only by a written
instrument executed by the party hereto waiving compliance. The failure of any
party hereto at any time or times to require performance of any provision of
this Agreement shall in no manner affect the right of such party at a later
date to enforce the same. No waiver by any party hereto of any 

condition or the breach of any provision, term, covenant, representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement, whether by conduct or otherwise, in any
one or more instances shall be deemed to be or construed as a further or
continuing waiver of any such condition or of the breach of any other
provision, term, covenant, representation or warranty of this Agreement.



12.9 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts, and
all counterparts so executed shall constitute one agreement, binding on the
parties hereto, notwithstanding that such parties are not signatory to the
same counterpart. Counterparts may be delivered by facsimile or other
electronic transmission.



12.10 Entire Agreement. This Agreement and the other Transaction Documents
constitute the entire agreement among the parties, and supersedes and cancels
any and all prior agreements among them relating to the subject matter hereof
and thereof (provided, that the Confidentiality Agreement shall survive in
accordance with Section 5.3(b)) and may not be amended or modified except by a
written agreement signed by the parties.



12.11 Company Disclosure Letter. Any information disclosed in any section of
the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed fully disclosed for the purposes
of qualifying the other representations and warranties hereunder if the
applicability of such information included in such disclosure to such
representations and warranties is reasonably apparent on its face. Neither the
specification (directly or indirectly by reference to a defined term hereof)
of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties set forth in
ARTICLE II, ARTICLE III or ARTICLE IV or the indemnification provisions of
ARTICLE IX nor the inclusion of any items in the Company Disclosure Letter
shall be deemed to constitute an admission by the parties, or otherwise imply,
that any such amount or such items so included are material for the purposes
of this Agreement. The inclusion of, or reference to, any item within any
particular Section of the Company Disclosure Letter does not constitute an
admission by the parties that such item meets any or all of the criteria set
forth in this Agreement for inclusion in such Section of the Company
Disclosure Letter. At any time prior to Closing, solely for informational
purposes, the Sellers shall have the right to supplement, modify or amend the
Company Disclosure Letter with respect to any matter first existing or
occurring following the date of this Agreement that: (i) if existing or
occurring at or prior to the date of this Agreement would have been required
to be set forth or described in such Company Disclosure Letter; (ii) would
make any representation or warranty in ARTICLE II or ARTICLE III inaccurate if
such representation or warranty were made on or as of the Closing Date, or
(iii) is necessary to correct any information in such Company Disclosure
Letter that has been rendered inaccurate thereby. No supplement, modification
or amendment to any such Company Disclosure Letter shall have any affect on
the representations and warranties made in ARTICLE II or ARTICLE III or cure,
or be deemed to have cured, any inaccuracy or breach of any representation or
warranty contained in this Agreement for any purpose, including for purposes
of indemnification or termination rights or determining whether or not
conditions set forth in Section 7.1 have been satisfied.



12.12 Submission to Jurisdiction. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO MATTERS SUBMITTED FOR
RESOLUTION BY THE ACCOUNTING FIRM PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 1.4, 10.1(C) OR
10.4(B), EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO IRREVOCABLY AGREES THAT ANY PROCEEDING
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY BROUGHT BY 

ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO OR ITS SUCCESSORS OR PERMITTED ASSIGNS WILL BE BROUGHT
AND DETERMINED IN THE COURT OF CHANCERY OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE IN THE CITY
OF WILMINGTON, COUNTY OF NEW CASTLE (OR, IF SUCH COURT LACKS SUBJECT MATTER
JURISDICTION, IN ANY APPROPRIATE DELAWARE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT), AND EACH OF
THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF
THE AFORESAID COURTS FOR ITSELF AND WITH RESPECT TO ITS PROPERTY, GENERALLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY, WITH REGARD TO ANY SUCH PROCEEDING. EACH OF THE PARTIES
HERETO AGREES NOT TO COMMENCE ANY SUCH PROCEEDING EXCEPT IN THE COURTS
DESCRIBED ABOVE IN DELAWARE, OTHER THAN PROCEEDINGS IN ANY COURT OF COMPETENT
JURISDICTION TO ENFORCE ANY JUDGMENT, DECREE OR AWARD RENDERED BY ANY SUCH
COURT IN DELAWARE AS DESCRIBED HEREIN. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER
AGREES THAT NOTICE AS PROVIDED HEREIN WILL CONSTITUTE SUFFICIENT SERVICE OF
PROCESS AND THE PARTIES HERETO FURTHER WAIVE ANY ARGUMENT THAT SUCH SERVICE IS
INSUFFICIENT. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES, AND AGREES NOT TO ASSERT, BY WAY OF MOTION OR AS A
DEFENSE, COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHERWISE, IN ANY PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR
RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY: (A) ANY
CLAIM THAT IT IS NOT PERSONALLY SUBJECT TO THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURTS IN
DELAWARE AS DESCRIBED HEREIN FOR ANY REASON; (B) THAT IT OR ITS PROPERTY IS
EXEMPT OR IMMUNE FROM JURISDICTION OF ANY SUCH COURT OR FROM ANY LEGAL PROCESS
COMMENCED IN SUCH COURTS (WHETHER THROUGH SERVICE OF NOTICE, ATTACHMENT PRIOR
TO JUDGMENT, ATTACHMENT IN AID OF EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT, EXECUTION OF JUDGMENT
OR OTHERWISE); AND (C) THAT: (I) THE PROCEEDING IN ANY SUCH COURT IS BROUGHT
IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM; (II) THE VENUE OF SUCH PROCEEDING IS IMPROPER; OR
(III) THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, MAY NOT BE ENFORCED IN OR
BY SUCH COURTS.



12.13 Specific Performance. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at law in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms, provisions and covenants contained herein in any court set forth in
Section 12.12, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled at law or in equity. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief on
the basis that: (a) the other party (or parties) has (or have) an adequate
remedy at law; or (b) an award of specific performance is not an appropriate
remedy for any reason at law or equity. Each party hereby waives any
requirement under any Law to post security or a bond as a condition to
obtaining equitable relief.



12.14 No Third-Party Beneficiary. This Agreement is for the sole benefit of
the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and
nothing herein, except as set forth in Sections 5.6 (with respect to the
Indemnitees), Sections 9.2(a) and 9.2(b) (with respect to 

Indemnified Parties) and 12.19 (with respect to Non-Party Affiliates), express
or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason
of this Agreement.



12.15 No Presumption. With regard to each and every term and condition of this
Agreement and any and all agreements and instruments subject to the terms
hereof or referred to herein, the parties hereto understand and agree that the
same have or has been mutually negotiated, prepared and drafted, and if at any
time the parties hereto desire or are required to interpret or construe any
such term or condition or any agreement or instrument subject hereto, no
consideration shall be given to the issue of which party hereto actually
prepared, drafted or requested any term or condition of this Agreement or any
agreement or instrument subject hereto.



12.16 Severability. To the fullest extent that they may effectively do so
under applicable Law, the parties hereto hereby waive any provision of Law
which renders any provision of this Agreement invalid, illegal or
unenforceable in any respect. Such parties further agree that any provision of
this Agreement which, notwithstanding the preceding sentence, is rendered or
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect in any jurisdiction
shall be ineffective, but such ineffectiveness shall be limited as follows:
(a) if such provision is rendered or held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in
such jurisdiction only as to a particular Person or Persons or under any
particular circumstance or circumstances, such provision shall be ineffective,
but only in such jurisdiction and only with respect to such particular Person
or Persons or under such particular circumstance or circumstances, as the case
may be; (b) without limitation of clause (a), such provision shall in any
event be ineffective only as to such jurisdiction and only to the extent of
such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability, and such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability in such jurisdiction shall not render invalid,
illegal or unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction; and (c)
without limitation of clause (a) or (b), such ineffectiveness shall not render
invalid, illegal or unenforceable this Agreement or any of the remaining
provisions hereof. Without limitation of the preceding sentence: (i) it is the
intent of the parties hereto that, in the event that in any court proceeding,
such court determines that any provision of this Agreement is illegal, invalid
or unenforceable in any jurisdiction to any extent, such court shall have the
power to, and shall: (A) modify such provision (including by limiting the
Persons against whom, or the circumstances under which, such provision shall
be effective in such jurisdiction) for purposes of such proceeding to the
minimum extent necessary so that such provision, as so modified, may then be
enforced in such proceeding; and (B) enforce such provision, as so modified
pursuant to clause (A), in such proceeding; and (ii) upon any determination
that any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of such parties as closely as possible in a
mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby
be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
Nothing in this Section 12.16 is intended to, or shall: (x) limit the ability
of any party hereto to appeal any court ruling or the effect of any favorable
ruling on appeal; or (y) limit the intended effect of Section 12.7 or 12.12.



12.17 Access to Books and Records. After the Closing Date, Buyer shall, upon
the Sellers' reasonable request from time to time, and upon reasonable notice:
(a) (i) provide to the authorized representatives of the Sellers full access,
during normal business hours, to any and all 

premises, properties, files, books, records, documents and other information
of the Companies and Company Subsidiaries relating to periods prior to the
Closing; (ii) cause its officers and the officers of each Company and Company
Subsidiary to furnish to the Sellers and their respective authorized
representatives any and all financial data and other information pertaining to
such Company relating to periods prior to the Closing; and (iii) make
available to the Sellers and their representatives, personnel of Buyer and the
Companies and Company Subsidiaries to consult with such personnel; and (b)
make available for inspection and copying by the Sellers true and complete
copies of any documents relating to the foregoing, and the reasonable out-of-
pocket expenses of Buyer incurred in connection with the foregoing matters in
this Section 12.17 will be paid by the Sellers. In exercising their rights
under the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.17, the Sellers and their
respective representatives shall not interfere with the normal operations of
Buyer or any Company or Company Subsidiary. Buyer shall cause each Company and
Company Subsidiary to retain the files, books, records and documents of each
Company and Company Subsidiary relating to the period prior to the Closing
Date for at least seven (7) years after the Closing Date and after such
seventh (7th) year anniversary, to give the Sellers at least twenty (20)
Business Days' prior written notice and a reasonable opportunity to receive,
at the Sellers' cost, such files, books, records or documents prior to
destroying or discarding any such files, books, records or documents.



12.18 Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representations; Privilege.



(a)Recognizing that HHR has acted as legal counsel to the Companies and the
Company Subsidiaries, and has acted from time to time as legal counsel to the
Sellers and one or more of their stockholders and Affiliates prior to the
consummation of the Closing, and that HHR intends to act as legal counsel to
the Sellers and one or more of the Sellers' stockholders and their Affiliates
after the consummation of the Closing, each of the Sellers and Buyer hereby
consents to and waives, on behalf of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries and agrees to cause each of the Companies and the Company
Subsidiaries to consent to and waive, any conflicts that may arise in
connection with HHR representing the Sellers or the Sellers' respective
stockholders or any of their Affiliates after the consummation of the Closing,
whether in connection with the Transaction Documents or otherwise. The parties
also agree that the fact that HHR may be deemed from time to time to have
acted as legal counsel to the Companies and Company Subsidiaries prior to the
consummation of the Closing shall not prevent HHR from representing the
Sellers or the Sellers' respective stockholders or any of their Affiliates in
connection with any matters, including any matter involving this Agreement or
the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby or any disputes between any of the parties hereto that may arise after
the consummation of the Closing. Each of the parties acknowledges that such
consent and waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and
that it has consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in
respect thereto. Communications between any Company or Company Subsidiary and
HHR will become the property of the Sellers following the Closing and will not
be disclosed to Buyer without the consent of the Sellers.



(b)Notwithstanding the Closing, the parties agree that none of the Companies
or Company Subsidiaries nor Buyer shall have the right to assert attorney-
client privilege as to pre-Closing and post-Closing communications between the
Sellers, the Companies or Company Subsidiaries (for the Companies and Company
Subsidiaries, only with respect to pre-Closing 

communications), on one hand, and HHR, on the other hand, to the extent that
the privileged communications relate to this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents or to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.
The parties agree that only the Sellers shall be entitled to assert or waive
such attorney-client privilege in connection with such communications
following the Closing. As of the consummation of the Closing and thereafter:
(x) the client communications, work product and files generated and maintained
by HHR as a result of HHR's representation of the Sellers, the Companies and
the Company Subsidiaries in connection with this Agreement or any of the other
Transaction Documents or any of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby shall be and become the exclusive property of the Sellers, and any
attorney-client privilege with respect thereto may be waived on behalf of the
Sellers only by Cenveo Corp; (y) HHR shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal
or disclose any such communications, work product or files to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Companies or Company
Subsidiaries) by reason of any attorney-client relationship or otherwise; and
(z) in the event any dispute arises between any of the parties hereto and/or
any of the Companies and/or Company Subsidiaries, whether involving this
Agreement or the other Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby or otherwise, Buyer agrees, on behalf of itself and the
Companies and the Company Subsidiaries, that Buyer, the Companies and the
