&#147;<U>Indemnified Party</U>&#148;) wishing to assert a claim for indemnification under this <U>Article X</U> (a &#147;<U>Claim</U>&#148;) shall deliver to the Person from whom indemnification is sought (the &#147;<U>Indemnifying Party</U>&#148;)
a written notice (a &#147;<U>Claim Notice</U>&#148;) that (i)&nbsp;states in reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for the Damages claimed, (ii)&nbsp;states the amount (the &#147;<U>Claim Amount</U>&#148;) of any Damages claimed by the
Indemnified Party, to the extent then known, (iii)&nbsp;states that the Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this <U>Article X</U> and set forth a reasonable explanation of the basis therefor, and (iv)&nbsp;includes a demand for
payment in the amount of such Damages. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response in which the Indemnifying Party shall (A)&nbsp;agree that the Indemnified Party
is entitled to receive all of the Claim Amount, (B)&nbsp;agree that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claim Amount, or (C)&nbsp;contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claim Amount.
If the Indemnifying Party in such response contests the payment of all or part of the Claim Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is not resolved within 60 days
following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party of such response, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall each have the right to submit such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the provisions of
<U>Section&nbsp;11.10</U>. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; margin-left:4%; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(b) <I><U>Third-Party Claims</U></I>. All claims for indemnification made under this Agreement
resulting from, related to, or arising out of a third-party claim shall be subject to the following additional procedures and provisions. An Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notification to the Indemnifying Party of the commencement of
any action, suit, or proceeding relating to a third-party claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon the assertion of any such claim or demand by a third party. Such notification shall (i)&nbsp;state in reasonable detail (to
the extent known by the Indemnified Party) the facts constituting the basis for such third-party claim, (ii)&nbsp;state the sections of this Agreement with respect to which indemnification is being claimed for such Damages and that the Indemnified
Party if entitled to indemnification under this <U>Article X</U>, and (iii)&nbsp;state the amount of the Damage being claimed. Within 30&nbsp;days after delivery of such notification, the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the
Indemnified Party, assume control of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding, or claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of any action,
suit, proceeding, or claim that seeks non-monetary relief or criminal penalties. If the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of such defense, the Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The party not controlling such defense may
participate therein at its own expense; provided that if the Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party have
conflicting interests with respect to such action, suit, proceeding, or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be </P>
