(iii) do not arise from or relate to any event, circumstance, or condition

contrary stated in this Agreement, if:

(a) the assignment of any contract or Permit that would otherwise be an
Assigned Contract or Assigned Permit (as applicable) without the approval,
consent, or waiver of

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 5  another party thereto would violate, conflict with, result in a breach or
termination of, or constitute a default or event of default under (or an event
that with due notice, lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default or
event of default under) the terms of such contract or Permit or any Applicable
Law, or result in the creation of any Lien on any Purchased Asset or enable
another party to terminate the contract or Permit or impose a penalty or
additional payment obligations or accelerate any obligation of Seller or Buyer
under the contract or Permit; and

 

(b) all necessary approvals, consents, and waivers required by the contract or
Permit have not been obtained on or before the Closing Date in order to avoid
the consequences set forth in _Section 1.5(a)_;

then Buyer shall not be obligated to assume the contract or Permit (and if
Buyer does not assume the contract or Permit, such contract or Permit shall
not be included in the Assigned Contracts, Assigned Permits or the Purchased
Assets at Closing); provided, however that Buyer may, at its sole
discretion, elect, by written notice to Seller, to assume the obligations and
liabilities of Seller under the contract or Permit (to the extent the same
would constitute Assumed Liabilities had such contract been included in the
Assigned Contracts or Assigned Permits at the Closing) (but not the contract
or Permit itself), in which event:

(i) such obligations and liabilities (but not the contract or Permit itself)
shall be included in the Assumed Liabilities, the claims, rights, and benefits
of Seller arising under the contract or resulting therefrom (but not the
contract or Permit itself) shall be included in the Assigned Contracts or
Assigned Permits and transferred to Buyer hereunder, and any payments or other
benefits received by Seller therefrom after the Closing shall immediately be
transferred by Seller to Buyer;

 

(ii) after the Closing, Seller and Seller Members shall have the continuing
obligation to use their commercially reasonable efforts (at their own
expense) to obtain all necessary approvals, consents, and waivers to the
assignment or transfer of any such unassigned contracts or Permits, and each
of the parties shall promptly execute all documents necessary to complete
the transfer of the contract or Permit to Buyer if such approvals, consents,
and waivers are obtained (whereupon such contract or Permit shall be included
in the Assigned Contracts or Assigned Permits, as applicable, and deemed a
Purchased Asset for all purposes hereunder); and

(iii) in addition to and notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that,
notwithstanding Sellers good faith efforts, Seller is unable to obtain the
consent to the assignment of a Takedown Contract, Buyer and Seller agree to
reasonably cooperate to facilitate the transfer of the Real Property that is
the subject of such Assigned Contract by alternative means, including,
without limitation, the acquisition of the Real Property that is the subject
of such Assigned Contract by Seller and subsequent or simultaneous conveyance
of such Real Property to Buyer.

 

1.6 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. From and after the Closing
Date, Seller and Seller Members shall, from time to time, at the request of
Parent or Buyer and without further consideration do, execute, acknowledge,
and deliver all such further acts, deeds, assignments, transfers, conveyances,
powers of attorney, and assurances as may be reasonably required to confirm

(i) the Estimated Equity Value _plus_  $23,250,000 (the " _Closing Purchase
Price_ "), as such amount may be adjusted after Closing pursuant to _Section
2.2(d)_; _plus_

 

(ii) the Closing Indebtedness; _plus_

 

(iii) the Holdback Amount, _plus_

 

(iv) any Earn-Out Payments.

 

(b) At the Closing:

 

(i) Parent or Buyer will pay in full, on Sellers behalf, the Closing
Indebtedness necessary to cause the release of all Liens on the Purchased
Assets, as set forth in payoff letters reasonably acceptable to Buyer;
_provided_ , _that_ , Parent may (in its sole discretion) elect to instead
assume all or any portion of the Closing Indebtedness;

 

(ii) Parent or Buyer will pay an amount equal to the Closing Purchase Price to
Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds pursuant to wire
instructions provided to Parent at least two Business Days before the Closing
Date; and

(iii) The portion of the Purchase Price represented by the Holdback Amount
and any Earn-Out Payments will be retained by Parent and Buyer, with any
subsequent payments of such amounts to be made pursuant to _Section 2.4_ or
_Section 2.5_. 

2.2 _Equity Value; Post-Closing True-Up_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Equity Value_ " means the total assets
of Seller less the total liabilities of Seller (including Indebtedness), in
each case to the extent included in the Purchased Assets or Assumed
Liabilities and determined in accordance with GAAP, as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time. For the avoidance of doubt, and without limiting the
foregoing, (i) assets included in the calculation of Equity Value shall
include the amount of any vendor or manufacturer rebates earned by Seller
prior to the Effective Time but payable to Buyer thereafter and (ii)
liabilities included in the calculation

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 7  of Equity Value shall include those items required by this Agreement to be
reflected as liabilities, including pursuant to _Sections 2.3_ , _3.26_ , and
_6.7(c)_ and _6.8(g)_. 

(b) At least three Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller will
deliver to Parent a certificate (the " _Closing Certificate_ ") signed by the
Co-Managers of Seller, certifying on behalf of Seller the accuracy and
completeness of an unaudited statement of estimated Equity Value (the "
_Estimated Closing Statement_ "), which Estimated Closing Statement shall (i)
be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the absence of footnotes),
(ii) set forth Sellers good faith estimate of Equity Value, as derived from
the Estimated Closing Statement and (iii) specifically itemize all
outstanding Indebtedness. If requested by Parent, Seller will provide to
Parent copies of all relevant documentation used in the preparation of the
Closing Certificate and the Estimated Closing Statement. Sellers good faith
estimate of Equity Value included in the Closing Certificate shall be the "
_Estimated Equity Value_ ," unless Parent reasonably objects to such estimate,
in which case the Seller and Parent will mutually determine the Estimated
Equity Value before Closing.

(c) Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Parent will deliver to Seller an
unaudited statement (the " _Closing Statement_ ") setting forth Parents
determination of Equity Value (" _Closing Equity Value_ "). The Closing
Statement shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP (except for the absence
of footnotes). If Seller disagrees with the calculation of Closing Equity
Value, Seller shall, within 30 days after receipt of the Closing Statement,
deliver a notice (an " _Objection Notice_ ") to Parent setting forth Sellers
calculation of Closing Equity Value and the reasons for Sellers disagreement
with Parents calculation. If requested by Seller, Parent will provide to
Seller copies of all relevant documentation used in its calculation.
If Seller does not deliver the Objection Notice to Parent within 30 days
after receipt by Seller of the Closing Statement, the Closing Equity Value
will be conclusively presumed to be true and correct in all respects and will
be final and binding upon the parties. Seller and Parent will use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to resolve any disagreements as to
the computation of the Closing Equity Value, but if they do not obtain a final
resolution within 30 days after Parents receipt of the Objection Notice,
then all amounts remaining in dispute may be submitted to the Neutral Auditor;
_provided_ , _however_ , to the extent agreed upon by Seller and Parent, the
30-day period set forth in the immediately preceding sentence may be
extended. Parent and Seller will direct the Neutral Auditor to render a
determination within 45 days of its retention, and Parent and Seller will
cooperate with the Neutral Auditor during its engagement. The Neutral Auditor
will consider only those items and amounts set forth in the Objection Notice
that Parent and Seller are unable to resolve; _provided_ that each of Parent
and Seller shall be entitled to make a presentation to the Neutral Auditor
regarding the items and amounts that they are unable to resolve and neither
Parent nor Seller will meet or communicate separately with the Neutral
Auditor. In making its determination, the Neutral Auditor shall (i) be bound
by the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including the definition of
Equity Value, and (ii) not assign any value with respect to a disputed amount
that is greater than the highest value for such amount claimed by either
Seller or Parent or that is less than the lowest value for such amount
claimed by either Seller or Parent. The determination of the Neutral Auditor
will be conclusive and binding upon the parties. Seller shall pay a portion of
the fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor equal to 100% multiplied by
a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of disputed amounts
submitted to the Neutral Auditor that are resolved in favor of Parent (that
being the difference between the Neutral Auditors determination and Sellers
determination) and the denominator of which is the total amount of disputed
amounts submitted to the Neutral

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 8  Auditor (that being the sum total by which Parents determination and
Sellers determination differ from the determination of the Neutral Auditor).
Parent shall pay that portion of the fees and expenses of the Neutral Auditor
that Seller is not required to pay under this _Section 2.2(c)_.

(d) Within three Business Days following the final determination of Closing
Equity Value, (i) if the Estimated Equity Value is greater than the finally
determined Closing Equity Value, Seller shall pay Parent an amount equal to
the excess of the Estimated Equity Value over the finally determined Closing
Equity Value, or (ii) if the Estimated Equity Value is less than the finally
determined Closing Equity Value, Parent shall pay the amount of such
difference to Seller. If the Estimated Equity Value equals the finally
determined Closing Equity Value, no disbursement will be required. The
Purchase Price automatically will be adjusted to reflect any adjustment made
pursuant to this _Section 2.2(d)_. The parties intend that any amount
payable by Seller hereunder will be paid directly by the Seller, without
recourse to the Holdback Amount and, in the event the Seller fails to pay any
such amount and the Parent is required to seek recourse against the Holdback
Amount, the Seller shall promptly pay such amount to Parent in order to
replenish the Holdback Amount. The Seller Members shall be jointly and
severally responsible for the timely payment of any amounts due from Seller
under this _Section 2.2(d)_. 

(e) No interest shall accrue on any amounts payable under _Section 2.2(d)_.

 

2.3 _Closing Indebtedness_. The amount of Sellers Indebtedness as of the
Closing is the " _Closing Indebtedness_ " and shall be included as a
liability in the calculation of Equity Value. In no event will the Closing
Indebtedness exceed an amount that would cause the Closing Purchase Price to
be below zero.

 

2.4 _Earn-Out_.

 

(a) For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms have the meanings
given them below:

 

(i) " _Achievement Percentage_ " means, for any Earn-Out Period, the quotient
of (A) EBIT for such period divided by (B) the Performance Objective for such
period.

(ii) " _Earn-Out Payment_ " means, for any Earn-Out Period, (A) if the
Achievement Percentage for such period is at least 0.70, an amount equal to
(1) the Target Amount multiplied by (2) such Achievement Percentage; and (B)
if the Achievement Percentage is less than 0.70, zero (no Earn-Out Payment
shall be made for such period).

(iii) " _Earn-Out Period_ " means each of (A) the 2015 calendar year and (B)
the 2016 calendar year.

(iv) " _EBIT_ " means aggregate earnings (excluding interest income) of the
specific projects set forth on _Schedule 2.4(a)(iv)_ before deduction of
interest expenses and income Taxes, as determined in accordance with GAAP as
applied by Buyer.

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 9 (v) " _Performance Objective_ " means, for any Earn-Out Period, the EBIT
amount listed for such Earn-Out Period on _Schedule 2.4(a)(v)_.

(vi) " _Target Amount_ " means $3.0 million.

(b) On or before the 90th day following the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer (i) a copy of financial statements of Seller
relating to the period from January 1, 2015 to the Closing Date, which
financial statements shall be in accordance with GAAP applied in the
Ordinary Course of Business, (ii) a report of Sellers independent public
accounting firm confirming that such financial statements were reviewed or
audited by it, (iii) a statement of EBIT for the period from January 1, 2015
until the Closing Date, setting forth such calculations in reasonable detail
and (iv) a certificate executed each Co-Manager of Seller certifying that such
statement of EBIT is true and correct and in accordance with the applicable
terms of this Agreement. If requested by Buyer, Seller will provide Buyer
with access to its working papers and all other relevant documentation or
information used in preparing such financial statements and such statement of
EBIT and will reasonably consider any changes to such statement proposed by
Buyer (and, if such changes are agreed, shall issue a revised statement of
EBIT for such period). The Sellers calculation of EBIT pursuant to this
_Section 2.4(b)_ (as revised pursuant to the foregoing sentence, if
applicable, the " _Seller s Pre-Closing EBIT Calculation_") shall be
considered by Buyer in its preparation of the Earn-Out Statement for the 2015
calendar year, but shall not be binding upon Parent or Buyer (it being
understood that the entire Earn-Out Statement for such period, including the
portion of such period prior to the Closing, will be subject to the review and
dispute resolution procedures set forth in this _Section 2.4_).

 

(c) On or before the 90th day following the end of each Earn-Out Period (an "
_Earn-Out Payment Date_ "), Buyer shall prepare and deliver to Seller a
statement of the Achievement Percentage for that Earn-Out Period (the " _Earn-
Out Statement_ "), setting forth such calculations in reasonable detail. If
an Earn-Out Payment is due hereunder in respect of the Earn-Out Period, Buyer
shall pay the Earn-Out Payment to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds on the Earn-Out Payment Date (except as otherwise provided
in  _Section 10.7(b)_).

(d) Within 30 days after delivery of the Earn-Out Statement to Seller (during
which period Buyer shall provide access to such working papers and
information relating to the preparation of the Earn-Out Statement as may be
reasonably requested by Seller), Seller may dispute all or a portion of the
Earn-Out Statement by giving written notice (a " _Notice of Disagreement_ ")
to Buyer setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for any such dispute.
Buyer and Seller shall promptly commence good faith negotiations with a view
to resolving all such disputes; _provided_ ,  _that_ , no Notice of
Disagreement may include any objection to the calculation of EBIT for the
period from January 1, 2015 until the Closing Date if such calculation of EBIT
is equal to or greater than the Sellers Pre-Closing EBIT Calculation, nor
may any Notice of Disagreement propose any change that would result in a
calculation of EBIT for such period being greater than the Sellers Pre-
Closing EBIT Calculation. If Seller does not provide a Notice of Disagreement
to Buyer within such 30-day period, Seller shall be deemed to have
irrevocably accepted the Earn-Out Statement in the form delivered by Buyer.

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 10 (e) If Buyer and Seller do not resolve the dispute described in  _Section
2.4(d)_ (as evidenced by a written agreement between them) within 30 days
following delivery of the Notice of Disagreement, the dispute may be resolved
in accordance with the provisions of _Section 2.2(c)_, mutatis mutandis. If,
upon resolution of the dispute, additional consideration is due to Seller,
Buyer shall pay such amount, without interest, to Seller by wire transfer of
immediately available funds within five Business Days after such dispute
is resolved. If, upon resolution of the dispute, it is determined that the
Earn-Out Payment due is less than the Earn-Out Payment previously paid with
respect to the applicable Earn-Out Period, Seller shall pay to Buyer within
five Business Days after such dispute is resolved, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, an amount, without interest, equal to such
difference.

 

(f) In accordance with _Section 10.7_, Buyer may set off against any Earn-Out
Payment payable under this  _Section 2.4_ any unpaid amount owed by Seller
or any Seller Member to Buyer hereunder, including pursuant to _Section 2.2_
and _Article X_.

 

(g) Subsequent to the Closing, Parent and Buyer shall have sole discretion
with regard to all matters relating to the operation of the Business;
_provided_ , _however_ , that for the duration of the Earn-Out Periods, Parent
and Buyer covenant and agree that they shall maintain separate records for the
Business (to the extent necessary to calculate EBIT) and shall
not intentionally take any action for the purposes of reducing or avoiding
any Earn-Out Payment. Parent has no obligation to operate the Business in
order to achieve any Earn-Out Payment or to maximize the amount of any Earn-
Out Payment. In the event Buyer unilaterally elects to materially change the
operation of the Business after the Closing as it relates to the projects set
forth on _Schedule 2.4(a)(iv)_ and such change materially and adversely
affects the ability of the Business to achieve the Performance Objectives,
Buyer and Seller Members shall mutually agree on any commercially reasonable
modifications to the terms of _Section 2.4(a)_ appropriate in light of such
change, taking into account other circumstances including general market
conditions and actions of Seller Members. In addition, Buyer may adjust EBIT
or the Performance Objectives for material differences in accounting in order
to conform to the original basis of the presentation on _Schedule 2.4(a)(v)_.

2.5 _Holdback_.

 

(a) To secure the indemnification and other payment obligations of Seller and
the Seller Members under this Agreement, Buyer shall withhold from the
Purchase Price that would otherwise be payable at Closing an amount equal to
$750,000 (the " _Holdback Amount_ "). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer is not
required to segregate any monies from its general funds, to create any trust
or to make any special deposits with respect to the Holdback Amount.

(b) On the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to the
Seller an amount (if any) equal to (i) one-half of the Holdback Amount _minus_
(ii) the amount of all indemnification and other payment claims for which
Buyer was entitled to indemnification or payment under this Agreement as of
such date, _minus_ (iii) any the amount of all pending indemnification and
other payment claims as to which Buyers entitlement remains unresolved as of
such date (the " _Pending Claim Amounts_ "), _minus_ (iv) a reserve for Home
Warranty Obligations remaining as of such date, calculated by Seller in good
faith based upon the historical warranty costs of the Business (the " _Pending
Warranty Amounts_ ").

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 11 (c) On the second anniversary of the Closing Date, Buyer shall pay to the
Seller an amount (if any) equal to (i) the remaining portion of the Holdback
Amount _minus_ (ii) the amount of all indemnification and other payment claims
for which Buyer was entitled to indemnification or payment under this
Agreement as of such date, _minus_ (iii) any Pending Claim Amounts as of such
date, _minus_ (iv) the Pending Warranty Amounts as of such date.

 

(d) Any portion of the Holdback Amount otherwise payable but retained by Buyer
with respect to a Pending Claim Amount (less any portion to which Buyer was
entitled to indemnification or payment under this Agreement) shall be paid to
the Seller promptly, but in no event later than ten Business Days, following
the final disposition of such Pending Claim Amount. Any portion of the
Holdback Amount otherwise payable but retained by Buyer after the second
anniversary of the Closing Date with respect to the Pending Warranty Amounts
(less any portion to which Buyer was entitled to indemnification or payment
under this Agreement) shall be paid to the Seller promptly, but in no event
later than ten Business Days, following the final expiration of all Home
Warranty Obligations.

 

(e) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Agreement, the Holdback
Amount will be the first source of funds accessed by Parent or Buyer for the
indemnification obligations of the Seller and the Seller Members under
_Article X_ , but such Holdback Amount will not be the sole source of funds
for such obligations or the other obligations of the Seller, and Parent and
Buyer will remain entitled to the full amounts owed to them under this
Agreement (if any) should the Holdback Amount be insufficient or unavailable
to cover any amount so owed. No interest shall accrue on any amounts payable
under this  _Section 2.5_.

2.6 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the "
_Closing_ ") shall take place at 9:00 a.m. Eastern Time on (a) July 1, 2015,
(b) if the Closing cannot take place on such date because all of the
conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ shall not have been satisfied or waived
(other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), on the second
Business Day following the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions (other
than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the
Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver thereof), or (c) at such
other date and time as Parent and Seller may mutually agree. The date on which
the Closing occurs is referred to as the " _Closing Date_." The Closing will
be effective as of 12:01 a.m. prevailing local time on the Closing Date (the "
_Effective Time_"). The Closing shall be held at the Troutman Sanders LLP in
Charlotte, North Carolina, unless another place is agreed to by Parent and
Seller; _provided_ that, to the extent Parent and Seller so agree, documents
may be delivered and exchanged at the Closing by facsimile, PDF, or other
electronic means.

 

ARTICLE III

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF SELLER AND SELLER MEMBERS

 

Seller and Seller Members, jointly and severally (subject to _Section 10.6_),
represent and warrant to Parent and Buyer that the statements contained in
this _Article III_ are true and correct, except as specifically set forth
herein or in the correspondingly numbered section of the disclosure schedule
delivered by Seller to Parent and Buyer and dated as of the date of this

---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 12  all requisite limited liability company power and authority to own, lease,
and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business (including,
the Business) as now being conducted. Seller is duly qualified to do business
and, where applicable as a legal concept, is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties it
owns, operates or leases or the nature of its activities makes such
qualification necessary, except for such failures to be so qualified or in
good standing, individually or in the aggregate, that would not reasonably be
expected to have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. _Section 3.1_ of
the Seller Disclosure Letter contains a complete and accurate list of (a) the
jurisdictions in which Seller is qualified to do business as a foreign limited
liability company and (b) each fictitious or assumed name or "DBA" used
by the Business.

3.2 _Capitalization_.

 

(a) _Section 3.2_ of the Seller Disclosure Letter lists each member of Seller
and the membership interests held by each of them. Such membership interests
are the only membership or equity interests of Seller, and Seller Members are
the only record or beneficial owners of any membership or equity interest in
Seller.

 

(b) Except as set forth in this _Section 3.2_, (i) there are no equity
securities of any class of Seller, or any security exchangeable into or
exercisable for such equity securities, issued, reserved for issuance, or
outstanding and (ii) there are no options, warrants, equity securities, calls,
rights, commitments, or agreements of any character to which Seller or a
Seller Member is a party or by which Seller or a Seller Member is bound
obligating Seller or Seller Member to issue, exchange, transfer, deliver, or
sell, or cause to be issued, exchanged, transferred, delivered, or sold,
additional shares of capital stock or other equity interests of Seller or any
security or rights convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for any
such shares or other equity interests, or obligating Seller or Seller Member
to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting of, otherwise modify or amend or
enter into any such option, warrant, equity security, call, right, commitment,
or agreement. Seller does not have any outstanding unit appreciation rights,
restricted stock, restricted membership units, phantom stock, performance
based equity rights or similar equity rights or obligations. Neither Seller
nor any of its Affiliates is a party to or is bound by any agreements or
understandings with respect to the voting or sale or transfer of
any membership or equity interests of Seller.

3.3 _No Subsidiaries_. Seller does not own or control, directly or indirectly,
any interest in any Person, including any Subsidiary.

3.4 _Authority; No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_.

 

(a) Each of Seller and Seller Members has the requisite power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and each other document to be executed by
Seller or Seller Member in connection herewith (collectively, the " _Seller
Ancillary Documents_ ") and to perform its obligations hereunder and
thereunder, all of which have been duly authorized by all requisite action.
No further company or member action on the part of Seller or any Seller Member
is necessary to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and each Seller Ancillary Document by Seller and the Seller
Members and the consummation by Seller and Seller Members of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. This Agreement has been, and at Closing each
Seller Ancillary Document will be, duly executed and delivered by Seller and
each Seller Member (as applicable) and, assuming

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 13  that this Agreement and each Seller Ancillary Document is duly and validly
authorized, executed, and delivered by the other parties hereto and thereto,
constitutes, or will constitute (as applicable), a valid and binding
agreement of Seller and each Seller Member (as applicable), enforceable
against each of them in accordance with its terms, subject to any applicable
bankruptcy, reorganization, insolvency, moratorium, or other similar
Applicable Laws affecting creditors rights generally and principles governing
the availability of equitable remedies.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller and each Seller
Member do not, and the consummation by Seller and Seller Members of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement will not, (i) conflict with, or
result in any violation or breach of, any provision of the certificate of
formation or limited liability company agreement of Seller, (ii) conflict
with, or result in any violation or breach of, or constitute (with or without
notice or lapse of time, or both) a default (or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation or acceleration of any material obligation or loss
of any material benefit) under, require a consent or waiver under, require
the payment of a penalty under or result in the imposition of any mortgage,
security interest, pledge, lien, charge, restriction, restrictive covenant,
easement or encumbrance (" _Liens_ ") on Sellers or any Seller Members
assets under, any of the terms, conditions, or provisions of any Assigned
Contract or any other contract, agreement instrument, or obligation to which
Seller or any Seller Member is a party or by which Seller, any Seller Member
or any of their respective properties or assets may be bound, or (iii)
conflict with or violate any permit, concession, franchise, license, judgment,
injunction, order, decree, statute, law, ordinance, rule, or regulation
applicable to Seller, any Seller Member or any of their respective properties
or assets.

 

(c) No consent, approval, license, permit, order, or authorization of, or
registration, declaration, notice, or filing with, Governmental Authority is
required by or with respect to Seller or any Seller Member in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement by Seller and Seller Members or
the consummation by Seller and Seller Members of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

3.5 _Financial Statements; Indebtedness_. Seller has delivered or otherwise
made available to Parent (a) Sellers audited balance sheet as of each of
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 and the related financial statements for each
of the years then ended and (b) the unaudited balance sheet of Seller as of
April 30, 2015 (the " _Seller Balance Sheet_ ") and the related unaudited
statement of operations of Seller for the year then ended (all of the
foregoing financial statements of Seller and any notes thereto are hereinafter
collectively referred to as the " _Seller Financial Statements_ "). The
Seller Financial Statements fairly present, in all material respects, the
financial condition of Seller at the dates therein indicated and the results
of operations of Seller for the periods therein specified in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ "), in each
case, as applied in the Ordinary Course of Business, except that the unaudited
financial statements do not contain footnotes. The financial records of
Seller, all of which Seller has made available to Parent, are true, correct
and complete and represent actual, bona fide transactions and have been
maintained in accordance with sound business practices, including the
maintenance of an adequate system of internal controls. _Section 3.5_ of the
Seller Disclosure Letter lists all Indebtedness of Seller and specifies any
property affected by such Indebtedness. Seller is, and after giving effect to
the transactions contemplated hereby, will be Solvent. With respect to the
inventory of Seller shown on the face of the Seller Balance Sheet and Closing
Statement, (a) all of such inventory is merchantable and fit for the purpose
for which it was procured or produced, (b) all of such inventory other than

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 14  written off inventory, except to the extent of reserves shown on the face of
such balance sheet, consists of a quality and quantity usable and salable in
its Ordinary Course of Business, (c) none of such inventory is obsolete,
damaged or defective, and (d) the quantities of each item of such inventory
are not excessive and are reasonable in the present circumstances of the
Business.

Agreement, between December 31, 2014 and the date of this Agreement, the
Business of Seller has been conducted in the Ordinary Course of Business and
there has not occurred:

(a) any event that has had, or is reasonably expected to have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Seller Material Adverse Effect;

 

(b) any acquisition (i) by merging or consolidating with, or by purchasing all
or a substantial portion of the assets or any stock of, or by any other

respect of any membership or equity interest of Seller, (ii) any split,
combination, or reclassification of any of the membership interests of Seller
or issuance or authorization for the issuance of any other securities in
respect of, in lieu of, or in substitution for membership or equity interests
or any of its other securities, or (iii) any purchase, redemption, or other
acquisition of any membership or equity interests or any other of its
securities or any rights, warrants or options to acquire any such shares or
other securities;

(g) (i) the incurrence of any Indebtedness or any guarantee of any
Indebtedness of another Person (other than (A) in connection with the
financing of trade receivables in the Ordinary Course of Business, (B) letters
of credit or similar arrangements issued to or for the benefit of suppliers
and manufacturers in the Ordinary Course of Business and (C) pursuant to
existing credit facilities in the Ordinary Course of Business), (ii) any
issuance, sale or amendment of any debt securities or warrants or other rights
to acquire any debt securities of Seller, any guarantee of any
debt securities of another Person, any "keep well" or other agreement to
maintain any financial statement condition of another Person or any
arrangement having the economic effect of any of the foregoing, (iii) any
loans, advances, or capital contributions to, or investment in, any other
Person, other than Seller, (iv) any grant or imposition of any Lien on the
Purchased Assets other than a Permitted Lien, or (v) any

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 15  hedging agreement or other financial agreement or arrangement designed to
protect Seller against fluctuations in commodities prices or exchange rates;

 

(h) any expenditure or commitment in any way related to or affecting the
Business in an amount in excess of $10,000 (in any one case) or $25,000 (in
the aggregate), except in the Ordinary Course of Business;

(i) hiring or firing of any employees, independent contractors, or other
consultants, except to the extent in the Ordinary Course of Business
consistent with Sellers employment policies;

 

(j) enter into any non-compete, non-solicit or any other agreement under which
Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates, following the Effective Time, could
be restricted from engaging in any business, operating in any market, or
offering any product or services to customers or potential customers or any
class of customers;

 

(k) pay, discharge or satisfy, in an amount in excess of $10,000 (in any one

any way related to or affecting the Business (absolute, accrued, asserted or
unasserted, contingent or otherwise) except in the Ordinary Course of
Business;

 

(l) entry into or amendment of any arrangement or relationship of the type
described in _Section 3.22_ of this Agreement;

(m) termination, modification or amendment of any insurance policy or Business
Collateral outside the Ordinary Course of Business; or

(n) any action or failure to act by Seller that, if occurred after the date
hereof, would constitute a breach of _Section 5.1_.

summary of its terms, and Seller consents to such disclosures (and subsequent

make any press release or other public statement regarding this Agreement
without the prior consent of Parent. 

6.4 _Exclusivity_. Neither Seller nor any Seller Member will, directly or
indirectly, through any representative or otherwise (a) solicit, or entertain

throughout the period that begins at the Closing and ends on the third
anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Restricted Period_"), none of
Seller, the Seller Members and their Affiliates (collectively, the "
_Restricted Parties_ ") will, directly or indirectly, except in the course of

(i) engage in the Business in any market in greater Charlotte, North Carolina
area (including the Charlotte-Concord Combined Statistical Area)

     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 42 (b) __Exceptions__. The limitation in _Section 6.6(a)(ii)_ shall not
restrict owning or acquiring 5% or less of the outstanding securities of a
public company. In addition, the limitations in _Section 6.6(a)(i)_ and
_(ii)_ shall not restrict the activities described on _Schedule 6.6(b)_ ,
subject to strict compliance with the other provisions of this Agreement.

(c) __Right of First Offer/Right of First Refusal__. Throughout the
Restricted Period, if any Restricted Party, directly or indirectly, acquires,
owns, maintains, develops, sells or has an option or right to acquire any real
estate that may be suitable for residential real property land projects (the
" _Restricted Property_ "), then Parent shall have a right of first offer
and/or a right of first refusal (which may be exercised directly by Parent or
by an Affiliate designated by Parent) with respect to said Restricted
Property as follows:

(i) _Solicited Offers_. Prior to any Restricted Party soliciting offers on
or selling all or any portion of the Restricted Property, such Restricted
Party shall promptly provide written notice to Parent of the such Restricted
Partys intent to sell said Restricted Property (the " _ROFO Notice_ "), which
ROFO Notice shall specify the terms, conditions and purchase price upon which
such Restricted Party intends to market such Restricted Property. If Parent
desires to accept such offer, Parent shall, within fifteen Business Days after
its receipt of the ROFO Notice, give the applicable Restricted Party written
notice to such effect (the " _ROFO Acceptance Notice_ ").

 

(ii) _Unsolicited Offers_. If any Restricted Party otherwise receives an offer
to purchase all or any portion of the Restricted Property or otherwise
intends to sell all or any portion of the Restricted Property, in each case on
terms and conditions satisfactory to such Restricted Party, then such
Restricted Party shall promptly provide written notice to Parent of such
Restricted Partys intent to sell said Restricted Property (each, a " _ROFR
Notice_ "; the ROFO Notices and ROFR Notices, collectively, being the "
_ROFO/ROFR Notices_ "), which ROFR Notice shall specify the terms, conditions
and purchase price offered by the offeror. If Parent desires to accept such
offer, within fifteen Business Days after its receipt of the ROFR Notice,
Parent shall give the applicable Restricted Party written notice to such
effect (each, a " _ROFR Acceptance Notice_ " the ROFO Acceptance Notices and
ROFR Acceptance Notices, collectively, being the " _ROFO/ROFR Acceptance
Notices_ ").

 

(iii) _Procedures Following Acceptance by Parent_. In the event that Parent
gives a ROFO/ROFR Acceptance Notice within the specified time period, then
the applicable Restricted Party and Parent shall cooperate in good faith, to
enter into a purchase agreement within sixty days after the giving of such
ROFO/ROFR Acceptance Notice, such purchase agreement to be on the terms and
conditions set forth in the ROFO/ROFR Notice and otherwise substantially in
the form of the contracted attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " _ROFO/ROFR
Contract Form_ "), subject to such mutually agreed modifications as may be
reasonably necessary in light of the property, terms and structure of the
transaction.

(iv) _Procedures Following Non-Acceptance by Parent_. In the event that
Parent (a) notifies the applicable Restricted Party that it is not interested
in acquiring the Restricted Property subject to a ROFO/ROFR Notice or (b)
fails to provide a ROFO/ROFR Acceptance Notice within the applicable time
period, then such Restricted Parties shall be free to convey the Restricted
Property in the applicable

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 43  ROFO/ROFR Notice to any other person at a price no less than 95% of the
price set forth in the applicable ROFO/ROFR Notice on other terms and
conditions substantially the same as those set forth in the ROFO/ROFR Notice.
If, after such non-acceptance, (i) any Restricted Property included in the
original applicable ROFO/ROFR Notice is not under contract to sell to a third
party within six months after delivery of such ROFO/ROFR Notice and the
Restricted Party persists in its desire to sell same, or (ii) the Restricted
Party desires to sell any portion of the Restricted Property included in the
original applicable ROFO/ROFR Notice at a price that is less than 95% of the
price set forth in such original ROFO/ROFR Notice or on other terms and
conditions that are not substantially the same as those set forth in such
original ROFO/ROFR Notice, then such Restricted Party shall provide Parent
with an additional ROFR Notice or ROFO Notice, as applicable, with respect to
such Restricted Property and otherwise comply once again with the foregoing
provisions in the same manner as provided in this _Section 6.6(c)_;
_provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to prospective sales following a
ROFO Notice or ROFR Notice delivered pursuant to this _Section 6.6(c)(iv)_,
Parent shall deliver its ROFO/ROFR Acceptance Notice to such second ROFO/ROFR
Notice within five Business Days after receipt thereof.

(v) _Restricted Property_. The provisions of this _Section 6.6(c)_ shall
apply independently to real property that is reasonably distinguishable (by
virtue of its condition, state of development, subdivision, bundling with
other real estate, or other factors) from other real property, notwithstanding
the fact that the land included in such real properties may overlap or be
identical, and each distinguishable real property shall be considered a
distinct Restricted Property. For example, buildable lots within a residential
community shall be distinct Restricted Property from subdivided but
undeveloped lots and from the original raw land, and any proposed sale of such
buildable lots will be independently subject to the provisions of this
_Section 6.6(c)_ notwithstanding the fact that such real property may
previously have been subject to the provisions of this _Section 6.6(c)_ as
raw land and as subdivided undeveloped lots. For the avoidance of doubt, the
real property relating to Sellers "Palisades" project (other than
developed multi-family projects not otherwise constituting Restricted
Property) and the real property received in the exchange transaction
contemplated by _Section 7.2_ shall be Restricted Property subject to this
_Section 6.6(c)_.

 

(d) __Equitable Relief__. Seller specifically acknowledges and agrees that (i)
this _Section 6.6_ and similar provisions set forth in the Employment
Agreement and any other Seller Ancillary Document are reasonable and necessary
to ensure that Parent and Buyer receive the expected benefits of acquiring the
Business; (ii) Parent and Buyer have refused to enter into this Agreement in
the absence of such provisions; and (iii) breach of such provisions will harm
Parent and Buyer to such an extent that monetary damages alone would be an
inadequate remedy and Parent and Buyer would not have an adequate remedy at
law. Therefore, in the event of a breach by Seller or any Seller Member of
this _Section 6.6_, the Employment Agreement and any other Seller Ancillary
Document, (A) Parent and Buyer (in addition to all other remedies Parent and
Buyer may have) will be entitled to seek an injunction and other equitable
relief (without posting any bond or other security) restraining Seller from
committing or continuing such breach and to enforce specifically
this Agreement and its terms and (B) the duration of the Restricted Period
will be extended with respect to

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 44  Seller and any breaching Seller Member beyond its then-scheduled termination
date for a period equal to the duration of such breach.

 

6.7 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Seller shall afford Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates (including Avatar
Properties, Inc.) a reasonable opportunity to interview Sellers employees
for prospective employment by Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates if so
requested by Parent, and shall not attempt to retain in Sellers employ any
such employees whom Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates desires to hire, or to
otherwise interfere with Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates discussions with
such employees. Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates shall be entitled (but shall
have no obligation) to offer employment to any such person, on terms
and conditions established by Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates, to be
effective on such date as selected by Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates in
their discretion. Seller will furnish to Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates
such information in its personnel files as Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates
may reasonably request in connection with determining whether to offer
employment to any person presently employed by Seller in the Business. Seller
will use its commercially reasonable efforts to assist Parent, Buyer or their
Affiliates in ensuring that all such employees who receive an offer of
employment from Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates accept such offer on the
terms and conditions offered by Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates.
Such efforts by Seller shall include immediately informing Parent if Seller
learns that any such employee is contemplating declining Parent, Buyer or
their Affiliates employment offer and encouraging any such employee to accept
Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates employment offer, as applicable. Parent,
Buyer or their Affiliates may refrain from offering employment to any person
for any reason.

 

(b) Effective immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall terminate
the employment of each person who is employed by Seller in the conduct of the
Business and who receives an offer of employment by Parent, Buyer or their
Affiliates effective as of the Closing Date. Each such person who accepts such
employment is (whether effective at or after the Closing) referred to as a "
_Transferred Employee_." Except as set forth in an Employment Agreement or
other employment agreement duly executed by the applicable employer, such
employment shall be "at will."

 

(c) Accrued vacation and other paid time off for the Transferred Employees
will not be paid to such Transferred Employees but shall instead be reflected
as a liability in the calculation of Equity Value and, to the extent so
reflected, shall be credited by Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates as a
rollover of such accrued paid time off and vacation for such
Transferred Employees. Seller shall fully reserve on the Estimated Closing
Statement all amounts for accrued vacation and other paid time off for
Sellers employees.

 

(d) Seller shall be responsible for all liabilities and obligations relating
to or arising out of the employment, engagement, remuneration, or cessation
of employment with Seller of the Transferred Employees (and the dependents of
such Transferred Employees), including with respect to all periods prior to
and including each such employees last day of employment with Seller, except
for accrued vacation and other paid time off that is included as a liability
in the calculation of Equity Value in accordance with _Section 6.7(c)_.
Seller shall pay each Transferred Employee all accrued wages,
salary, commission (except for ordinary course commissions not yet due or
payable with respect to Retail Sales Contracts closing

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 45  after the Closing, set forth on _Section 3.26_ of the Seller Disclosure
Letter), bonus, and other employee compensation and benefits (except for
accrued vacation and other paid time off that is included as a liability in
the calculation of Equity Value in accordance with _Section 6.7(c)_) related
to employment with Seller for all periods through the date of termination of
each such employees employment with Seller in a timely fashion and not later
than the date such payment is required by law or the provisions of any benefit
plan or contract under which such compensation is or becomes duly payable. In
addition, for each Transferred Employee, Seller shall pay or provide for all
Employee Benefit Plans and other employee benefits maintained by Seller for

(e) Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates shall cause employee benefits to be made
available to each Transferred Employee eligible to participate in accordance
with the terms of Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates employee benefit plans,
as applicable; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may elect to instead
continue certain employee benefit plans provided under third party contracts
and, in such case, Seller will cooperate to effect the transfer of such third
party contracts. Service with Seller prior to the Closing Date will generally
be recognized as if it had been service with Parent, Buyer or
their Affiliates, as applicable, for purposes of determining eligibility for
Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates insured medical, dental, life insurance,
and other insured welfare benefit plans, and for purposes of determining
eligibility and the amount of vacation or paid time off under Parent, Buyer
or their Affiliates vacation or paid time off policies (in each case subject
to Applicable Laws and the terms of such plans and policies), but will not be
recognized for any other purposes under these plans or for any purposes under
any of Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates other benefit plans, programs,
policies, or arrangements.

 

(f) Seller and Parent shall cooperate in good faith to identify any potential
plant closing, mass layoff, reduction in force, or other similar event
requiring notice pursuant to the WARN Act or any similar state or local
regulation, with respect to the employees of the Business in connection with
the consummation of the transactions on the Closing Date. Parent shall
have the opportunity to review and approve any notice or employee
communication or other communication provided under this section. Seller shall
comply with the notice requirements and all other provisions of the WARN Act
and any similar state or local regulation with respect to any event occurring
at or prior to the Closing and with respect to any employees of the Business
who are not hired by Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates, whether such event
occurs prior, at, or after the Closing, and shall be responsible for all
liabilities and obligations in connection therewith, including any claims or
demands arising from Parent, Buyer or their Affiliates review of Sellers
employees and their decision not to offer employment to an employee, and any
severance amounts to which employees may be entitled to under any severance
pay plan of Seller in effect on the Closing Date.

 

(g) For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall remain responsible for
liabilities, including payment of all wages, salary, commission, bonus,
vacation and other paid time off, and other employee compensation and benefits
for all periods, with respect to employees of Seller who do not become
Transferred Employees, and shall satisfy all obligations imposed by
Applicable Law (including COBRA) relating to health and other benefit
continuation privileges of any employee or former employee (or dependent of
such an employee) of Seller, whether terminated by Seller incident to the
Closing or otherwise.

(a) For a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the second
anniversary thereof, Buyer will provide warranty administration service, on
behalf of and at the sole cost and expense of Seller, with respect to Sellers
Home Warranty Obligations to customers who closed on purchases of Housing
Units from Seller on or prior to the Closing Date. Buyers obligations under
this _Section 6.8_ are limited to receiving and processing requests from such
customers for warranty service pursuant to the Home Warranty Obligations and
coordinating the delivery of warranty service for the account of Seller in
accordance with this _Section 6.8_.

(b) The Home Warranty Obligations remain liabilities of the Seller, and in no
event shall any of Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates have any
responsibility or liability for the Home Warranty Obligations (except as
expressly set forth in this _Section 6.8(b)_ with respect to the
warranty reserve and Warranty Threshold). The costs of satisfying any Home
Warranty Obligations shall be satisfied by recourse to, in order, (i) any
applicable insurance policy purchased by Seller, then (ii) any warranties
provided by third party contracts, then (iii) the warranty reserve existing
on the balance sheet of Seller as of the Closing Date, to the extent reflected
as a liability in the final calculation of Equity Value, then (iv) subject to
the Warranty Threshold, (A) the Holdback Amount, then (B) an offset against
any earned but unpaid Earn-Out Payment, then (C) by Seller or the Seller
Members. Buyer may not recover the costs of satisfying any Home Warranty
Obligations pursuant to the foregoing clause _(iv)_ until the aggregate
amount of such costs exceeds $150,000 (the " _Warranty Threshold_ ") , at
which time Buyer may recover all of such costs pursuant to the foregoing
clause _(iv)_ (including those equal to or less than the Warranty
Threshold).

(c) Parent, Buyer and their Affiliates shall be entitled to
prompt reimbursement from Seller of all costs and expenses incurred by any of
them in connection with the provision of warranty administration services,
including a reasonable allocation of their overhead expenses, out-of-pocket
costs and expenses of collecting insurance proceeds and/or enforcing
warranties under third party contracts, all costs and expenses incurred for
any repair or service work, and any payments made to satisfy Home Warranty
Obligations. Except as set forth in this  _Section 6.8(c)_, but without
limiting _Section 6.8(b)_, Buyer will receive no compensation for the
provision of warranty administration service pursuant to this _Section 6.8_.

 

(d) Seller and Seller Members will cooperate with Buyer in connection with the
efficient delivery of warranty administration services, including making
available all Records with respect to the Home Warranty Obligations and any
potential defects.

 

(e) Buyer shall perform the warranty administration services in a manner and
at a level of service generally consistent with the provision of such
services by Seller in connection with the conduct of the Business immediately
prior to the Closing Date. Buyer makes no representations and warranties of
any kind, implied or expressed, with respect to the warranty administration
services, including no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a
particular purpose, which are specifically disclaimed.

 

(f) The services to be provided by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ are
those of an independent contractor and nothing contained herein shall be
construed as creating a

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 47  partnership, joint venture, agency, trust or other association of any kind,
each party being individually responsible only for its obligations as set
forth in this Agreement. Nothing herein shall be deemed to constitute an
employment relationship between Seller and the employees of Buyer engaged in
providing the warranty administration services.

 

(g) The calculation of Equity Value shall include as a liability an
appropriate accrual, consistent with industry practice and the historical
claims experience of Seller, adequately reflecting the amount of the Home
Warranty Obligations.

6.9 _Substitution of Collateral_. For and at the Closing, or promptly
thereafter, Buyer will use its commercially reasonable efforts to secure the
unconditional release and, as appropriate, return to Seller any Business
Collateral, in each case to the extent pertaining to any of the Purchased
Assets or Assumed Liabilities, but not meaning any such collateral that is a
Purchased Asset).

6.10  _Name Change_. As soon as practicable, but in any event within five
Business Days after the Closing, Seller will, and, if applicable, will cause
each of its Affiliates to (a) amend its articles of organization, and take all
other actions necessary, to change its name and all names under which it does
business to a name that does not include the words "Bonterra" and that does
not otherwise imply any affiliation with Parent, Buyer or any of their
respective Affiliates, and (b) give to Buyer a true, correct and complete
copy of the filings with the applicable Governmental Authorities showing that
such name changes occurred. Buyer may change its name after the Closing to
"Bonterra Builders, LLC" or to otherwise include the words "Bonterra" in
Buyers name, and Seller will and, if applicable, will cause each of its
Affiliates to, execute and deliver any written consent or other documentation
that may be required by the North Carolina Secretary of State or other
Governmental Authority to facilitate such name change by Buyer. Neither Seller
nor any Seller Member (except in a Seller Members capacity as an employee of
an Affiliate of Parent) will use a name after the date hereof that includes
the word "Bonterra" or that otherwise implies any affiliation with Parent,
Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates, including on letterhead or other
correspondence, employee business cards, accounts or signage.

6.11 _Home Design Plans_. Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain, from each Person who contributed to the creation or development of,
or otherwise has any rights to, any of the Purchased Intellectual Property
(including architectural, building, and engineering designs, drawings,
specifications, plans used by Seller), documentation, in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, confirming the rights of Seller (and, after
the Closing, the Buyer) to use such Intellectual Property. This _Section
6.11_ shall not be construed as limiting any of Sellers representations,
warranties or covenants hereunder, or the remedies of Parent and Buyer with
respect thereto.

6.12 _Construction Management_. Effective following the Closing, Seller
hereby engages Buyer as construction manager to construct (or complete
construction of) a Housing Unit on the Replacement Home Property, all for the

  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 48 6.14 _Consent of Seller Members_. By execution of this Agreement, each Seller
Member hereby consents and agrees to the entry by Seller and Seller Members
into this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Documents and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Each Seller Member further
waives any other come-along and tag-along rights, all rights of co-sale and
redemption, all rights of first refusal, purchase rights and options to
purchase, all consent or notice rights and other similar rights arising under
the Amended and Restated Operating Agreement of Seller or otherwise in
connection with this Agreement and the Seller Ancillary Documents and
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

 

6.15 _Further Assurances_. Following the Closing, each of the parties hereto
shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver
such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances and take
such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions
hereof and give effect to this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

ARTICLE VII

 

TAX MATTERS

7.1  _Property Taxes; Transfer Taxes_.

(a) In the case of real property Taxes, personal property Taxes, and
special assessments relating to the Purchased Assets, Seller shall pay, on or
prior to the Closing Date, all such taxes and installments of special
assessments payable with respect to any year prior to the year of Closing.
Taxes for the year of Closing shall be pro-rated. Real estate Taxes and
personal property Taxes for the year of Closing shall be prorated on the
following basis: (i) if a Tax bill for the year of Closing is available, then
proration shall be based upon the current bill; (ii) if the assessment for
the year is available, but not the actual Tax bill, then proration shall be
based upon the assessment; or (iii) if neither the assessment for the year nor
the Tax bill is available, then proration shall be based upon the prior
years Tax bill. If Tax statements for any Purchased Assets are sent directly
to Seller by a Tax authority or other Governmental Authority after the Closing
Date, Seller shall cause such statements to be forwarded promptly to Buyer.
Certified municipal non ad valorem liens and pending municipal liens for which
work has been substantially completed as of the Closing shall be paid by the
Seller and any other pending liens shall be assumed by the Buyer, provided
that if any such non ad valorem assessment liens relate to special taxing
districts for municipal services that are payable in installments, then the
Seller shall only be responsible for the installment currently payable which
shall be prorated in the same manner as taxes. At the Closing, the foregoing
items shall be prorated and adjusted as indicated. If subsequent to the
Closing Taxes for the year of Closing are determined to be higher or lower
than as prorated, a reproration and adjustment will be made at the request of
Buyer or Seller upon presentation of actual tax bills, and any payment
required as a result of the reproration shall be made within 10 Business Days
following demand therefor. This provision shall survive the Closing.

 

(b) Seller shall pay all transfer, documentary, conveyancing, or similar
Taxes, charges or expenses (including transfer fees, capital contributions,
capital improvement fees and other fees or charges payable under CCRs, whether
payable to Associations or otherwise) and all recording fees that may be
imposed as a result of the sale and transfer of the Real Property under this
Agreement (collectively, " _Real Estate Transfer Taxes_ "). Buyer and Seller
shall jointly agree on the valuation of the Real Property to the extent that
valuations are

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 49  needed for purposes of determining the amount of Real Estate Transfer Taxes
prior to the Closing. If a party disagrees with respect to a proposed
valuation, the parties shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the issue
prior to the Closing. If payment of a Real Estate Transfer Tax is due prior to
any such resolution, payment shall be made based on Sellers valuation and,
upon resolution, Seller shall make such corrective filings with the
appropriate Governmental Authority and shall pay any additional, and shall be
entitled to any refund of, any Real Estate Transfer Tax resulting from such
corrective filings. The Seller shall remain ultimately responsible for the
valuation of the Real Property used in the Real Estate Transfer Tax filings,
and shall ensure that such valuation complies with Applicable Laws relating
thereto. For the avoidance of doubt, such valuations are solely for the
purposes of determining the amount of Real Estate Transfer Taxes, and none of
Parent, Buyer or any of their affiliates shall be bound by such valuations for
any purpose.

 

(c) Seller shall pay all sales, use, value-added, business, goods and
services, transfer, documentary, conveyancing or similar Taxes, charges or
expenses and all recording fees that may be imposed as a result of the sale
and transfer of the Business or the Assets to Buyer under this Agreement,
other than the Real Estate Transfer Taxes. Seller will prepare, subject
to Parents reasonable approval (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed), and timely file all Tax Returns required to be filed in
respect of such Taxes, provided that Parent may elect to prepare and file any
such Tax Returns that are the primary responsibility of Buyer under
Applicable Laws. Parents preparation of any such Tax Returns will be subject
to Sellers reasonable approval, which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Seller and Parent will reasonably cooperate with each
other to share information reasonably necessary for the preparation of those
Tax Returns and any Tax clearance certificates that either Seller or Parent
may request.

 

7.2 _1031 Exchange_. Buyer acknowledges that Seller intends to perform a tax-
deferred exchange transaction pursuant to Tax Code Section 1031 the Treasury
Regulations thereunder with respect to certain of the Purchased Assets.
_Schedule 7.2_ lists the properties that Seller intends to include in such
exchange transaction and the portion of the aggregate Purchase Price that
Seller has assigned to such properties for such purposes (it being understood
that none of Parent, Buyer or any of their affiliates shall be bound by such
valuations for any purpose). Seller requests Buyers reasonable cooperation
in such exchange transaction and agrees to hold Buyer harmless from any and
all Damages relating thereto. Buyer consents to the assignment of the portion
of the Purchase Price relating to such exchange transaction, as set forth on
_Schedule 7.2_ , to Sellers qualified intermediary and will deliver such
portion of the Purchase Price to Sellers qualified intermediary in accordance
with wire instructions provided by Seller. Notwithstanding such assignment,
Seller shall remain liable for performance of all its obligations hereunder.

7.3 _Income and Franchise Taxes_. Nothing in this Agreement makes a party
liable for the income or franchise Taxes of the other party.

9.3 _Termination Fee_. If Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to
_Section 9.1(b)_ and the failure of the Closing to occur prior to such
termination is solely as a result of the failure of Parent to obtain the
Financing (such that only the condition set forth in _Section 8.2(k)_ is not
satisfied or waived), then the parties agree that Seller shall have suffered
a loss of an incalculable nature and amount, unrecoverable in law, and Buyer
shall pay to Seller a fee of $1,000,000.00 (the " _Buyer Termination Fee_ "),
it being understood that in no event shall Buyer be required to pay the Buyer
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. The Buyer Termination Fee shall be
payable in immediately available funds by wire transfer no later than 10
Business Days after such termination. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, Sellers right to receive payment of the Buyer Termination
Fee pursuant to this _Section 9.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Seller, Seller Members or any of their Affiliates against Buyer or any of
its Affiliates or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members or
representatives for any and all losses that may be suffered based upon,
resulting from or arising out of the circumstances giving rise to such
termination, and upon payment of the Buyer Termination Fee in accordance with
this _Section 9.3_, none of the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or any of
their respective stockholders, partners, members or Representatives shall have
any further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

9.4 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as set forth in _Section 7.1_, all fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party incurring such fees and
expenses, whether or not the transactions contemplated by this Agreement are
consummated. For the avoidance of doubt, any transaction commission due to
Builder Advisory Group or Tony Avila will be borne by Seller or Seller Members
and not Parent or Buyer.

writing signed on behalf of Parent, Buyer and Seller.

9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the parties
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other parties hereto, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, and (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to
any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such party. Such extension or waiver shall not
be deemed to apply to any time for performance, inaccuracy in any
representation or warranty, or noncompliance with any agreement or condition,
as the case may be, other than that which is specified in the extension or
waiver. The failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights
under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such
rights.

10.3 _Claims for Indemnification_.

 

(a) __Procedure for Claims__. A Person entitled to indemnification under this
_Article X_ (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") wishing to assert a claim for
indemnification under this _Article X_ (a " _Claim_ ") shall deliver to the
Person from whom indemnification is sought (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") a
written notice (a " _Claim Notice_ ") that (i) states in reasonable detail the
facts constituting the basis for the Damages claimed, (ii) states the amount
(the " _Claim Amount_ ") of any Damages claimed by the Indemnified Party, to
the extent then known, (iii) states that the Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under this _Article X_ and set forth a reasonable explanation
of the basis therefor, and (iv) includes a demand for payment in the amount
of such Damages. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim Notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall deliver to the Indemnified Party a written response
in which the Indemnifying Party shall (A) agree that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to receive all of the Claim Amount, (B) agree that the Indemnified
Party is entitled to receive part, but not all, of the Claim Amount, or (C)
contest that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the Claim
Amount. If the Indemnifying Party in such response contests the payment of
all or part of the Claim Amount, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified
Party shall use good faith efforts to resolve such dispute. If such dispute is
not resolved within 60 days following the delivery by the Indemnifying Party
of such response, the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall each
have the right to submit such dispute to a court of competent jurisdiction in
accordance with the provisions of  _Section 11.10_.

(b) __Third-Party Claims__. All claims for indemnification made under this
Agreement resulting from, related to, or arising out of a third-party claim
shall be subject to the following additional procedures and provisions. An
Indemnified Party shall give prompt written notification to the Indemnifying
Party of the commencement of any action, suit, or proceeding relating to a
third-party claim for which indemnification may be sought or, if earlier, upon
the assertion of any such claim or demand by a third party. Such notification
shall (i) state in reasonable detail (to the extent known by the Indemnified
Party) the facts constituting the basis for such third-party claim, (ii) state
the sections of this Agreement with respect to which indemnification is being
claimed for such Damages and that the Indemnified Party if entitled to
indemnification under this _Article X_ , and (iii) state the amount of the
Damage being claimed. Within 30 days after delivery of such notification, the
Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice thereof to the Indemnified Party,
assume control of the defense of such action, suit, proceeding, or claim with
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party; provided that the
Indemnifying Party may not assume control of the defense of any action, suit,
proceeding, or claim that seeks non-monetary relief or criminal penalties. If
the Indemnifying Party does not assume control of such defense, the
Indemnified Party shall control such defense. The party not controlling such
defense may participate therein at its own expense; provided that if the
Indemnifying Party assumes control of such defense and the Indemnified Party
reasonably concludes, based on advice from counsel, that the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party have conflicting interests with respect to
such action, suit, proceeding, or claim, the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel to the Indemnified Party solely in connection therewith shall be

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 58  considered Damages for purposes of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that in no event shall the Indemnifying Party be responsible for the fees and
expenses of more than one additional counsel for all Indemnified Parties. The
party controlling such defense shall (A) keep the other party advised of the
status of such action, suit, proceeding, or claim and the defense thereof, (B)
provide the other party with reasonable access to all relevant information
and documentation relating to the claim and the prosecution or defense
thereof, and (C) consider recommendations made by the other party with respect
thereto. The Indemnified Party shall not agree to any settlement of such
action, suit, proceeding or claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not agree to any settlement
of such action, suit, proceeding or claim that does not include a complete
release of the Indemnified Party from all liability with respect thereto or
that imposes any liability or obligation on the Indemnified Party without the
prior written consent of the Indemnified Party.

 

(c) __Treatment of Indemnity Payments_. _All indemnity payments made under
this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the
Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law.

10.4 _Survival_.

 

(a) The representations and warranties of Seller, Seller Members, Parent, and
Buyer set forth in this Agreement (other than Fundamental Representations)
shall survive the Closing and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby and continue until the second anniversary of the Closing
Date (the " _Survival Date_ "), at which time they shall expire.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, all
Fundamental Representations shall survive until the date that is 60 days
following the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect
to the subject matter thereof.

 

(c) The covenants and other agreements of each party set forth in this
Agreement will remain in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms.

(d) If an indemnification claim under _Section 10.1_ or 10.2, as the case may
be, is properly asserted under _Section 10.3_ prior to the Survival Date or
other applicable survival date, then the related representation and warranty,
covenant or agreement shall survive until, but only for the purpose of, the
resolution of such claim.

10.5 _Limitations and Other Terms_.

 

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the aggregate
liability of Seller and Seller Members for Damages under _Section 10.1(a)_
shall not exceed $8 million (the " _Cap_ "), and (ii) Seller and Seller
Members shall not be liable under _Section 10.1(a)_ unless and until the
aggregate Damages for all claims under such section equal or exceed an amount
equal to $150,000 in the aggregate (the " _Threshold_ "), at which time Seller
and Seller Members shall be liable for all such Damages (including those equal
to or less than the Threshold);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the
limitations set forth in this _Section 10.5(a)_ shall not apply to a claim
arising out of a breach of a Fundamental Representation or any representation
that was fraudulently made.

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 59 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) the
aggregate liability of Parent for Damages under _Section 10.2(a)_ shall not
exceed the Cap, and (ii) Parent shall not be liable under _Section 10.2(a)_
unless and until the aggregate Damages for all claims under such section equal
or exceed Threshold, at which time Parent shall be liable for all such
Damages (including those equal to or less than the Threshold); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the limitations set forth in this _Section 10.5(b)_ shall
not apply to a claim arising out of a breach of a Fundamental Representation
or any representation that was fraudulently made.

(c) For purposes of this _Article X_ , the representations and warranties of
each of Seller, Parent, and Buyer in this Agreement (other than _Section
3.6(a)_) and in any certificate delivered pursuant hereto shall be deemed not
to include any Materiality Qualifiers.

(d) No right or obligation under this _Article X_ will be waived or otherwise
affected by any knowledge (of any form or type) of Parent or Buyer or by any
investigation, due diligence, or verification by or on behalf of Parent or
Buyer. All representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements herein will
be deemed material and relied upon by each party, and none will be waived by
any failure to pursue any action or by consummation of the transactions
contemplated herein.

 

(e) Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

 

(f) Except with respect to claims for equitable relief and except with respect
to claims of fraud, the rights of the Indemnified Parties under this _Article
X_ shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of the Indemnified Parties and
their respective Affiliates for a breach of this Agreement from and after the
Effective Time.

 

10.6 _Allocation of Liability Among Seller Members_.

 

(a) __Allocation of Liability Among Seller Members__. Seller shall be liable
for the full amount of any indemnification obligations under this _Article
X_. The individual liability of any Seller Member for any Claim under this
_Article X_ shall be limited to such Seller Members Pro Rata Portion thereof,
unless such Claim arises from (i) a breach of a representation or warranty
relating specifically to such Seller Member or (ii) a failure by such Seller
Member to perform any covenant or agreement applicable to him (an "
_Individual Claim_ ").

 

(b) __Contribution__. If any Seller Member pays (or becomes obligated to pay)
any indemnification under this  _Article X_ (other than an Individual Claim)
and such payment is not paid (or is not allocated to be paid) by all Seller
Members in proportion to each Seller Members Pro Rata Portion thereof, then
each Seller that paid (or was allocated) less than such Seller Members Pro
Rata Portion promptly will contribute immediately available funds to each
Seller Member that paid (or was allocated) more than its Pro Rata Portion such
that, after making such contribution payments, each Seller Member will have
paid its Pro Rata Portion of such indemnification. This _Section 10.6(b)_
contains covenants and agreements by and among Seller Members only. Buyer will
have no right or liability under or in connection with this  _Section
10.6(b)_.

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 60 10.7 _Set-Off; First Recourse to Holdback Amount and Earn-Out Payment_.

 

(a) Parent and Buyer will have the right to set off and retain any unpaid
amount owed by Seller or any Seller Member to Parent or Buyer under this
Agreement or otherwise, including pursuant to _Section 2.2_, _Section 6.8_
and _Article X_ , against any amount payable by Parent or Buyer to Seller or
such Seller Member, including the Holdback Amount and any Earn-Out Payments.
The exercise of or failure to exercise such right of set off will not
constitute an election of remedies or limit in any manner the enforcement of
any other remedy that may be available to Parent or Buyer.

 

(b) The Holdback Amount and the Earn-Out Payment shall be Parent and Buyers
primary, but non-exclusive, sources of recovery for any indemnification
claims for which Parent or Buyer may be entitled to payment under this
_Article X_. Accordingly, before seeking recourse directly from Seller or the
Seller Members for any monetary claim for indemnification under this _Article
X_ , Parent and Buyer shall seek to satisfy such claim (i) first, by recourse
to the Holdback Amount, then (ii) if and to the extent any Earn-Out Payment
has been earned and is payable by Buyer pursuant to  _Section 2.4_ at the
time of the final determination of such claim, by a dollar-for-dollar offset
against such Earn-Out Payment. As a consequence of the foregoing, upon
delivery of a Claim Notice by Parent or Buyer to Seller, Buyers obligations
to pay any portion of the Holdback Amount and any Earn-Out Payment shall be
suspended to the extent (but only to the extent) of the amount specified in
such Claim Notice until the matter set forth in the Claim Notice is fully
resolved. No interest will accrue on the Holdback Amount or the Earn-Out
Payment during this period or at any other time.

---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 62 11.2 _Entire Agreement_ . This Agreement (including the schedules and exhibits
hereto and the documents and instruments referred to herein that are to be
delivered at the Closing) constitutes the entire agreement among the parties
to this Agreement and supersedes any prior understandings, agreements or
representations by or among the parties hereto, or any of them, written or
oral, with respect to the subject matter hereof; provided that the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms.

 

11.3 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. Except as provided in _Article X_ , this
Agreement is not intended, and shall not be deemed, to confer any rights or
remedies upon any Person other than the parties hereto and their respective
successors and permitted assigns or to otherwise create any third-party
beneficiary hereto.

 

11.4 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations under this Agreement may be assigned or delegated, in whole or in
part, by operation of law or otherwise by any of the parties hereto without
the prior written consent of the other parties, and any such assignment
without such prior written consent shall be null and void; _provided_ , 
_however_ , Buyer may assign all of its rights, interests and obligations to
Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent without any such consent. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns.

11.5 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect the
validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or the
validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a court of
competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is invalid
or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that
comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable
term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified. In
the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it in the prior
sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or unenforceable
term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or provision that will
achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of
such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

11.6 _Counterparts and Signature_. This Agreement may be executed in two or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original but all of which
together shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when counterparts have been signed by each of the parties hereto and
delivered to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need
not sign the same counterpart. The exchange of copies of this Agreement and
the signature pages by facsimile transmission or other electronic means shall
constitute effective execution and delivery of this Agreement as to the
parties and may be used in lieu of the original Agreement for all purposes.
Signatures of the parties transmitted by facsimile or other electronic means
shall be deemed to be their original signatures for all purposes.

 

11.7 _Interpretation_. When reference is made in this Agreement to an Article
or a Section, such reference shall be to an Article or Section of this
Agreement, unless otherwise indicated. Whenever the words "herein,"
"hereunder," "hereby" and similar words are used in this Agreement, they refer
to this Agreement as a whole (and not to the particular sentence, paragraph
or Section

 



     |  | 
---|---|--- 
  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 63  where they appear). The table of contents, table of defined terms and
headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only and
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.
The language used in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the language chosen
by the parties hereto to express their mutual intent, and no rule of strict
construction shall be applied against any party. Whenever the context may
require, any pronouns used in this Agreement shall include the corresponding
masculine, feminine or neuter forms, and the singular form of nouns and
pronouns shall include the plural, and vice versa. Any reference to any
Applicable Law means such Applicable Law as amended, modified, codified,
replaced or reenacted, in whole or in part, and as in effect from time to
time, and shall be deemed also to refer to all rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, unless the context requires otherwise. Unless
expressly stated herein to the contrary, reference in this Agreement to any
document means such document as amended, modified or supplemented and as in
effect from time to time in accordance with the terms thereof. Whenever the
words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement, they
shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation." The word
"or" is used in the sense of "and/or"; "any" is used in the sense of "any or
all"; and "with respect to" any item includes the concept "of," "under" or
"regarding" such item or any similar relationship regarding such item. No
summary of this Agreement prepared by any party shall affect the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

 

11.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and any controversy related to, arising
directly or indirectly out of, caused by, or resulting from this shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that
would cause the application of laws of any jurisdictions other than those of
the State of Delaware.

11.9 _Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all remedies
herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative with and not
exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such
party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will not preclude the
exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.
It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction
or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.

11.10 _Submission to Jurisdiction_. Each of the parties to this Agreement (a)
consents to submit itself to the personal jurisdiction of any state or federal
court sitting in the State of Delaware in any action or proceeding arising out
of or relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (b) agrees that all claims in respect of such action or
proceeding may be heard and determined in any such court, (c) agrees that it
shall not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction by motion or
other request for leave from any such court, and (d) agrees not to bring any
action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any other court. Each of
the parties hereto waives any defense of inconvenient forum to the
maintenance of any action or proceeding so brought and waives any bond, surety
or other security that might be required of any other party with respect
thereto. Any party hereto may make service on another party by sending or
delivering a copy of the process to the party to be served at the address and
in the manner provided for the giving of notices in _Section 11.1_. Nothing
in this _Section 11.10_, however, shall affect the right of any party to
serve legal process in any other manner permitted by Applicable Law.

  Bonterra Builders Asset Purchase Agreement |  | Page 64 11.11 _Seller Disclosure Letter_. Seller Disclosure Letter shall be arranged
in Sections corresponding to the numbered Sections contained in _Article III_
, and the disclosure in any Section shall qualify (a) the corresponding
Section in _Article III_ , and (b) the other Sections in _Article III_ , to
the extent that it is apparent from a reading of such disclosure that it also
qualifies or applies to such other Sections. The inclusion of any information
in Seller Disclosure Letter, or in any update thereto, shall not be deemed to
be an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself, that such information is
required by the terms hereof to be disclosed, is material, has resulted in or
would result in a Seller Material Adverse Effect, or is outside the Ordinary
Course of Business. From time to time following the date hereof and prior to
the Closing Date, Seller shall, by written notice thereof delivered to Parent,
supplement the Seller Disclosure Letter relating to any representation or
warranty set forth in _Article III_ that expressly requires a listing of
certain items on a specific section of the Seller Disclosure Letter (any such
supplement, a " _Disclosure Letter Update_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that
such Disclosure Letter Update shall in no event be deemed to cure or limit
the rights or remedies of Parent or Buyer with respect to the failure of any
representations and warranties in _Article III_ to be true and correct with or
without giving effect to such Disclosure Letter Update (including _Section
8.2_ and _Article X_ of this Agreement).

11.12 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each of Parent, Buyer, Seller and Seller
Members hereby irrevocably waives all right to trial by jury in any action,
proceeding or counterclaim (whether based on contract, tort or otherwise)
arising out of or relating to this agreement or the actions of Parent,
Buyer, Seller and Seller Members in the negotiation, administration,
performance and enforcement hereof.
