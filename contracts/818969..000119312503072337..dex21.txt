     WHEREAS, Southern Financial is a party to an Agreement and Plan of
Reorganization dated as of July 24, 2003 by and among Southern Financial, Essex

     WHEREAS, Southern Financial desires to complete the Essex Merger and to
affiliate with Bankshares, and Bankshares desires to permit the completion of
the Essex Merger and to affiliate with Southern Financial in the manner provided

     WHEREAS, Bankshares and Southern Financial believe that the acquisition of

and supplements hereto is desirable and in the best interests of their
respective shareholders; and

     WHEREAS, Bankshares and Southern Financial intend the Merger to qualify as

Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), and the regulations thereunder; and

     WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Bankshares and Southern

                                  INTRODUCTION

     This Agreement provides for the merger of Southern Financial with and into
Bankshares with Bankshares as the survivor (the "Merger"), all pursuant to this
Agreement. In connection with the Merger, all of the issued and outstanding
shares of common stock, $0.01 par value, of Southern Financial ("Southern

<PAGE>

consideration as set forth in this Agreement. As soon as practicable after the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, Provident Bank, a wholly owned
subsidiary of Bankshares, and Southern Financial Bank, a wholly owned subsidiary
of Southern Financial, shall enter into a Plan of Bank Merger, pursuant to which
Southern Financial Bank will merge with and into Provident Bank (the "Bank
Merger"). The parties intend that the Bank Merger will become effective
simultaneously with or immediately following the Effective Time.

                                 I. THE MERGER

     Section 1.1. Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 8.2 of this
Agreement), Southern Financial shall be merged with and into Bankshares (which,
as the surviving corporation, is hereinafter referred to as "Continuing
Corporation" whenever reference is made to it at or after the Effective Time)
pursuant to the provisions of and with the effect provided for in Maryland
General Corporation Law and the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the "Virginia
Act").

     Section 1.2. Articles of Incorporation, Bylaws and Facilities of Continuing
Corporation. At the Effective Time and until thereafter amended in accordance
with applicable law, the Articles of Incorporation of Continuing Corporation
shall be the Articles of Incorporation of Bankshares as in effect at the
Effective Time. Until altered, amended or repealed as therein provided and in
the Articles of Incorporation of Continuing Corporation, the Bylaws of
Continuing Corporation shall be the Bylaws of Bankshares as in effect at the
Effective Time. Unless and until changed by the Board of Directors of Continuing
Corporation, the main office of Continuing Corporation shall be the main office
of Bankshares as of the Effective Time. The established offices and facilities
of the Southern Financial immediately prior to the Merger shall become
established offices and facilities of Continuing Corporation. Until thereafter
changed in accordance with law or the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of
Continuing Corporation, all corporate acts, plans, policies, contracts,
approvals and authorizations of Southern Financial and Bankshares and their
respective shareholders, boards of directors, committees elected or appointed
thereby, officers and agents, which were valid and effective immediately prior
to the Effective Time, shall be taken for all purposes as the acts, plans,
policies, contracts, approvals and authorizations of Continuing Corporation and
shall be as effective and binding thereon as the same were with respect to
Southern Financial and Bankshares, respectively, as of the Effective Time.

     Section 1.3. Board of Directors and Officers of Continuing Corporation. At
the Effective Time and until thereafter changed in accordance with the law or
the Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws of Continuing Corporation, the members
of the Board of Directors of Bankshares at the Effective Time and the two
members of the Board of Directors of Southern Financial designated in Section
6.13 hereof to serve on the Board of Directors of Bankshares shall become the
Board of Directors of Continuing Corporation. At the Effective Time and until
thereafter changed in accordance with the law or the Articles of Incorporation
or Bylaws of Continuing Corporation, the senior officers of Bankshares
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall become the officers of Continuing
Corporation.

     Section 1.4. Effect of Merger. At the Effective Time, the corporate
existence of Southern Financial and Bankshares shall, as provided in the
provisions of law heretofore


                                       -2-

<PAGE>

mentioned, be consolidated and continued in Continuing Corporation, and
Continuing Corporation shall be deemed to be a continuation in entity and
identity of Southern Financial and Bankshares. All rights, franchises and
interests of Southern Financial and Bankshares, respectively, in and to any type
of property and choses in action shall be transferred to and vested in
Continuing Corporation by virtue of such Merger without any deed or other
transfer. Continuing Corporation, without any order or other action on the part
of any court or otherwise, shall hold and enjoy all rights of property,
franchises and interest, including appointments, designations and nominations,
and all other rights and interests as trustee, executor, administrator, transfer
agent or registrar of stocks and bonds, guardian of estates, assignee, receiver
and committee of estates and lunatics, and in every other fiduciary capacity, in
the same manner and to the same extent as such rights, franchises, and interests
were held or enjoyed by Southern Financial and Bankshares, respectively, as of
the Effective Time.

     Section 1.5. Liabilities of Continuing Corporation. At the Effective Time
of the Merger, Continuing Corporation shall be liable for all liabilities of
Southern Financial and Bankshares. All deposits, debts, liabilities, obligations
and contracts of Southern Financial and of Bankshares, respectively, matured or
unmatured, whether accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise, and whether or
not reflected or reserved against on balance sheets, books of account, or
records of Southern Financial or Bankshares, as the case may be, shall be those
of Continuing Corporation and shall not be released or impaired by the Merger.
All rights of creditors and other obligees and all liens on property of either
Southern Financial or Bankshares shall be preserved unimpaired subsequent to the
Merger.

     Section 1.6. Ratification by Shareholders. This Agreement shall be
submitted to the shareholders of Southern Financial and the shareholders of
Bankshares in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, the applicable
provisions of law and the respective Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of
Southern Financial and Bankshares. Southern Financial and Bankshares shall
proceed expeditiously and cooperate fully in the procurement of any other
consents and approvals and the taking of any other actions in satisfaction of
all other requirements prescribed by law or otherwise necessary for consummation
of the Merger on the terms herein provided, including, without limitation, the
preparation and submission of all necessary filings, requests for waivers and
certificates with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System ("Federal
Reserve Board"), the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ("FDIC"), the Office
of Thrift Supervision ("OTS"), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency
("OCC"), the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation or the Virginia State
Corporation Commission.

     Section 1.7. Tax Consequences. It is intended by the parties hereto that
the Merger shall constitute a reorganization within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code, and the parties hereto hereby adopt this Agreement as a
"plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Sections 1.368-2(g) and
1.368-3(a) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder.

     Section 2.1. Merger Consideration.

          (a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holders thereof, each share of Southern Financial
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than any Dissenting Shares (as defined in Section 2.3 of this Agreement),

"Stock Consideration") and (ii) an aggregate amount of $11.125 in cash without
interest (the "Cash Consideration"). The aggregate of the Cash Consideration and
Stock Consideration payable and/or issuable pursuant to this Agreement is

shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired
and shall cease to exist, and each certificate previously representing any such
shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive the Merger Consideration.

          (b) The aggregate number of shares of Bankshares Common Stock to be
exchanged for each share of Southern Financial Common Stock shall be adjusted
appropriately to reflect any change in the number of shares of Bankshares Common
Stock by reason of any stock dividends or splits, reclassification,
reorganization, recapitalization or conversion or other similar change in
capitalization with respect to Bankshares Common Stock, received or to be
received by holders of Bankshares Common Stock, when the record date or payment
occurs prior to the Effective Time.

          (c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
Bankshares will not issue any certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Bankshares Common Stock otherwise issuable pursuant to the Merger. In
lieu of the issuance of any such fractional shares, Bankshares shall pay to each
former holder of Southern Financial Common Stock otherwise entitled to receive
such fractional share an amount of cash determined by multiplying (i) the
closing price per share of Bankshares Common Stock on Nasdaq (as reported by The
Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another alternative source as
chosen by Southern Financial) on the third trading day immediately prior to the
day on which the Effective Time occurs by (ii) the fraction of a share of
Bankshares Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to this Section 2.1.

     Section 2.2. Treatment of Southern Financial Stock Options.

          (a) At the Effective Time, each option to acquire shares of Southern
Financial Common Stock which is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior
thereto ("Southern Financial Stock Option") pursuant to the Southern Financial
Bancorp, Inc. 1993 Stock Option and Incentive Plan, as Amended and Restated, or
the Southern Financial Bancorp, Inc. 2003 Stock Incentive Plan (collectively,
the "Southern Financial Stock Option Plans") shall automatically become vested
and shall, at the option of the holder (i) be cancelled and converted into the
right to receive a cash payment equal to the difference between (A) the sum of
(1) the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the closing price per share of Bankshares
Common Stock on


                                       -4-

<PAGE>

Nasdaq on the third trading day immediately prior to the day the Effective Time
occurs and (2) the Cash Consideration and (B) the exercise price of such
Southern Financial Stock Option as listed on Schedule 3.2, or (ii) be converted
(automatically and without any action on the part of the holder thereof) into an
option to purchase shares of Bankshares Common Stock in an amount and at an
exercise price determined as provided below (and otherwise subject to the terms
of the Southern Financial Stock Option Plans and/or agreements evidencing the
grants thereunder):

                    (i) The number of shares of Bankshares Common Stock to be
     subject to the new option shall be equal to the number of shares of
     Southern Financial Common Stock subject to the original option multiplied
     by the Option Exchange Ratio (as defined below); and

                    (ii) The exercise price per share of Bankshares Common Stock
     under the new option shall be equal to the exercise price per share of
     Southern Financial Common Stock under the original option divided by the
     Option Exchange Ratio

          (b) The Option Exchange Ratio shall be that number of shares of
Bankshares Common Stock determined by (i) dividing the Cash Consideration by the
closing price per share of Bankshares Common Stock on Nasdaq (as reported by The
Wall Street Journal or, if not reported thereby, another alternative source as
chosen by Bankshares) on the third trading day immediately prior to the date on
which the Effective Time occurs by the Exchange Ratio, and (ii) adding that
number to the Exchange Ratio. Based on an assumed closing price per share of
Bankshares Common Stock on the third trading day immediately prior to the day on
which the Effective Time occurs of $30.69 and Cash Consideration of $11.125, the
Option Exchange Ratio would equal 1.45.

          (c) The adjustment provided herein with respect to any options which
are "incentive stock options" as defined in Section 422 of the Internal Revenue
Code, shall be and is intended to be effected in a manner which is consistent
with Section 424(a) of the Internal Revenue Code. The duration and other terms
of the new option shall be the same as the original option except that all
references to Southern Financial shall be deemed to be references to Bankshares.

     Section 2.3. Dissenting Shares. Each share of Southern Financial Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, the holder
of which has not voted in favor of the Merger and who has delivered a written
demand for payment of the fair value of such shares within the time and in the
manner provided in Article 15 of the Virginia Act, is referred to herein as a
"Dissenting Share." Dissenting Shares shall not be converted into or represent
the right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 of this
Agreement unless and until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall
have effectively withdrawn or lost his right to appraisal and payment under
Article 15 of the Virginia Act. If any such holder shall have so failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, such holder's
Dissenting Shares shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted into and to
have become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

     Section 2.4. Exchange of Shares.

          (a) Immediately prior to the Closing Date (as defined in Section 8.1
of the Agreement), Bankshares shall deposit or cause to be deposited in trust
with EquiServe (the "Exchange Agent") (i) certificates representing shares of
Bankshares Common Stock and (ii) cash in an aggregate amount sufficient to make
the appropriate payments of the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 2.1 of
this Agreement, including the cash payments (A) to holders of Dissenting Shares
pursuant to Section 2.3 hereof, if any, and (B) holders of a fraction of a share
of Bankshares Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(c) (such certificates and
cash being referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). The Exchange Fund shall not be
used for any other purpose, except as provided in this Agreement. The Exchange
Agent shall promptly deliver the stock certificates representing shares of
Bankshares Common Stock and the cash payment upon surrender of certificates
representing shares of Southern Financial Common Stock.

          (b) Promptly after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail
to each record holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates which as of
the Effective Date represented shares of Southern Financial Common Stock (the
"Certificates"), a form letter of transmittal which will specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass,
only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and contain
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment
therefor. Upon surrender to the Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with
such letter of transmittal duly executed, the holder of such Certificate shall
be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash and number of
shares of Bankshares Common Stock provided in Section 2.1 hereof, and such
Certificate shall forthwith be cancelled. Bankshares shall provide the Exchange
Agent with certificates for Bankshares Common Stock, as requested by the
Exchange Agent, for the number of shares provided in Section 2.1. No interest
will be paid or accrued with respect to the shares of Bankshares Common Stock or
cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates. Until surrendered in accordance
with the provisions of this Section 2.4, each Certificate (other than
Certificates representing Dissenting Shares) shall represent for all purposes
the right to receive the Merger Consideration without any interest thereon.

          (c) Former shareholders of Southern Financial shall be entitled to
vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Bankshares's shareholders the
number of shares of Bankshares Common Stock into which their shares are
converted, regardless of whether such shareholders of Southern Financial have
surrendered their Certificates in exchange therefor.

          (d) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective
Time with respect to shares of Bankshares Common Stock and payable to the
holders thereof shall be paid to the holder of a Certificate until such holder
surrenders such Certificate to the Exchange Agent in accordance with this
Section 2.4. After the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with this
Section 2.4, the holder thereof shall be entitled to receive any such dividends
or other distributions, without interest thereon, which had become payable after
the Effective Time with respect to the shares of Bankshares Common Stock
represented by such Certificate.

          (e) After the Effective Time, the stock transfer ledger of Southern
Financial shall be closed and there shall be no transfers on the stock transfer
books of Southern Financial of the shares of Southern Financial Common Stock
which were outstanding immediately prior to


                                       -6-

<PAGE>

the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
Bankshares, they shall be promptly presented to the Exchange Agent and exchanged
as provided in this Section 2.4.

          (f) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the shareholders of Southern
Financial for six months after the Exchange Agent mails the letter of
transmittal pursuant to Section 2.4 shall be returned to Bankshares upon demand,
and holders of Southern Financial Common Stock not theretofore presented to the
Exchange Agent shall look to Bankshares only, and not the Exchange Agent, for
the payment of any Merger Consideration in respect of such shares.

          (g) If any certificate representing shares of Bankshares Common Stock
is to be issued in a name other than that in which the Certificate surrendered
in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a condition of the issuance
thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be appropriately endorsed (or
accompanied by an appropriate instrument of transfer) and otherwise in proper
form (reasonably satisfactory to Bankshares) for transfer, and that the person
requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing
shares of Bankshares Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required for any other reason, or
shall establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been
paid or not payable.

          (h) None of Bankshares, Southern Financial, the Exchange Agent or any
other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Southern
Financial Common Stock for any Bankshares Common Stock (or dividends or
distributions with respect thereto) or cash properly delivered to a public
official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar laws.

          (i) In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, then upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Bankshares or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such person of a bond in such
amount as Bankshares or the Exchange Agent may direct as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against Bankshares with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to
this Agreement.

Southern Financial is not a party to any written or oral: (i) loan agreement,
note or borrowing arrangement, other than credit card loans and other loans the

which the obligor is sixty (60) days delinquent in payment of principal or
interest or in default of any other material provisions as of the date hereof;
(ii) loan agreement, note or borrowing arrangement which has been classified or,
in the exercise of reasonable diligence by Southern Financial or any regulatory

mentioned," "other assets especially mentioned" or any comparable
classifications by such persons; (iii) loan agreement, note or borrowing

Southern Financial.

Financial ("Watch List") as of September 30, 2003. Except as set forth in
Schedule 3.7(b), to the knowledge of Southern Financial, there is no loan
agreement, note or borrowing arrangement which should be included on the Watch

of such Southern Financial Real Property. Each of such leases is a legal, valid
and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms (except as may
be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization or similar laws
affecting the rights of creditors generally and the availability of equitable
remedies), and is in full force and effect; there are no existing defaults by
Southern Financial or the other party thereunder and there are no allegations or
assertions of such by any party under such agreement or any events that with
notice lapse of time or the happening or occurrence of any other event would
constitute a default thereunder.

          (c) To the knowledge of Southern Financial, none of the buildings and
structures located on any Southern Financial Real Property, nor any
appurtenances thereto or equipment therein, nor the operation or maintenance
thereof, violates in any material manner any restrictive covenants or encroaches
on any property owned by others, nor does any building or structure of third
parties encroach upon any Southern Financial Real Property, except for those
violations and encroachments which in the aggregate could not reasonably be
expected to cause a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of Southern
Financial. No condemnation proceeding is pending or, to Southern Financial's
knowledge, threatened, which would preclude or materially impair the use of any
Southern Financial Real Property in the manner in which it is currently being
used.

          (d) Southern Financial and its Subsidiaries have good and indefeasible
title to, or a valid and enforceable leasehold interest in, or a contract
vendee's interest in, all Southern Financial Real Property, and such interest is
free and clear of all liens, charges or other encumbrances, except (i) statutory
liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith
through proper proceedings and (ii) those liens related to real property taxes,
local improvement district assessments, easements, covenants, restrictions and
other


                                       -11-

<PAGE>

matters of record which do not, individually or in the aggregate, materially
adversely affect the use and enjoyment of the relevant real property.

          (e) Except as set forth in Schedule 3.8(e), all buildings and other
facilities used in the business of Southern Financial are in adequate condition
(ordinary wear and tear excepted) and, to Southern Financial's knowledge, are
free from defects which could materially interfere with the current or future
use of such facilities consistent with past practices.

     Section 3.9. Personal Property. Southern Financial and its Subsidiaries
have good title to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all personal property,
whether tangible or intangible, used in the conduct of its business (the
"Southern Financial Personalty"), free and clear of all liens, charges or other
encumbrances, except (i) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which
are being contested in good faith through proper proceedings and (ii) such other
liens, charges, encumbrances and imperfections of title as do not individually
or in the aggregate materially adversely affect the use and enjoyment of the
relevant Southern Financial Personalty. Subject to ordinary wear and tear, the
Southern Financial Personalty is in good operating condition and repair and is
adequate for the uses to which it is being put.

     Section 3.10. Environmental Laws. To the knowledge of Southern Financial,
Southern Financial and its subsidiaries and any properties or business owned or
operated by any of them, whether or not held in a fiduciary or representative
capacity, are in material compliance with all terms and conditions of all
applicable federal and state Environmental Laws (as defined below) and permits
thereunder. Neither Southern Financial nor any of its subsidiaries has received
notice of any violation of any Environmental Laws or generated, stored, or
disposed of any materials designated as Hazardous Materials (as defined below)
under the Environmental Laws, and they are not subject to any claim or lien
under any Environmental Laws. During the term of ownership by Southern Financial
or any of its subsidiaries no real estate currently owned, operated, or leased
(including any property acquired by foreclosure or deeded in lieu thereof) by
Southern Financial or its subsidiaries, or owned, operated or leased by Southern
Financial or its subsidiaries within the ten years preceding the date of this

requiring any environmental cleanup or response action to comply with
Environmental Laws, or has been the site of release of any Hazardous Materials.

asbestos was used in the construction of any portion of Southern Financial's or
any subsidiary's facilities and (ii) to the knowledge of Southern Financial or
any subsidiary, no real property currently owned by it or any subsidiary is, or
has been, an industrial site or landfill. There are no underground storage tanks
at any properties owned or operated by Southern Financial or any of its
subsidiaries and no underground storage tanks have been closed or removed from
any properties owned or operated by Southern Financial or any of its
subsidiaries. Bankshares and its consultants, agents and representatives shall
have the right to inspect Southern Financial's assets for the purpose of
conducting asbestos and other environmental surveys, provided that such
inspection shall be at the expense of Bankshares and at such time as may be
mutually agreed upon between Southern Financial and Bankshares.

federal, state or local statute, law, rule, regulation, ordinance, code, policy

stock, which might have a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of Southern
Financial or the transactions proposed by this Agreement. Southern Financial
does not know of any basis on which any litigation or proceeding could be
brought which is reasonably likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect on the
Condition of Southern Financial or which could question the validity of any
action taken or to be taken in connection with this Agreement and the
transaction contemplated thereby. Neither Southern Financial nor any of its

Financial nor its subsidiaries have executed or filed with the Internal Revenue
Service any agreement extending the period for assessment and collection of any
federal income Tax. None of Southern Financial or its subsidiaries is a party to
any action or proceeding by any governmental authority for assessment or
collection of Taxes, nor has any claim for assessment or collection of Taxes
been asserted against Southern Financial. Southern Financial has not waived any
statute of limitations with respect to any Tax or other assessment or levy, and
all such Taxes and other assessments and levies which Southern Financial or its
subsidiaries is required by law to withhold or to collect have been duly
withheld and collected and have been

former employee of Southern Financial.

          (e) Schedule 3.19(e) sets forth an accurate list of all contracts,
agreements, plans or arrangements, formal or informal, covering employees,
former employees or directors of Southern Financial under which completion of
the transactions contemplated hereby could result in the accelerated vesting,

benefit to any employee, former employee or director of Southern Financial.
Schedule 3.19(e) further sets forth reasonable estimates of severance benefits
payable under the employment or change in control agreements and any amounts
that could be considered "excess parachute payments" within the meaning of
Section 280G of the Code. Except as required by the continuation coverage
requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code,
Southern Financial has no liability to provide post-retirement health or
lifetime benefits to any employee or former employee of Southern Financial.

          (f) "ERISA Affiliates" means, with respect to any entity, trade or
business, any other entity, trade or business that is a member of a group
described in Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code or Section 4001(b)(1)

the duly authorized executive officers of Southern Financial; (ii) all material
transactions are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial

and cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, and (ii)
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2003, as filed with
the SEC, which contains its unaudited balance sheets and related statements of
income and statements of changes in shareholders' equity and cash flows as of
and for the six months ended June 30, 2003 and 2002. The financial statements
referred to in this Section 4.5(a) are collectively referred to herein as the
"Bankshares Financial Statements."

          (b) The Bankshares Financial Statements fairly present the financial
position and results of operations of Bankshares at the dates and for the
periods indicated in conformity with GAAP applied on a consistent basis.

          (c) As of the dates of the Bankshares' Financial Statements referred
to above, Bankshares did not have any liabilities, fixed or contingent, which
are material and are not fully shown or provided for in the Bankshares Financial
Statements or otherwise disclosed in this Agreement, or in any of the documents
delivered to Southern Financial. Since June 30, 2003, there have been no
material changes in the financial condition, assets, liabilities or business of
Bankshares, other than changes in the ordinary course of business, which
individually or in the aggregate, have not had a Material Adverse Effect on the
Condition of Bankshares.

     Section 4.6. Litigation and Other Proceedings. There are no legal,
quasi-judicial or administrative proceedings of any kind or nature now pending
or, to the knowledge of


                                       -22-

<PAGE>

Bankshares, threatened before any court or administrative body in any manner
against Bankshares, or any of its properties or capital stock, which might have
a Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of Bankshares or the transactions
proposed by this Agreement. Bankshares knows of no basis on which any litigation
or proceeding could be brought which is reasonably likely to result in a
Material Adverse Effect on the Condition of Bankshares or which could question
the validity of any action taken or to be taken in connection with this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Bankshares is not in default
with respect to any judgment, order, writ, injunction, decree, award, rule or
regulation of any court, arbitrator or governmental agency or instrumentality.

     Section 4.7. Securities and Exchange Commission Reporting Obligations.
Since January 1, 2000, Bankshares has timely filed all reports and statements,
together with any amendments required to be made with respect thereto, that it
was required to file with the SEC pursuant to the Exchange Act ("Bankshares' SEC
Reports"). As of their respective dates, each of such reports and statements,
(or if amended, as of the date so amended), were true and correct and complied
in all material respects with the relevant statutes, rules and regulations
enforced or promulgated by the SEC and such reports did not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary in order
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

     Section 4.8. Accounting Controls. Bankshares has devised and maintained a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable
assurances that: (i) all material transactions are executed in accordance with
general or specific authorization of the Board of Directors and the duly
authorized executive officers of Bankshares; (ii) all material transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with GAAP consistently applied with respect to institutions such as
Bankshares or other criteria applicable to such financial statements, and to
maintain proper accountability for items therein; (iii) access to the material
properties and assets of Bankshares is permitted only in accordance with general
or specific authorization of the Board of Directors and the duly authorized
executive officers of Bankshares; and (iv) the recorded accountability for items
is compared with the actual levels at reasonable intervals and appropriate
actions taken with respect to any differences.

     Section 4.9. Bankshares Employee Benefit Plans.

          (a) No employee benefit plans of Bankshares or its ERISA Affiliates
(as defined in Section 3.19 hereof) (the "Bankshares Plans") are "multiemployer
plans" within the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA ("Multiemployer
Plans"). None of Bankshares or any of its respective ERISA Affiliates has, at
any time during the last six years, contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any Multiemployer Plan, and none of Bankshares, or any of its
respective ERISA Affiliates has incurred any withdrawal liability under Part I
of Subtitle E of Title IV of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full.

          (b) There does not now exist, nor, to the knowledge of Bankshares, do
any circumstances exist that could result in, any Controlled Group Liability
that would be a material liability of Bankshares now or following the Closing.
"Controlled Group Liability" means (i) any and all liabilities (A) under Title
IV of ERISA, (B) under Section 302 of ERISA, (C) under Sections 412 and 4971 of
the Code, or (D) as a result of a failure to comply with the


                                       -23-

<PAGE>

continuation coverage requirements of Section 601 et seq. of ERISA and Section
4980B of the Code, and (E) under corresponding or similar provisions of foreign
laws or regulations; (ii) with respect to any Bankshares Plan any other material
liability under Title I of ERISA or Chapter 43 or 68 of the Code, and (iii)
material unfunded liabilities under any non-qualified deferred compensation plan
for the benefit of any employee or former employee of Bankshares.

          (c) Each Bankshares Plan has been operated and administered in all
material respects in compliance with ERISA, since ERISA became applicable with
respect thereto. None of the Bankshares Plans nor any of their respective
related trusts have been terminated (except the termination of any Bankshares
Plan which is in compliance with the requirements of ERISA and which will not
result in any additional liability to Bankshares), and there has been no
"reportable event," as that term is defined in Section 4043 of ERISA, required
to be reported since the effective date of ERISA which has not been reported,
and none of such Bankshares Plans nor their respective related trusts have
incurred any "accumulated funding deficiency," as such term is defined in
Section 302 of ERISA (whether or not waived), since the effective date of ERISA.

          (d) The Bankshares Plans are the only employee pension benefit plans
covering employees of Bankshares and its Subsidiary. Bankshares and its
Subsidiary will not have any material liabilities with respect to employee
pension benefits, whether vested or unvested as of the Closing Date, for any of
their employees other than under the Bankshares Plans, and as of the date hereof
the actuarial present value of Bankshares Plan assets of each Bankshares Plan is
not less (and as of the Effective Time of the Merger such present value will not
be less) than the present value of all benefits payable or to be payable
thereunder.

     Section 4.10. Regulatory Approvals; Tax Opinion. Bankshares has no reason
to believe that it cannot obtain (i) all requisite regulatory approvals
referenced in Section 12.1 hereof and (ii) the tax opinion referenced in Section
12.3 hereof.

     Section 4.11. Taxes. Bankshares and its Subsidiary have timely filed with
the appropriate federal, state and local governmental authorities all material
Tax Returns and reports required to be filed, and have paid all Taxes and
assessments shown or claimed to be due and payable thereon. At the time of
filing, all such Tax Returns were correct in all material respects. Neither
Bankshares nor its Subsidiary has executed or filed with the Internal Revenue
Service any agreement extending the period for assessment and collection of any
federal income Tax. None of Bankshares or its Subsidiary is a party to any
pending action or proceeding by any governmental authority for assessment or
collection of Taxes, nor has any written claim for assessment or collection of
Taxes been asserted against Bankshares or its Subsidiary. All Taxes which
Bankshares or its Subsidiary is or was required by law to withhold or to collect
have been duly withheld and collected and have been paid over to the proper
authorities to the extent due and payable, or segregated and set aside for such
payment and, if so segregated and set aside will be so paid by Bankshares or its
Subsidiary, as required by applicable law.

     Section 4.12. Absence of Certain Changes. Except as set forth in
Bankshares' SEC Reports, since June 30, 2003 (i) Bankshares and its Subsidiary
have conducted their respective businesses in the ordinary and usual course
consistent with past practice (excluding the incurrence of expenses related to
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby) and

                                       -24-

<PAGE>

(ii) no event has occurred or circumstance arisen that, individually or in the
aggregate, has had or is reasonably likely to have a Material Adverse Effect on
Bankshares.

     Section 4.13. Insurance. Bankshares currently maintains insurance in
amounts reasonably necessary for its operations. In the judgment of the Board of
Directors of Bankshares, such insurance policies in respect of amounts, types
and risks insured are adequate to insure against risks to which Bankshares and
its assets are normally exposed in the operation of its business, subject to
customary deductibles and policy limits. Bankshares has no reason to believe
that existing insurance coverage cannot be renewed as and when the same shall
expire upon terms and conditions as favorable as those presently in effect,
other than possible increases in premiums or unavailability of coverage that
does not result from any extraordinary loss experience on the part of
Bankshares.

     Section 4.14. Laws and Regulatory Filings. Bankshares and its Subsidiary
are in material compliance with all applicable federal, state and local laws,
rules, regulations and orders applicable to them. Except for approvals by
regulatory authorities having supervisory jurisdiction over Bankshares and its
Subsidiary, no prior consent, approval or authorization of, or declaration,
filing or registrations with, any person or regulatory authority is required of
Bankshares and its Subsidiary in connection with the execution, delivery and
performance by Bankshares of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, except for certain instruments necessary to consummate the Merger
contemplated hereby. Bankshares and its subsidiaries have filed all reports,
registrations and statements, together with any amendments required to be made
thereto, that are required to be filed with the Federal Reserve Board, the FDIC,
the OCC, the OTS or any other regulatory authority having supervisory
jurisdiction over Bankshares and its Subsidiary, and such reports, registrations
and statements, as finally amended or corrected, are, to the knowledge of
Bankshares and its Subsidiary, true and correct in all material respects.

     Section 4.15. Community Reinvestment Act. Provident Bank is in material
compliance with the CRA and all regulations promulgated thereunder. Provident
Bank has a rating of "satisfactory" as of its most recent CRA compliance
examination and, knows of no reason why it would not receive a rating of
"satisfactory" or better pursuant to its next CRA compliance examination or why
the FDIC, the Maryland Commissioner of Financial Regulation or any other
governmental entity may seek to restrain, delay or prohibit the transactions
contemplated hereby as a result of any act or omission of the Provident Bank
under the CRA.

     Section 4.16. Allowance for Loan Losses. The allowance for loan losses
reflected on the Bankshares Financial Statements, as of their respective dates,
has been established in accordance with GAAP as applied to banking institutions
and all applicable laws and regulations.

     Section 4.17. Environmental Matters. To the knowledge of Bankshares,
Bankshares and Provident Bank are in material compliance with all terms and
conditions of all applicable federal and state Environmental Laws (as defined in
Section 3.10 hereof) and permits thereunder. Neither Bankshares nor Provident
Bank has received any communication alleging that Bankshares or Provident Bank
is not in such material compliance and, to the knowledge of Bankshares, there
are no present circumstances that would prevent or interfere with the
continuation of such material compliance.


                                       -25-

<PAGE>

     Section 4.18. Brokers and Finders. Other than as set forth on Schedule
4.18, neither Bankshares nor any of its officers, directors or employees have
employed any broker or finder or incurred any liability for any brokerage fees,
commissions or finders' fees in connection with this Agreement.

     Section 4.19. Ability to Pay Merger Consideration. Bankshares has, and will
have available to it at the Effective Time, sources of capital sufficient to pay
the aggregate Cash Consideration and to effect the transactions contemplated
hereby.

     Section 4.20. Bankshares Information. The information regarding Bankshares
and its subsidiaries to be supplied by Bankshares for inclusion in the
Registration Statement, any filings or approvals under applicable federal or
state banking laws or regulations or state securities laws, or any filing
pursuant to Rule 165 or Rule 425 under the Securities Act will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

                       V. COVENANTS OF SOUTHERN FINANCIAL

     Southern Financial covenants and agrees with Bankshares as follows:

     Section 5.1. Shareholder Approval and Reasonable Best Efforts. Southern
Financial will, as soon as practicable, take all steps under applicable laws and

action to aid and assist in the consummation of the Merger, and will use its
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or

     transmission. Bankshares shall notify Southern Financial via e-mail
     transmission within two (2) business days of receipt of such notice whether
     Bankshares consents to such loan or extension of credit, provided that if
     Bankshares fails to notify Southern Financial with such time frame,
     Bankshares shall be deemed to have consented to such loan or extension of
     credit;

               (ii) issue or sell or obligate itself to issue or sell any shares

     Section 5.3. Access to Properties and Records.

          (a) To the extent permitted by applicable law, Southern Financial
shall and shall cause each of its Subsidiaries, upon reasonable notice from
Bankshares to Southern Financial to: (i) afford the employees and officers and
authorized representatives (including legal counsel, accountants and

<PAGE>

may have full opportunity to make such reasonable investigation as it shall
desire to make of the affairs of Southern Financial and its Subsidiaries, and
(ii) furnish Bankshares with such additional financial and operating data and
other information as to the business and properties of Southern Financial as
Bankshares shall, from time to time, reasonably request.

          (b) As soon as practicable after they become available, Southern
Financial will deliver or make available to Bankshares all reports filed by
Southern Financial with the appropriate federal or state banking or regulatory
authority after the date of this Agreement. All such financial statements shall
be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a consistent basis with previous
accounting periods. In the event of the termination of this Agreement,
Bankshares will return to Southern Financial all documents and other information

     Section 5.4. Information for Regulatory Applications and SEC Filings. To
the extent permitted by law, Southern Financial will furnish Bankshares with all

or, if such is not the case, indicating the inaccuracies contained in such
document or indicating the information not furnished by Southern Financial
expressly for use therein.

     Section 5.5. Standstill Provision. So long as this Agreement is in effect,
neither Southern Financial nor any of its subsidiaries shall and Southern
Financial agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and each of its
subsidiaries' directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives not to
entertain, solicit or encourage any inquiries, or provide any information to or
negotiate with any other party any proposal which could reasonably be expected
to lead to the merger, consolidation, acquisition, or sale of all or
substantially all of the assets or any shares of capital stock of Southern
Financial, except where the Board of Directors of Southern Financial determines,
based on the advice of counsel, that the failure to furnish such information or
participate in such negotiations or discussions would or could reasonably be
deemed to constitute a breach of the fiduciary or legal obligations of Southern
Financial's Board of Directors to its shareholders. Southern Financial agrees to
notify Bankshares of any such unsolicited acquisition proposal orally, within
one business day and in writing within three business days of its receipt, and
provide reasonable detail as to the identity of the proposed acquiror and the
nature of the proposed transaction. Southern Financial will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or negotiations
with any parties conducted heretofore that relate to any such unsolicited
acquisition proposal. Southern Financial


                                       -30-

<PAGE>

will take the necessary steps to inform the appropriate individuals or entities
referred to in this Section 5.5 of the obligations undertaken in this Section
5.5. Southern Financial will promptly request each person (other than Bankshares
and Essex) that has executed a confidentiality agreement prior to the date
hereof in connection with its consideration of a business combination with
Southern Financial or any of its subsidiaries to return or destroy all
confidential information previously furnished to such person by or on behalf of
Southern Financial or any of its Subsidiaries. Southern Financial shall not
release any third party from, or waive any provisions of, any confidentiality
agreements or standstill agreement to which it or any of its subsidiaries is a
party.

     Section 5.6. Affiliates' Letters. No later than the fifteenth (15th) day
following the date of execution of this Agreement, Southern Financial shall
deliver to Bankshares, after consultation with legal counsel, a list of names
and addresses of those persons who are then "affiliates" of Southern Financial
within the meaning of Rule 144 under the Securities Act. There shall be added to
such list the names and addresses of any other person (within the meaning of
Rule 144) which Bankshares identifies (by written notice to Southern Financial
within three business days after receipt of such list) as possibly being a
person who may be deemed to be an "affiliate" of Southern Financial within the
meaning of Rule 144. Southern Financial shall use all reasonable efforts to
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to Bankshares not later than the thirtieth
(30th) day following the date of execution of this Agreement from each of the
"Affiliates" of Southern Financial identified as aforesaid who own Southern
Financial Common Stock and will acquire Bankshares Common Stock in the Merger, a
letter dated as of the date of delivery thereof in the form of Exhibit B

     Section 5.7. Certain Policies and Actions of Southern Financial. At the
request of Bankshares, Southern Financial shall cause Southern Financial Bank to

(the "Indemnifying Party") shall indemnify and hold harmless each present and
former director and officer of Southern Financial or an Southern Financial
Subsidiary, as applicable, determined as of the Effective Time (the "Indemnified
Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or liabilities incurred in connection
with any claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, arising out of matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, arising in


                                       -34-

<PAGE>

whole or in part out of or pertaining to the fact that he or she was a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of Southern Financial or any Southern
Financial Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of Southern Financial
or any of the Subsidiaries of Southern Financial as a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation, partnership, limited
liability company joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including without
limitation matters related to the negotiation, execution and performance of this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, to the fullest extent
which such Indemnified Parties would be entitled under the Articles of
Incorporation of Southern Financial or the equivalent document of any Southern
Financial Subsidiary, as applicable, in each case as in effect on the date
hereof. Without limiting the foregoing, Bankshares also agrees that limitations
on liability existing in favor of the Indemnified Parties as provided in the
Articles of Incorporation of Southern Financial or the equivalent document of
any Subsidiary of Southern Financial as in effect on the date hereof with
respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time shall survive the
Merger and the Bank Merger and shall continue in full force and effect from and
after the Effective Time.

          (b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under this
Section 6.9, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify the Indemnifying Party, but the failure to
so notify shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of any liability it may have
to such Indemnified Party if such failure does not actually prejudice the
Indemnifying Party. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof and the
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal
expenses of other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if the
Indemnifying Party elects not to assume such defense or counsel for the
Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise conflicts of
interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Parties, the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel which is reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnifying Party, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, promptly as statements
therefor are received, the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel for the
Indemnified Parties (which may not exceed one firm in any jurisdiction), (ii)
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter, (iii)
the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement effected without
its prior written consent and (iv) the Indemnifying Party shall have no
obligation hereunder in the event that indemnification of an Indemnified Party
in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable laws and
regulations.

          (c) Prior the Effective Time, Bankshares shall use its best efforts to
cause the persons serving as directors and officers of Southern Financial
immediately prior to the Effective Time to be covered by the directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy maintained by Southern Financial (provided
that Bankshares may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage
and amounts containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
advantageous than such policy or single premium tail coverage with policy limits
equal to the existing coverage limits of Southern Financial) for a six-year
period following the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time which were committed by such directors and officers
in their capacities as such, provided that in no event shall Bankshares be
required to expend for any one year an amount in excess of 175% of the


                                       -35-

<PAGE>

annual premium currently paid by Southern Financial for such insurance (the
"Insurance Amount"), and further provided that if Bankshares is unable to
maintain or obtain the insurance called for by this Section 6.8(c) as a result
of the preceding provision, Bankshares shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain as much comparable insurance as is available for the Insurance Amount.

          (d) If Bankshares or any of its successors or assigns shall
consolidate with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing
or surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case, the
successors and assigns of Bankshares shall assume the obligations set forth in
this Section 6.9.

     Section 6.10. Assumption of Southern Financial Stock Options.

          (a) At the Effective Time, each outstanding and unexercised Southern
Financial Stock Option which the holder thereof has elected to be converted into

Bankshares as provided in Section 2.2 hereof.

for issuance at all times after the Effective Time a sufficient number of shares
of Bankshares Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of Southern Financial
Stock Options assumed by Bankshares in accordance with Section 2.2. Immediately
following the Effective Time, Bankshares shall file a registration statement on
Form S-8 (or any successor or other appropriate form) with respect to the shares
of Bankshares Common Stock subject to such options and shall use its best
efforts to maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement (and
maintain the current status of the prospectus contained therein) for so long as
such options remain outstanding. With respect to those individuals who
subsequent to the Merger will be subject to the reporting requirements under
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act, where applicable, Bankshares shall administer
the Southern Financial Stock Option Plan in a manner that complies with Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

gross negligence or dereliction in the performance of such employee's duties,
dishonesty or commission of a crime), the severance benefits in accordance with

by the Board of Directors of Southern Financial if prior to the Effective Time,
Southern Financial shall have received a bona fide Acquisition Proposal (as
defined in Section 9.3(c)) and the Southern Financial Board of Directors
determines in its good faith judgment and in the exercise of its fiduciary
duties, based as to legal matters on the written advice of independent legal
counsel and as to financial matters on the written advice of Sandler O'Neill &
Partners, L.P. or an investment banking firm of national reputation, that such
alternative Acquisition Proposal (if consummated pursuant to its terms) is a
Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 9.3(d)) and that the failure to
terminate this Agreement and accept such Superior Proposal would be inconsistent
with the proper exercise of such fiduciary duties; provided, however, that
termination under this clause (f) shall not be deemed effective until payment of
the Termination Fee required by Section 9.3.

          (g) This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing
by the Board of Directors of Bankshares if the Southern Financial Board of
Directors shall have (i) resolved to accept an Acquisition Proposal, (ii)
recommended to the shareholders of Southern Financial that they tender their
shares in a tender or exchange offer commenced by a third party or (iii)
withdrawn or modified, in any manner that is adverse to Bankshares, its
recommendation or approval of this Agreement or the Merger or recommended to the
Southern Financial shareholders acceptance or approval of any alternative
Acquisition Proposal, or shall have resolved to do the foregoing.

          (h) This Agreement may be terminated any time prior to Closing by the
Board of Directors of Southern Financial at any time during the five-day period
following the Determination Date (as defined below), if:

                    (1) the Average Closing Price (as defined below) shall be
          less than the product of 0.80 and the Starting Price (as defined
          below); and

                    (2) (a) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing
          Price (as defined below) by the Starting Price (such number being
          referred to herein as the "Bankshares Ratio") shall be less than (b)
          the number obtained by dividing the Index Price (as defined below) on
          the Determination Date by the Index Price on the Starting Date (as
          defined below) and subtracting 0.20 from such quotient;

subject to the following. If Southern Financial elects to exercise its
termination right pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence, it shall give
prompt written notice to Bankshares; provided that such notice of election to
terminate may be withdrawn at any time within the aforementioned five-day
period. During the five-day period commencing with its receipt of such notice,
Bankshares shall have the option of increasing the Exchange Ratio and/or the
Cash Consideration in a manner such that the conditions set forth in either
clauses (1) or (2) above shall be deemed not to exist; provided, however, that
the Cash Consideration shall not be increased in a manner that would cause the
failure of the conditions set forth in Section 12.3 hereof. For purposes hereof,
the condition set forth in clause (1) above shall be deemed not to exist if the
Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Consideration is increased so that the Per Share
Consideration (as defined below) after such increase is not less than the Per
Share Consideration that would have been in effect if the condition set forth in
clause (1) above did not exist. For purposes hereof, the condition set forth in
clause (2) above shall be deemed not to exist if the


                                       -41-

<PAGE>

Exchange Ratio and/or the Cash Consideration is increased so that the Per Share
Consideration after such increase is not less than the Per Share Consideration
that would have been in effect if the condition set forth in clause (2) above
did not exist. If Bankshares makes this election, within such five-day period,
it shall give prompt written notice to Southern Financial of such election and
the revised Exchange Ratio and/or Cash Consideration, whereupon no termination
shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 9.1(h) and this Agreement shall
remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except as the Exchange Ratio
and/or Cash Consideration shall have been so modified), and any references in
this Agreement to "Exchange Ratio" and "Cash Consideration" shall thereafter be
deemed to refer to the Exchange Ratio and Cash Consideration after giving effect
to any adjustment made pursuant to this Section 9.1(h). For purposes of this
Section 9.1(h) and the following Section 9.1(i), the following terms shall have
the meanings indicated:

     "Average Closing Price" means the average of the last reported sale prices
per share of Bankshares Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq (as reported in
The Wall Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed
upon authoritative source) for the 20 consecutive trading days ending on the
Determination Date.

     "Determination Date" shall mean the date on which the last approval,
consent or waiver of any Governmental Entity required to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement is received, without regard to
any requisite waiting period in respect thereof.

     "Index Price" on a given date means the closing value of the Nasdaq Bank
Index.

     "Per Share Consideration" shall mean the sum of (A) the Exchange Ratio
multiplied by the Average Closing Price and (B) the Cash Consideration.

     "Starting Price" shall mean last reported sale prices per share of
Bankshares Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq (as reported in The Wall
Street Journal or, if not reported therein, in another mutually agreed upon
authoritative source) on the Starting Date.

     "Starting Date" shall mean the second full trading day after the
announcement by press release of the Merger.

     If Bankshares declares or effects a stock dividend, reclassification,
recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction between the Starting Date and the Determination Date, the prices for
the common stock of Bankshares shall be appropriately adjusted for the purposes
of applying this Section 9.1(h) and the following Section 9.1(i).

          (i) This Agreement may be terminated any time prior to Closing by the
Board of Directors of Southern Financial at any time during the three-day period
following the Determination Date, if:

                    (1) the Average Closing Price shall be less than the product
          of 0.70 and the Starting Price; and


                                       -42-

<PAGE>

                    (2) (a) the number obtained by dividing the Average Closing
          Price by the Starting Price shall be less than (b) the number obtained
          by dividing the Index Price on the Determination Date by the Index
          Price on the Starting Date and subtracting 0.30 from such quotient.

     Section 9.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Bankshares or Southern Financial as provided in Section 9.1
or the abandonment of the Merger without breach by any party hereto, this
Agreement (other than Section 7.2) shall become void and have no effect, without
any liability on the part of any party or its directors, officers or
shareholders. Nothing contained in this Section 9.2 shall relieve any party
hereto of any liability for a breach of this Agreement.

     Section 9.3. Termination Fee. To compensate Bankshares for entering into
this Agreement, taking actions to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereunder and incurring the costs and expenses related thereto and other losses
and expenses, including foregoing the pursuit of other opportunities by
Bankshares, Southern Financial and Bankshares agree as follows:

          (a) Provided that Bankshares shall not be in material breach of any
covenant or obligation under this Agreement (which breach has not been cured
promptly following receipt of written notice thereof by Southern Financial
specifying in reasonable detail the basis of such alleged breach), Southern
Financial shall pay to Bankshares the sum of $10,000,000 (the "Termination Fee")
if this Agreement is terminated (i) by Southern Financial under the provisions
of Section 9.1(f), (ii) by either Bankshares or Southern Financial under the
provisions of Section 9.1(d), if at the time of any failure by the shareholders
of Southern Financial to approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger there
shall exist an Acquisition Proposal with respect to Southern Financial and,
within twelve months of the termination of this Agreement, Southern Financial
enters into a definitive agreement with any third party with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or (iii) by Bankshares under the provisions of Section
9.1(g).

          (b) Any payment required by paragraph (a) of this Section 9.3 shall
become payable within two (2) business days after receipt by the non-terminating
party of written notice of termination of this Agreement.

          (c) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means a
written offer or proposal which contains a fixed price per share or a
mathematically ascertainable formula for calculating a price per share for the
Southern Financial Common Stock regarding any of the following (other than the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) involving Southern Financial or any
Subsidiary: (i) any merger, reorganization, consolidation, share exchange,
recapitalization, business combination, liquidation, dissolution or other
similar transaction involving any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of, all or substantially all of the assets or
equity securities or deposits of, Southern Financial or any Subsidiary, in a
single transaction or series of related transactions which could reasonably be
expected to impede, interfere with, prevent or materially delay the completion
of the Merger; (ii) any tender offer or exchange offer for 50% or more of the
outstanding shares of capital stock of Southern Financial or the filing of a
registration statement under the Securities Act in connection


                                       -43-

<PAGE>

therewith; or (iii) any public announcement of a proposal, plan or intention to
do any of the foregoing or any agreement to engage in any of the foregoing.

          (d) For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" means a bona
fide Acquisition Proposal made by a third person that the Board of Directors of
Southern Financial determines in its good faith judgment to be more favorable to
Southern Financial's shareholders than the Merger (taking into account, in good
faith, the written opinion, with only customary qualifications, of Southern
Financial's independent financial advisor that the value of the consideration to
Southern Financial's shareholders provided for in such proposal exceeds the
value of the consideration to Southern Financial's shareholders provided for in
the Merger) and for which financing, to the extent required, is then committed
or which, in the good faith judgment of the Board of Directors of Southern
Financial (taking into account, in good faith, the written advice of Southern
Financial's independent financial advisor), is reasonably capable of being
obtained by such third person.

("Southern Financial") and the beneficial holder of shares of common stock of
Southern Financial (the "Southern Financial Common Stock").

         Provident Bankshares Corporation ("Provident") and Southern Financial
are considering the execution of an Agreement and Plan of Reorganization (the
"Agreement") contemplating the acquisition of Southern Financial through the
merger of Southern Financial with and into Provident (the "Merger"). The
execution of the Agreement by Provident is subject to the execution and delivery
of this letter agreement.

         In consideration of the substantial expenses that Provident will incur
in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and to induce
Provident to execute the Agreement and to proceed to incur such expenses, the
undersigned agrees and undertakes, in his capacity as a shareholder of Southern
Financial, and not in his capacity as a director or officer of Southern
Financial, as follows:

         1. While this letter agreement is in effect the undersigned shall not,
directly or indirectly, (a) sell or otherwise dispose of or encumber prior to
the record date of Southern Financial's shareholder meeting any or all of his
shares of Southern Financial Common Stock, except (i) transfers by will or by
operation of law, in which case this Agreement shall bind the transferee, (ii)
transfers in connection with estate and tax planning purposes, including
transfers to relatives, trusts and charitable organizations, subject to the
transferee agreeing in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, or
(iii) transfers of shares acquired upon the exercise of stock options after the
date of this Agreement or in connection with the vesting of restricted stock, or
(b) deposit any shares of Southern Financial Common Stock into a voting trust or
enter into a voting agreement or arrangement with respect to any shares of
Southern Financial Common Stock or grant any proxy with respect thereto, other
than to other members of the Board of Directors of Southern Financial for the
purpose of voting to approve the Agreement and the Merger and matters related
thereto.

                              _______________, 2003

Provident Bankshares Corporation
114 Lexington Street
Baltimore, Maryland

Attn: Board of Directors

To the Board of Directors:

         I have been advised that I may be deemed to be, but do not admit that I
am, an "affiliate" of Southern Financial Bancorp, Inc., a Virginia corporation
("Southern Financial"), as that term is defined in Rule 144 and used in Rule 145
promulgated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). I understand that
pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Reorganization, dated as of
November ___, 2003 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and between Southern Financial
and Provident Bankshares Corporation, a Maryland corporation ("Provident"),
Southern Financial plans to merge with and into Provident (the "Merger").

         I further understand that as a result of the Merger, I will receive
shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Provident ("Provident
Common Stock") in exchange for shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of Southern Financial ("Southern Financial Common Stock").

         I have carefully read this letter and reviewed the Merger Agreement and
discussed their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to
sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of Provident Common Stock, to the extent I
felt necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Southern Financial.

         I represent, warrant and covenant with and to Provident that with
regard to any shares of Provident Common Stock that I receive as a result of the
Merger:

         1. I shall not make any sale, transfer, or other disposition of such
shares of Provident Common Stock unless (i) such sale, transfer or other
disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145 under the Securities Act (as such rule may be amended from time to time), or
(iii) in the opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Provident, or under a "no-action" letter obtained by me from the staff of the
SEC, such sale, transfer or other disposition will not violate the registration
requirements of, or is otherwise exempt from registration under, the Securities
Act.

<PAGE>

         2. I understand that Provident is under no obligation to register the
sale, transfer or other disposition of shares of Provident Common Stock by me or
on my behalf under the Securities Act or to take any other action necessary to
make compliance with an exemption from such registration available.

         3. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to
Provident's transfer agent with respect to shares of Provident Common Stock
issued to me as a result of the Merger and that there will be placed on the
certificates for such shares, or any substitutions therefor, a legend stating in
substance:

         "The shares represented by this certificate were issued as a result of
         the merger of Southern Financial Bancorp, Inc. with and into Provident
         Bankshares Corporation on ______________, 2004, in a transaction to
         which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933 applies.
         The shares represented by this certificate may be transferred only in
         accordance with the terms of a letter agreement between the registered
         holder hereof and Provident Bankshares Corporation, a copy of which
         agreement is on file at the principal offices of Provident Bankshares
         Corporation."

         4. I understand that, unless transfer by me of the Provident Common
Stock issued to me as a result of the Merger has been registered under the
Securities Act or such transfer is made in conformity with the provisions of
Rule 145(d) under the Securities Act, Provident reserves the right, in its sole
discretion, to place the following legend on the certificates issued to my
transferee:

         "The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered
         under the Securities Act of 1933 and were acquired from [SHAREHOLDER]
         who, in turn, received such shares as a result of the merger of
         Southern Financial Bancorp, Inc. with and into Provident Bankshares
         Corporation on ______________, 2004, in a transaction to which Rule 145
         under the Securities Act of 1933 applies. The shares have been acquired
         by the holder not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
         distribution thereof within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933
         and may not be offered, sold, pledged or otherwise transferred except
         in accordance with an exemption from the registration requirements of
         the Securities Act of 1933."

         It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraphs
(3) and (4) above shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificates
without such legends if I shall have delivered to Provident (i) a copy of a "no
action" letter from the staff of the SEC, or an opinion of counsel in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Provident, to the effect that such legend
is not required for purposes of the Act, or (ii) evidence or representations
satisfactory to Provident that Provident Common Stock represented by such
certificates is being or has been sold in conformity with the provisions of Rule
145(d).

<PAGE>

         I further understand and agree that the provisions of Rule 145 shall
apply to all shares of Provident Common Stock that my spouse, any relative of
mine, or any relative of my spouse, any one of whom has the same home as me,
receives as a result of the Merger and I further represent, warrant and covenant
with and to Provident that I will have, and will cause each of such persons to
have, all shares of Southern Financial Common Stock owned (other than shares
held through tax-qualified retirement or benefit plans) by me or such persons
registered in my name or the name of such persons, as applicable, prior to the
effective date of the Merger and not in the name of any bank, broker or dealer,
nominee or clearing house.

                                           Very truly yours,

                                           By: ________________________________
