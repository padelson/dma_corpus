satisfactory to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying_ ___Agent_
") for the payment and delivery of the Merger Consideration, as provided in
_Section 3.1(b)_. On or before the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, with the Paying Agent cash in immediately available
funds in an amount sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration (such cash
amount, the " _Exchange Fund_ "), for the sole benefit of the holders of
shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to make,
and the Paying Agent shall make, payments of the Merger Consideration out of
the Exchange Fund in accordance with this Agreement and the Articles of
Merger. The Exchange Fund shall not be used for any other purpose. Any and all
interest earned on cash deposited in the Exchange Fund shall be paid to the
Surviving Entity.

 



 

(b) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of
the Company shall be closed, and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock. From and after
the Effective Time, Persons who held shares of Company Common Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have rights with
respect to such shares, except as otherwise provided for herein. On or after
the Effective Time, any Certificates presented to the Paying Agent or the
Surviving Entity for any reason shall be exchanged for the applicable Merger
Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly
represented thereby.

 



 

(c) _Payment Procedures_.

 



 

(i) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time (but in no event
later than two (2) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Entity shall cause
the Paying Agent to mail (and to make available for collection by hand) to
each holder of record of a Certificate (A) a letter of transmittal in such
form as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree (a " _Letter of
Transmittal_ "), which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk
of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof subject to the posting
of a bond as required by Section 3.5) to the Paying Agent, and which Letter of
Transmittal shall be in such form and have such other customary provisions as
the Company and Parent may reasonably agree upon prior to the Closing, and (B)
instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in
exchange for the Merger Consideration into which the number of shares of
Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have
been converted pursuant to this Agreement (which instructions shall provide
that, at the election of the surrendering holder, (1) Certificates may be
surrendered by hand delivery or otherwise or (2) the Merger Consideration in
exchange therefor may be collected by check or wire transfer to the
surrendering holder).

 



 

(ii) Upon surrender of a Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof
subject to the posting of a bond as required by Section 3.5) to the Paying
Agent, together with a Letter of Transmittal duly completed and validly
executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holder of such
Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange

 



      
 

 



 

therefor the Merger Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock
formerly represented by such Certificate by check or wire transfer to be
mailed or delivered by wire transfer, within two (2) Business Days following
the later to occur of (A) the Effective Time or (B) the Paying Agents receipt
of such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof subject to the
posting of a bond as required by Section 3.5), and the Certificate (or
affidavit of loss in lieu thereof subject to the posting of a bond as required
by Section 3.5) so surrendered shall be forthwith cancelled. The Paying Agent
shall accept such Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof subject
to the posting of a bond as required by Section 3.5) upon compliance with such
reasonable terms and conditions as the Paying Agent may impose to effect an
orderly exchange thereof in accordance with customary exchange practices.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2_, each Certificate
shall be deemed, at any time after the Effective Time, to represent only the
right to receive, upon such surrender, the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article III_. No interest shall be paid or accrued for
the benefit of holders of the Certificates on the Merger Consideration payable
upon the surrender of the Certificates.

 



 

(iii) Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary
form (or any other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request), the Paying Agent shall, as promptly as practicable, issue
and deliver to each holder of record of Book-Entry Shares the Merger
Consideration that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the
provisions of _Section 3.1(b)_, in each case without such holder being
required to deliver a Certificate or an executed Letter of Transmittal to the
Paying Agent, and such Book-Entry Shares shall then be canceled. No interest
shall be paid or accrued for the benefit of holders of Book-Entry Shares on
the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Book-Entry Shares.

 



 

(iv) In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common Stock
that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, it shall be a
condition of payment that any Certificate surrendered in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this _Section 3.2(c)_ shall be properly endorsed or
shall be otherwise in proper form for transfer, or any Book-Entry Share shall
be properly transferred, and that the Person requesting such payment shall
have paid any transfer Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
or Book-Entry Share surrendered or shall have established to the reasonable
satisfaction of Parent that such Tax either has been paid or is not
applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2(c)_, each
share of Company Common Stock shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Section 3.2_.

 



 

(d) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest and other income received with respect thereto) which
remains undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
on the first (1st) anniversary of the Effective Time shall be delivered to
Parent, upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock
who have not theretofore received any Merger Consideration to which they are
entitled under this _Article III_ shall thereafter look only to Parent and
the Surviving Entity for payment of their claims with respect thereto.

 



       
 

 



 

(e) _No Liability_. None of the Parent Parties, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Surviving Entity or the Paying Agent, or any employee, officer, director,
agent or Affiliate of any of them, shall be liable to any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock in respect of any part of the Merger Consideration
delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar Law. Any amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of any such
shares immediately prior to the time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to, or become property of, any Governmental Authority shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Entity, free and clear of any claims or interest of any such holders or their
successors, assigns or personal representatives previously entitled thereto.

 



 

Section 3.3 _Redemption of Company Preferred Stock_. The Merger shall have no
effect on the Company Series A Preferred Stock or the Company Series B
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time

the Company Series B Preferred Stock shall remain outstanding and shall
continue to be Company Series A Preferred Stock and the Company Series B
Preferred Stock, respectively, of the Surviving Entity; _provided_ , _however_
, that the Surviving Entity shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity

terms of the Company Charter, all amounts that are required to be paid at the
times they are required to be paid in connection with the exercise of such
Special Optional Redemption Right, including the redemption price in respect
thereof and all other fees and expenses that may be payable in connection
therewith (and Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to have immediately
available funds necessary to take such actions) (the actions contemplated by
clauses (i) and (ii), collectively, the " _Preferred Stock Redemption_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that the Surviving Entity shall be solely responsible
for any and all liabilities arising out of or relating to the failure to pay
any such amounts on a timely basis. Prior to Closing, the Company will, at

Stock underlying such Company Options times (ii) (x) the Merger Consideration

then-outstanding shares of Company Restricted Stock shall become fully vested

Code other than a violation which has been cured pursuant to any applicable
provisions of Section 856 of the Code so as not to cause the Company to fail
to qualify as a REIT for any such year and which has not and reasonably could
not be expected to result in any material Tax liability.

 



 

(d) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary holds, directly or
indirectly, any asset the disposition of which would be subject to (or to
rules similar to) Section 1374 of the Code (or otherwise result in any "built-

expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect; (iii) neither the Company

or waiver of) the limitation period for the assessment or collection of any
Tax that has not since expired, and no power of attorney with respect to any
Tax matter is currently in force; and (iv) neither the Company nor any Company
Subsidiary has entered into any "closing agreement" as described in Section
7121 of the Code (or any corresponding or similar provision of state, local or

Subsidiary has incurred any material liability for Taxes under Sections

liability for any other Taxes other than (x) in the ordinary course of
business, or (y) transfer or similar Taxes arising in connection with

respects with all applicable Laws relating to the payment and withholding of

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto, and the Company and the Parent Parties shall

its stockholders that they give the Company Stockholder Approval, include such
recommendation in the Proxy Statement and solicit and use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the Company Stockholder Approval, except to the
extent that the Company Board shall have made an Adverse Recommendation Change
in accordance with the terms of _Section 6.4_. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this _Section 6.2(c)_, if, on a date for which the Company
Stockholder Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not received proxies
representing a sufficient number of shares of Company Common Stock to obtain
the Company Stockholder Approval, whether or not a quorum is present, the

adjournments of the Company Stockholder Meeting.

and financial advisors, constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (y) determines in
good faith, following consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the directors duties under applicable Law, and in such case the Company
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ and enter into
a Contract with respect to such Superior Proposal; _provided_ that the
applicable Takeover Proposal was not the result of a violation of _Section
6.4(a)_, or (ii) make an Adverse Recommendation Change as a result of an
Intervening Event, if the Company Board determines in good faith, following
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that failure to take such action
would be inconsistent with the directors duties under applicable Law.

 



 

(f) The Company Board shall not be entitled to effect an Adverse
Recommendation Change pursuant to _Section 6.4(e)_ or terminate this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii) _unless (i) the Company has
provided a written notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal/Intervening Event_
") to Parent that the Company intends to take such action, specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons therefor and, (A) in the case of a Superior
Proposal, describing the material terms and conditions of, and attaching to
such notice the most recent draft of, the Superior Proposal that is the basis
of such action, and (B) in the case of an Intervening Event, the material
facts and circumstances (based on information reasonably available) related to
such Intervening Event, (ii) during the three (3) Business Day period
following Parents receipt of the Notice of Superior Proposal/Intervening
Event, the Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, negotiate
with Parent in good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
action is no longer necessary, and (iii) following the end of the three (3)
Business Day period, the Company

 



      
 

 



 

Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, taking into account any changes to this Agreement proposed in
writing by Parent in response to the Notice of Superior Proposal/Intervening
Event or otherwise, that the failure to make an Adverse Recommendation Change
pursuant to _Section 6.4(e)_ or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
8.1(c)(ii)_ would still be inconsistent with the directors duties under
applicable Law, subject to the payment obligations set forth in _Section
8.3_; provided that any amendment to the financial terms or any other material
amendment of such Takeover Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior
Proposal/Intervening Event and the Company shall be required to comply again
with the requirements of this _Section 6.4(f)_ (except that in the case of
such an amendment, the references to three (3) Business Days in this _Section
6.4(f)_ shall instead be two (2) Business Days).

 



 

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from
complying with Rules 14a-9, 14d-9, 14e-2 and Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
statement pending disclosure of its position thereunder or making any required
disclosure to the Companys stockholders if, in the good faith judgment of the
Company Board, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, the failure
to do so would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the directors
duties under applicable Law or such disclosure is otherwise required under
applicable Law.

Section 6.5 _Appropriate Action; Consents; Filings_.

 



 

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement,
each of the Company and the Parent Parties shall (or shall cause the Company
Subsidiaries and the Parent Subsidiaries, respectively, to) use its
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions,
and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other
party in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable Law
or pursuant to any contract or agreement to which it is a party to consummate
and make effective, as promptly as practicable, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) the taking of all
actions necessary to cause the conditions to Closing set forth in _Article
VII_ to be satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or
nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Authorities or

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the making of all
necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental
Authorities, if any) and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be

contemplated by this Agreement, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including seeking to have any stay or

to enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, and (iv) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate

the Company Subsidiaries, respectively, to give) any notices to Third Parties,
and each of the Parent Parties and the Company shall use, and cause each of
their respective Affiliates to use, its commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain any third party consents not covered by _Section 6.5(a)_ that are
necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Merger. Each of the parties
hereto will furnish to the other such necessary information and commercially
reasonable assistance as the other may request in connection with the
preparation of any required governmental filings or submissions and will
cooperate in responding to any inquiry from a Governmental Authority,
including

 



      
 

 



 

promptly informing the other party of such inquiry, consulting in advance
before making any presentations or submissions to a Governmental Authority,
and supplying each other with copies of all material correspondence, filings
or communications between either party and any Governmental Authority with
respect to this Agreement. To the extent reasonably practicable, the parties
or their Representatives shall have the right to review in advance and each of
the parties will consult the others on, all the information relating to the
other and each of their Affiliates that appears in any filing made with, or
written materials submitted to, any Governmental Authority in connection with
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, except
that confidential competitively sensitive business information may be redacted
from such exchanges. To the extent reasonably practicable, neither the Company
nor the Parent Parties shall, nor shall they permit their respective
Representatives to, participate independently in any meeting or engage in any
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of any
filing, investigation or other inquiry without giving the other party prior
notice of such meeting or conversation and, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, without giving the other party the opportunity to attend or
participate (whether by telephone or in person) in any such meeting with such
Governmental Authority. Notwithstanding the foregoing, obtaining any approval
or consent from any third party pursuant to this _Section 6.5(b)_ shall not
be a condition to the obligations of the Parent Parties and Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, in connection
with obtaining any approval or consent from any Person (other than any
Governmental Authority) with respect to the Merger, none of the Company, the
Parent Parties, any of the Company Subsidiaries, any of the Parent
Subsidiaries or any of the their respective Representatives, shall be
obligated to pay or commit to pay to such Person whose approval or consent is
being solicited any cash or other consideration, make any accommodation or
commitment or incur any liability or other obligation to such Person. The
parties shall cooperate with respect to accommodations that may be requested
or appropriate to obtain such consents.

 



 

Section 6.6 _Notification of Certain Matters; Transaction Litigation_.

 



 

(a) The Company shall give prompt notice to Parent, and the Parent Parties
shall give prompt notice to the Company, of any notice or other communication
received by such party from any Governmental Authority in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or
may be required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) The Company shall control the defense or settlement of any Action against
the Company, any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors or officers by any stockholder of the Company arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
including the Merger, and the disclosure of information in connection
therewith shall be subject to the provisions of _Section 6.3_, including
regarding attorney-client privilege or other applicable legal privilege. The
Company shall not settle any litigation against the Company or its directors,
executive officers or similar persons by any stockholder of the Company
relating to this Agreement, the Merger, or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement without the prior written consent of Parent (which shall not
be

 



      
 

 



 

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except for settlements
providing solely for (a) money damages and the payment of attorneys fees in
an aggregate amount (together with all other settlements entered into pursuant
to this _Section 6.6(b)_) not in excess of amounts equal to the dollar amount
of the limits of the Companys insurance and/or (b) providing additional
disclosure in the Proxy Statement that does not disparage the Parent Parties,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Entity, any of their respective
Affiliates or any of their respective businesses.

 



 

Section 6.7 _Public Announcements_. The Company, the Parent Parties and Merger
Sub shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, consult with each other
before issuing any press release or otherwise making any public statements or
filings with respect to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby, and none of the parties shall issue any such press release or make any
such public filing prior to obtaining the other parties consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _however_ , that a party may, without obtaining the other
parties consent, issue such press release or make such public statement or
filing to the extent required by Law, Order or the applicable rules of any
stock exchange or the applicable provisions of any listing agreement of any
party hereto. If for any reason it is not practicable to consult with the
other party before making any public statement with respect to this Agreement
or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, then the party making such
statement shall not make a statement that is inconsistent with public
statements or filings to which the other party had previously consented;
_provided_ , _further_ , that such consultation and consent shall not be
required with respect to any release, communication or announcement permitted
by _Section 6.4_.

 



 

Section 6.8 _Directors  and Officers Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) To the fullest extent permitted by Law, from and after the Effective Time,
the Surviving Entity shall provide exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses for each Indemnitee, which is at least as favorable in
scope and amount to such Indemnitee as the exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses provided to such Indemnitee by the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries, as applicable, immediately prior to the Effective Time
in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws or each of the Company
Subsidiaries respective articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws
(or comparable organizational or governing documents), as in effect on the
date of this Agreement; _provided_ that such exculpation, indemnification and
advancement of expenses covers actions and omissions at or prior to the
Effective Time, including all transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting the provisions of _Section 6.8(a)_ or any additional
rights that any Indemnitee may have under any employment or indemnification
agreement or under the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws, during the
period commencing as of the Effective Time and ending on the sixth (6th)
anniversary of the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall, to the fullest
extent permitted by Law (and Parent shall take such corporate action as may be
required to cause the Surviving Entity to): (i) indemnify, defend and hold
harmless each Indemnitee against and from any costs or expenses (including
attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any Action, whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative, to the extent such Action arises
out of or pertains to (x) any action or omission or alleged action or omission
in such

 



      
 

 



 

Indemnitees capacity as a director, officer, partner, member, manager,
trustee or employee of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or of
any other corporation, partnership, limited partnership, limited liability
company, trust, association, employee benefit plan or other enterprise for
whom such person served in such capacity at the request of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, or (y) this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger; and (ii) promptly pay in advance of
the final disposition of any such Action the expenses (including attorneys
fees and any expenses incurred in defending, serving as a witness with respect
to or otherwise participating in any claim in advance of final disposition of
such claim, including payment on behalf of or advancement to the Indemnitee of
any expenses incurred by the Indemnitee in connection with enforcing any
rights with respect to such indemnification and/or advancement, in each case
without the requirement of posting a bond or other security) of any Indemnitee
subject to the receipt of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Indemnitee to
repay such amount if it shall ultimately be determined that such Indemnitee is
not entitled to be indemnified, including a good faith affirmation by such
Indemnitee of such Indemnitees compliance with the standard of conduct
required in the Company Charter and the Company Bylaws or the applicable
Company Subsidiarys articles or certificates of incorporation or bylaws (or
comparable organizational or governing documents), as in effect on the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that (i) the Surviving Entity shall have the
right to defend such action and to designate counsel to defend such action
and, after assuming such defense, notwithstanding anything contained in
_Section 6.8(a)_ or _Section 6.8(b)_, as the case may be, to the contrary,
the Surviving Entity shall not be liable to the Indemnitee for any fees,
expenses or costs in connection with such claim; _provided_ , however, that in
the event that the Indemnitees counsel determines that there is a conflict of
interest between the Surviving Entitys position and the Indemnitees position
then the Indemnitee shall have the right to designate one counsel of their own
at the Surviving Entitys expense, _provided_ , that the Surviving Entity
shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more than one counsel
(selected by a plurality of the applicable Indemnitees) for all Indemnitees in
any jurisdiction with respect to any single claim; and (ii) the Surviving
Entity shall not be liable for any amounts paid in settlement effected without
its prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
conditioned, withheld or delayed). The indemnification and advancement
obligations of the Surviving Entity pursuant to this _Section 6.8_ shall
extend to acts or omissions occurring at or before the Effective Time and any
claim relating thereto. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in
this Agreement, neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnitee to the extent that a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine in a final and non-appealable order that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable Law, in which case the Indemnitee
shall promptly refund to the Surviving Entity the amount of all such expenses
theretofore advanced pursuant hereto.

 



 

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall or, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity as of the Effective Time
to, obtain and fully pay the premium for the non-cancellable extension of the
coverage afforded by the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance policies and the Companys existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies (collectively, the " _D andO Insurance_"), in each case, for a claims
reporting or discovery period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time with respect to any claim related to any period of time at or
prior to the Effective Time from one or more insurance carriers with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance

 



      
 

 



 

carrier with respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions and retentions
that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage provided under
the Companys existing policies and with limits of liability that are no lower
than the limits on the Companys existing policies. If the Company or the
Surviving Entity for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" insurance policies
as of the Effective Time, either: (i) the Surviving Entity shall continue to
maintain in effect, for a period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time, the DandO Insurance in place as of the date hereof with the
Companys current insurance carrier or with an insurance carrier with the same
or better credit rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with
respect to DandO Insurance with terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
liability that are no less favorable in the aggregate than the coverage
provided under the Companys existing policies as of the date hereof, or (ii)
Parent shall provide, or shall cause the Surviving Entity to provide, for a
period of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time, the
Indemnitees who are insured under the Companys DandO Insurance with comparable
DandO Insurance that provides coverage for events occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit rating
as the Companys current insurance carrier, that is no less favorable in the
aggregate than the existing policy of the Company or, if substantially
equivalent insurance coverage is unavailable, the best available coverage;
_provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the Surviving Entity shall not be
required to pay an annual premium for the DandO Insurance in excess of 250% of
the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such insurance; and
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall be obligated
to obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available, with respect to
matters occurring prior to the Effective Time, for a cost not exceeding such
amount.

 



 

(d) The Indemnitees to whom this _Section 6.8_ applies are intended to be
third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 6.8_. The provisions of this
_Section 6.8_ are intended to be for the benefit of each Indemnitee and his
or her successors, heirs, executors, trustees, fiduciaries, administrators or
representatives. Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnitee in successfully
enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 6.8_.

 



 

(e) The rights of each Indemnitee under this _Section 6.8_ shall be in
addition to, and shall not be deemed to be exclusive of, any rights such
Person or any employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary may have under
the Company Charter, the Company Bylaws or the certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or equivalent organizational or governing documents) of any of the
Company Subsidiaries, or the Surviving Entity or any of its subsidiaries, or
under any applicable Law or under any agreement of any Indemnitee or any
employee with the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries. Nothing in this
Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall release, waive or
impair any rights to directors and officers insurance claims under any
policy that is or has been in existence with respect to the Company or its
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.8_ is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding anything contained in _Section 9.1_ or _Section 9.7_ to
the contrary, this _Section 6.8_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger
indefinitely and shall be binding, jointly and severally, on all successors
and assigns of Parent, the Surviving Entity and its subsidiaries, and shall be
enforceable by the Indemnitees and their successors, heirs or

 



      
 

 



 

representatives. In the event that Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of
its successors or assigns consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or transfers or conveys all or a majority of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Entity, as applicable, shall succeed to the obligations set forth in
this _Section 6.8_. The parties acknowledge and agree that Parent guarantees
the payment and performance of the Surviving Entitys obligations pursuant to
this _Section 6.8_.

 



 

Section 6.9 _Employee Benefit Matters_.

 



 

(a) For a period of one year following the Effective Time, Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, to employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries who are employed by the Company or the Company
Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time who continue in the
employ of Parent, the Surviving Entity or any of their respective affiliates
on or after the Effective Time (" _Continuing Employees_ ") compensation and
employee benefits that are, in the aggregate, substantially comparable to
those provided to the Continuing Employees immediately before the Effective
Time.

 



 

(b) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and for calculating
severance and vacation entitlements under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and the Surviving Entity (each, a " _New Plan_ "), each Continuing Employee
shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors before the Effective
Time, to the same extent as such Continuing Employee was entitled, before the
Effective Time, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated or was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , that the
foregoing shall not apply (i) with respect to accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan, (ii) to the extent that its application would result in a
duplication of benefits, or (iii) with respect to any newly established New
Plan for which prior service is not taken into account for employees of Parent
or any of its affiliates. In addition and without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, for purposes of each New Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, Parent shall
make all commercially reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition
exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for
such employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would
not have been waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time (such
plans, collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and Parent shall make all
commercially reasonable efforts to cause any eligible expenses incurred by
such employee and his or her covered dependents during the portion of the plan
year of the Old Plans ending on the date such employees participation in the
corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for
purposes of satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket
requirements applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for
the applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with
such New Plan.

 



 

(c) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee,
Continuing Employee or other Person any right to continue in the employ or
service of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company, the Surviving Entity, Parent or any of their respective affiliates.
No provision of this Agreement: (i) shall limit the ability of the Company or
any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the Surviving
Entity and its affiliates) to amend, modify or terminate in accordance with
its terms any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement, contract,
policy or arrangement at any time assumed, established, sponsored or
maintained by any of them, (ii) shall be deemed or construed to amend,
establish, or modify any benefit or compensation plan, program, agreement,
contract, policy or arrangement, or (iii) create any third party beneficiary
rights or obligations in any person (including any current or former service
provider or employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries (or any
beneficiaries or dependents thereof)) or any right to employment or continued
employment or to a particular term or condition of employment with the Company
or any of its affiliates (including, following the Effective Time, the
Surviving Entity and its affiliates).

 



 

Section 6.10 _Merger Sub_. The Parent Parties and Merger Sub shall take all
actions necessary to (a) cause Merger Sub to perform its obligations under
this Agreement and to consummate the Merger on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and (b) ensure that, prior to the Effective Time,
Merger Sub shall not conduct any business or make any investments or incur or
guarantee any indebtedness other than as specifically contemplated by this
Agreement.

 



 

Section 6.11 _Voting of Shares_. The Parent Parties shall vote all shares of
Company Common Stock beneficially owned by them or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries as of the record date for the Company Stockholder Meeting, if
any, in favor of approval of the Merger.

 



 

Section 6.12 _Financing_.

 



 

(a) Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall use its best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the Debt Financing and
obtain the proceeds of the Debt Financing on the Closing Date on the terms and
conditions described in the Commitment Letters, including using best efforts
to (i) maintain in effect and enforce the Commitment Letters until the
expiration thereof in accordance with their terms, (ii) negotiate, execute and
deliver definitive agreements with respect to the Debt Financing (the "
_Definitive Financing Agreements_ ") consistent with the terms and conditions
contained therein (including, as necessary, any "flex" provisions), and (iii)
satisfy (or, if deemed advisable by Parent, obtain the waiver of) on a timely
basis all conditions in the Commitment Letters and the Definitive Financing
Agreements and comply with its obligations thereunder. Parent shall, upon
request, keep the Company informed in reasonable detail of the then current
status of its efforts to arrange the Debt Financing or any Alternative
Financing.

 



 

(b) If, notwithstanding the use of best efforts by Parent to satisfy its
obligations under this _Section 6.12_, the Commitment Letters (or any
Definitive Financing Agreements relating to the Debt Financing) expire or are
terminated prior to the Closing, in whole or in part, for any reason,
including as a result of a breach or repudiation or if any portion of the Debt
Financing otherwise becomes unavailable, regardless of the reason therefor
(other than a breach by the Company of this Agreement which prevents or
renders impracticable the consummation of the Debt Financing) Parent will (i)
use its best efforts to obtain alternative debt

 



      
 

 



 

or equity financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") in an amount sufficient,
when taken together with available Liquid Assets and any then-available Debt
Financing pursuant to any then-existing Commitment Letters, to consummate the
Merger and to pay related fees and expenses earned, due and payable by Parent
as of the Closing Date and which do not include any incremental conditionality
to the consummation of such Alternative Financing that are more onerous to
Parent or to the Company (in the aggregate) than the conditions set forth in
the Commitment Letters in effect as of the date hereof, and (ii) promptly
notify the Company of such unavailability and the reason therefor.

 



 

(c) Parent shall promptly notify the Company in writing (i) if Parent has
actual knowledge of any material breach or default (or any event or
circumstance that, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would
reasonably be expected to give rise to any material breach or default) by any
party to any Commitment Letter, (ii) of the receipt by Parent or Merger Sub of
any written notice or other written communication from a Lender with respect
to any actual breach, default, termination or repudiation by any party to any
of the Commitment Letters or (iii) if, for any reason, Parent no longer
believes in good faith that it will be able to obtain the Debt Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters on the terms described therein in an
amount sufficient, when taken together with available Liquid Assets and any
then-available Debt Financing pursuant to any then-existing Commitment
Letters, to consummate the Merger and to pay any related fees and expenses
incurred by the Parent Parties, Merger Sub and, to the extent responsible
therefor hereunder, the Company, and any repayment or refinancing of any
Indebtedness of the Company or any Company Subsidiaries that Parent elects to
so repay or refinance as of the Closing Date. Parent and Merger Sub shall not
consent to (1) any amendment or modification to, or any waiver of any
provision under, any Commitment Letter if such amendment, modification or
waiver imposes new or additional conditions, or otherwise expands any of the
conditions, to the receipt of the Debt Financing, extends the timing of the
funding of the commitments thereunder to a date after the Closing Date,
shortens the term of the commitments under the applicable Commitment Letter to
a date earlier than the date set forth therein as of the date hereof or
reduces the aggregate cash amount of the funding commitments thereunder which
would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of _Section 5.8_ hereunder,
(2) any other amendment, modification to, or any waiver of any provision
under, any Commitment Letter that would reasonably be expected to materially
adversely affect the ability of Parent and Merger Sub to consummate the

under the Existing Loan Documents (and any other party whose consent is
required under the Existing Loan Documents) (the " _Existing Lenders_ ") a
notice(s) prepared by Parent, in form and substance reasonably approved by the
Company, regarding (i) the assumption, prepayment or defeasance of the

this Agreement is not subject to any condition or contingency with respect to
the receipt of any tenant estoppel certificate or the consent of any Existing
Lender or the modification of any of the Existing Loan Documents.

(a) _REIT Matters_. During the Interim Period, the Company agrees to

respect to maintaining the status of the Company as a REIT for the Companys
taxable year that includes the Effective Time.

use their commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as reasonably may
be necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any real property transfer or
gains, sales, use, transfer, value added, stock transfer or stamp taxes, any
transfer, recording, registration and other fees and any similar taxes that
become payable in connection with the transactions contemplated in this
Agreement.

cause to be prepared and file or cause to be filed all Tax Returns required to

prepared in a manner consistent with the historic Tax accounting practices of
the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, as applicable (except as

 



      
 

 



 

may be required under applicable Tax Law). The Company and the Company

Closing Returns. The Company shall provide to Parent copies of any Pre-Closing

for review by Parent, and Parent shall provide any comments it may have with
respect to a Pre-Closing Income Tax Return at least five (5) days prior to the
due date of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Return (including applicable

Parent with respect to such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns, but only to the
extent that such comments are necessary to cause such Pre-Closing Income Tax
Returns to be prepared in compliance with applicable Tax Law, in a manner
consistent with the historic Tax accounting practices applicable to the
preparation of such Pre-Closing Income Tax Returns, or, if there are no such
historic Tax accounting practices, in a manner that does not have the effect
of distorting the reporting of income or the claiming of expenses or losses in
the applicable tax period to which the Pre-Closing Income Tax Return relates.

 



 

(d) _REIT Opinion_. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain the tax opinion described in _Section 7.2(d)_ dated as of the Closing

written instrument reasonably satisfactory to the Company pursuant to which
the New Guarantor agrees to be bound by the terms of this Agreement as a
"Parent Party" hereunder in accordance with this _Section 6.16(b)_ and
_Section 9.5_, which written instrument (or separate disclosure letter)
states the Net Worth and Liquid Assets of the New Guarantor and the aggregate
Net Worth and Liquid Assets of all of the Parent Parties, and, in connection
therewith, reduce their respective Net Worth and Liquid Assets on a dollar-
for-dollar basis by the amount of the Net Worth and Liquid Assets of the New
Guarantor, and, upon such assignment or delegation, such New Guarantor shall
become a party to this Agreement and be deemed to be a Parent Party for all
purposes hereunder. Prior to any such

 



      
 

 



 

assignment or delegation, the Parent Party that proposes to assign or delegate
any of its rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall deliver to the
Company written notice of the proposed assignment or delegation, which written
notice shall be accompanied by the most recent quarterly unaudited
consolidated balance sheet for the latest quarterly period and related

6.16(b)_, all of which shall be certified by Parents chief financial or
similar officer to be true, complete and correct. The Company shall have the
right to object to and prevent any such assignment or delegation if such
assignment or delegation either (i) would reasonably be expected to delay the
Closing in the manner described in _Section 9.5_ or beyond the date that is
ten (10) days prior to the Outside Date, or (ii) does not comply in all
respects with the terms of this _Section 6.16(b)_ and _Section 9.5_, by
written notice of such objection including the reasons therefor delivered to
Parent within five (5) Business Days following the receipt of the written
notice of such proposed assignment or delegation, and such assignment or
delegation shall not be permitted hereunder until any such objection is
resolved to the reasonable satisfaction of the Company. If the Company objects
to any such assignment or delegation in accordance with the immediately
preceding sentence, the Company and Parent shall attempt to resolve such
objection in good faith with a view towards maintaining the intent and
purposes of this _Section 6.16_.

is actually paid to the Company pursuant to _Section 8.3(b_), Parent shall
maintain Liquid Assets of at least $125,000,000.

 



 

(d) During the Interim Period, neither the Parent Parties nor any of the
Parent Subsidiaries shall take or agree to take any action (including entering
into agreements with respect to any equity investments, joint ventures,
acquisitions, mergers, consolidations or business combinations) which would
reasonably be expected to (i) reduce the Net Worth or Liquid Assets of the
Parent Parties below the amounts set forth on _Section 5.11_ of the Parent
Disclosure Letter, or (ii) otherwise materially delay or materially and
adversely affect the Parent Parties ability to pay the Merger Consideration
or consummate the Merger and the Debt Financing.

 



 

(e) During the Interim Period, within forty five (45) days after the end of
each fiscal quarter, Parent shall furnish to the Company a quarterly unaudited
consolidated balance sheet for the latest quarterly period and related
unaudited consolidated statements of comprehensive income and changes in
partners capital for the period then ended, including a then current
calculation of the Net Worth and Liquid Assets of the Parent Parties,
certified by Parents chief financial or similar officer to be true, complete
and correct.

Agreement is terminated:

 



 

(i) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_ or by
Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ and, in either case, the Company (x)
receives or has received a Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement,
which proposal has been publicly announced and not subsequently withdrawn (a "
_Qualifying Proposal_ ") and (y) within twelve (12) months of the termination
of this Agreement, consummates a transaction regarding, or executes a
definitive agreement which is later consummated with respect to, such
Qualifying Proposal, then the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to
Parent a fee equal to $30,000,000 (the " _Company Termination Fee_ ") by wire
transfer of same day funds to an account designated by Parent, not later than
two (2) Business Days following the consummation of such transaction arising
from such Qualifying Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of
this _Section 8.3(a)(i)_, the references to "twenty percent (20%)" in the
definition of Takeover Proposal shall be deemed to be references to "fifty
percent (50%)"; or

 



 

(ii) (A) by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(ii)_ or (B) Parent
pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, as applicable, then the Company shall pay,

Days of such termination; and/or

 



 

(iii) (A) by either the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(b)(iii)_,

to _Section 8.1(d)(ii)_, or (D) by Parent pursuant to _Section 8.1(d)(i)_ in
circumstances where the Company Termination Fee is payable pursuant to
_Section 8.3(a)(i)_ or because the Company fails to deliver to Parent the
REIT Opinion pursuant to _Section 7.2(d)_, then the Company shall reimburse
Parent for its actual reasonable out-of-pocket Expenses up to a maximum amount
of $5,000,000 by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by
Parent within thirty (30) days after receipt by the Company of written notice
of demand for payment and a documented itemization setting forth in reasonable
detail all such Expenses of Parent (the " _Expense Reimbursement_ "). For the
avoidance of doubt, in the event the Company Termination Fee is payable

 



      
 

 



 

pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)(i)_ or _8.3(a)(ii)_ above, then, subject to
_Section 8.3(c)(ii)_, in either case the Company shall reimburse Parent for
its actual reasonable out-of-pocket Expenses in accordance with this _Section
8.3(a)(iii)_.

 



 

(b) _Parent Termination Fee Option_. If, but only if, this Agreement is
terminable by the Company pursuant to _Section 8.1(c)(iii)_ or _8.1(c)(iv)_ ,
then the Company may elect, at its option in its sole and absolute discretion,
either of the following: (i) to terminate this Agreement in accordance with

Company an aggregate amount equal to $100,000,000 (the " _Parent Termination
Fee_ ") by wire transfer of same day funds to an account designated by the
Company, within two (2) Business Days of such termination; or (ii) sue for
specific performance of the Parent Parties and Merger Subs obligations under
this Agreement, it being understood that the Company shall have the right of
injunctive relief under _Section 9.8_ to enforce the Parent Parties and
Merger Subs obligations hereunder.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, the
parties agree that:

 



 

(i) under no circumstances shall (A) the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement earlier than one (1) full
Business Day after receipt of appropriate wire transfer instructions from
Parent, or (B) Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee earlier
than one (1) full Business Day after receipt of appropriate wire transfer
instructions from the Company; and

 



 

(ii) under no circumstances shall (A) the Company be required to pay the
Company Termination Fee or Expense Reimbursement on more than one occasion, or
(B) Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on more than one
occasion.

 



 

(d) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this _Section 8.3_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, (ii) none of the Company Termination Fee, the Expense
Reimbursement or the Parent Termination Fee is a penalty, but is liquidated
damages, in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Parent Parties and
Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, in the circumstances in which such
fee is payable for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby, which amounts would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision, and (iii) without these agreements, the parties would not enter
into this Agreement.

 



 

(e) Upon termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms, Parents
right, if any, to receive the Company Termination Fee and/or Expense
Reimbursement pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ or the Companys right, if any, to
receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section 8.3(b)_ (but only if
the Company elects to receive the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to _Section
8.3(b)(i)_) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Parent Parties and
Merger Sub or the Company, as applicable, and their respective Affiliates
against the Company or the Parent Parties and Merger Sub, as applicable, and
its former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers, Affiliates,
agents or other Representatives for any loss suffered as a result of any
breach

 



      
 

 



 

of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement in this Agreement or
the failure of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement to be consummated, and upon payment of such Company Termination Fee
and/or Expense Reimbursement or Parent Termination Fee, as applicable, neither
the Company or the Parent Parties and Merger Sub, as the case may be, nor any
of its or their former, current or future stockholders, directors, officers,
Affiliates, agents or other Representatives shall have any further liability
or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the Merger or
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, nothing
in this _Section 8.3(e)_ shall relieve any Person (other than any Lender)
from any liabilities or damages resulting from or rising out of any willful or
intentional material breach of this Agreement prior to or in connection with
such termination.

 



 

Section 8.4 _Payment of Termination Fees and/or Expense Reimbursement_.

 



 

(a) In the event that the Company is obligated to pay Parent the Company
Termination Fee and/or Expense Reimbursement pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ or
Parent is obligated to pay the Company the Parent Termination Fee pursuant to
_Section 8.3(b)_ (the " _Section 8.3 Amount_"), the Company or Parent, as
applicable (" _Payor_ "), shall pay to Parent or the Company, as applicable ("
_Payee_ "), from the applicable Section 8.3 Amount deposited into escrow, if
any, in accordance with the next sentence, an amount not to exceed the lesser
of (i) the Section 8.3 Amount and (ii) the sum of (1) the maximum amount that
can be paid to Payee without causing Payee to fail to meet the requirements of
Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code for the relevant tax year, determined
as if the payment of such amount did not constitute income described in
Sections 856(c)(2) or 856(c)(3) of the Code (" _Qualifying Income_ ") and
Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such year which is
not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated income which is
not Qualifying Income), in each case, as determined by Payees independent
certified public accountants, plus (2) in the event Payee receives either (X)
a letter from Payees counsel indicating that Payee has received a ruling from
the IRS described in _Section 8.4(b)(ii) _or (B) an opinion from Payees
outside counsel as described in _Section 8.4(b)(ii_), an amount equal to the
Section 8.3 Amount less the amount payable under clause (1) above. To secure
Payors obligation to pay these amounts, Payor shall deposit into escrow an
amount in cash equal to the Section 8.3 Amount with an escrow agent selected
by Payor and on such terms (subject to _Section 8.4(b)_) as shall be mutually
agreed upon by Payor, Payee and the escrow agent, provided that the payment or
deposit into escrow shall be at Payees option. The payment or deposit into
escrow of the Section 8.3 Amount pursuant to this _Section 8.4(a) _shall be
made at the time Payor is obligated to pay Payee such amount pursuant to
_Section 8.3_, as applicable, by wire transfer or bank check.

 



 

(b) The escrow agreement shall provide that the Section 8.3 Amount in escrow
or any portion thereof shall not be released to any Payee that is a REIT
unless the escrow agent receives any one or combination of the following: (i)
a letter from Payees independent certified public accountants indicating the
maximum amount that can be paid by the escrow agent to Payee without causing
Payee to fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the
Code determined as if the payment of such amount did not constitute Qualifying
Income and Payee has $1,000,000 of income from unknown sources during such
year which is not Qualifying Income (in addition to any known or anticipated
income which is not Qualifying Income) or a subsequent letter from Payees
accountants revising that amount, in which case the escrow agent shall release
such amount to Payee, or (ii) a letter from Payees counsel indicating

 



      
 

 



 

that Payee received a ruling from the IRS holding that the receipt by Payee of
the Section 8.3 Amount would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be
excluded from gross income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of
the Code (or alternatively, Payees outside counsel has rendered a legal
opinion to the effect that the receipt by Payee of the Section 8.3 Amount
would either constitute Qualifying Income or would be excluded from gross
income within the meaning of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code), in which
case the escrow agent shall release the remainder of the Section 8.3 Amount to
Payee. Payor agrees to amend this Section 8.4 at the reasonable request of any
Payee that is a REIT in order to (x) maximize the portion of the Section 8.3
Amount that may be distributed to Payee hereunder without causing Payee to
fail to meet the requirements of Sections 856(c)(2) and (3) of the Code, (y)
improve Payees chances of securing a favorable ruling described in this
Section 8.4(b) or (z) assist Payee in obtaining a favorable legal opinion from
its outside counsel as described in this _Section 8.4(b)_. Any portion of the
Section 8.3 Amount that remains unpaid as of the end of a taxable year shall
be paid as soon as possible during the following taxable year, subject to the
foregoing limitations of this _Section 8.4_. The escrow agreement shall also
provide that any portion of the Section 8.3 Amount held in escrow for five
years shall be released by the escrow agent to Payor. Payor shall not be a
party to such escrow agreement and shall not bear any cost of or have
liability resulting from the escrow agreement.

 



 

Section 8.5 _Amendment_. Subject to compliance with applicable Law, this
Agreement may be amended by mutual agreement of the parties hereto by action
taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors (or similar
governing body or entity) at any time before or after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval and prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Company Stockholder Approval has been obtained, there shall not
be (a) any amendment of this Agreement that changes the amount or the form of
the consideration to be delivered under this Agreement to the holders of
Company Common Stock, or which by applicable Law or in accordance with the
rules of any stock exchange requires the further approval of the stockholders
of the Company without such further approval of such stockholders, (b) any
amendment or change not permitted under applicable Law, or (c) any amendment
to _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3(e)_, this subclause _(c)_ to _Section 8.5_,
_Section 9.7_, _Section 9.11(a)_, _Section 9.12_ or _Section 9.13_ in any
manner adverse to a Lender without the prior written consent of such Lender.
This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed by
each of the parties hereto.

 



 

Section 8.6 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, any party hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance
of any obligation or other act of any other party hereto, (b) waive any
inaccuracy in the representations and warranties of the other party contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and (c) subject to the
proviso of _Section 8.5_, waive compliance with any agreement or condition
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed by the party or parties to be bound thereby. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, no failure or delay by the Company, the Parent Parties or
Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof
nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further
exercise of any other right hereunder.

 



 

Section 8.7 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, all Expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this

 



       
 

 



 

Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses, whether or not

is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced under any present or future
Law, or public policy, (a) such term or other provision shall be fully
separable, (b) this Agreement shall be construed and enforced as if such
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part hereof,
and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall remain in
full force and effect and shall not be affected by the illegal, invalid or
unenforceable term or other provision or by its severance herefrom so long as
the economic or legal substance of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any party. Upon
such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith
to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that transactions
contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to
the fullest extent possible.

 



 

Section 9.5 _Assignment; Delegation_. Other than to the Surviving Entity,
neither this Agreement nor any rights, interests or obligations hereunder
shall be assigned or delegated, in whole or in part, by any of the parties
hereto (whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may,
upon prior written notice to the Company, assign or delegate its rights,
interests or obligations hereunder (other than under _Section 6.16(c)_)
solely in accordance with _Section 6.16(b)_ (provided that no such assignment
or delegation shall adversely impact or materially delay the receipt of the
Debt Financing, materially delay the Closing or adversely impact the
maintenance by the Parent Parties of the Minimum Net Worth and Liquid Assets).

 



 

Section 9.6 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the exhibits,
annexes and appendices hereto) constitutes, together with the Confidentiality
Agreement, the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior

 



      
 

 



 

agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among the parties, or
any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



 

Section 9.7 _No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement is not intended to
and shall not confer any rights or remedies upon any Person other than the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except
for (i) the provisions of _Section 6.8_ (which shall be to the benefit of the
parties referred to in such section), (ii) the rights of the holders of
Company Common Stock and Company Restricted Stock to receive the Merger
Consideration after the Effective Time in accordance with _Article III_,
(iii) the rights of the holders of Company Options after the Effective Time as
provided in _Section 3.4_, (iv) the rights of the holders of Company
Preferred Stock to receive the amounts to which they are entitled in
connection with the Preferred Stock Redemption in accordance with _Section
3.3_, and (v) the provisions of _Section 8.2_, _Section 8.3(e)_, _Section
8.5_, this _Section 9.7_, _Section 9.11(a)_, _Section 9.12_ and _Section
9.13_ (which shall be to the benefit of the Lenders and their respective
successors and assigns). The representations and warranties in this Agreement
are the product of negotiations among the parties hereto and are for the sole
benefit of the parties hereto. Any inaccuracies in such representations and
warranties are subject to waiver by the parties hereto in accordance with
_Section 8.5_ without notice or liability to any other Person. The
representations and warranties in this Agreement may represent an allocation
among the parties hereto of risks associated with particular matters
regardless of the knowledge of any of the parties hereto and may have been
qualified by certain disclosures not reflected in the text of this Agreement.
Accordingly, Persons other than the parties hereto may not rely upon the
representations and warranties in this Agreement as characterizations of
actual facts or circumstances as of the date of this Agreement or as of any
other date.

 



 

Section 9.8 _Equitable Relief_. Except as otherwise provided in _Section
8.3(d)_, the parties hereto agree that irreparable harm, for which monetary
damages would be an inadequate remedy, shall occur in the event that any party
hereto does not perform a provision of this Agreement (including, failing to
take such action as may be required to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in accordance with its specified
terms, or otherwise breaches any such provision. Accordingly, the parties
acknowledge and agree that, in addition to any other remedy or remedies to
which they are or may be entitled at Law or in equity, a party shall be
entitled to an injunction, specific performance, and other equitable relief to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement, and to specific
enforcement of this Agreement. Each party agrees that it will not oppose the
granting of an injunction, specific performance, or other equitable relief on
the basis that any other party has an adequate remedy at Law or that an award
of specific performance would be inappropriate for any reason at Law or in
equity. A party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement, or specific enforcement of this Agreement shall not be
required to provide any bond or other security in connection therewith.

 



 

Section 9.9 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different parties hereto in separate counterparts,
each of which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
taken together shall constitute one and the same agreement. Delivery of an
executed counterpart of a signature page to this Agreement by facsimile
transmission or by e-mail of a pdf attachment shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 9.10 _Governing Law_. This Agreement and all Actions (whether based on
contract, tort or otherwise) directly or indirectly arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the actions of the Parent Parties, Merger Sub or the
Company shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the internal
laws of the State of Maryland, without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of Laws provision or rule (whether of the State of Maryland or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of Maryland.

 



 

Section 9.11 _Consent to Jurisdiction_.

 



 

(a) Each party hereto hereby irrevocably consents and submits to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Maryland and to the jurisdiction of

hereto hereby irrevocably agrees that all claims asserted in or arising from

support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim
of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract
or in tort or otherwise, against a Lender in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including
but not limited to any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the
Commitment Letters or the performance thereof, in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, or, if under
applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested in the Federal courts, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and

 **Re: REIT Status of Inland Real Estate Corporation**

 



 

Ladies and Gentlemen:

 



 

We have acted as counsel to Inland Real Estate Corporation, a Maryland
corporation (the " _Company_ "), in connection with the merger (the " _Merger_
") with and into the Company of Midwest Retail Acquisiton Corp., a Maryland
corporation (" _Merger Sub_ "), an indirect subsidiary of DRA Growth and
Income Fund VIII, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, and DRA Growth
and Income Fund VIII (A), LLC, a Delaware limited liability company
(collectively, the " _Parent Parties_ "), with the Company surviving. The
Merger will be consummated pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated
as of December [*], 2015, by and among the Company, the Parent Parties and
Merger Sub, as amended through the date hereof (the " _Merger Agreement_ ").
We are rendering our opinion pursuant to Section 7.2(d) of the Merger
Agreement regarding the classification of the Company as a real estate
investment trust (" _REIT_ ") under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ ").(1)

 



 

The opinion set forth in this letter is based on relevant provisions of the
Code, Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (including Proposed and Temporary
Regulations), and interpretations of the foregoing as expressed in court
decisions, administrative determinations, and the legislative history as of
the date hereof. These provisions and interpretations are subject to differing
interpretations or change at any time, which may or may not be retroactive in
effect, and which might result in modifications of our opinion. In this
regard, an opinion of counsel with respect to an issue represents counsels
best judgment as to the outcome on the merits with respect to such issue, is
not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (" _IRS_ ") or the courts, and is
not a guarantee that the IRS will not assert a contrary position with respect
to an issue, or that a court will not sustain such a position if asserted by
the IRS.

 



 

In rendering our opinion, we have made such factual and legal examinations,
including an examination of such statutes, regulations, records, certificates
and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate, including,
but not limited to: (i) the Merger Agreement (including any exhibits and
schedules thereto) and (ii) the Fifth Articles of Amendment and Restatement of
the Company, dated August 2, 2013 and the Articles Supplementary Establishing
and Fixing the Rights and Preferences of 6.95% Series B Cumulative Redeemable
Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value per share, dated October 13, 2014, as amended
through the date hereof. The opinion set forth in this letter also is based on
certain written factual representations and covenants made by an officer of
the Company in letters to us of even date herewith (the " _Officer s
Certificates_") relating to, among other things, those factual matters as are
germane to the determination that the Company, and the entities in which it
holds direct or indirect interests, have been formed, owned and operated in
such a manner that the Company has satisfied the requirements for
qualification as a REIT under the Code (collectively, the Officers
Certificates, and the documents described in the immediately preceding
sentence are referred to herein as the " _Transaction Documents_ ").

  (1) Unless otherwise stated, all section references herein are to the Code.

      
 

 



 

In our review, we have assumed, with the Companys consent, that all of the
factual representations, covenants and statements set forth in the Transaction
Documents are true and correct, and all of the obligations imposed by any such
documents on the parties thereto have been and will be performed or satisfied
in accordance with their terms. Moreover, we have assumed that the Company has
been operated in the manner described in the relevant Transaction Documents.
We have, consequently, assumed and relied on the Companys representations
that the information presented in the Transaction Documents accurately and
completely describe all material facts relevant to our opinion. We have not
undertaken any independent inquiry into, or verification of, these facts for
the purpose of rendering this opinion. While we have reviewed all
representations made to us to determine their reasonableness, we have no
assurance that they are or will ultimately prove to be accurate. No facts have
come to our attention, however, that would cause us to question the accuracy
or completeness of such facts or the Transaction Documents in a material way.
Our opinion is conditioned on the continuing accuracy and completeness of such
representations, covenants and statements. Any material change or inaccuracy
in the facts referred to, set forth, or assumed herein, in the Transaction
Documents may affect our conclusions set forth herein.

 



 

Furthermore, we have assumed with your consent that the Parent Parties will
cause the Company to make sufficient distributions with respect to shares of
capital stock of the Company in the taxable year that includes the date of
this letter to maintain its status as a REIT under the Code to the extent
Section 6.1(c)(iv) of the Merger Agreement operates to delay any distribution
