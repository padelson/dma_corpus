discharge and redemption, collectively, the " _Satisfaction and Discharge_
"). For the avoidance of doubt, all such payments set forth in subclauses (i)
or (ii) above, as applicable, shall be included in the calculation of Closing
Indebtedness.

 

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the Closing
Consideration to the Stockholders and Optionholders. All payments under or
pursuant to this Agreement shall be made by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to one or more accounts designated by the Representative or by
bank check if requested by the Representative; provided that the Closing
Consideration payable to the Optionholders and the Restricted Share Holders
shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation for payroll processing and
distribution at the next administratively practicable payroll date to each
Optionholder and Restricted Share Holder. All disbursements to each
Stockholder shall be made only after delivery by such Stockholder of a Letter
of Transmittal and stock certificates representing all of such holders shares
of Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") either duly endorsed in blank for
transfer or accompanied by duly executed in blank stock powers, and such other
documents, in each case, as reasonably satisfactory to Parent. All
disbursements to each Optionholder shall be made only after delivery by such
Optionholder of an Option Payment Letter and such other documents, in each
case, as reasonably satisfactory to Parent. Parent and the Company shall
establish procedures to enable all Stockholders and Optionholders to deliver
a Letter of Transmittal and/or Option Payment Letter, as applicable, at or
prior to the Closing and to receive payment for the shares of Common Stock
and/or Options covered thereby at the Effective Time or, if processed through
payroll, at the next administratively practicable payroll date.

(d) If any Certificate or document evidencing Options shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate or document to be lost, stolen or destroyed
and, if required by the Surviving

 



18  Corporation, Parent or any third party paying agent appointed thereby, the
posting by such Person of a bond, in such customary amount as the Surviving
Corporation, Parent or such third party paying agent may reasonably request,
as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to
such Certificate or document and delivery of a Letter of Transmittal or Option
Payment Letter, as the case may be, Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the
applicable portion of the Closing Consideration to which such Person is
entitled pursuant to the provisions of this _Article III_.

 

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall pay, or cause to be paid,
on behalf of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Estimated Transaction
Expenses to the applicable payees thereof, when such Estimated Transaction
Expenses are due and payable, but only to the extent such Estimated
Transaction Expenses will be reflected as Final Transaction Expenses in the
Final Statement and will be taken into account for purposes of calculating
the Final Closing Consideration. All Estimated Transaction Expenses to be paid
by Parent or its designee on the Closing Date shall be expressly reflected by
the Company on the Estimated Closing Statement.

SECTION 3.4 _Escrow Agreement_. On the Closing Date, Parent and the
Representative shall enter into an escrow agreement with the Escrow Agent
effective as of the Closing Date which shall be substantially in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit E_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "), and Parent shall
deliver (i) the Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") to be
designated and administered by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the Escrow
Agreement and (ii) the Representative Escrow Amount to the Escrow Agent by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account (the "
_Representative Escrow Account_ "). All costs, fees, charges and expenses
assessed by the Escrow Agent to maintain the Escrow Account as
required hereunder, and any and all penalties, obligations and liabilities
associated therewith or arising therefrom, shall be paid (a) first, from the
funds available in the Escrow Account, and (b) thereafter, equally by the
Surviving Corporation, on the one hand, and the Representative, on behalf of
the Stockholders and the Optionholders (which amount shall be treated as a
Representative Expense and paid from the Representative Escrow Account as
provided in _Section 11.13(e)_), on the other hand. All costs, fees, charges
and expenses assessed by the Escrow Agent to maintain the Representative
Escrow Account as required hereunder, and any and all penalties, obligations
and liabilities associated therewith or arising therefrom, shall be paid (a)
first, from the funds available in the Representative Escrow Account, and (b)
thereafter, by the Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders and the
Optionholders (which amount shall be treated as a Representative Expense and
paid from the Representative Escrow Account as provided in _Section
11.13(e)_).

SECTION 3.5 _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Stock_. The consideration
paid in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ and _Article IV_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
all shares of Common Stock (and all Options), and after the Effective Time,
there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Common Stock (or Options) that
were outstanding prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective
Time, the

 



19  Stockholders shall cease to have any rights with respect to shares of Common
Stock and holders of Options shall cease to have any rights with respect to
Options, except as otherwise provided for herein or by applicable Law. If,
after the Effective Time, any Certificates that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented outstanding shares of Common Stock are presented to
the Surviving Corporation for any reason, they shall be cancelled and
exchanged as provided in this _Article III_.

SECTION 3.6 _Unclaimed Consideration_. Any portion of the
merger consideration that is being held by a third-party agent and that
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates for six months after the
Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand, and any holder of a
Certificate who has not theretofore complied with this _Article III_ shall
thereafter look only to Parent for, and Parent shall remain liable for,
payment of any such holders claim for a portion of the merger consideration
with respect to such Certificate, without interest thereon, in accordance
with this _Article III_. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered
immediately prior to such date on which any portion of the merger
consideration with respect to the shares of Common Stock represented by such
Certificate would otherwise escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Body, any such portion of the merger consideration shall, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto or
any Governmental Body.

SECTION 3.7 _Stockholder Consent_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to secure, including by executing the consent as a Stockholders agent
and attorney-in-fact, promptly following the execution and delivery of this
Agreement (but no later than twenty-four (24) hours thereafter), the delivery
of the Stockholder Consent to Parent.

SECTION 3.8 _Withholding Rights_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and any
third-party agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may
be required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, Treasury Regulations or under any provision of any
state, local or foreign Law with respect to Taxes. To the extent that amounts
are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate Taxing Authority, such
withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a third-party
agent, as the case may be.

 

ARTICLE IV

 

DETERMINATION OF CLOSING CONSIDERATION AND POST-CLOSING ADJUSTMENTS

 

SECTION 4.1 _Closing Estimates_. Not less than two (2) Business Days prior to
the Closing, the Company shall prepare and deliver to Parent a statement (the
" _Estimated Closing Statement_ ") reflecting in reasonable detail the
Companys good faith calculation of the Closing Consideration, with an example
of such statement attached hereto as _Exhibit F_. In 

 



20  connection with determining the Closing Consideration, the Company shall
estimate in good faith (with such estimates reflected in reasonable detail on
the Estimated Closing Statement) the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment
(the " _Estimated Net Working Capital Adjustment_ "), Closing Indebtedness
(the " _Estimated Indebtedness_ "), Closing Cash (" _Estimated Cash_ "), and
Closing Transaction Expenses (the " _Estimated Transaction Expenses_ "). The
Estimated Closing Statement and the determinations and calculations contained
therein shall be prepared in accordance with this Agreement, including, as
applicable, _Exhibit B_. The Company shall consider in good faith Parents
comments to the Estimated Closing Statement and make such modifications to the
Estimated Closing Statement as the Company shall determine in good faith are
necessary to achieve conformity with the requirements of this Agreement,
including, as applicable, _Exhibit B_. The Closing Consideration shall be
adjusted following the Closing in the manner required by Section 4.2.

 

SECTION 4.2 _Post-Closing Adjustments_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the Closing, but in no event
later than sixty (60) days after the Closing Date, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to prepare and deliver to the Representative a statement
(the " _Post-Closing Adjustment Statement_ ") setting forth the Surviving
Corporations calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment,
Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses, which
shall be calculated on a basis consistent with this Agreement, including, as
applicable, _Exhibit B_.

 

(b) The Surviving Corporation and Parent shall (i) permit the Representative
and its representatives to have reasonable access to the books, records and
other documents (including work papers, schedules, financial statements,
memoranda, etc.) of the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereof and
shall cooperate with the Representative in seeking to obtain work papers from
the Surviving Corporation pertaining to or used in connection with the
preparation of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement and provide the
Representative with copies thereof (as reasonably requested by the
Representative) and (ii) provide the Representative and its representatives
reasonable access to the employees and accountants of the Surviving
Corporation and any successor thereof as reasonably requested by the
Representative, in each case, in connection with its review of the Post-
Closing Adjustment Statement. If the Representative disagrees with any part of
the Surviving Corporations calculation of the Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash or Closing Transaction Expenses
as set forth on the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, the Representative
shall, within forty-five (45) days after the Representatives receipt of the
Post-Closing Adjustment Statement, notify Parent in writing of such
disagreement (an " _Objection Notice_ "). The Objection Notice shall specify
which aspects of the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement are being disputed and
describe the basis for such dispute. If the Representative does not deliver an
Objection Notice and to the extent the Objection Notice does not so dispute
items in the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement within such forty-five (45) day
period, then the Post-Closing Adjustment Statement shall be conclusive, final
and binding on all of the parties (in such instance, a " _Final Statement_
"). If an Objection Notice is delivered to Parent, then Parent and the
Representative shall negotiate in good faith to resolve their disagreements
with respect to the computation of the Closing Net Working Capital
Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction

 



21  Expenses, and any such resolution shall be conclusive and binding on all of
the parties (in such instance, a " _Final Statement_ "). In the event that
Parent and the Representative are unable to resolve all such disagreements
within thirty (30) days after Parents receipt of such Objection Notice,
Parent or the Representative may submit such remaining disagreements to a
nationally recognized certified public accounting firm as is reasonably
acceptable to Parent and the Representative (the " _Accounting Firm_ ").
Parent and the Representative shall enter into an engagement letter with the
Accounting Firm promptly after its retention, which includes customary
indemnification and other provisions.

(c) Parent and the Representative shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Accounting Firm to resolve all remaining disagreements with respect to
the computation of the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and/or Closing Transaction Expenses identified in
the Objection Notice as soon as practicable, but in any event shall direct
the Accounting Firm to render a determination within thirty (30) days after
its retention. The Accounting Firm shall consider only those items and amounts
in the Surviving Corporations and the Representatives respective
calculations of the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing
Indebtedness, Closing Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses that are
identified as being items and amounts to which Parent and the
Representative have been unable to agree. In resolving any disputed item, the
Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any item greater than the greatest
value for such item claimed by either party or less than the smallest value
for such item claimed by either party. The Accounting Firms determination of
the Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash
and/or Closing Transaction Expenses, as applicable, shall be based solely on
written materials submitted by Parent and the Representative ( _i.e._ , not
on independent review) and shall be determined on a basis consistent with this
Agreement, including, as applicable, _Exhibit B_. The determination of the
Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding upon the parties hereto and
shall not be subject to appeal or further review (other than with respect to
errors in arithmetic calculations) (in such instance, a " _Final Statement_
").

 

(d) The costs and expenses of the Accounting Firm in determining the Closing
Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing Cash, and
Closing Transaction Expenses shall be borne equally by the Surviving
Corporation, on the one hand, and the Representative, on behalf of the
Stockholders and the Optionholders (which amount shall be treated as a
Representative Expense and paid from the Representative Escrow Account as
provided in _Section 11.13(e)_), on the other hand.

(e) The Closing Net Working Capital Adjustment, Closing Indebtedness, Closing
Cash and Closing Transaction Expenses set forth on any Final Statement as
determined in accordance with this _Section 4.2_ is the " _Final Net Working
Capital Adjustment_ ", " _Final Indebtedness_ ", " _Final Closing Cash_ " and
" _Final Transaction Expenses_ ". For purposes of this Agreement, " _Final
Closing Consideration_ " means (i) the Enterprise Value,  _less_ (ii) Final
Indebtedness, _plus_ (iii) Final Closing Cash, _less_ (iv) Final Transaction
Expenses, _plus_ (v) the Final Net Working Capital Adjustment, _less_ (vi) the
Escrow Amount _less_  (vii) the Representative Escrow Amount. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_ " means (x) the Final
Closing Consideration _less_ (y) the Closing Consideration (which may be a
positive or negative number). Within five (5) Business Days after the Final
Closing Consideration and the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount are finally
determined pursuant to this _Section 4.2_:

 

(i) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a positive amount, (A) Parent or
the Surviving Corporation will promptly pay to, or at the direction of, the
Representative, for payment to the Stockholders and Optionholders, by wire
transfer or delivery of other immediately available funds, an amount equal to
the lesser of (x) the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount and (y) the Escrow
Amount and (B) Parent and the Representative shall provide joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent to release all amounts remaining in the
Escrow Account to, or at the direction of, the Representative, for payment to
the Stockholders and the Optionholders, in each case, by wire transfer or
delivery of immediately available funds. If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount
is a positive amount and such amount is greater than the Escrow Amount, the
Representative, on behalf of the Stockholders and the Optionholders, shall
only be entitled to the Escrow Amount.

 



22 (ii) If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a negative amount, Parent and
the Representative will promptly instruct the Escrow Agent to (A) pay to
Parent (or its designee) an amount equal to the lesser of (x) the absolute
value of the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount and (y) the amount in the Escrow
Account, and (B) release all amounts remaining in the Escrow Account (if any)
to, or at the direction of, the Representative, for payment to the
Stockholders and Optionholders, in each case, by wire transfer or delivery of
other immediately available funds. If the Post-Closing Adjustment Amount is a
negative amount and the absolute value of such amount is greater than the
amount in the Escrow Account, Parent shall only be entitled to the amount in
the Escrow Account.

 

(iii) If the Stockholders and the Optionholders are entitled to receive any
payments under this Section 4.2, the Representative shall distribute or
direct funds (A) to each Stockholder (other than Restricted Share Holders with
respect to their Restricted Shares), the Per Share Escrow Release Amount and
the Per Share Positive Adjustment Amount for each share of Common Stock held
by such Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time, and (B) to the
Surviving Corporation for payroll processing and distribution at the next
administratively practicable payroll date to each Optionholder and each
Restricted Share Holder, the Per Share Escrow Release Amount and the Per
Share Positive Adjustment Amount, as applicable, for each share of Common
Stock underlying the Options held by such Optionholder immediately prior to
the Effective Time and each Restricted Share held by such Restricted Share
Holder immediately prior to the Effective Time.

(iv) Any payment to be made pursuant to this Section 4.2(e) shall be treated
by all parties for Tax purposes as an adjustment to the merger consideration,
unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

otherwise holds assets, or conducts any business, so as to require such
qualification, except where the lack of such power, authority, authorization,
license or qualification has not had and would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect. Prior to
the date hereof, the Company has made available to Parent a true and complete
copy of each of the organizational documents for each of the Companys
Subsidiaries.

SECTION 5.6 _SEC Reports; Financial Statements_.

contain when filed) any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to
make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they

otherwise), acceleration, forgiveness of indebtedness, vesting, distribution,
increase in benefits or obligation to fund benefits with respect to any
current or former employee or other service provider, (ii) result in the
triggering or imposition or any restrictions or limitations on the right of

(c) Each of Parent and the Company covenants and agrees, on behalf of itself
and its Subsidiaries, that between the date hereof and the Effective Time, it
shall use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance thereof, Parent shall not, and
shall not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, agree to enter into a letter
of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for the acquisition
of any business or person that is reasonably likely to prevent or materially
delay its ability to satisfy the conditions to the Merger set forth in
_Section 8.1(c)_ (to the extent related to applicable Antitrust Laws) and
_Section 8.1(h)_ of this Agreement.

SECTION 7.3 _Consents_. From the date hereof until the Closing, Parent and
the Company shall use (and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to use)
their respective reasonable best efforts to obtain at the earliest practicable
date all consents and approvals required to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the consents and approvals referred
to in _Sections 5.3(a)_ , _5.3(b)_ , _6.3(a)_ and _6.3(b)_ , but excluding
those matters 

 



50  covered by _Section 7.4_ (which shall be governed by _Section 7.4_ and not
by this _Section 7.3_); _provided_ , _however_ , that no party shall be
obligated to pay any material cash consideration to any third party from whom
consent or approval is required and the Company shall not modify or enter into
any Material Contract or material Lease or limit or dispose of any non-cash
rights, assets or properties, and Parent shall not be obligated to permit or

modify or enter into any agreement or limit or dispose of any non-cash
rights, assets or properties, in each case pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ or
any provision that cross-references the proviso to this _Section 7.3_.

 

SECTION 7.4 _Regulatory Approvals_.

 

(a) Each of Parent and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and
to assist and cooperate in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable
under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably practicably and in
any event prior to the End Date, including to (i) obtain any regulatory
approvals needed pursuant to any applicable Antitrust Laws, including the HSR
Act (collectively, the " _Antitrust Filings_ "), with respect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as reasonably
practicable and advisable after the date of this Agreement (but in no event
file the Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act later than five (5)
Business Days after the execution of this Agreement), and any filing fees
associated therewith shall be paid by Parent and such initial filings from
Parent and the Company shall request early termination of any applicable
waiting period under the HSR Act, (ii) subject to applicable Law, furnish to
the other party as promptly as reasonably practicable all information required
for any application or other filing to be made by the other party pursuant to
any applicable Law in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably practicable to any
formal or informal additional requests for information, including requests for
production of documents and production of witnesses for interviews or
depositions received from, and supply as promptly as reasonably practicable
any additional information or documentation that may be requested by, the
Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (the " _DOJ_ "), the
Federal Trade Commission (" _FTC_ ") or any other Governmental Body in
respect of such Antitrust Filings, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (iv) promptly notify the other party of any material
communication between that party and the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Body in respect of any Antitrust Filings or any inquiry or
Proceeding relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby
and of any material communication received or given in connection with any
Proceeding by a private party relating to the transactions contemplated
hereby, (v) as permitted by applicable Law and by the applicable Government
Body, discuss with and permit the other party (and its counsel) to review in
advance, and consider in good faith the other partys reasonable comments in
connection with, any Antitrust Filing or communication to the FTC, the DOJ or
any other Governmental Body or, in connection with any Proceeding by a private
party to any other Person, relating to any Antitrust Filing or inquiry or
Proceeding relating to this Agreement, or the transactions contemplated
hereby, (vi) not participate or agree to participate in any material meeting,
telephone call or discussion with the FTC, the DOJ or any other Governmental
Body in respect

 



51  of any Antitrust Filing, investigation or inquiry relating to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other
party in advance and, to the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Body,
gives the other party the opportunity to attend and participate in such
meeting, telephone call or discussion, (vii) as permitted by applicable Law
and by the applicable Governmental Body, furnish the other party promptly
with copies of all material correspondence, filings and communications between
them and their Affiliates on the one hand, and the FTC, the DOJ or any other
Governmental Body or members of their respective staffs on the other
hand, with respect to any Antitrust Filing, inquiry or Proceeding relating to
the effect of an Antitrust Law on this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, (viii) if any Governmental Body initiates oral
communication regarding Antitrust Laws, promptly notify the other party of
the substance of such communication and (ix) act in good faith and reasonably
cooperate with the other party in connection with any Antitrust Filings and in
connection with resolving any investigation or inquiry of any such agency or
other Governmental Body under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law with
respect to any such Antitrust Filing, this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The parties may, as they deem advisable and necessary,
designate any competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under
this _Section 7.4_ as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the
information contained therein shall be given only to outside counsel
and previously-agreed outside economic consultants of the recipient and will
not be disclosed by such outside counsel or outside economic consultants to
employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without advance written
consent of the party providing such materials.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing (except, for the
avoidance of doubt, it is the intent of the parties hereto that the actions
required to be taken by Parent under this _Section 7.4(b)_ shall only be
required to be taken to the extent necessary to permit the Merger to close
prior to the End Date and not to the extent necessary to permit the Merger to
close as promptly as reasonably practicable), Parent shall, to the extent
necessary to permit the Merger to close prior to the End Date, take any and
all steps necessary to (i) resolve, avoid or eliminate impediments or
objections, if any, that may be asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Antitrust Law and (ii) avoid the entry of,
effect the dissolution of, and have vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned,
any Order that would prevent, prohibit, restrict or delay the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall, to the extent necessary to permit the Merger to close prior to the End
Date, propose, negotiate, commit to and effect, by consent decree, hold
separate orders or otherwise, the sale, divesture, disposition or license, and
otherwise take or commit to take actions that after the Closing Date would
limit Parents and its Affiliates freedom of action, ownership or control
with respect to, or its or their ability to retain, one or more of the assets,
properties, businesses, product lines or services of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any interest or interests therein (each a " _Divestiture
Action_ "). If requested by Parent, the Company shall agree to such
Divestiture Action, _provided_ that any such agreement or action is
conditioned upon consummation of the Merger. In furtherance of the foregoing,
Parent shall, to the extent necessary to permit the Merger to close prior to
the End Date, negotiate in good faith with all applicable Governmental Bodies
and private parties to enter into any requisite definitive agreements in
connection with any of the foregoing following Parents receipt of any request
for additional information and documentary material from the FTC or the DOJ or
the commencement of any second phase investigation by any such Governmental
Body.

(c) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, but without
limiting the scope of the commitments in  _Section 7.4(b)_, Parent shall, on
behalf of the parties, control and lead all communications and strategy
relating to Antitrust Laws and litigation matters relating to the Antitrust
Laws (provided that the Company is not prohibited from complying with
applicable Law), subject to good faith consultations with the Company, the
inclusion of the Company at meetings with Governmental Bodies with respect to
any discussion related to the Merger under Antitrust Laws, and all
other obligations to cooperate and share information pursuant to _Section
7.4(a)_.

 



52 SECTION 7.5 _Further Assurances_. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, including the proviso to _Section 7.3_, and to the understanding
of the parties that the matters covered by _Section 7.4_ shall be governed by
_Section 7.4_ and not this _Section 7.5_, each of Parent, Merger Sub and
the Company shall use (and each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to use) reasonable best efforts to (i) take all
actions necessary or appropriate to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement and (ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable
date of all of the conditions to their respective obligations to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (which, for the avoidance of
doubt, shall not require Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to waive any such
conditions).

SECTION 7.6 _Confidentiality_. Parent acknowledges that the information
provided to it in connection with this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby is
subject to the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement related to non-use
and non-disclosure and that such terms related to non-use and non-disclosure
are incorporated herein by reference.

SECTION 7.7  _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation and any successor thereof to, (i) agree subject to applicable
Law, to indemnify and hold harmless each individual who at the Effective Time
is, or at any time prior to the Effective Time was, a director, officer or
manager of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (each, an " _Indemnitee_ "
and, collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with respect to all claims,
liabilities, losses, damages, judgments, fines, penalties, costs (including
amounts paid in settlement or compromise) and expenses (including fees and
expenses of legal counsel) in connection with any Proceeding (whether civil,
criminal, administrative or investigative), whenever asserted, based on or
arising out of, in whole or in part, (A) the fact that an Indemnitee was a
director, officer or manager of the Company or such Subsidiary or (B) acts or
omissions by an Indemnitee in the Indemnitees capacity as a director,
officer, manager, employee or agent of the Company or such Subsidiary or
taken at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary (including in
connection with serving at the request of the Company or such Subsidiary as a
director, officer, manager, employee, agent, trustee or fiduciary of another
Person (including any employee benefit plan)),

 



53  in each case under clause (A) or (B), at, or at any time prior to, the
Effective Time (including any Proceeding relating in whole or in part to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement), to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, and (ii) assume all obligations of the Company and such
Subsidiaries to the Indemnitees in respect of indemnification and exculpation
from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time as provided in (x) the Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws
and the organizational documents of such Subsidiaries as currently in effect
as of the date of this Agreement and (y) the indemnification agreements
listed on _Schedule 7.7_ as in effect as of the date of this Agreement, which
agreements shall survive the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent, from and after the
Effective Time, shall cause the certificate of incorporation and by-laws of
the Surviving Corporation and the organizational documents of its
Subsidiaries to contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with
respect to limitation of liabilities of directors, officers and managers and
indemnification than are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the
Companys certificate of incorporation and by-laws and its Subsidiaries
organizational documents, which provisions shall not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified in a manner that would adversely affect such rights
thereunder of the Indemnitees. In addition, from and after the Effective
Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to agree, subject to
applicable Law, to advance any expenses (including fees and expenses of legal
counsel) of any Indemnitee under this  _Section 7.7_ (including in
connection with enforcing the indemnity and other obligations referred to in
this _Section 7.7_) as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law, _provided_ that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

 

(b) Parent shall cause (at Parents expense) the Surviving Corporation and any
successor thereof to purchase and keep in effect a "tail" directors and
officers liability insurance policy for the six (6)-year period commencing at
the Effective Time, issued by one or more reputable insurers, covering acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time with respect to those
persons who are currently (and any additional persons who prior to the
Effective Time become) covered by the Companys and its Subsidiaries
directors and officers liability insurance policy on terms and scope with
respect to such coverage, and in amount, not less favorable to such
individuals than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof. At
Parents request, the Company shall arrange for any such "tail" policy to
be purchased (at Parents expense) and to become effective as of the
Effective Time.

(c) The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ are (i) intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her heirs and
his or her representatives and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution
for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such Person
may have by contract or otherwise. The obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation under this _Section 7.7_ shall not be terminated or modified in
such a manner as to adversely affect the rights of any Indemnitee to whom
this _Section 7.7_ applies unless (x) such termination or modification is
required by applicable Law or (y) the affected Indemnitee shall have consented
in writing to such termination or modification (it being expressly agreed
that the Indemnitees to whom this _Section 7.7_ applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.7_).

 

(d) In the event that Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially
all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such
case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of
Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the transferee of such properties and
assets shall assume and be responsible for all of the respective obligations
of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, set forth in this
_Section 7.7_.

 



54 SECTION 7.8 _Publicity_. Neither the Company nor Parent, nor any of their
respective Affiliates, shall issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld, unless, in the judgment of the Company or
Parent, as applicable, public disclosure is otherwise required by applicable
Law or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which Parent or any of
its Affiliates lists securities, provided that, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, the party required to make such disclosure shall use its
reasonable best efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult with the
other party with respect to the text thereof prior to making any such public
disclosure. The Company and Parent agree that the initial press release to be
issued in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby shall be in a
form mutually agreed.

 

SECTION 7.9 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Except as otherwise agreed between Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
such Company Employee, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its
subsidiaries to provide employees of the Company and its subsidiaries (the "
_Company Employees_ ") (i) for the period of twelve (12) months immediately
following the Closing Date, (x) the same level of base salary and hourly
wages as in effect on the Closing Date, (y) employee benefit plans, programs,
contracts and arrangements that are no less favorable in the aggregate than
similar employee benefit plans, programs, contracts and arrangements
(excluding stock-based compensation, cash incentive and any retention,
severance, change in control or similar plans, programs, policies or
arrangements) provided by the Company and its affiliates to Company Employees
immediately prior to the Closing Date, and (z) with respect to only those
Company Employees who are not party to a written employment agreement, offer
letter or similar agreement or arrangement, continued coverage under the
Companys severance plans or policies on the terms and conditions of such
plans or policies set forth on _Schedule 7.9(a)_; (ii) for the period
immediately following the Closing Date until December 31, 2015 with respect to
each Company Employee, an annual cash incentive bonus opportunity as set
forth in Section 7.9(c); (iii) for Parents 2016 fiscal year, with respect to
each Company Employee, an annual cash incentive bonus opportunity commensurate
with the annual cash incentive bonus opportunity provided to similarly-
situated employees of Parent for such fiscal year. From and after the Closing
Date, each Company Employee shall be eligible to participate in the Parents
stock-based compensation plan on the 

 



55  same basis as similarly situated employees of Parent, _provided_ that
nothing herein shall entitle any Company Employee to a grant of stock-based
compensation or a grant of stock-based compensation of a particular size or
value. From and after the Closing Date, Parent or one of its Affiliates shall
honor, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to honor, in accordance with
their terms, all employment, retention, change in control and severance
agreements and all severance, incentive and bonus plans, programs and
arrangements (excluding with respect to stock-based compensation) as in effect
on the Closing Date that are applicable to any current or former employees
or directors of the Company. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this
Agreement shall prevent or restrict Parent or any of its Affiliates from
modifying or terminating the employment of any Company Employee following the
Closing Date or from amending or terminating any Company Benefit Plan
following the Closing Date in accordance with its terms. Parent or one of its
Affiliates shall, to the same extent recognized by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, recognize the service of the Company Employees with the Company
and its Affiliates prior to the Closing Date as service with Parent and its
Affiliates in connection with any pension or welfare benefit plans and
policies (including vacations, paid time-off, and holiday
policies) maintained by Parent or one of its Affiliates which is made
available following the Closing Date by Parent or one of its Affiliates for
purposes of any waiting period, vesting, eligibility and benefit entitlement
or level of benefits (but excluding benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan of Parent or any of its Affiliates), except to the extent such
credit would result in the duplication of benefits for the same period of
service. To the extent permitted by applicable Law and the terms of Parents
welfare benefit plans and insurance contracts as in effect as of the date
hereof, Parent shall, (i) waive, or cause its insurance carriers to waive, all
limitations as to pre-existing and at-work conditions, if any, with respect
to participation and coverage requirements applicable to Company Employees
under any welfare benefit plan (as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA) which is
made available to Company Employees following the Closing Date by Parent
or one of its Affiliates, and (ii) provide credit to Company Employees for
any co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid by such employees
under the employee benefit plans, programs and arrangements of the Company and
its Subsidiaries during the portion of the relevant plan year including the
Closing Date.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its subsidiaries to (i)
credit each of the Company Employees with an amount of paid vacation and sick
leave days following the Closing Date equal to the amount of vacation time and
sick leave days each such Company Employee has accrued but not yet used or
cashed out as of the Closing Date under the Companys vacation and sick leave
policies as in effect immediately prior to the Closing Date, and, (ii) at
Parents election, (x) allow each of the Company Employees to use such
accrued vacation and sick leave days at such times as each would have been
allowed under the Companys vacation and sick leave policies as in effect
immediately prior to the Closing Date and/or (y) pay each of the
Company Employees an amount in cash equal to the value of such Company
Employees accrued and unused vacation days.

(c) Parent agrees that the annual bonuses in respect of the Companys 2015
calendar year (the " _2015 Bonuses_ ") shall be paid in the ordinary course
subject to the terms of the Bonus Plan, based on actual performance of the
Company as a standalone business unit and the achievement of the applicable
performance targets under the Bonus Plan, as such

 



56  performance targets may be equitably and proportionately adjusted by Parent
in good faith for the period following Closing, after reasonable consultation
with the Companys chief executive officer, to reflect the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In the event a Company Employees employment
is terminated by the Company other than for cause, as determined by Parent
acting in good faith, or the Company Employee has been "constructively
dismissed" or "constructively terminated" as provided under applicable state
or local Law, following the Closing Date but prior to payment of the 2015
Bonuses, such Company Employee shall be paid his or her 2015 Bonus, which
amount shall be based upon actual performance and pro-rated to reflect the
portion of the performance period during which he or she was employed with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (and/or Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
from and after the Closing Date).

(d) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
but in no event later than five (5) days prior to the Closing Date, the
Company will submit to a stockholder vote (in compliance with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations thereunder) the right of any
individual who is or could reasonably be expected to be, as of the Closing
Date, a "disqualified individual" (as defined in Section 280G(c) of the Code)
to receive payments and benefits that could be deemed a "parachute payment"
(as defined in Section 280G(b)(2) of the Code) (" _Section 280G Payments_ ").
The Company shall take all actions necessary to comply with the requirements
of the exemption provided under Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code, including,
without limitation, by (i) obtaining any necessary waivers from such
disqualified individuals with respect to any payments and benefits that would
otherwise constitute Section 280G Payments and (ii) preparing, and causing to
be mailed promptly after the date hereof, to the Stockholders, a disclosure
document including relevant information with respect to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement meeting the requirements of
Section 280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code (the " _Company Disclosure Document_ ").
The Company shall deliver a draft of the Company Disclosure Document to Parent
promptly after the date hereof and, as promptly as reasonably practicable
following such delivery, Parent shall provide the Company its comments, if
any, regarding the Company Disclosure Document, including those portions
relating to the Section 280G Payments, and Company shall consider in good
faith such comments of Parent. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
deliver to Parent notification and evidence satisfactory to Parent that a vote
of the holders of Common Stock was solicited in conformance with Section
280G(b)(5)(B) of the Code and the regulations promulgated thereunder with
respect to the payments or benefits that would constitute Section 280G
Payments and either (a) the requisite stockholder approval was obtained with
respect to any payments or benefits that were subject to the stockholder vote
(the " _280G Stockholder Approval_ ") or (b) that the 280G Stockholder
Approval was not obtained and, as a consequence, that such payments or
benefits shall not be made or provided to the extent they would cause any
amounts to constitute Section 280G Payments, pursuant to the waivers of those
payments or benefits, which were executed by the affected individuals prior to
the vote of the holders of Common Stock pursuant to this _Section 7.9(d)_.

 

(e) If requested by Parent in writing delivered to the Company not less than
ten (10) Business Days before the Closing Date, the Board of Directors of the
Company (or the

 



57  appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and take such
corporate action as is necessary to terminate any 401(k) plans maintained by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Company 401(k)
Plans_ "), effective as of the day prior to the Closing Date. Following the
Effective Time and as soon as practicable following receipt of a favorable
determination letters from the IRS on the termination of the Company 401(k)
Plans, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the participants, and Parent
shall, to the extent permitted by Parents applicable 401(k) plan (the "
_Parent 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the Company Employees who are then actively
employed to make rollover contributions of "eligible rollover distributions"
(within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of the Code), in the form of cash,
in an amount equal to the full account balance distributed to such Company
Employees from the Company 401(k) Plans to the Parent 401(k) Plan.

(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
_Section 7.9_ are included for the sole benefit of the parties hereto, and
that nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall (i) create
any third-party beneficiary or other rights (x) in any other Person,
including any current or former employees or service providers of the Company
or any Subsidiary, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan, or any
dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (y) to continued employment with Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates (ii) be intended to be,
shall constitute or be construed as an amendment to or modification of the
Company Benefit Plans or any other employee benefit plan or arrangement of
the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates and (iii) create any obligation of the parties hereto with respect
to any employee benefit plan of Parent, the Surviving Corporation, the Company
or any of their respective Affiliates.

SECTION 7.10 _No Shop_. From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
Company will not, and will not permit its Subsidiaries, or any of their
respective directors, officers, employees, representatives or agents to,
directly or indirectly, except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement,
(i) discuss, negotiate, undertake, authorize, recommend, propose or enter
into any transaction involving a merger, consolidation, business combination,
purchase or disposition of any material assets of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than in the Ordinary Course of Business) or any capital
stock or other equity interests of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (an
" _Acquisition Transaction_ "), (ii) facilitate, encourage, solicit or
initiate discussions, negotiations or submissions of proposals or offers in
respect of an Acquisition Transaction, (iii) furnish or cause to be furnished,
to any Person, any information concerning the business, operations, properties
or assets of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Acquisition Transaction, or (iv) otherwise cooperate in any way with, or
assist or participate in, facilitate or encourage, any effort or attempt by
any other Person to do or seek any of the foregoing. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall (and shall cause their respective representatives to)
immediately cease and cause to be terminated any existing discussions or
negotiations with any Persons (other than Parent and Merger Sub) conducted
heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and to promptly (and, in any
event, within 48 hours) require the destruction or return of any and all
confidential information provided to any such Persons in accordance with the
terms of any confidentiality agreement entered into with any such Persons. 

 



58 SECTION 7.11 _Preservation of Books and Records_. For a period of six (6)
years after the Closing Date or such longer time as may be required by Law:

(a) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereof
not to dispose of or destroy any of the books and records of the Company
relating to periods prior to the Closing (the " _Books and Records_ ") without
first offering to turn over possession thereof to the Representative
by written notice to the Representative at least sixty (60) days prior to the
proposed date of such disposition or destruction.

(b) Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and any successor thereof to
allow the Representative and its agents, at the Representatives sole expense,
access to all Books and Records on reasonable notice and during normal
business hours at the Surviving Corporations principal place of business or
at any location where any Books and Records are stored, and the Representative
shall have the right, at its own expense, to make copies of any Books and
Records; _provided_ , that any such access or copying shall be had or done in
such a manner so as not to unduly interfere with the normal conduct of
Parents business; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that nothing herein
shall require either party to disclose any information to the other if such
disclosure would jeopardize any attorney-client or other legal privilege or
contravene any applicable Law, fiduciary duty or binding agreement (it being
understood that each party shall cooperate in any reasonable efforts and
waivers that would enable otherwise required disclosure to the other party to
occur without jeopardizing any such privilege or contravening such Law, duty
or agreement).

 

SECTION 7.12 _Payoff Letters_. The Company shall, and shall cause the Borrower
to, obtain and deliver to Parent, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the
anticipated Closing Date, an executed payoff letter with respect to each of
the Credit Agreements in customary form which shall be effective as of the
Effective Time (subject only to delivery of funds as arranged by Parent at
the Closing) setting forth (a) the amount to be paid on the Closing Date,
together with wire transfer instructions, in order to result in the full
repayment, satisfaction, release and discharge of all current and future
obligations (including principal, interest, fees, expense and other amounts,
in each case then due and payable under the Credit Agreements) of the Company
and its Subsidiaries under the applicable Credit Agreement other than
contingent indemnity obligations, (b) a confirmation of the release of any
Liens on or other security interests in the properties and assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries securing all obligations under the applicable
Credit Agreement and (c) an undertaking to execute and deliver promptly at or
following the Effective Time UCC-3 termination statements, mortgage discharges
and other necessary instruments of discharge to document such Lien and other
security interest releases. The payoff letters shall be subject to the prior
review of, and comment by, Parent and its legal counsel and shall be
reasonably acceptable to them.

SECTION 7.13 _Notes Redemption; Satisfaction and Discharge of the Notes_.

(a) No later than July 24, 2015 (but only if Section 7.13(b) does not apply
as a result of the failure to have received by July 24, 2015 the good faith
assurance from the SEC referenced in the first sentence of Section 7.13(b)) or
as soon as practicable thereafter (but only if 

 



59  there has been a subsequent withdrawal of such assurance or a subsequent
refusal by the Staff of the SEC to grant such no action relief or provide such
other assurance as referenced in the first sentence of Section 7.13(b)), the
Company shall issue a notice (the " _Redemption Notice_ ") of redemption (the
" _Notes Redemption_ ") of all of the outstanding principal amount of the
Notes pursuant to the requisite provisions of the Indenture; _provided_ that
the Redemption Notice shall be conditioned on the occurrence of the Closing in
accordance with the terms of the Indenture. At any time and from time to time
following the issuance of the Redemption Notice, if Parent or the Company
reasonably believes that the then-anticipated Closing Date would not fall on a
date on which the Notes Redemption would be permitted in accordance with the
terms of the Indenture and the Redemption Notice, the Company shall, in
consultation with the Trustee of the Notes, modify or reissue the Redemption
Notice so that the Notes Redemption would be permitted on such then-
anticipated Closing Date. Any modification or reissuance of the Redemption
Notice shall take into account and be subject to applicable procedures of DTC
for any such modification and reissuance. In consultation with Parent and the
Trustee of the Notes, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
prepare and deliver all other necessary and appropriate documentation in
connection with the Notes Redemption. The Redemption Notice (including all
amendments or supplements thereto), all submissions to the holders of the
Notes or the Trustee of the Notes in connection with the Notes Redemption and
all such other necessary and appropriate documentation shall be subject to the
prior review of, and comment by, the Parent and its legal counsel, and shall
be reasonably acceptable to them.

 

(b) In lieu of the Notes Redemption, but only if the Company and the Parent
shall have received good faith assurances from the Staff of the SEC no later
than July 24, 2015 to the reasonable satisfaction of Parent that the Staff of
the SEC will, upon completion of the Satisfaction and Discharge, grant no-
action relief or provide other assurance to the effect that the Company
shall, immediately after filing a Form 15, cease to have any further
reporting obligations under the Exchange Act (and there has not been a
subsequent withdrawal of such assurances or a subsequent refusal by the Staff
of the SEC to grant such no action relief or provide such other assurance),
the Company shall deliver on the Closing Date to the Trustee (i) an officers
certificate stating that not less than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to
November 15, 2015 (or, (A) if such day is not a Business Day, the following
Business Day, or (B) if the Closing Date is a date after October 16, 2015, the
earliest date following the Closing Date on which the Notes may be redeemed in
accordance with the Indenture), the Company shall, or shall have caused the
Trustee to, mail in accordance with the terms of the Indenture to each holder
of the outstanding Notes or send electronically in accordance with the
procedures of DTC an irrevocable notice of redemption stating that the
Company intends to irrevocably call all of the outstanding Notes for
redemption on November 15, 2015 (or, (A) if such day is not a Business Day,
the following Business Day, or (B) if the Closing Date is a date
after October 16, 2015, the earliest date following the Closing Date on which
the Notes may be redeemed in accordance with the Indenture) in connection with
the Satisfaction and Discharge, and (ii) an officers certificate of the
Company and opinion of the Companys counsel, in each case, in accordance
with Section 8.01 of the Indenture, to effect the Satisfaction and Discharge;
_provided_ , that the Company shall not take any actions pursuant to this 
_Section 7.13_ unless and until the Parent confirms in writing on the Closing
Date that the Company should take such actions. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Trustee to deliver to the Company and the
Parent an acknowledgement that the Satisfaction and Discharge has been
completed promptly after the payment contemplated by _Section 3.3(b)_ has
been made.

 

(c) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts and otherwise
cooperate with each other, including through communications and submissions
to the Staff of the SEC, to cause the satisfaction (but not the waiver) of
_Section 8.1(h)_ as promptly as practicable and, in any event, by no later
than the date on which the Closing would occur if all the conditions
other than _Section 8.1(h)_ were to be satisfied.

 



60 SECTION 7.14 _Notice of Current Events_. The Company shall keep Parent
informed, on a current basis, of any events, discussions, notices or changes
with respect to any Tax, criminal or regulatory investigation or action
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than in each case
ordinary course events, discussions, notices and changes which are not
material to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and shall reasonably
cooperate with Parent and its Affiliates in an effort to avoid or mitigate any
cost or regulatory consequences to them that might arise from such
investigation or action (including, to the extent practicable, by reviewing
written submissions in advance, attending meetings with authorities and
coordinating and providing assistance in meetings with regulators).

 

SECTION 7.15 _Related Party Agreements_. At or prior to the Closing, the
Company shall deliver to Parent written evidence from each of the
counterparties to the agreements listed on Exhibit A (such agreements, the "
_Related Party Agreements_ ") irrevocably agreeing to terminate each
agreement, with effect as of the Closing, without any cost, obligation,
liability or loss to the Company.

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.2(d)_ if the issuance
of such final nonappealable Order was primarily due to the breach by such
party of any of its obligations under this Agreement;

 

(e) by Parent if (i) neither Parent nor Merger Sub is then in breach of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(a)_

Date is less than thirty (30) days from the date of notice by Parent, such
breach is not cured, or is not capable of being cured, by the Company prior to
the End Date);

or _Section 8.1(b)_ not to be satisfied, and (ii) any of the conditions set
forth in _Section 8.2(a)_ or _Section 8.2(b)_ is not satisfied due to a
breach by Parent or Merger Sub of any of its representations, warranties,

receipt by Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, of notice of such breach
from the Company (or if the End Date is less than thirty (30) days from the
date of notice by the Company, such breach is not cured, or is not capable of
being cured, by Parent or Merger Sub prior to the End Date); and

(g) by the Company if (i) the Company is not then in breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement so as to cause any of the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_
or _Section 8.1(b)_ not to be satisfied, (ii) the condition set forth in
Section 8.1(h) is not capable of being satisfied, (iii) the Company has given
Parent at least five (5) Business Days prior written notice of its intention

this Agreement shall terminate, and the Merger contemplated hereby shall be
abandoned, without further action by Parent or the Company.

SECTION 10.4 _Effect of Termination_. If this Agreement is validly terminated
pursuant to  _Section 10.2_, this Agreement shall become void and of no
effect with no liability on the part of any party (or any stockholder,
director, officer, employee, agent, consultant, Affiliate or representative of
such party) to any other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that no such
termination shall relieve any party of any liability for any willful or
intentional breach of this Agreement occurring prior to such termination;
_provided_ , _further_ , that the provisions of _Section 7.8_, this _Section
10.4_, _Article I_ and _Article XI_ and the provisions of the Confidentiality

out of or in any way relating to this Agreement shall be brought exclusively

State of Delaware) (together with the appellate courts thereof, the " _Chosen
Courts_ ") and each of the parties hereby submits to the
exclusive jurisdiction of the Chosen Courts for the purpose of any such
Proceeding. Each party irrevocably and unconditionally agrees not to assert

Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
their respective successors and permitted assigns. Except, from and after the
Effective Time, as contemplated by _Section 3.3_ (with respect to (i) the
Stockholders right to receive the Per Share Closing Consideration, the Per
Share Escrow Release Amount, the Per Share Representative Escrow Release
Amount and the Per Share Positive Adjustment Amount, and (ii) the
Optionholders right to receive the Option Cancellation Amount (other
than with respect to Underwater Options)), and _Section 7.7_ (which
provision is intended to be for the benefit of the Persons referred to therein
and may be enforced by any such Person), nothing in this Agreement shall
create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary rights in any
Person not a party to this Agreement. No assignment of this Agreement or of
any rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any party, directly or
indirectly (by operation of Law or otherwise), without the prior written
consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment without the
required consents shall be void; _provided_ , _however_ , Parent, Merger Sub
and, following the Closing, the Surviving Corporation may (a) assign any or
all of its rights and interests hereunder to one or more of its Affiliates and
(b) designate one or more of its Affiliates to perform its obligations
hereunder; _provided_ , _further_ , _however_ , that in any such case, no
assignment or delegation of any obligations hereunder shall relieve the
assigning party of any its obligations hereunder. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights (x) in any employees or former employees of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any participant in any Company Benefit
Plan, or any dependent beneficiary thereof or (y) to continued employment
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



69 SECTION 11.10 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement.

 

SECTION 11.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. Each party hereto hereby waives to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable Law any right it may have to a trial
by jury in respect of any Proceeding directly or indirectly arising out of,
under or in connection with this Agreement, any Company Documents, any Parent
Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or thereby. Each party
hereto (i) certifies that no representative, agent or attorney of any other
party has represented, expressly or otherwise, that such other party would
not, in the event of litigation, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (ii)
acknowledges that it and the other parties hereto have been induced to enter
into this Agreement and the Company Documents, as applicable, by, among other
things, the mutual waivers and certifications in this _Section 11.11_.

 

SECTION 11.12 _Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and that monetary damages or legal remedies, even if available, would not be
an adequate remedy therefor. Therefore, it is accordingly agreed that,
in addition to any other remedies, each party shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including an injunction or injunctions to prevent or
restrain any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement by any other party
and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement to
prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce compliance with, the
covenants and obligations of any other party, in the Chosen Courts, and
appropriate injunctive relief may be applied for and granted in connection
therewith. Each of the parties hereto hereby waives: (i) any defenses that a
remedy at law would be adequate; and (ii) any requirement to post a bond or
other security as a prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief. 

SECTION 11.13 _Representative_.

 

(a) The Company agrees that GS Capital Partners VI, L.P. shall be the agent
and attorney-in-fact for each of the Stockholders and the Optionholders to
act as the Representative under this Agreement and the other agreements
contemplated hereby in accordance with the terms of this _Section 11.13_. In
the event of the resignation, death or incapacity of the Representative, a
successor representative reasonably satisfactory to Parent shall thereafter be
appointed by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and such successor
representative.

 

(b) The Representative is hereby authorized and empowered to act for, and on
behalf of, any or all of the Stockholders and the Optionholders (with full
power of substitution in the premises) in connection with such matters as are
reasonably necessary for the consummation of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby including: (i)
to receive all payments owing to the Stockholders or the Optionholders under
this Agreement, (ii) to the extent within the power of the Stockholders and
Optionholders to do so, to terminate, amend, waive any provision of, or
abandon, this Agreement or the other agreements contemplated hereby, (iii) to
act as the representative of the Stockholders and the

 



70  Optionholders to review and authorize all claims and disputes or question
the accuracy thereof, (iv) to negotiate and compromise on their behalf with
Parent any claims asserted hereunder and to authorize payments to be made
with respect thereto, (v) to take such further actions as are authorized in
this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby, and (vi) in
general, do all things and perform all acts, including executing and
delivering all agreements (including the Escrow Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated in this Agreement), certificates, receipts, consents,
elections, instructions and other documents contemplated by, or deemed by
the Representative to be necessary or desirable in connection with, this
Agreement, the other agreements contemplated hereby and the transactions
contemplated herein or therein. Parent and Merger Sub shall be entitled to
rely on such appointment and to treat the Representative as the duly
appointed attorney-in-fact of each Stockholder and Optionholder. Notices given
to the Representative in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement
shall constitute notice to the Stockholders and the Optionholders for all
purposes under this Agreement.

(c) The appointment of the Representative is an agency coupled with an
interest and is irrevocable and any action taken by the Representative
pursuant to the authority granted in this _Section 11.13_ shall be effective
and absolutely binding on each Stockholder and Optionholder notwithstanding
any contrary action of or direction from such Stockholder or Optionholder,
except for actions or omissions of the Representative constituting willful
misconduct or gross negligence. The death or incapacity, or dissolution or
other termination of existence, of any Stockholder or Optionholder shall not
terminate the authority and agency of the Representative. Parent, Merger Sub
and any other party to any document contemplated by this Agreement in dealing
with the Representative may conclusively and absolutely rely, without
inquiry, upon any act of the Representative as the act of the Stockholder or
Optionholder.

(d) The Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder, Optionholder
or to any other Person (other than Parent or Merger Sub), with respect to any
action taken or omitted to be taken by the Representative in its role as
Representative under or in connection with this Agreement, unless such action
or omission results from or arises out of willful misconduct or gross
negligence on the part of the Representative, and the Representative shall not
be liable to any Stockholder or Optionholder in the event that, in the
exercise of his or its reasonable judgment, the Representative believes there
will not be adequate resources available to cover potential costs and expenses
to contest a claim made by Parent or Merger Sub.

 

(e) The Representative shall receive reimbursement from, and be indemnified
from, the Representative Escrow Account, for any and all expenses, charges
and liabilities, including reasonable attorneys fees, incurred by the
Representative in the performance or discharge of its duties pursuant to this
_Section 11.13_ (the " _Representative Expenses_ ").

 

SECTION 11.14 _Legal Representation_.

 

(a) In any dispute or Proceeding arising after the Effective Time relating to
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the parties agree that any of the Stockholders
or the Optionholders shall have the right, at their election, to retain the
firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver and Jacobson LLP (" _Fried_  

 



71   _Frank_ ") to represent such Stockholder or Optionholder or their
respective Affiliates in such matter, and Parent and the Surviving Corporation
(on behalf of themselves, their respective Affiliates, directors, officers,
employees and representatives and their respective successors and assigns)
hereby irrevocably waive any conflicts that may arise in connection with Fried
Frank representing any such Stockholders or Optionholders or their respective
Affiliates after the Closing as such representation may relate to Parent,
Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and,
in each case, the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Each of the parties further agrees that, as to all communications
involving attorney-client confidences among Fried Frank, the Company, any of
its Subsidiaries and any Stockholder or any Optionholder or their respective
Affiliates relating to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the attorney-client privilege
belongs to such Stockholder or Optionholder or Affiliate, as applicable, and
shall not pass to or be claimed by the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries or Affiliates.

 

(c) If the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the other
agreements contemplated hereby are consummated:

 

(i) the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall have
no right of access to or control over any of Fried Franks records related to
the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, which shall become the property of (and be
controlled by) the Stockholders or the Optionholders, as applicable; and

 

(ii) it would be impracticable to remove from the records (including emails
and other electronic files) of the Company and its Subsidiaries any
privileged communications with Fried Frank and the parties agree that no
attorney-client privilege is waived or intended to be waived by allowing such
material to remain in the files of the Company or its Subsidiaries.

 

(d) Furthermore, in the event of a dispute between any Stockholders or the
Optionholders, on the one hand, and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the other hand, arising out of or relating to any matter related to the
negotiation, documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement in which Fried Frank acted for them both, none of
the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client confidence or any
other rights to any evidentiary privilege will protect from disclosure to the
Stockholders or the Optionholders, as applicable, any information or documents
developed or shared during the course of Fried Franks joint representation
of the Stockholders and the Optionholders and the Company and its
Subsidiaries.

 

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) none of the Surviving Corporation or
any of its Subsidiaries is waiving any attorney-client privilege (including
relating to the negotiation, documentation and consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this

 



72  Agreement) or work product protection in connection with any third-party
litigation and the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries may assert any
such privilege or protection to prevent disclosure of confidential
communications by Fried Frank in connection with any such third-party
litigation, and (ii) for the avoidance of doubt, this _Section 11.14_ shall
not apply to any representation by Fried Frank of any Stockholder or
Optionholder (or their respective Affiliates) unrelated to the negotiation,
documentation and consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the representation of any other Person by Fried Frank.
