Price_ "), as allocated and as adjusted in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. The Purchase Price, as adjusted pursuant to Section 10.02,
shall be paid to Seller at Closing (as defined in Section 10.01) by means of a
completed federal funds transfer to an account designated in writing by Seller
not less than one (1) business day prior to the Closing.

Section 2.02 _Deposit_. No later than one (1) business day after the execution
of this Agreement by Buyer and Seller, Buyer shall deliver to Deutsche Bank,
N.A. (the " _Escrow Agent_ "), a performance guarantee deposit in the amount
of ten percent (10.0%) of the unadjusted Purchase Price (the " _Deposit_ ").
The Deposit shall be paid by Buyer to the Escrow Agent by means of a
completed federal funds transfer to an account (the " _Escrow Account_ ") with
the Escrow Agent, to be held, invested, and disbursed in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement and an escrow agreement of even date herewith among
Seller, Buyer, and Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").

 

Section 2.03 _Allocated Values_. Buyer and Seller have agreed on the
allocation of the Purchase Price among the Assets as set forth in Exhibit C
attached hereto (the " _Allocated Values_ "). Seller and Buyer agree that the
Allocated Values shall be used for federal income tax purposes, for
computation of any adjustments to the Purchase Price pursuant to
the provisions of Article III and Article IV, and for all other purposes
incident to this Agreement.

 



(4) Section 2.04 _Effective Time_. If the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated in accordance with the terms and provisions hereof, the ownership
of the Assets shall be transferred from Seller to Buyer on the Closing Date,
but effective as of 7:00 a.m. local time where the Assets are located on
September 1, 2016 (the " _Effective Time_ ").

Article III

 

TITLE MATTERS

 

Section 3.01 _Examination Period_. Following the execution date of this
Agreement until the earlier of the Closing Date or the date on which this
Agreement is terminated pursuant to Article XI (the " _Examination Period_ "),
Seller shall permit Buyer and/or its representatives (including Buyers
Environmental Consultant) to examine, at all reasonable times, in Sellers
offices, all abstracts of title, title opinions, title files, ownership maps,
lease files, contract files, assignments, division orders, operating and
accounting records and agreements pertaining to the Assets insofar as same may
now be in existence and in the possession of Seller, subject to such
restrictions on disclosure as may exist under confidentiality agreements or
other agreements binding on Seller or such data. During the Examination
Period, (a) Seller shall give Buyer and/or its representatives (including
Buyers Environmental Consultant) access to the Assets to inspect the
condition of such Assets and (b) Seller shall use reasonable efforts
(including the assertion of any rights of Seller to information to which
Seller is entitled pursuant to an applicable joint operating agreement) to
obtain permission for Buyer to gain access to the Assets operated by Third
Parties and the records and files of such Third Parties to inspect
the condition of such Assets, records, and files.

Section 3.02 _Defensible Title and Permitted Encumbrances_. For purposes of
this Agreement, the term " _Defensible Title_ " means, with respect to a
given Asset, such title of Seller in such Asset that, subject to and except
for the Permitted Encumbrances (as defined in Subsection (e) of this Section
3.02):



     | (a) | entitles Seller (and will entitle Buyer, as successor in
interest to Seller) to receive not less than the percentage set forth in
Exhibit B as Sellers " _Net Revenue Interest_ " of all
Hydrocarbons produced, saved and marketed from each well or unit as set forth
in Exhibit B, all without reduction, suspension or termination of such
interest throughout the productive life of such well; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) | obligates Seller (and will obligate Buyer as successor in
interest to Seller) to bear not greater than the percentage set forth in
Exhibit B as Sellers " _Working Interest_ " of the costs and expenses

set forth in Exhibit B, all without increase (unless accompanied by a
corresponding and proportionate increase in Sellers Net Revenue
Interest) throughout the productive life of such well; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | is free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects in
title. 
---|---|--- 
 



(5) the productive life of such Undeveloped Lease, to the aggregate number of Net
Mineral Acres in and to all such Undeveloped Lease set forth therefor on
Exhibit C. The term " _Undeveloped Lease_ " means each Lease (or portion
thereof) that is not included in or allocated to the proration unit for a
Well. The term " _Net Mineral Acre_ " means, as to each parcel or tract
burdened by an Undeveloped Lease, the product of (i) the number of surface
acres of land that are described in such parcel or tract (i.e., gross acres),
_multiplied by_ (ii) the undivided interests in the fee minerals, non-
executive interests and other mineral fee interests in the lands covered by
such parcel or tract burdened by the applicable Undeveloped Lease, _multiplied
by_ (iii) Sellers working interest in such Undeveloped Lease. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | The term " _Permitted Encumbrances_ " shall mean any of the
following matters to the extent the same are valid and subsisting and affect
the Assets: 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (i) | the terms and provisions of the Leases and Contracts, to the
extent that they do not, individually or in the aggregate, reduce Sellers (or
Buyers, as successor in interest to Seller) Net Revenue Interest below that
shown in Exhibit B, reduce Sellers Net Mineral Acres in an Undeveloped Lease
below that shown in Exhibit C or increase Sellers (or Buyers, as successor
in interest to Seller) Working Interest above that shown on Exhibit B without
a corresponding and proportionate increase in the Net Revenue Interest; 
---|---|--- 



     | (ii) | any materialmans, mechanics, repairmans, employees,
contractors, operators liens or other similar liens or charges for
liquidated amounts arising in the ordinary course of business, and which
amounts are not yet delinquent or, if delinquent, that are being contested in
good faith in the ordinary course of business; 
---|---|---

other rights in respect of surface operations, pipelines, grazing, hunting,
lodging, canals, ditches, reservoirs or the like, and (B) easements for
streets, alleys, highways, pipelines, 

---|---|--- 
 



(6) rights-of-way on, over or in respect of property owned or leased by Seller or
over which Seller owns rights-of-way, easements, permits or licenses, in each
case, to the extent that same do not individually or in the aggregate
materially interfere with the oil and gas operations to be conducted on any
Asset; 
---|--- 
 



     | (vi) | all lessors royalties, overriding royalties, net profits
interests, carried interests, production payments, reversionary interests and
other burdens on or deductions from the proceeds of production in existence
as of the Effective Time, whether recorded or unrecorded, provided that such
matters do not operate to reduce the Net Revenue Interests of Seller below
those set forth in Exhibit B, reduce Sellers Net Mineral Acres in an
Undeveloped Leases below that shown in Exhibit C or increase the Working
Interests of Seller above those set forth in Exhibit B without a corresponding
and proportionate increase in the Net Revenue Interests; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (vii) | preferential rights to purchase or similar agreements with
respect to which (A) waivers or consents are obtained from the appropriate
parties for the transaction contemplated hereby, or (B) required notices have
been given for the transaction contemplated hereby to the holders of such
rights and the appropriate period for asserting such rights has expired
without an exercise of such rights or without dispute; 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (viii) | required Third Party consents to assignments or similar

of such rights and the appropriate period for asserting such rights has
expired without an exercise of such rights or without dispute;  
---|---|--- 



     | (ix) | all rights to consent by, required notices to, filings
with, or other actions by Governmental Authorities in connection with the sale

obtained subsequent to such sale or conveyance and if such Governmental
Authority is, pursuant to applicable law, without discretion to refuse to
grant such consent if specifically enumerated conditions set forth in such
applicable law are satisfied;  
---|---|--- 



     | (x) | rights reserved to or vested in any Governmental Authority
to control or regulate any of the Assets and the applicable Laws, rules, and
regulations of such Governmental Authorities; 
---|---|--- 
 



(7) Closing and that are actually released at Closing; 
---|---|--- 



     | (xii) | any defect that (A) is based solely on a lack of
information in the files of Seller or references to a document if such
document is not in the files of Seller; (B) arises out of lack of corporate or
other entity authorization unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence that
the action was not authorized and results in another persons superior claim
of title to the relevant Asset; (C) is in the chain of title consisting of the
failure to recite marital status in a document or omissions of successions of
heirship or estate proceedings, unless Buyer provides affirmative evidence
that such failure or omission could reasonably be expected to result in
another persons superior claim of title to the relevant Asset; (D) arises
out of a lack of survey, unless a survey is expressly required by applicable
Laws; (E) consists of an alleged defect in the authorization, execution,
delivery, acknowledgement or approval in Sellers chain of title unless Buyer
provides affirmative evidence that such defect has resulted in another partys
superior claim of title; (F) is based on any failure of the records of any
Person to reflect sufficient production or operations over any period of time
unless the applicable lessor has alleged in writing that such failure has
caused the applicable Lease to terminate or expire or Buyer provides evidence
of insufficient production or operations that could reasonably be expected to
give rise to a right to terminate or partially terminate the applicable Lease
or cause the applicable Lease to expire or partially expire; or (G) is based
on unreleased instruments (including prior oil and gas leases and mortgages)
that pursuant to their terms are not in force and effect; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (xiii) | all defects and irregularities affecting the Assets which
individually or in the aggregate do not operate to reduce the Net Revenue
Interests of Seller below those set forth in Exhibit B, reduce Sellers
Net Mineral Acres in an Undeveloped Leases below that shown in Exhibit C or
increase the Working Interests of Seller above those set forth in Exhibit B
without a corresponding and proportionate increase in the Net Revenue
Interests, operate to interfere materially with the operation, value or use
of the Assets, and that would not be considered material when applying general
industry standards. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 3.03 _Title Defect_ _._ The term " _Title Defect_ ," as used in this
Agreement, shall mean: (a) any encumbrance, encroachment, irregularity,
defect in or objection to Sellers ownership of any Asset (expressly excluding
Permitted Encumbrances) that causes Seller not to have Defensible Title to
such Asset; or (b) any default by Seller under a lease, farmout agreement or
other contract or agreement that would (i) have a material adverse effect on
the operation, value or use of such Asset, (ii) prevent Seller from receiving
the proceeds of production attributable to Sellers interest therein or (iii)
result in cancellation of Sellers interest therein.

 



(8) Section 3.04 _Notice of Title Defects_.

 



     | (a) | If Buyer discovers any Title Defect affecting any Asset,
Buyer shall notify Seller as promptly as reasonably possible, but no later
than October 10, 2016 (the " _Defect Notice Date_ "), of such alleged Title
Defect. To be effective, such notice must (i) be in writing, (ii) be sent to
Seller by 5:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time on the Defect Notice Date, (iii)
describe the Title Defect in reasonably sufficient, specific
detail (including any alleged variance in the Net Revenue Interest), (iv)
identify the specific Asset or Assets affected by such Title Defect, and (v)
include the value of such Title Defect as determined by Buyer. Any matters
that may otherwise constitute Title Defects, but of which Seller has not been
specifically notified by Buyer in accordance with the foregoing, shall,
subject to Sellers special warranty of title in the Assignment, be deemed to
have been waived by Buyer for all purposes and shall constitute Permitted
Encumbrances. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Upon the receipt of any such effective notice from Buyer,
Seller, at Sellers option, may, but shall not be obligated to, elect to
attempt to cure such Title Defect at any time prior to the Closing.  
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | The value attributable to each Title Defect (the " _Title
Defect Value_ ") that is asserted by Buyer in the Title Defect notices shall
be determined based upon the criteria set forth below:  
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | If the Title Defect is a lien upon any Asset that is
liquidated in amount, the Title Defect Value is the amount necessary to be
paid to unconditionally remove the lien from the affected Asset. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (ii) | If the Title Defect asserted is that the Net Revenue
Interest attributable to any Asset is less than that stated in Exhibit B, then
the Title Defect Amount shall be the product of the Allocated Value of such
Asset multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the decrease in
Sellers Net Revenue Interest and the denominator of which is Sellers Net
Revenue Interest stated on Exhibit B. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (iii) |

if a Title Defect constitutes a reduction in the aggregate number of Net
Mineral Acres as to Sellers interest in an Undeveloped Lease, then the Title
Defect Amount shall be equal to the product of (A) the Net Mineral Acre Price
therefore _multiplied by_ (B) the remainder of (1) the number of Net Mineral
Acres set forth on Exhibit C purported to be included in such Sellers
interest in such 

---|---|--- 
 



(9) Net Mineral Acres included in Sellers interest in such Undeveloped Lease
after giving effect to such Title Defect. As used herein, the term " _Net
Mineral Acre Price_ " means, with respect to each Undeveloped Lease, the value
set forth in Exhibit C for each Net Mineral Acre burdened by such Undeveloped
Lease. 
---|--- 
 



     | (iv) | If the Title Defect represents an obligation, encumbrance,
burden or charge upon the affected Asset (including any increase in Working
Interest set forth on Exhibit B for which there is not a corresponding
and proportionate increase in Net Revenue Interest) for which the economic
detriment to Buyer is unliquidated, the amount of the Title Defect Value shall
be determined by taking into account the Allocated Value of the affected
Asset, the portion of the Asset affected by the Title Defect, the legal
effect of the Title Defect, the potential discounted economic effect of the
Title Defect over the life of the affected Asset, and the Title Defect Values
placed upon the Title Defect by Buyer and Seller.  
---|---|--- 



     | (v) | If a Title Defect is not in effect or does not adversely
affect an Asset throughout the entire productive life of such Asset, such fact
shall be taken into account in determining the Title Defect Value.  
---|---|--- 



     | (vi) | The Title Defect Value of a Title Defect shall be
determined without duplication of any costs or losses included in another
Title Defect Value hereunder to the extent such costs or losses generate an
adjustment to the Purchase Price. 
---|---|--- 



     | (vii) | Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no
event shall a Title Defect Value exceed the Allocated Value of the wells,
units or other Assets affected thereby. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (viii) | Such other factors as are reasonably necessary to make a
proper evaluation. 
---|---|--- 

Section 3.05  _Remedies for Title Defects_.



     | (a) | With respect to each Title Defect that Seller does not cure
to Buyers reasonable satisfaction on or before the Closing, except as
otherwise provided in this Section 3.05, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by an amount equal to the Title Defect Value agreed upon in writing
by Buyer and Seller and Seller shall assign the Asset subject to such Title
Defect to Buyer at Closing without further claim against Seller. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

If on or before Closing the Parties have not agreed upon the validity of any
asserted Title Defect or have not agreed on the Title Defect Value
attributable thereto, (i) Sellers good faith estimate of the Title Defect
Value(s) shall be used for the purposes of determining the Purchase Price  

---|---|--- 
 



(10) to and without waiver of either Partys right to have the validity of such
Title Defect and/or such Title Defect Value determined by an Independent
Expert pursuant to Section 16.03 following Closing, and (ii), Seller shall
assign the affected Asset(s) to Buyer at Closing, subject to the determination
of the validity of any Title Defect and/or Title Defect Value by the
Independent Expert and any necessary adjustments to the Purchase Price on the
final Accounting Statement pursuant to Section 12.02. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
(i) if the Title Defect Value of a given individual Title Defect does not
exceed $75,000, then no adjustment to the Purchase Price shall be made for
such Title Defect and (ii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price
determined in accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects does not exceed
one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments
thereto, then no adjustment of the Purchase Price shall be made therefor, and
(iii) if the aggregate adjustment to the Purchase Price determined in
accordance with this Agreement for Title Defects does exceed one and one-half
percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price prior to any adjustments thereto, then
the Purchase Price shall only be adjusted by the amount of such excess (such
adjustment, the " _Title Defect Adjustment_ "). 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 3.06 _Preferential Rights To Purchase_. Seller shall use its
reasonable efforts to comply with all preferential right to purchase
provisions relative to any Asset prior to the Closing. Seller shall determine
(in its reasonable judgment) the extent of the preferential purchase rights
encumbering the Assets, and said determination shall be used by Seller to
provide the preferential purchase right notifications. If, (i) prior to
Closing, a holder of a preferential purchase right notifies Seller that it
intends to exercise its rights with respect to an Asset to which its
preferential purchase right applies (as determined in accordance with the
agreement in which the preferential purchase right arises), or (ii) the time
period for exercising such preferential right has not expired prior to the
Closing or been waived by the holder thereof, then, in each case, the Asset
covered by said preferential purchase right shall be excluded from the Assets
to be conveyed to Buyer, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the Allocated
Value of said Asset as set forth on attached Exhibit C, and Seller shall be
entitled to retain all proceeds paid for the affected Asset by the Person
exercising such preferential right to purchase or similar right. If the holder
of the preferential purchase right fails to consummate the purchase of the
Asset subject to the preferential purchase right, Seller shall promptly
notify Buyer. Within ten (10) calendar days after Buyers receipt of such
notice or Closing, whichever is later, Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer
shall purchase from Seller, such Asset under the terms of this Agreement for
a price equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset as set forth on Exhibit C.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no obligation under this
Agreement or otherwise to purchase the Asset if Buyer is not notified of the
preferential purchase right holders failure to consummate the purchase of the
Asset within ninety (90) calendar days following Closing. Subject to the last
sentence of this Section 3.06, Seller will send out the applicable
preferential right to purchase notices within five (5) business days after the
date this Agreement is executed. In no event will Seller or any of its
affiliates send any notices pursuant to this Section 3.06 until the earlier
of (x) Buyers initial public announcement regarding this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby and (y) four (4) business days after the date
this Agreement is executed.

 



(11) Section 3.07 _Consents to Assignment_. Subject to the last sentence of
this Section 3.07, within five (5) business days after the date this
Agreement is executed, Seller shall prepare and send notices to the holders of
all necessary consents from Third Parties to assign the Assets prior to
Closing that are set forth on Schedule 5.12 (other than governmental
approvals that are customarily obtained after Closing). Seller shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require the payment of money;
provided that Seller gives Buyer the option to make such payment) to obtain
such consents and Buyer shall, upon request of Seller, use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Seller in obtaining such consents. Seller shall
deliver a written notice to Buyer on or before the date that is five (5)
business days prior to Closing setting forth each consent requirement which,
as of such date, has not been unconditionally satisfied or waived. In no event
shall there be transferred at Closing any Asset for which a consent
requirement has not been satisfied and for which the failure to obtain such
consent would (i) cause (A) the assignment to Buyer of any portion of the
Assets to be void or voidable or (B) the termination of a Lease under the
express terms thereof, or (ii) require the payment of a fee (unless Buyer
agrees in writing to pay such fee). To the extent such consents are not
obtained prior to Closing and, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer, could
invalidate the conveyance of some or all of the Assets hereunder or the
Leases, then the affected Asset shall be excluded from the Assets to be
conveyed to Buyer at Closing, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by the
Allocated Value of said Asset as set forth on Exhibit C, and the affected
Asset shall constitute an Excluded Asset and be deemed deleted from the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto. In all other cases, such un-obtained consents
shall not cause the affected Assets to be excluded from the Assets to be
conveyed to Buyer at Closing. If the holder of a consent requirement that is
not obtained by Closing and causes the affected Asset to be excluded from the
Closing later provides such consent, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer.
Within ten (10) calendar days after Buyers receipt of such notice from
Seller or Closing, whichever is later, Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer
shall purchase from Seller, such Asset under the terms of this Agreement for a
price equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset as set forth on Exhibit C.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer shall have no obligation under this
Agreement or otherwise to purchase the Asset if Buyer is not notified of the
obtained consent within 120 calendar days following Closing. In no event will
Seller or any of its affiliates send any notices pursuant to this Section
3.07 until the earlier of (x) Buyers initial public announcement regarding
this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and (y) four (4)
business days after the date this Agreement is executed.

Section 3.08 _Remedies for Title Benefits_.

 



     | (a) |

If either Party discovers any Title Benefit affecting the Assets during the
period from the date of this Agreement to 5:00 p.m. Central Daylight Time on
the Defect Notice Date, it shall promptly notify the other Party in writing
thereof on or before such expiration. With respect to each Asset affected by
Title Benefits reported under this Section 3.08, the Title Defect Amount for
such Asset, if any, shall be decreased by an amount (the " _Title Benefit
Value_ ") equal to the increase in the Allocated Value for such Asset caused
by such Title Benefits, taking into account the portion of Sellers interest
in the Subject Interest affected by the Title Benefit, the 

---|---|--- 
 



(12) effect of the Title Benefit over the life of the Subject Interest, the values
placed on the Title Benefit by Buyer and Seller, and such other factors as
are necessary to make a proper evaluation and determination of such value;
_provided_ , however, that (i) if the Title Benefit Value of a given
individual Title Benefit does not exceed $75,000, then no upward adjustment
to the Purchase Price shall be made for such Title Benefit, and (ii) there
shall be no upward adjustment to the Purchase Price unless and until the
aggregate Title Benefit Values which would generate an upward adjustment to
the Purchase Price pursuant to clause (i) exceeds one and one-half percent
(1.5%) of the Purchase Price, and then only to the extent that such aggregate
amount exceeds one and one-half percent (1.5%) of the Purchase Price. For
purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Title Benefit_ " shall mean Sellers
Net Revenue Interest in any Subject Interest that is greater than that set
forth in Exhibit B (without a corresponding and proportionate increase in
Sellers Working Interest above that shown in Exhibit B) or Sellers Net
Mineral Acres in any Undeveloped Lease is greater than that shown in Exhibit C
or Sellers Working Interest in any Subject Interest that is less than the
Working Interest set forth in Exhibit B (without a corresponding decrease in
the Net Revenue Interest). Any matters that may otherwise constitute Title
Benefits, but of which Buyer has not been specifically notified by Seller in
accordance with the foregoing, shall be deemed to have been waived by Seller
for all purposes. 
---|--- 



     | (b) | If, with respect to a Title Benefit, the Parties are not
deemed to have agreed on the existence of the Title Benefit or the Title
Benefit Value prior to the Closing Date, (i) Sellers good faith estimate
of such Title Benefit Value shall be used to determine the offset to the
applicable Title Defect Amount, subject to and without waiver of either
Partys right to have the validity of such Title Benefit and/or such Title
Benefit Value determined by an Independent Expert pursuant to Section 16.03
following Closing, and (ii) Seller shall assign the Asset to Buyer at Closing,
subject to the determination of the validity of the Title Benefit and/or Title
Benefit Value by the Independent Expert and any necessary adjustments to the
Purchase Price on the final Accounting Statement pursuant to Section 12.02. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 3.09 _EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO TITLE DEFECTS AND TITLE
BENEFITS_. EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO THE SPECIAL WARRANTY CONTAINED IN THE
ASSIGNMENT, THIS ARTICLE III SHALL, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED PURSUANT
TO APPLICABLE LAW, BE THE EXCLUSIVE RIGHT AND REMEDY OF THE BUYER WITH RESPECT
TO TITLE DEFECTS. BUYER RELEASES, REMISES, AND FOREVER DISCHARGES SELLER FROM
ANY AND ALL SUITS, LEGAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS, DEMANDS,
DAMAGES, LOSSES, LIABILITIES, COSTS AND EXPENSES, INCLUDING COURT COSTS AND
REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES, INTERESTS OR CAUSES OF ACTION WHATSOEVER, IN LAW
OR IN EQUITY, CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE, KNOWN

 



(13)  OR UNKNOWN, WHICH BUYER MAY NOW OR SUBSEQUENTLY HAVE BASED ON, RELATING TO,
OR ARISING OUT OF, ANY TITLE DEFECT(S) EXCEPT FOR A BREACH OF THE SPECIAL
WARRANTY CONTAINED IN THE ASSIGNMENT. IN ADDITION, TITLE DEFECT(S) SHALL NOT
BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHETHER THE CONDITION SET
FORTH IN SECTION 8.01 HAS BEEN SATISFIED OR FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING
WHETHER BUYER HAS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THIS AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO ARTICLE
XI (OTHER THAN A TERMINATION UNDER ARTICLE XI THAT IS BASED ON SECTION 8.04).

Article IV

 

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

 

Section 4.01 _Environmental Review_.



     | (a) |

Buyer shall have the right to conduct or cause a consultant (" _Buyer s
Environmental Consultant_") to conduct an environmental review of the Assets
and Sellers records pertaining to the Assets (as set forth in Section 3.01)
during the Examination Period (" _Buyer s Environmental Review_"). The cost
and expense of Buyers Environmental Review, if any, shall be borne solely by
Buyer. The scope of work comprising Buyers Environmental Review shall not
include any invasive test or procedure unless Buyer, in its reasonable
discretion based on the findings of Buyers Environmental Review, determines
that an invasive test or procedure is needed with respect to an Asset and
Seller consents to such invasive test or procedure. In the event that Buyer
requests an invasive test or procedure pursuant to the forgoing sentence and
Buyer does not obtain the prior written consent of Seller to such invasive
test or procedure, Buyer may, in its sole discretion, exclude the affected
Asset from the sale, in which case the affected Asset shall be excluded from
the Asset to be conveyed to Buyer at Closing, the Purchase Price shall be
reduced by the Allocated Value of said Asset as set forth on Exhibit C, and
the affected Asset shall constitute an Excluded Asset and be deemed deleted
from the Exhibits and Schedules hereto. Buyer shall (and shall cause Buyers
Environmental Consultant to): (i) notify Seller two (2) business days prior to
conducting any work comprising Buyers Environmental Review that requires
access to the Assets, (ii) perform any work physically on the Assets in a safe
and workmanlike manner consistent with the standard of care normally exercised
in the course of such work and so as to not unreasonably interfere
with Sellers operations, and (iii) comply in all material respects with all
applicable Laws, rules, and regulations. Seller shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to assist Buyer with obtaining any Third Party consents
that are required in order to perform any work comprising Buyers
Environmental Review, and Buyer shall consult with Seller prior to requesting
each such Third Party consent. To the extent 

---|---|--- 
 



(14) accessing the Assets, Seller shall have the right to have a representative or
representatives accompany Buyer and Buyers Environmental Consultant at all
times during Buyers Environmental Review. With respect to any samples taken
in connection with Buyers Environmental Review, Buyer shall take split
samples, providing one of each such sample, properly labeled and identified,
to Seller. Buyer hereby agrees to release, defend, indemnify and hold harmless
Seller from and against all claims, losses, damages, costs, expenses, causes
of action and judgments of any kind or character (INCLUDING THOSE RESULTING
FROM SELLERS SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT
LIABILITY, BUT EXCLUDING THOSE RESULTING FROM SELLERS GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR
WILLFUL MISCONDUCT) to the extent arising out of or relating to
Buyers Environmental Review; provided however that Buyer shall have no
responsibility under this sentence for conditions existing prior to Buyers
Environmental Review or the discovery of such conditions except to the extent
constituting an Assumed Obligation under Section 14.02. Buyer hereby
covenants and agrees that (x) it will have at least $10,000,000 of general
liability insurance to cover its indemnifications hereunder prior to the
commencement of Buyers Environmental Review or (y) will have the financial
capacity to satisfy up to $10,000,000 of indemnification obligations of Buyer
pursuant to this Section 4.01. Buyer shall deliver to Seller a copy of any

delivered by Buyer at Closing) and the transactions contemplated hereby are
duly and validly authorized by all requisite corporate action on the part of
Buyer. This Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding obligation of
Buyer enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such enforceability
may be limited by the effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium, and similar Laws from time to time in effect relating to the
rights and remedies of creditors, as well as to general principles of equity
(regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in
equity or at law).

 

Section 6.04 _Brokers_. No broker or finder is entitled to any brokerage or
finders fee, or to any commission, based in any way on agreements,
arrangements or understandings made by or on behalf of Buyer or any affiliate
of Buyer for which Seller has or will have any liabilities or obligations
(contingent or otherwise).

 

Section 6.05 _Bankruptcy_. There are no bankruptcy, reorganization or
arrangement proceedings pending, being contemplated by or to the knowledge of
Buyer threatened against Buyer or any affiliate of Buyer. Assuming (i)
satisfaction of the conditions in Article VIII or waiver of such conditions,
and (ii) the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller set
forth in this Agreement, and after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including payment of the Purchase Price,
payment of all amounts required to be paid in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby and payment of all related fees and
expenses, Buyer will be Solvent as of the Closing and immediately following
the Closing. For purposes of this Section 6.05, " _Solvent_ " with respect to
Buyer means that, as of any date of determination, (i) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of Buyer and its subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, exceeds, as of such date, the sum of (A) the value of all "liabilities
of Buyer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, including contingent and
other liabilities," as of such date, as such quoted terms are generally
determined in accordance with the applicable federal and state Laws governing
determinations of the insolvency of debtors, including applicable fraudulent
transfer Laws, and (B) the amount that will be required to pay the probable

 



(26)  liabilities of Buyer and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole on its existing
debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts become
absolute and mature; (ii) Buyer will not have, as of such date, an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the business in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged following the Closing Date; and
(iii) Buyer will be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and
other liabilities, as they mature.

Section 6.06 _Suits_. There is no suit, action, claim, investigation
or inquiry by any person or entity or by any administrative agency or
Governmental Authority and no legal, administrative or arbitration proceeding
pending or, to Buyers knowledge, threatened against Buyer or any affiliate of
Buyer that has materially affected or will materially affect Buyers ability
to consummate the transactions contemplated herein.

Section 6.07  _Qualifications_. Buyer is now, and after the Closing shall
continue to be, qualified with all applicable Governmental Authorities to own
and operate the Assets and has, and shall maintain, all necessary bonds to own
and operate the Assets. 

Section 6.08 _Investment_. Prior to entering into this Agreement, Buyer was
advised by and has relied solely on its own legal, tax and other professional
counsel concerning this Agreement, the Assets and the value thereof. Buyer is
acquiring the Assets for its own account and not for distribution or resale in
any manner that would violate any state or federal securities law, rule,
regulation or order. Buyer understands and acknowledges that if any of the
Assets were held to be securities, they would be restricted securities and
could not be transferred without registration under applicable state and
federal securities Laws or the availability of an exemption from such
registration.

Section 6.09 _Funds_. Buyer has, or will have contractually arranged to have
available by the Closing Date, sufficient funds to enable Buyer to pay in full
the Purchase Price as herein provided and otherwise to perform its obligations
under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.10 _Non-Reliance_. Except with respect to the representations and
warranties of Seller set forth in Article V (including the related disclosure
schedules), the certificate of Seller to be delivered at Closing and the
special warranty of title in the Assignment delivered at Closing, Buyer has
not relied upon any oral or written statements, representations,
or warranties that may have been made by or on behalf of Seller or any of its
representatives concerning the condition, operation, performance, or prospects
of the Assets, or upon any written reports, financial data, business plans,
projections, or forecasts, any audits, studies, or assessments, or any other
written materials, copies of which may have been furnished to Buyer or as to
which Buyer may have been provided access in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Buyer and its representatives have (a) been
permitted full and complete access to all materials in Sellers (or its
representatives) possession relating to the Assets, (b) been afforded the
opportunity to ask all questions of Seller (or one or more persons acting on
Sellers behalf) concerning the Assets, (c) been afforded the opportunity to
investigate the condition, including the subsurface condition, of the Assets,
and (d) had the opportunity to take such other actions and make such other
independent investigations as Buyer deems necessary to evaluate the Assets and
understand the merits and risks of an investment therein and to verify the
truth, accuracy, and completeness of the materials, documents, and other
information provided or made available to Buyer (whether by Seller or
otherwise). EXCEPT AS PROVIDED ELSEWHERE HEREIN

 



(27)  TO THE CONTRARY, IN THE CERTIFICATE OF SELLER TO BE DELIVERED AT CLOSING AND
THE ASSIGNMENT DELIVERED AT CLOSING, BUYER ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT SELLER
HAS NOT MADE, AND SELLER HEREBY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS, ANY REPRESENTATION OR
WARRANTY AS TO THE ACCURACY OR COMPLETENESS OF ANY INFORMATION CONTAINED IN

or threatened tax audit, examination, or assessment that could reasonably be
expected to affect the others tax liability under applicable Law or
this Agreement (a " _Tax Controversy_ "), and promptly furnish the other with
copies of all correspondence with respect to any Tax Controversy, allow the

forth in Article VIII have been met and Seller terminates this Agreement
pursuant to Section 11.01(b) above, and if Seller has materially performed all

performance of this Agreement. If Seller exercises such right of termination,
Seller and Buyer shall execute and deliver joint written instructions to the

Seller in immediately available funds within three (3) business days after the
event giving rise to such payment to Buyer. In connection with any such

representation herein by Buyer, then in such event, Buyer shall alternatively
be entitled to terminate this Agreement and have the Deposit returned to Buyer
or enforce specific performance of this Agreement. If Buyer exercises such
right of termination, the Parties shall execute and deliver joint written

funds within three (3) business days after the event giving rise to such
payment to Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall thereupon have the rights and
obligations set forth elsewhere herein.

Section 11.04 _Attorneys  Fees, Etc_.. If either Party to this Agreement
resorts to legal proceedings to enforce this Agreement, the prevailing Party
in such proceedings shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred by such
Party, including reasonable attorneys fees, in addition to any other relief
to which such Party may be entitled. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this Agreement, in no event shall either Party, nor any of their respective
affiliates, be entitled to receive any punitive, indirect or consequential
damages, unless same are a part of a Third Party claim for which a Party is
seeking indemnification hereunder, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

 



(36)  CAUSED OR CONTRIBUTED TO BY THE SOLE, JOINT, COMPARATIVE OR CONCURRENT
NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY OF THE OTHER PARTY, BUT EXCLUDING GROSS

Section 12.02 _Final Accounting Statement_.



     | (a) | On or before 120 days after the Closing Date, Seller shall
prepare and deliver to Buyer a post-Closing statement setting forth a detailed
calculation of all post-Closing adjustments applicable to the period of
time between the Effective Time and Closing (" _Accounting Statement_ "). The
Accounting Statement shall include any adjustment or payment which was not
finally determined as of the Closing Date and the allocation of revenues and
expenses as determined in accordance with Section 12.01. To the extent
reasonably requested by Seller, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to assist in the preparation of the Accounting Statement. Seller shall
provide Buyer such data and information as Buyer may reasonably request
supporting the amounts reflected on the Accounting Statement in order to
permit Buyer to perform or cause to be performed an audit. The Accounting
Statement shall become final and binding upon the Parties on the thirtieth
(30th) day following receipt thereof by Buyer (the " _Final Settlement Date_
") unless Buyer gives written notice of its disagreement (a " _Notice of
Disagreement_ ") to Seller on or prior to such date. Any Notice of
Disagreement shall specify in reasonable detail the dollar amount, nature and
basis of any disagreement so asserted. If a Notice of Disagreement is received
by Seller in a timely manner, then the Parties shall resolve the Dispute (as
defined in Section 16.01) evidenced by the Notice of Disagreement in
accordance with Article XVI. 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | Absent Buyers delivery of a Notice of Disagreement pursuant
to Section 12.02(a), within three (3) business days after the Final Settlement
Date, Seller shall pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller in immediately
available funds the net amount due. If Buyer delivers a Notice of Disagreement
to Seller pursuant to Section 12.02(a), within three (3) business days after
resolution of any Dispute regarding such Notice of Disagreement, Seller shall
pay to Buyer or Buyer shall pay to Seller in immediately available funds the
net amount due. 
---|---|--- 

Section 12.03  _Records_. Seller shall make the Records available to be
picked up by Buyer at the offices of Seller during normal business hours
within three (3) business days after the Closing to the extent the Records are
in the possession of Seller or its affiliates and are not subject to
contractual restrictions on transferability. After the Closing Date, until
such time that Seller satisfies its obligation to make the Records available
to be picked up by Buyer, Seller shall provide the Buyer with access to the
Records during normal business hours. Seller shall have the right to retain
copies of any of the Records.

 



(38) Section 12.04 _Exclusive Agreement_. In consideration of the time and expense
to be incurred by Buyer in its evaluation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, Seller agrees that until the earlier to occur of the
termination of this Agreement or the Closing, Seller shall not, and shall not
authorize or permit any of its respective subsidiaries, affiliates or
representatives to (a) solicit, initiate or encourage the submission from any
person of any proposal to directly or indirectly acquire any of the Assets by
such person (any proposal for such a transaction, an " _Alternative Proposal_
"), (b) enter into any agreement with respect to, or approve or recommend, any
Alternative Proposal or (c) participate in any discussions or negotiations
regarding, or furnish to any person any information with respect to, or take
any other action to facilitate any inquiries or the making of any proposal
that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to constitute, any
Alternative Proposal (and any such activity that is being undertaken as of
the date of this Agreement shall be terminated immediately). Without limiting
the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that any violation of the
restrictions set forth in this Section 12.04 by any representative or
affiliate of Seller (whether or not such person is purporting to act on
behalf of Seller) shall be deemed to be a breach of this Section 12.04 by
Seller.

 

Section 12.05 _Certain Restrictions_. Except as hereinafter provided in this
Section 12.05, if the Closing occurs, for a twelve (12) month period
following the Closing Date, Seller shall not, and shall cause its affiliates
not to, (a) lease, acquire any lease, "top lease" or right or option to lease
any lands within Howard County, Texas, regardless of whether it is alleged
that a Lease is not in full force and effect or (b) acquire all or
substantially all of the equity interests (or similar ownership interests) in
a person if such persons real and personal property includes leases, "top
leases" or rights or option to lease lands within Howard County, Texas. For
purposes of this Section 12.05 only, the term "affiliates" shall have no
application to and shall not cover or include, and this Section 12.05 shall
accordingly be inapplicable to, any of (i) ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC or
(ii) any person or entity that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled
by, or is under common control with ArcLight Capital Partners, LLC, other
than (X) Seller and its subsidiaries or (Y) any other such person or entity in
or with which any of S. Todd Gibson, Jamie R. Small, Jiri Klubal, S. Eric
Hopper, Linda Crass, Keith M. Skaar, Jerry S. Berkebile or Taylor G. Sell,
directly or indirectly, owns an equity interest or is employed.

Section 12.06 _Confidentiality_. Seller and Buyer each acknowledge that
confidential information of the other may be disclosed to, made available to,
or otherwise obtained by such Party (in its capacity as the recipient of such
confidential information, the " _Receiving Party_ "), whether prior to or
after the date of this Agreement. Receiving Party may disclose such
information to its affiliates and to its and their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, representatives, consultants, contractors,
attorneys, advisors, lenders (current and prospective) and investors (current
and prospective) who need to know such information for the purpose of aiding
such Party in the transactions contemplated hereby or matters relating
thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that, subject to the remainder of this
Section 12.06, until the first to occur of the one year anniversary of the
Closing or the one year anniversary of the termination of this Agreement,
Receiving Party agrees to maintain (and to cause its affiliates, and its and
their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives,
consultants, contractors, attorneys, advisors, lenders and investors, to
maintain) all information made available to it pursuant to this
Agreement confidential, except to the extent such information (a) is or
becomes generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach
by Receiving Party of this Section 12.06,

 



(39)  (b) was (or becomes) available to Receiving Party (or its affiliates, or its
or their respective directors, officers, employees, agents, representatives,
consultants, advisors, lenders and investors) on a non-confidential basis
prior to its disclosure to Receiving Party, (c) is required by applicable
securities or other Laws or the applicable rules of any stock exchange having
jurisdiction over the Receiving Party or its affiliates, to be disclosed, or
(d) is required, by deposition, interrogatories, requests for information or
documents in legal or regulatory proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative
demand or other similar process or Law to be disclosed ( _provided_ that
Receiving Party shall, if not prohibited by Law, provide disclosing Party with
prompt written notice of any such request or requirement so disclosing Party
may seek a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or
waive compliance with the provisions of this Section 12.06). Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in the foregoing provisions of this Section 12.06,
where Buyer is the Receiving Party, information included in or related to the
Assets transferred to Buyer at Closing shall not constitute confidential
information as to Buyer, provided, however, that until one year after the
Closing, Seller shall be subject to the non-disclosure provisions contained
herein with respect to such information as if Seller was the Receiving Party
of such information.

Section 12.07 _Satisfaction of Closing Conditions_. Subject to the other
terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts (except where a different efforts standard is specifically
contemplated by this Agreement, in which case such different standard shall
apply) to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and to ensure the satisfaction of its
conditions to Closing set forth in Article VII (with respect to Buyer) or
Article VIII (with respect to Seller). For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in
this Section 12.07 is intended to or shall require Seller to cure or attempt
to cure any Title Defects asserted by Buyer under Section 3.04 or
Environmental Defects asserted by Buyer under Section 4.03.

Section 12.08  _Audits and Filings_.



     | (a) | From and after the date of this Agreement, Seller shall
cooperate (and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its affiliates, employees
and auditors to cooperate) with Buyer and its affiliates and their respective

extent reasonably necessary for Buyer and its affiliates to comply with their
tax, financial, or other reporting requirements and audits, including (i) any

required by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission under
securities Laws applicable to Buyer and its affiliates. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (b) |

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Seller will permit Buyer and
its representatives to contact Sellers (and, if applicable, its affiliates)
current and historical accountants, auditors and employees, and Seller shall
use reasonable efforts to cause its (and, if applicable, its affiliates)
current and historical accountants, auditors and employees to (i) discuss,
cooperate and provide information reasonably requested by Buyer or its
representatives, in order for Buyer to prepare audited and unaudited  

---|---|---

each case as would be required in connection with reports, registration
statements and other filings to be made by Buyers parent or any of its
affiliates with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant
to the Securities Act of 1933, as amended from time to time, and the rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended from time to time, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (collectively, " _SEC Filings_ ") and (ii) cooperate with Buyers
parent (and shall use reasonable efforts to cause its affiliates, auditors and
employees to cooperate) with regard to responding to the United States
Securities and Exchange Commissions comments on such financial statements.
In addition, from the date of this Agreement until the Closing, Seller agrees
to reasonably cooperate with Buyers parent in connection with any potential
financing by Buyers parents for the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (the " _Potential Financing_ "), including providing information as
reasonably requested for the preparation of materials for meetings, drafting
sessions, presentations, road shows and due diligence sessions for the
Potential Financing and otherwise providing reasonable access to the
employees of Seller (and, if applicable, its affiliates) in connection with
the same. 
---|--- 



     | (c) | Buyer shall reimburse Seller promptly for any and all out-
of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by Seller or any of its affiliates,
employees, accountants and auditors in performing Sellers obligations
of cooperation and assistance under this Section 12.08.

     | (d) | For a period of seven (7) years following the Closing,
Seller shall retain all books, records, information and documents in its or
its affiliates possession that are reasonably necessary to prepare and
audit financial statements with respect to the Assets, except to the extent

Closing. 
---|---|--- 
 

Section 12.09 _Further Assurances_. After the Closing Date, each Party, at the
request of the other and without additional consideration, shall execute and
deliver, or shall cause to be executed and delivered, from time to time such
further instruments of conveyance and transfer and shall take such other
action as the other Party may reasonably request to convey and deliver the
Assets to Buyer and to accomplish the orderly transfer of the Assets to Buyer
in the manner contemplated by this Agreement. After the Closing, the Parties
will cooperate to have all proceeds received attributable to the Assets be
paid to the proper Party hereunder and to have all expenditures to be made
with respect to the Assets be made by the proper Party hereunder.

---|---|---

contrary contained herein (i) Sellers indemnification obligation under this
Section 14.04 for any breach of any representation or warranty of Seller under
this Agreement or in the certificate delivered at Closing pursuant to Section
10.04(g) that is not a Fundamental Representation or
Environmental Representation or any breach of Sellers covenants and
agreements contained in this Agreement to be performed prior to Closing shall
only apply if Buyer has provided Seller with written notice claiming
indemnification in good faith within twelve (12) months of the Closing Date
and only with respect to the indemnification so claimed, (ii) Sellers
indemnification obligation under this Section 14.04 for any breach of an

and warranties of Seller under this Agreement or in the certificate delivered
at Closing pursuant to Section 10.04(g) that are not Fundamental
Representations and breaches of Sellers covenants and agreements contained

Section 14.05 _Notices and Defense of Indemnified Matters_. Each Party shall

Agreement. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however,
relieve the indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations except and
only to the extent that the indemnifying Party forfeits rights or defenses by
reason of such failure. The indemnifying Party shall be obligated to defend
and shall have the right to prosecute, at the indemnifying Partys sole
expense, any litigation or other administrative or adversarial proceeding
against the indemnified Party relating to any matter for which the
indemnifying Party has agreed to indemnify and hold the indemnified Party
harmless under this Agreement. However, the indemnified Party shall have the
right to participate with the indemnifying Party in the defense of any such
matter at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Party will,
without the other partys written consent, settle, compromise, confess
judgment or permit a judgment by default in any action, suit or proceeding if
such activity does not provide for a full release of the other Party and/or
such activity results in any other detriment to the other Party. The Parties
agree to cooperate with each other to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any matter with respect to which indemnification may be applicable. Any
claim for indemnity under Section 14.03 or 14.04 by any affiliate,
director, officer, employee or agent must be brought and administered by the
applicable Party to this Agreement. No indemnified person other than Seller
and Buyer shall have any rights against either Seller or Buyer under the terms
of Section 14.03 or 14.04 except as may be exercised on its behalf by Buyer
or Seller, as applicable, pursuant to this Section 14.05. Each of Seller and
Buyer may elect to exercise or not exercise indemnification rights under this
Section 14.05 on behalf of the other indemnified persons affiliated with it
in its sole discretion and shall have no liability to any such other
indemnified person for any action or inaction under this Section 14.05.

 

Section 14.06 _Sole and Exclusive Remedy_. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, from and after Closing, Sellers and
Buyers sole and exclusive remedy against each other with respect to breaches
of the representations, warranties, covenants, and agreements of the Parties
contained in this Agreement (other than post-Closing breaches of the
agreements of the Parties set forth in Articles I, II, IX, X, XI, XII and
XVI), and the affirmations of such representations, warranties, covenants, and
agreements contained in the certificates delivered by each Party at Closing

Such Disputed Claim Amount will be disbursed by the Escrow Agent from the
Escrow Account only (i) upon the delivery to the Escrow Agent of a Joint
Written Instruction Letter or (ii) pursuant to a final non-appealable judgment
or decree of a court of competent jurisdiction instructing the Escrow Agent
to disburse such Disputed Claim Amount (a " _Final Determination_ "). 
---|---|---

(without duplication) until otherwise instructed to disburse any portion of
such amount pursuant to any Joint Written Instruction Letters or Final
Determinations, as applicable. 
---|---|--- 
 



     | (e) | The Parties agree and acknowledge that the Holdback Amount
shall not be deemed a limitation to Buyers remedies against Seller pursuant
to this Agreement. To the extent that Buyer is determined to be owed by
Seller amounts in excess of the Holdback Amount, then Seller shall be liable
to, and Buyer may pursue, payment for such amounts.
