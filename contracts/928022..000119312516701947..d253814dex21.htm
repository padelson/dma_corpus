forth on Schedule 5.12 (other than governmental approvals that are customarily obtained after Closing). Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts (which shall not require the payment of money; provided that Seller gives Buyer the option to
make such payment) to obtain such consents and Buyer shall, upon request of Seller, use commercially reasonable efforts to assist Seller in obtaining such consents. Seller shall deliver a written notice to Buyer on or before the date that is five

not been satisfied and for which the failure to obtain such consent would (i)&nbsp;cause (A)&nbsp;the assignment to Buyer of any portion of the Assets to be void or voidable or (B)&nbsp;the termination of a Lease under the express terms thereof, or

the holder of a consent requirement that is not obtained by Closing and causes the affected Asset to be excluded from the Closing later provides such consent, Seller shall promptly notify Buyer. Within ten (10)&nbsp;calendar days after Buyer&#146;s
receipt of such notice from Seller or Closing, whichever is later, Seller shall sell to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, such Asset under the terms of this Agreement for a price equal to the Allocated Value of such Asset as set forth on
