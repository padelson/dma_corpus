whom such Purchased Entity Retained Asset is to be transferred or assigned, or
which will assume such Purchased Entity Retained Liability, as the case
may be, in order to place such member of the Atlas Group in a substantially
similar position as if such Purchased Entity Retained Asset or such Purchased
Entity Retained Liability had been transferred, assigned or assumed as

money unless the necessary funds are advanced (or otherwise made available)
by Atlas or the member of the Atlas Group entitled to the Purchased Entity
Retained Asset or Purchased Entity Retained Liability, other than reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses, attorneys fees and recording or similar fees, all of
which shall be promptly reimbursed by Atlas or the member of the Atlas Group
entitled to such Purchased Entity Retained Asset or Purchased Entity Retained
Liability.

 



     | 2.8 | _Unassigned Assets of Drilling Partnerships; Hedging Cash_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Atlas shall, and shall cause the applicable Atlas Subsidiaries to, as
promptly as practicable after the date hereof, transfer all Unassigned Assets
of Drilling Partnerships to the applicable Drilling Partnerships (or, at the
election of the Purchased Entity that is the general partner of any such
Drilling Partnership, to such Purchased Entity). It is understood and agreed
that the obligations in the preceding sentence shall continue to apply after
the Closing in respect of any Unassigned Assets of Drilling Partnerships that
are not so transferred prior to the Closing.

(b) At or prior to the Closing, (i) Atlas shall unwind all Hedges entered into
by Atlas or any Atlas Subsidiary, in whole or in part, on behalf of any
Drilling Partnership and transfer to AHD at Closing on behalf of such
Drilling Partnership that portion of the cash resulting from such unwind that
is allocable to such Drilling Partnership, such allocation to be made using
the same policies and practices historically used by Atlas and the Atlas
Subsidiaries to allocate the benefits and burdens of Hedges amongst Drilling
Partnerships and other businesses of Atlas and the Atlas Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that only the cash attributable to limited partner
interests of Third Party Drilling Partnership Limited Partners will be
transferred to AHD (the cash required to be so transferred to AHD, the "
_Hedging Cash_ ").

(c) As promptly as practicable after the date hereof, Atlas or ATN shall use
its reasonable best efforts to enter into a new Hedge Contract (the " _New
Hedge Contract_ ") in reasonable consultation with AHD that is intended to
benefit from or reduce the risk of fluctuations in the price of Hydrocarbons
or

 



-34-   other commodities produced by the Transferred Business consistent with its
historical policies and practices and that has the terms described in the next
sentence. Any such New Hedge Contract must, if entered into pursuant to the
preceding sentence, by its terms provide that it shall be assumed by AHD if
the Closing occurs (and that Atlas or ATN, as applicable, shall be released
from all of its obligations thereunder and that all collateral posted by
Atlas or ATN, as applicable, in connection therewith shall be released or
otherwise returned, in each case upon such assumption by AHD) or shall remain
a Contract of Atlas if this Agreement is terminated prior to the Closing. 

2.9 _Amount and Form of Consideration_. Subject to _Section 2.10_, the
consideration to be paid by AHD to ATN at the Closing in full consideration
of the Purchased Equity Interests and the Purchased Assets shall consist of:

(a) 23,379,384 newly issued AHD Common Units;

(b) $30,000,000 in cash; and

 

(c) the assumption by AHD on and as of the Closing Date of the Assumed
Liabilities.

 

2.10 _Substitution of AHD Common Units for Cash Consideration; Parent Option
to Provide Financing_.

 

(a) [Reserved]

 

(b) If the Financing pursuant to the Commitment Letter becomes reasonably
likely to be unavailable for any reason, then Atlas may elect, at any time on
or prior to the date that is five Business Days before the anticipated Closing
Date, to require AHD to (i) substitute 3,188,098 newly issued AHD Common Units
for the cash payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_ or (ii) accept Financing
from Chevron on the terms set forth in the Commitment Letter.

(c) The AHD Common Units issuable pursuant to _Section 2.9(a)_, together
with the AHD Common Units, if any, issuable pursuant to this _Section 2.10_
in lieu of the cash payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_, are collectively
referred to herein as the " _New AHD Common Units_." The aggregate amount, if
any, of cash payable pursuant to _Section 2.9(b)_, which may be eliminated
pursuant to this _Section 2.10_, is referred to herein as the "
_Cash Consideration_." The New AHD Common Units and the Cash Consideration,
if any, are collectively referred to herein as the " _Consideration_."

2.11 _Sale of New AHD Common Units by ATN to Atlas_. Upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein, immediately after the New AHD
Common Units are issued to ATN, ATN shall sell, transfer, convey, assign and
deliver to Atlas, free and clear of all Liens,

 



-35-   and Atlas shall purchase and acquire from ATN, all of ATNs right, title and
interest in, to and under the New AHD Common Units (the " _AHD Unit Sale_ ").
The consideration to be paid by Atlas to ATN at the Closing in full
consideration of the New AHD Common Units shall be an amount in cash equal to
the number of New AHD Common Units _multiplied by_ $9.41.

 



     | 2.12 | _Determination of Cash Amount_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) At least four Business Days prior to the anticipated Closing Date, Atlas
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to AHD a good-faith
estimated statement of the Cash Amount (the " _Estimated Cash Amount
Statement_ "), including a calculation of a good-faith estimate of Cash Amount
(the " _Estimated Cash Amount_ "). The Estimated Cash Amount Statement shall
be prepared using the same accounting methods, policies, practices and
procedures as were used in calculating such amounts as set forth on the
Reference Cash Amount Statement to the extent consistent with GAAP, but
otherwise in accordance with GAAP. To the extent that AHD disagrees
with Atlass determination of the Estimated Cash Amount as set forth in the
Estimated Cash Amount Statement, AHD may deliver written notice of its
disagreement to Atlas at least two Business Day prior to the anticipated
Closing Date, and AHD and Atlas shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such
differences prior to the Closing; _provided_ , that no disagreement with
respect to the Estimated Cash Amount shall delay the Closing. Any such
estimate subject to such negotiation shall be revised by Atlas (i) with
respect to any resolved differences, to reflect any such resolution, and (ii)
with respect to any unresolved differences, to reflect Atlass applicable
estimates.

 

(b) If the Estimated Cash Amount is not zero, then Atlas shall pay to AHD at
the Closing an amount equal to the Estimated Cash Amount. 

(c) Within 90 calendar days following the Closing Date, AHD shall prepare, or
cause to be prepared, and deliver to Atlas a revised statement of the Cash
Amount (as such may be adjusted following resolution of disputes in accordance
with _Section 2.12(d)_, the " _Revised Cash Amount Statement_ "), including a
revised calculation of the Cash Amount (" _Revised Cash Amount_ "). The
Revised Cash Amount Statement shall be prepared using the same accounting
methods, policies, practices and procedures as were used in calculating such
amounts as set forth on the Reference Cash Amount Statement to the extent
consistent with GAAP, but otherwise in accordance with GAAP.

(d) After receipt of the Revised Cash Amount Statement, Atlas shall have 60
calendar days to review the Revised Cash Amount. During the review of the
Revised Cash Amount, and the period of any dispute within the contemplation of
this _Section 2.12_, each of Atlas and AHD shall, and shall cause the other
members of its applicable Group to: (i) provide the other Party and its
authorized representatives with reasonable access to all relevant books,
records, facilities and employees of its Group to the extent reasonably
necessary to complete their review of the Revised Cash Amount; and (ii)
reasonably cooperate with the other Party

 



-36-   and its authorized representatives, including by providing on a timely basis
all information reasonably requested by such other Party to the extent
reasonably necessary in reviewing the Revised Cash Amount. Unless Atlas
delivers written notice to AHD on or prior to the 60th calendar day after
Atlass receipt of the Revised Cash Amount Statement specifying in reasonable
detail the amount, nature and basis of all disputed items, Atlas shall be
deemed to have accepted and agreed to the calculation of Revised Cash Amount.
If Atlas so notifies AHD of its objection to the calculation of Revised Cash
Amount, AHD and Atlas shall, within 30 calendar days following such notice
(the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt to resolve their differences and any
resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be final, binding and
conclusive.

(e) If, at the conclusion of the Resolution Period, any amounts remain in
dispute with respect to Revised Cash Amount, then all amounts remaining in
dispute shall be submitted to KPMG LLP or, if KPMG LLP is unable or unwilling
to serve in such role, another nationally recognized independent accounting
firm mutually agreed upon by Atlas and AHD, the retention of which would not
give rise to present or potential future auditor independence issues
for Atlas or AHD or any of their respective Affiliates as determined by Atlas
and AHD in their reasonable discretion (the " _Neutral Auditors_ "). Each
party agrees to execute, if requested by the Neutral Auditors, a reasonable
engagement letter, including customary indemnities in favor of the Neutral
Auditors. All fees and expenses relating to the work, if any, to be performed
by the Neutral Auditors shall be borne pro rata as between Atlas, on the one
hand, and AHD, on the other, in proportion to the allocation of the dollar
value of the amounts remaining in dispute between Atlas and AHD made by the
Neutral Auditors such that the prevailing party pays the lesser proportion of
the fees and expenses. The Neutral Auditors shall act as an arbitrator to
determine, based solely on the provisions of this _Section 2.12_ and the
presentations by Atlas and AHD, and not by independent review, only those
issues still in dispute. Atlas and AHD agree that (i) they shall request the
Neutral Auditors to make their determination within 30 calendar days of their
selection, in a written statement delivered to Atlas and AHD and (ii) such
determination shall be final, binding and conclusive. The term " _Final Cash
Amount_ " shall mean the definitive Cash Amount agreed to (or deemed to be
agreed to) by AHD and Atlas in accordance with the terms of _Section 2.12(d)_
or the definitive Cash Amount resulting from the determinations made by the
Neutral Auditors in accordance with this _Section 2.12(e)_ (in addition to
those items theretofore agreed to by Atlas and AHD).



     | (f) | If: 
---|---|--- 

(i) the Final Cash Amount exceeds the Estimated Cash Amount, then Atlas shall
pay to AHD the amount of such excess; or

 

(ii) the Estimated Cash Amount exceeds the Final Cash Amount, then AHD shall
pay to Atlas the amount of such excess. 

(g) Any payment required to be made pursuant to _Section 2.12(f)_ shall be
made within five Business Days after the Final Cash Amount are agreed to by
AHD and Atlas or any remaining disputed items are ultimately determined by the
Neutral Auditors, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S.
Dollars to an account or accounts designated by the Party receiving such
payment.

 



-37-  2.13 _Purchase Price Allocation_. No later than sixty (60) days after the
Closing Date, AHD shall prepare and deliver to Atlas the proposed allocation
of the total consideration paid by AHD to Atlas pursuant to this Agreement
among the Purchased Assets, the Purchased Equity Interests and the AHD GP
Contribution (the " _Proposed Allocation_ ") for purposes of Section 1060 of
the Code. If within thirty (30) days after Atlass receipt of the Proposed
Allocation, Atlas consents in writing to the Proposed Allocation, then the
Proposed Allocation shall become the Final Allocation, as defined below. In
the event that Atlas does not consent in writing within such thirty (30) day
period, AHD and Atlas shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute.
If AHD and Atlas fail to agree on such allocation within thirty (30) days,
such allocation shall be determined, within a reasonable time, by an
independent, nationally recognized accounting firm mutually selected by the
parties (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). The allocation of the total
consideration, as agreed upon by AHD and Atlas (as a result of either Atlass
failure to object to the Proposed Allocation or good faith
negotiations between AHD and Atlas) or determined by the Accounting Firm
under this _Section 2.13_ (the " _Final Allocation_ "), shall be final and
binding upon the parties. Each of AHD and Atlas shall bear all fees and costs
incurred by it in connection with the determination of the allocation of the
total consideration, except that the parties shall each pay one-half (50%) of
the fees and expenses of such accounting firm. Each of AHD and Atlas agrees to
timely file, or cause to be timely filed, Internal Revenue Service Form 8594
(or any comparable form under state or local Tax Law) and any required
attachment thereto in accordance with the Final Allocation. Except as
otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" under Section 1313 of the
Code (or any comparable provision of state or local Law), neither AHD nor
Atlas shall take, or shall permit its Affiliates to take, a Tax position which
is inconsistent with the Final Allocation.

2.14 _MLP Status_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein,
AHD may, with the prior written consent of Atlas, purchase at Closing any
Purchased Assets or Purchased Entities through one or more wholly owned
entities treated as corporations for federal income tax purposes to the extent
determined necessary by AHD to satisfy the requirements of Section 7704(c) of
the Code.

THE AHD REORGANIZATION

3.1 _AHD LPA Amendment_. AHD GP, in its capacity as general partner of AHD,
has approved, and Atlas, in its capacity as holder of a majority of AHD Common
Units, has executed and delivered, concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, the Written Consent approving, the amendment and restatement of the
AHD LPA substantially in the form of _Exhibit A_ (the " _Second Amended and
Restated AHD LPA_ "), with the Second Amended and Restated AHD LPA to be
effective as of the Closing (the " _AHD LPA Amendment_ ").

 



-38-  3.2 _New AHD Equity Plan Adoption_. AHD GP, in its capacity as general
partner of AHD, has adopted on behalf of AHD, and Atlas, in its capacity as
holder of a majority of AHD Common Units, has executed and delivered,
concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Written Consent
approving the adoption by AHD of, a new equity plan substantially in the form
of _Exhibit B_ (the " _New AHD Equity Plan_ "), with the New AHD Equity Plan
to be effective as of Closing (the " _New AHD Equity Plan Adoption_ ").

3.3 _AHD GP Contribution_. At the Closing, concurrently with the consummation
of the Sale, Atlas shall effect the AHD GP Contribution, pursuant to which
Atlas shall contribute, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to AHD, and AHD
shall acquire from Atlas, all of the equity interests in AHD GP. Effective as
of the Closing, the limited liability company agreement of AHD GP shall be
amended and restated substantially in the form of _Exhibit C_.

3.4 _AHD Distribution_. Atlas shall effect the AHD Distribution prior to the
Merger. In the AHD Distribution, Atlas shall distribute, to stockholders of
record of Atlas (including record holders of restricted stock of Atlas) as of
the Record Time, all AHD Common Units held by Atlas and its Subsidiaries held
as of the Record Time, including any New AHD Common Units issued to Atlas and
its Subsidiaries at the Closing pursuant to _Sections 2.9_ and _2.10_. It is
understood that no stock options, deferred units, restricted stock units or
phantom stock or units, in each case, granted pursuant to equity plans of
Atlas and existing as of the Record Time, shall entitle the holder thereof to
receive any AHD Common Units in the AHD Distribution.



     | 3.5 | _Certain Shareholder Matters_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) On the Closing Date, Atlas will deliver to a distribution agent to be
appointed by Atlas, which may or may not be the AHD Transfer Agent (the " _AHD
Distribution Agent_ "), for the benefit of holders of record of Atlas Common
Stock as of the Record Time, all of the outstanding AHD Common Units
(including the New AHD Common Units) to be distributed in the AHD Distribution
(including, in the event that all or a portion of such AHD Common Units are
represented by certificates, such certificates, endorsed by Atlas in blank),
and Atlas will instruct the AHD Distribution Agent to deliver to the AHD
Transfer Agent true, correct and complete copies of the stock and
transfer records reflecting the holders of Atlas Common Stock entitled to
receive AHD Common Units in connection with the AHD Distribution. Atlas will
cause its transfer agent to instruct the AHD Distribution Agent to distribute
on the Closing Date or as soon as reasonably practicable thereafter the
appropriate number of AHD Common Units to each such holder or designated
transferee(s) of such holder and to credit the appropriate number of such AHD
Common Units to book entry accounts for each such holder or designated
transferee. For stockholders who hold Atlas Common Stock through a broker or

 



-39-   other nominee, such broker or nominee will be instructed to credit their AHD
Common Units to their respective accounts. Atlas will cooperate, and will
instruct the AHD Distribution Agent to cooperate, with AHD and the AHD
Transfer Agent, and AHD will cooperate, and will instruct the AHD Transfer
Agent to cooperate, with Atlas and the AHD Distribution Agent, in connection
with all aspects of the AHD Distribution and all other matters relating to
the issuance and delivery of certificates representing, or other evidence of
ownership of, the AHD Common Units to be distributed to the holders of Atlas
Common Stock in the AHD Distribution.

 

(b) Each holder of Atlas Common Stock as of the Record Time (or such holders
designated transferee(s)) will be entitled to receive in the AHD Distribution
a number of AHD Common Units equal to the number of shares of Atlas Common
Stock held by such holder as of the Record Time, multiplied by a fraction, (i)
the numerator of which is the number of AHD Common Units owned by Atlas as of
the Record Time (including the New AHD Common Units received by AHD in the
Sale), and (ii) the denominator of which is the number of shares of Atlas
Common Stock outstanding as of the Record Time (the " _AHD
Distribution Ratio_ ").

(c) From and after the AHD Distribution, until such AHD Common Units are duly
transferred in accordance with applicable Law, AHD will regard the Persons
entitled to receive such AHD Common Units as record holders of AHD Common
Units in accordance with the terms of the AHD Distribution without requiring
any action on the part of such Persons. AHD agrees that, subject to any
transfers of such AHD Common Units, (i) each such holder will be entitled to
receive all dividends or distributions payable on, and exercise voting rights
and all other rights and privileges with respect to, the AHD Common Units
then held by such holder, and (ii) each such holder will be entitled, without
any action on the part of such holder, to receive one or more certificates
representing, or other evidence of ownership of, the AHD Common Units
then held by such holder.

(d) No fractional AHD Common Units will be distributed in the AHD
Distribution. Instead, on the Closing Date, Atlas shall direct the AHD
Distribution Agent (i) to determine, based on the AHD Distribution Ratio, the
amount of the fractional AHD Common Units allocable to each holder of record
or beneficial owner of Atlas Common Stock and to aggregate all such
fractional shares into whole AHD Common Units; (ii) to sell the resulting
number of whole AHD Common Units in open market transactions or otherwise, at
the then prevailing trading prices and (iii) to cause to be distributed to
each such holder or for the benefit of each such beneficial owner to which a
fractional AHD Common Unit shall be allocable such holders or beneficial
owners ratable share of the proceeds of such sale, after making appropriate
deduction for any amount required to be withheld under the Code, or under any
provision of State, local or foreign Tax law. Atlas shall pay all expenses
reasonably incurred by the AHD Distribution Agent, including all brokerage
charges, commissions and transfer taxes, in connection with such sale. The
AHD Distribution Agent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
aggregate the AHD Common Units that may be held by any beneficial owner
thereof through more than one account in determining the fractional AHD
Common Unit allocable to such beneficial owner.

required (by oral question, interrogatories, requests for information or

Governmental Entity or pursuant to applicable Law to disclose or provide any
AHD Confidential Information or Atlas Confidential Information, as applicable,
the Person receiving such request or demand shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to provide the other Party with written notice of such request or
demand as promptly as practicable under the circumstances so that such other
Party shall have an opportunity to seek an appropriate protective order. The
Party receiving such request or demand agrees to take, and cause its
representatives to take, at the requesting Partys expense, all other
reasonable steps necessary to obtain confidential treatment by the recipient.
Subject to the foregoing, the Party that received such request or demand

Purchased Assets) is distinctly discernable in accordance with acceptable
industry practice in the relevant jurisdiction between Atlas or an Atlas
Subsidiary (other than a Purchased Entity) and the interests in such Oil and
Gas Leases that are Assets of Drilling Partnerships. From and after the
Closing, each of Atlas and AHD shall, upon reasonable request of the other,
use commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, curative
action (including the preparation and execution of correction assignments and
the filing and recording thereof) in order to help ensure that the title to
the Oil and Gas Leases of Atlas and the Atlas Subsidiaries (other than Oil
and Gas Leases that are Purchased Assets) is distinctly discernable in

between Atlas or an Atlas Subsidiary and AHD and the Purchased Entities.

     | 7.10 | _Insurance Matters_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) With respect to events or circumstances relating to the Purchased Assets,
assets and liabilities of the Purchased Entities, Assumed Liabilities, the
members of the AHD Group and the employees of the members of the AHD Group
that occurred or existed prior to the Closing that are covered by the AHD
Groups or the Atlas Groups occurrence-based liability insurance policies and
any workers compensation insurance policies and/or comparable workers
compensation self-insurance, State or country programs that are in effect
prior to the Closing (the " _Pre-Closing Insurance Policies_ "), AHD may make
claims under such policies and programs to the extent such policies and
programs are available, and Atlas shall take such actions as may reasonably
be requested by AHD in connection with the tendering of such claims to the
applicable insurers under such Pre-Closing Insurance Policies and to provide
AHD with the net proceeds (less any reasonable out-of-pocket costs of Atlas
from making the claim on behalf of AHD) it realizes with respect to such
claims; _provided_ , _however_ that (i) AHD shall be liable for all uninsured
or uncovered amounts for such claims and (ii) AHD shall notify Atlas of all
such coverage claims made. The rights of the members of the AHD Group pursuant
to this _Section 7.10_ shall include any and all rights of an insured party
with respect to such claims, including but not limited to the receipt of
insurance proceeds, rights of indemnity and the right to be defended by or at
the expense of the insurer. For the avoidance of doubt, Atlas shall retain all
rights to control its insurance policies and programs, including the right to
exhaust, settle, release, commute, buy-back or otherwise resolve disputes
with respect to any of its insurance policies and programs, notwithstanding
whether any such policies or programs apply to any Liabilities of AHD;
_provided_ that Atlas shall not take any action or omit to take any action
for the purpose of limiting AHDs ability to make claims and recover proceeds
pursuant to this _Section 7.10_ (it being understood that actions undertaken
by Atlas for other purposes may have such effect). Atlas agrees to cooperate
with AHD in the administration and handling of insurance claims under this
_Section 7.10_, and to keep AHD informed on a continuing basis of remaining
aggregate limits of coverage, deductible payments, retrospective premium
payments and other material matters relevant to continued dealings with
insurers providing coverage for Liabilities of the members of the AHD Group.
With respect to any open claims as of the Closing against the Pre-Closing
Insurance Policies relating to the Purchased Assets, assets and liabilities of
the Purchased Entities, Assumed Liabilities, the members of the AHD Group or
the employees of the members of the AHD Group, Atlas shall, upon the request
of AHD and at AHDs sole expense, use its commercially reasonable efforts to
pursue such claims and receive proceeds in respect thereof.

 



-60-  (b) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to relieve any insurer of any
Liability under any insurance policy. Nothing in this Agreement shall be
considered as an attempted assignment of any policy of insurance or as a
contract of insurance and shall not be construed to waive any right or remedy
of any member of the Atlas Group in respect of any member of the Atlas Groups
insurance policies and programs or any other contract or policy of insurance.

 

7.11 _Ancillary Agreements_. Effective at the Closing, AHD and Atlas, or such

acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the effective time of the Closing
now existing in favor of the current or former directors, officers or
employees of AHD GP, AHD or any Purchased Entity, as provided in the

respect to such rights to exculpation, indemnification and advancement of
expenses.

 

(b) Prior to the Effective Time, Atlas shall obtain and fully pay for "tail"
prepaid insurance policies with a claim period of six (6) years from and
after the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) from an
insurance carrier believed to be sound and reputable with respect to
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_"), for AHD GPs and AHDs current and former
directors and officers, but only for facts or events that occurred at or prior
to the Effective Time, which DandO Insurance (i) shall not have an annual
premium in excess of 250% of the last annual premium paid by Atlas (the "
_Maximum Premium_ ") prior to the date hereof for its existing DandO Insurance,
(ii) has terms, conditions, retentions and limits of

 



-63-   coverage at least as favorable as the existing DandO Insurance with respect to
matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective Time (including with

Atlas shall only be required to obtain as much similar insurance as is
reasonably practicable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Premium and
(iii) Atlas shall maintain such policies in full force and effect, for its
full six (6) year term, and to continue to honor its respective obligations
thereunder. If Atlas for any reason fails to obtain such "tail" prepaid
insurance as of the Effective Time, Atlas shall continue to maintain in
effect, for a period of six (6) years from and after the effective time of the
Merger for AHD GPs and AHDs current and former directors and officers, but
only for facts or events that occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, the
DandO Insurance, which DandO Insurance (i) shall not have an annual premium in
excess of the Maximum Premium, (ii) has terms, conditions, retentions and
limits of coverage at least as favorable as the Companys existing DandO
Insurance with respect to matters existing or occurring prior to the Effective
Time (including with respect to acts or omissions occurring in connection
with this Agreement and consummation of the transaction contemplated hereby);
_provided_ , _however_ , that if terms, conditions, retentions and limits of
coverage at least as favorable as Atlas existing DandO Insurance cannot be
obtained or can be obtained only by paying an annual premium in excess of the
Maximum Premium, Atlas shall only be required to obtain as much similar
insurance as is reasonably practicable for an annual premium equal to the
Maximum Premium and (iii) Atlas shall maintain such policies in full force and

affect any Person (including such Persons successors, heirs and legal
representatives) entitled to exculpation, indemnification, advancement of
expenses or insurance coverage as provided in this  _Section 7.14_ without
the consent of such affected Person (it being expressly agreed that the
Persons to whom this _Section 7.14_ applies shall be third-party
beneficiaries of this _Section 7.14_, and this  _Section 7.14_ shall be
enforceable by such Persons and their respective successors, heirs and legal
representatives and shall be binding on all successors and permitted assigns
of Atlas).

 

(d) In the case of any conflict between this _Section 7.14_ and _Section
7.10_, the provisions of this  _Section 7.14_ shall control. Atlas shall not
exercise any of the rights granted or reserved to it in _Section 7.10_ with
respect to DandO Insurance in a manner that would reasonably be expected to
impair the ability of AHD, AHD GP and the AHD Indemnitees to recover AHD
Losses from DandO Insurance.

7.15 _Certain Joint HBP Interests_. Following the Closing:

(a) AHD shall provide to Atlas, no later than 10 days following the end of
each month, a written report indicating each gas Well located on a Joint HBP
Interest with average natural gas production in the prior month of less than
30 mcf/month, listing the relevant Joint HBP Interest, the Well name, and the
average daily production for the prior month for each such Well.

 



-64-  (b) If AHD makes a determination to abandon or Permanently Shut In a Well on
a Joint HBP Interest (each such well, an " _Abandoned Well_ "), AHD shall
provide Atlas with written notice of such determination no less than 45 days
(to the extent reasonably possible) prior to such abandonment or such shut
in. Within 45 days of such notice, Atlas shall have the right, to the extent
permitted by the Joint HBP Interest, to take over such Abandoned Well and
receive an assignment of the associated leasehold interest (or partial
leasehold interest) by providing AHD with an irrevocable written notice of
such election (the date of such written notice being the " _Assignment
Effective Date_ "). Within 10 days from the Assignment Effective Date, AHD
shall deliver (and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts (without the
obligation to pay any consideration or fee) to cause any other owner of
leasehold interests to deliver) an assignment of all associated leasehold
interest, including a bill of sale for the Abandoned Well, which assignment
shall be made effective as of the Assignment Effective Date. Upon receipt of
the assignment from AHD and assignments, if any, from any other owners of
leasehold interests, Atlas will be deemed to have acquired the Abandoned
Well, AHDs associated leasehold interest and any such third party associated
leasehold interest as of the Assignment Effective Date together with all
rights, responsibilities, assets and liabilities of AHD and such other owners
of leasehold interests, if any, that deliver an assignment, in each case
associated with or arising from such Abandoned Well and the assignment of the
interests therein, including associated plugging, abandonment, restoration,
reclamation, environmental, lessee and other liabilities of any kind or
character, and Atlas shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the AHD
Indemnified Parties from the same. Within 90 days after execution of this
Agreement the parties will agree to a mutually satisfactory form of
assignment and bill of sale to be used as the form for all conveyances made
pursuant to this _Section 7.15(b)_.

7.16 _Drilling Arrangements_. Prior to Closing, AHD and Atlas shall establish
and implement with immediate effect at Closing mutually satisfactory
arrangements (the " _Drilling Arrangements_ ") to ensure AHD has the
capabilities of identified drilling rigs and related services necessary to
drill and/or complete the planned drilling program identified to Atlas by AHD
prior to the date hereof, which reflected the planned wells set forth on
Schedule 1.1 of the Petro-Technical Services Agreement. The Drilling
Arrangements will be negotiated in good faith by AHD and Atlas within a
reasonable period of time prior to the anticipated Closing Date and will
reflect industry standard terms providing for the assignment to AHD and,
following completion of applicable operations, the subsequent re-assignment to
Atlas of those contracts available to Atlas or the Atlas Subsidiaries that are
expected to be utilized in the planned drilling program. It is understood
that industry standard terms include the consent of the various contractors to

Actions or other matters that involve both the Atlas Group and the AHD Group.

(d) Subject to _Sections 8.8(e)_ and _(f)_ , no Party may waive any privilege

a privilege, or if either Party obtains knowledge that any of its, or any
member of its respective Groups, current or former directors, officers,
agents or employees have received any subpoena, discovery or other requests
that may reasonably be expected to result in the production or disclosure of
such privileged Information, such Party shall promptly notify the other Party
of the existence of the request (which notice shall be delivered to such other
Party no later than five Business Days following the receipt of any such
subpoena, discovery or other request) and shall provide the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to review the Information and to assert any rights it
or they may have under this  _Section 8.8_ or otherwise to prevent the

Information, witnesses and other Persons, the furnishing of notices and
documents and other cooperative efforts between the Parties contemplated by
this Agreement, and the transfer of privileged Information between the Parties
and members of their respective Groups pursuant to this Agreement, shall not
be deemed a waiver of any privilege that has been or may be asserted under
this Agreement or otherwise.

8.9 _Joint Defense Agreements_. In furtherance of the Parties agreements
under _Sections 8.7_ and _8.8_ , Atlas and AHD shall, and shall cause

-76-  12.2 _Indemnification by Atlas_. Subject to _Section 12.5_, from and after
the Closing Date, Atlas shall indemnify and hold harmless AHD and each other
member of the AHD Group, each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and
assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _AHD Indemnified Parties_
") from and against any and all Losses to the extent resulting from or arising
out of:

 

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty (other than the
Terminating Representations) of Atlas contained in this Agreement or in any
certificate delivered pursuant to this Agreement;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be
performed by Atlas; or

(c) other than any Liability indemnifiable by AHD under  _Section 9.1_ or
_12.3_ , any Retained Liability.

12.3 _Indemnification by AHD_. Subject to  _Section 12.5_, from and after
the Closing Date, AHD shall indemnify and hold harmless Atlas and each other
member of the Atlas Group, each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents, and each of the heirs, executors, successors and
assigns of any of the foregoing (collectively, the " _Atlas Indemnified
Parties_ " and together with AHD Indemnified Parties the " _Indemnified
Parties_ ") from and against any and all Losses resulting from or arising out
of:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty of AHD
contained in this Agreement or in any certificate delivered pursuant to this
Agreement;

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement to be
performed by AHD; or

(c) other than any Liability indemnifiable by Atlas under _Section 9.1_ or
_12.2_ , any Assumed Liabilities.

12.4 _Third-Party Claims_. If a claim by a third party is made against an
Indemnified Party, and if such Indemnified Party intends to seek indemnity
with respect thereto under this _Article XII_ , such Indemnified Party, shall
promptly notify AHD, if an Atlas Indemnified Party, or Atlas, if an AHD
Indemnified Party (AHD or Atlas, as the case may be, the " _Indemnifying
Party_ "), of such claims. The failure to provide such notice shall not result
in a waiver of any right to indemnification hereunder except to the extent
that the Indemnifying Party is actually materially prejudiced by such
failure. The Indemnifying Party shall have 30 days after receipt of such
notice to elect to undertake, conduct and control, through counsel of

 



-77-   its own choosing and at its own expense, the settlement or defense thereof (
_provided_ that the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation
to indemnify the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim), and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with it in connection therewith.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, an Indemnified Party shall have the right to
employ separate counsel at the Indemnifying Partys expense if the named
parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both
such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such Indemnified Party
shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest is likely to
exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies the
Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume the defense thereof and the reasonable expenses of such
counsel shall be at the expense of the Indemnifying Party). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall an Indemnifying Party be required to pay the
expenses of more than one (1) separate counsel. The Indemnified Party shall
not pay or settle any claim without the prior written consent of the
Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
Indemnified Party shall have the right to pay or settle any such claim;
_provided_ that, in such event, it shall waive any right to indemnity therefor
by the Indemnifying Party. The Indemnifying Party shall not, except with the
consent of the Indemnified Party, enter into any settlement that does not
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the person or persons
asserting such claim to all Indemnified Parties of unconditional release from
all liability with respect to such claim or consent to entry of any judgment
or that imposes injunctive or equitable relief.



     | 12.5 | _Limitations_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) No indemnity shall be payable to the AHD Indemnified Parties under
_Section 12.2(a)_ with respect to any claim resulting from any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, unless and until the aggregate
of all Losses due from Atlas exceeds $5,000,000, in which event all Losses so
due in excess of such amount shall be paid in full by Atlas; _provided_ that
the aggregate amount payable by Atlas under _Section 12.2(a)_, with respect
to claims resulting from any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty, shall not exceed $25,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, Atlas shall not be required to indemnify
any AHD Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss (or series of related
Losses) incurred by or asserted by reason of any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement if the Loss (or series of
related Losses) from such breach is less than $50,000, nor shall any
such Losses be included in the calculation of the amounts specified in this
_Section 12.5(a)_. The limitations set forth in this _Section 12.5(a)_ shall
not apply with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in 
_Sections 5.2(a)_ , _(b)_ and _(c)_ , _5.6_ and _5.10_.

(b) No indemnity shall be payable to the Atlas Indemnified Parties under
_Section 12.3(a)_ with respect to any claim resulting from any breach or
inaccuracy of any representation or warranty, unless and until the aggregate
of all Losses due from AHD exceeds $5,000,000, in which event all Losses so
due in excess of such amount shall be paid in full by AHD; _provided_ that the
aggregate amount payable by AHD under _Section 12.3(a)_, with respect to
claims resulting from any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or
warranty, shall

 



-78-   not exceed $25,000,000. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, AHD shall not be required to indemnify any Atlas
Indemnified Party with respect to any Loss (or series of related Losses)
incurred by or asserted by reason of any breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant contained in this Agreement if the Loss (or series of
related Losses) from such breach is less than $50,000, nor shall any
such Losses be included in the calculation of the amounts specified in this
_Section 12.5(b)_. The limitations set forth in this _Section 12.5(b)_ shall
not apply with respect to the representations and warranties set forth in 
_Sections 6.4_ and _6.6_.

12.6 _Mitigation; Additional Indemnification Provisions_. Each Indemnified
Party shall use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any claim or
liability that an Indemnified Party asserts under this _Article XII_. For
purposes of this Agreement, Losses shall be net of any Tax Benefit actually
realized (either by cash refund or actual reduction of Taxes otherwise
payable) net of any Tax Detriment actually realized (either by a reduction in
cash refund or increase in Taxes otherwise payable) by the Indemnified Party
or its Affiliates during or prior to the Tax period in which the
indemnification payment is made arising in connection with the accrual,
incurrence or payment of any such Losses. The Indemnified Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts (exercising its reasonable discretion in
relation to the availability of such Tax Benefit and ability not to suffer
such Tax Detriment) to claim such Tax Benefit and not suffer such Tax
Detriment. For purposes of this Agreement, Losses shall be calculated after
giving effect to any amounts recovered from third parties, including amounts
recovered under insurance policies with respect to such Losses, net of any
costs to recover such amounts. Any Indemnified Party having a claim under
these indemnification provisions shall make a good-faith effort to recover
all losses, costs, damages and expenses from insurers of such Indemnified
Party under applicable insurance policies so as to reduce the amount of any
Losses hereunder; _provided_ that actual recovery of any insurance shall not
be a condition to the Indemnifying Partys obligation to make indemnification
payments to the Indemnified Party in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement. If the Indemnifying Party receives any amounts under
applicable insurance policies, or from any other Person alleged to be
responsible for Loss, after an indemnification payment by the Indemnifying
Party has been made for such Loss, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly
reimburse the Indemnifying Party for such indemnification payment up to the
amount so received or realized by the Indemnified Party. No Indemnified Party
will, in any event, be entitled to any incidental, indirect, consequential,
special, exemplary or punitive damages, including damages for lost profits or
opportunity costs or damages based upon a multiple of earnings or other
financial measure (other than any such damages payable to third parties).

12.7 _Exclusive Remedies_. Except with respect to the matters covered by
_Article II_ and _Section 13.12_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that,
following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of _Sections 12.2_ and
_12.3_ shall be the sole and exclusive monetary remedies of the Parties (other
than in the case of fraud), respectively, for any Losses (including any Losses
from claims for breach of contract, warranty, tortious conduct (including
negligence) or otherwise and whether predicated on common law, statute, strict
liability, or otherwise) that each Party may at any time suffer or incur, or
become subject to, as a result of, or in connection with, any breach of

 



-79-   any representation or warranty in this Agreement by another Party or any
failure by such other Party to perform or comply with any covenant or
agreement that, by its terms, was to have been performed, or complied with,
by such other Party prior to the Closing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the Parties to this Agreement hereby irrevocably waive any
right of rescission they may otherwise have or to which they may become
entitled.

-80-   to a Section or Article of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise

way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement. Any capitalized terms
used in any Exhibit but not otherwise defined therein shall have the meaning
set forth in this Agreement. All Exhibits annexed hereto or referred to

limitation," unless otherwise specified. The words "hereby," "hereof,"

terms hereof. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement. In the event an ambiguity or question of intent
or interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted
jointly by the Parties and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise
favoring or disfavoring any Party by virtue of the authorship of any
provisions of this Agreement.

13.3 _Amendment_. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or
supplemented if such amendment or supplement is in writing and signed by the
Parties hereto. This Agreement may not be amended or supplemented in any
manner, whether by course of conduct or otherwise, except by an instrument in

each of the Parties in interest at the time of the amendment.

13.4 _Extension; Waiver_. The Parties may, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein of the other Party or Parties contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a Party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on
behalf of such Party. No failure or delay by any Party in exercising any right
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of any other right
hereunder. Except as otherwise provided herein, the rights and remedies of the
Parties hereunder are cumulative and are not exclusive of any rights or
remedies which they would otherwise have hereunder.

 



-81-  13.5  _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which
shall constitute one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become
effective when each Party hereto shall have received counterparts thereof
signed and delivered (by confirmed facsimile transmission or electronic mail
or otherwise) by the other Parties hereto.



      | 13.6 | _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and the Parties disclosure
schedules hereto) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between the Parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to or shall
confer upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns any right or remedy hereunder, other than with (i)
respect to the provisions of _Article XII_ , which shall inure to the
benefit of the Persons benefiting therefrom, who are hereby intended to be
third-party beneficiaries thereof and (ii) prior to the Merger, the provisions
of _Section 13.12_ applicable to Atlas and/or ATNs and/or ATNs right
to specific performance to require APL and APL Sub to comply with their
obligations under this Agreement shall be enforceable by Chevron and its
successors and assigns.

13.7 _Severability_. Whenever possible, each provision or portion of any
provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Law, but if any term or other provision
of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any
Law or public policy, all other terms and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal
or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the Parties as
closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order that the transactions
contemplated hereby are consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest
extent possible.

13.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties (whether by
operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written consent of the other
Parties, and any attempted assignment of this Agreement or any of such rights,
interests or obligations without such consent shall be void and of no effect.
Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon and
shall inure to the benefit of the Parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns.

13.9  _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to any
conflicts of Law rules (whether of the State of Delaware or of any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the Laws of any
jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware.

 



-82-  13.10 _Exclusive Jurisdiction for Disputes_. The Parties hereto agree that
any Action seeking to enforce any provision of, or based on any matter arising
out of or in connection with, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby (whether brought by any Party or any of its Affiliates or against any
Party or any of its Affiliates) shall only be brought in the Delaware Chancery
Court or, if such court shall not have jurisdiction, any federal court located
in the State of Delaware or other Delaware State court, and each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably consents to the jurisdiction of such courts (and of
the appropriate appellate courts therefrom) in any such Action and irrevocably
waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection that it may now
or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such Action in any such
court or that any such Action brought in any such court has been brought in an
inconvenient forum. Process in any such Action may be served on any
Party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of
any such court. Without limiting the foregoing, each Party agrees that service
of process on such Party as provided in _Section 13.1_ shall be deemed
effective service of process on such Party.

13.11 _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR RELATED TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

13.12 _Specific Performance_. The Parties hereto agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any provision of this Agreement was not
performed in accordance with its specific terms or was otherwise breached. It
is accordingly agreed that the Parties and, to the extent set forth in
_Section 13.6(b)_, Chevron, shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions
to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to specific performance of the
terms and provisions hereof in any court of competent jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at Law or in
equity.

 



     | 13.13 | _Expenses_. 
---|---|--- 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 13.13_, whether or not the
Transactions are consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection
with the Transactions, this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby
shall be paid by the Party incurring or required to incur such expenses.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 13.13_, after
the date hereof and prior to the Closing, upon request of AHD and AHD GP,
Atlas shall pay, or loan AHD or AHD GP sufficient funds to pay, costs, fees
and expenses incurred by AHD and AHD GP (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of its counsel, financial advisor and financing sources) in
connection with the investigation, negotiation and execution of this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby and to make any required payments 

 



-83-   under Section 7.7(b) of the AHD LPA; _provided_ that in no event shall
Atlas aggregate payment obligation under this sentence exceed $5 million (the
aggregate amount paid or loaned by Atlas pursuant to this sentence, the "
_AHD Expense Payments_ "). If the Closing shall occur, then the aggregate
amount of AHD Expense Payments shall be repaid by AHD to Atlas, either as a
cash payment at Closing or as an offset to the Estimated Cash Amount paid by
Atlas to AHD at the Closing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 13.13_, if this Agreement is terminated (other than pursuant to
_Section 11.1(d)(i))_, neither AHD nor AHD GP shall be obligated to repay
Atlas or any Atlas Subsidiary any AHD Expense Payments, and, if the aggregate
AHD Expense Payments is less than $5 million, Atlas shall pay, or reimburse
AHD and AHD GP for, all reasonable out-of-pocket fees and expenses that are
in excess of the AHD Expense Payments that are incurred by AHD and AHD GP
(including the reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel, financial advisor
and financing sources) in connection with the investigation, negotiation and
execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby;
_provided_ that in no event shall the sum of the aggregate AHD Expense
Payments and the aggregate payment obligation under this sentence exceed $5
million.

 

13.14 _Obligations of Atlas_. In the event Atlas or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not
be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or
merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties
and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper provision shall
be made so that the successors and assigns of Atlas assume the obligations set
forth in this Agreement.

 

13.15 _Alternative Structure_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, before the Closing, if requested by Atlas, the
Parties will cooperate in good faith to revise the structure of the
Transactions or the Purchased Entity Restructuring or otherwise revise the
method of effecting the Transactions or the Purchased Entity Restructuring; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that (1) such revision does not alter or change the
kind or amount of consideration to be delivered to Atlas, (2) such revised
structure or method does not materially delay consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement in relation to the structure
contemplated herein, (3) such revision does not, and is not reasonably likely
to, otherwise cause any of the conditions set forth in _Article X_ not to be
capable of being fulfilled (unless duly waived by the Party entitled to the
benefits thereof) and (4) such revision does not diminish or otherwise
adversely affect any rights or benefits accruing, or expected to accrue, to,
or expand or otherwise adversely affect any Liabilities, burdens or
obligations of, AHD or the AHD Group under this Agreement or any of the
Ancillary Agreements. The Parties agree to cooperate in good faith to
appropriately amend this Agreement and any related documents in order
to reflect any such revised structure or method.
