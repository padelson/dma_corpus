                                  CONSIDERATION

($65,000,000) less the Zions Mortgage Balance if the Zions Mortgage is assumed
by Purchasers (the "Cash Purchase Price") plus the Employee and Related

                  (b) if this Agreement is validly terminated by Sellers
pursuant to Section 4.4(e), the Deposit Amount, plus all accrued interest and

or Sellers pursuant to Section 4.4(a) or 4.4(c), or (iii) by Purchasers and

to Purchasers; provided, however, in the event that this Agreement is terminated
by Purchasers pursuant to Section 4.4(d), 4.4(f), 4.4(g), 4.4(i), or 4.4(j),
then (x) the Deposit Amount, together with all accrued interest and investment
income thereon shall be returned to Purchasers and (y) Sellers shall pay to
Purchasers the Expense Reimbursement; and provided further, in the event this

to pay to Purchasers any amounts in respect of the Deposit Amount prior to

other than with respect to the return of the Deposit Amount.

interest and investment income thereon, shall be released in accordance with
Section 3.2 and the terms of Escrow Agreement. The Indemnity Escrow

                                       18

Purchasers shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a statement setting forth the
allocation of the Purchase Price among Purchasers and the Purchased Assets. The
parties agree that, for the purpose of reporting Taxes, they (i) shall report
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in accordance with such
allocation statement, (ii) shall not take a position for the purpose of
reporting Taxes inconsistent therewith, and (iii) shall cooperate in the

Court approval pursuant to the Sale Order, each Seller has all requisite power,

thereunder and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.
The execution, delivery and performance by each Seller of this Agreement and
each other Seller Document have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on behalf of each such Seller. This Agreement has been, and each other
Seller Document will be at or prior to the Closing, duly and validly executed
and delivered by Sellers and (assuming the due authorization, execution and

and each other Seller Document when so executed and delivered will constitute,
legal, valid and binding obligations of Sellers, enforceable against Sellers in
accordance with their respective terms, subject to applicable bankruptcy,

execution and delivery by Sellers of this Agreement and the other Seller
Documents, the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby,
or compliance by Sellers with any of the provisions hereof or thereof will
conflict with, or result in any violation of or default (with or without notice
or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of termination,
cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or to loss of a material benefit
under, or give rise to any obligation of Sellers to make any payment under, or
to the increased, additional, accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements
of any Person under any provision of (i) the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of any Seller; (ii) any Contract or Permit to which any Seller is a party
or by which any of the properties or assets of any Seller are bound, except to
the extent any of the foregoing is not enforceable due to operation of

Governmental Body or arbitrator applicable to any Seller or any of the
properties or assets of any Seller; or (iv) other than, in the case of clauses

                                       24

<PAGE>

                  (b) The Purchased Assets constitute all the properties and
assets relating to, used or held for use in connection with the Business, other
than the Excluded Assets. There are no material assets or properties used
primarily in the operation of the Business and owned by a third party that will
not be leased or licensed to Purchasers under current leases or license
agreements.

         5.7      Real Property. Schedule 5.7 sets forth a complete list of (i)
all real property and interests in real property owned in fee by Sellers

and (ii) all real property and interests in real property leased by Sellers
(individually, a "Real Property Lease," collectively, the "Real Property
Leases," and together with the Owned Properties, the "Real Property") as lessee
or lessor. Sellers have good, marketable and valid fee title to all Owned
Property, free and clear of all Liens of any nature whatsoever except (A) the

enforceable leasehold interest under each of the Real Property Leases, subject
to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar
laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally and subject, as to
enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless of whether
enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). No Seller has
received or given any notice of any default or event that with notice or lapse
of time, or both, would constitute a default by any Seller under any of the Real
Property Leases, except for defaults which Sellers are obligated to cure as of
the Closing Date pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof which shall be so cured, or are
unenforceable due to the Bankruptcy Case or the Sale Order, or which are not
individually or in the aggregate, likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect.
Seller has no knowledge of any default by any other party to a Real Property
Lease. Sellers enjoy peaceful and undisturbed possession of the Real Property.
All water, storm sewer, sanitary sewer, gas, electricity, telephone and other
utility lines, pipes and other equipment necessary in order to operate the Real
Property in the manner that such Real Property is presently being operated

applicable Seller (or the applicable utility) is the beneficiary of a perpetual
and irrevocable easement to use such property to run the applicable Utility
Equipment and/or (c) other property owned by a Governmental Body on or under
which the applicable Seller (or the applicable utility) is legally permitted to
run the applicable Utility Equipment. There are no violations of any law,
regulations or orders (including parking ordinances, site plan approvals, zoning
and subdivision rules and regulations and land use development plans) issued by
any Governmental Body having jurisdiction against or affecting the Real Property
(or any portion thereof), the Business or any Seller which have not been cured,
except for such violations which would not, individually or in the aggregate,
result in a Material Adverse Effect. There are no applications currently pending
by Seller for any change in, or otherwise pertaining to, (x) the zoning
applicable to the Real Property or (y) the use of the Real Property. There are
no leases or other occupancy agreements in effect with respect to all or any
portion of the Owned Property. All material HVAC, electric, gas, fire-safety,
plumbing, mechanical and other systems at the Real Property are in good, working
condition which will allow the Business to be continued in the manner presently

                                       25

being operated. There are no pending condemnation or eminent domain proceedings
affecting the Real Property and no Seller has received any written notices of
any, and to the Knowledge of Sellers there are no, threatened condemnation or
eminent domain proceedings affecting the Real Property or any portion thereof.
The Real Property has not suffered any casualty or other material damage that
has not been repaired.

enforceable leasehold interest under each Personal Property Lease under which it
is a lessee, subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors' rights and remedies generally
and subject, as to enforceability, to general principles of equity (regardless
of whether enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity). No Seller
has received or given any notice of any default or event that with notice or
lapse of time or both would constitute a default by any Seller under any
Personal Property Lease, except for defaults which Sellers are obligated to cure
as of the Closing Date pursuant to Section 2.5 hereof which shall be so cured,
or are unenforceable due to the Bankruptcy Case or the Sale Order or which would
not, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Effect.

Purchasers that the Security Agreement, dated May 25, 2001, between Twin
Laboratories Inc. and Ross Blechman et al., is a material Lien). Sellers have

         5.11     Employee Benefits.

                  (a) Schedule 5.11(a) lists: (i) all material "employee benefit
plans," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and all other material employee
benefit arrangements or payroll practices, including bonus plans, employment,
consulting or other compensation agreements, incentive, equity or equity-based
compensation, deferred compensation arrangements, stock purchase, severance pay,
sick leave, vacation pay, salary continuation, disability, hospitalization,
medical insurance, life insurance, scholarship programs maintained by Sellers or
to which Sellers contributed or is obligated to contribute thereunder for
current or former employees of Sellers (the "Employee Benefit Plans") and (ii)
all "employee pension plans," as defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA ("Pension
Plan"), subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code, maintained by
any Seller and any trade or business (whether or not incorporated) which are or
have ever been under common control, or which are or have ever been treated as a
single employer, with Sellers under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code
("ERISA Affiliate") or to which Sellers and any ERISA Affiliate contributed or
has ever been obligated to contribute thereunder (the "Title IV Plans").
Schedule 5.11(a) separately sets forth each Title IV Plan which is a
multiemployer plan as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA ("Multiemployer Plans"),
or has been subject to Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA ("Multiple Employer
Plans").

                  (b) Except for non-compliance which would not, individually or
in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect, all Employee Benefit Plans are
in compliance with ERISA and the Code. Each Pension Plan which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination letter from the IRS and, to the Knowledge of Sellers, there are no
circumstances that could result in revocation of any such favorable
determination letter. There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of Sellers,
threatened litigation relating to the Employee Benefit Plans. No Seller has
engaged in a transaction with respect to any Employee Benefit Plan that could
subject Sellers, the Business, the Purchased Assets or any Employee Benefit Plan
to any Taxes or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502(i) of ERISA. No action has been taken with respect to any Employee Benefit
Plan to either terminate such Employee Benefit Plan or to cause distributions,
other than in the Ordinary Course of Business to participants under such
Employee Benefit Plan.

                  (c) No Employee Benefit Plan is subject to Section 302 or
Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code and no facts exist pursuant to
which any Liability or obligation under Title IV of ERISA could be incurred with
respect to the Business or the Purchased Assets.

                  (d) All contributions required to be made under the terms of
any Employee Benefit Plan have been timely made when due.

                  (e) No Seller has any obligations for post-employment health
or life benefits, except as set forth on Schedule 5.11(e). There are no
restrictions on the rights of Sellers to amend or terminate any such Employee
Benefit Plan without incurring any liability or obligation thereunder.

employment management, retention, severance, independent contractor, or other
similar agreement to which such employee or other personnel is a party, (ii)
whether such employee or other personnel is actively at work as of such date,
and (iii) if such employee or other personnel is not actively at work as of such

and his or her expected or required date of return to active service.

                  (b) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.12(b), no Seller is
party to, and none of the employees or other personnel employed in or rendering
services to the Business are covered by any union, collective bargaining or
other similar labor agreements and to the Knowledge of Sellers there is no
indication that such employees or personnel desire to be covered by a collective
bargaining agreement. As related to the Business, there is not presently pending
or existing, and to the Knowledge of Sellers there is not threatened, (i) any
strike, or slowdown, picketing, lockout, work stoppage or other material labor
dispute, or (ii) any application for certification of a collective bargaining
agent. As related to the Business, (A) no labor organization or group of
employees of Sellers has made a pending demand for recognition or certification,
and there are and have been no representation or certification proceedings or
petitions seeking a representation proceeding, with the United States National
Labor Relations Board or any other labor relations tribunal or authority, nor
have any such demands, proceedings or petitions been brought or filed or

claim, suit, proceeding, order, writ, injunction or decree against Sellers or
any of their Affiliates at law or in equity relating to the alleged violation of
any law with respect to the subjects listed in Section 5.12(b) above. Except as
set forth on Schedule 5.12(c), to the Knowledge of

                                       31

Sellers, there is no pending or threatened investigation of the Sellers by any
federal, state, local or foreign agency responsible for the enforcement of labor
or employment laws. As related to the Business, all material levies,
assessments, and penalties made against Sellers pursuant to all applicable
workers compensation legislation as of the Balance Sheet Date have been paid or
have been reserved for or accrued on the Balance Sheet by Sellers and Sellers
have not, as of the Closing Date, been reassessed under any such legislation.

                  (d) Except as set forth on Schedule 5.12(d), no employee has a
written employment contract which promises such employee continued employment
for any period of time.

         5.13     Litigation. Except as set forth in Schedule 5.13 and the
Bankruptcy Case, there are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the Knowledge of
Sellers, threatened against Sellers, or to which any Seller is otherwise a party
before any Governmental Body, which, if adversely determined, would reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect. Sellers are not subject to
any Order of any Governmental Body which would result in a Material Adverse
Effect.

                  (a) Each Seller and the Purchased Assets are in compliance
with and the Business has been operated in compliance with all Laws, regulations
and Orders relating to the Purchased Assets and the Business, including all
Environmental Laws, and all rules and regulations of any Governmental Body or
other Person which regulates any goods produced or services rendered by such
Seller, except for such noncompliance as could not reasonably be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect. Except as set forth on Schedule 5.14(a), no
Seller has received notice of any violation of any Law, regulation or Order, and
neither Seller nor any of the Purchased Assets are in default under any order,
writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree of any Governmental Body, applicable
to the Purchased Assets or the Business, except for defaults which, individually
or in the aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

                  (b) All material approvals, Permits, qualifications,
franchises, Orders and registrations, together with all modifications,
amendments, supplements and extensions thereof, of all Governmental Bodies and
any other governmental entities or other Person that are necessary for Sellers
to own the Purchased Assets, conduct the Business and use and occupy the Real
Property (collectively, the "Business Permits") are valid and in full force and
effect and are fully and freely transferable by Sellers to Purchasers. None of
the Business Permits will be terminated or become terminable as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby. A true, complete and correct list of all
Business Permits will be attached to this Agreement as Schedule 5.14(b) prior to
the Closing.

         5.15     Intentionally omitted.

or child or other family member of any of them, or any Person affiliated with
any of them (each of the foregoing, a "Related Person"), has any interest in any
of the Purchased Assets or any other assets or properties relating to the
Business. No Related Person has owned, directly or indirectly, and whether on an
individual, joint or other basis, any equity interest (other than ownership by a
Person of less than 1% of the outstanding capital stock of a company as long as

Liabilities. The reserves of six million five hundred thousand dollars
($6,500,000) as of the Balance Sheet Date established with respect to certain
product liability indemnity claims relating to the sale of products containing
ephedra represent management's best estimate of the Sellers' contingent
Liabilities with respect to such Liabilities.

operations and properties of each of their respective subsidiaries, relating to
the Business comply with all applicable Environmental Laws and Environmental

circumstances exist that could (A) form the basis of an Environmental Action
against Sellers, any of their respective subsidiaries or any of

                                       34

Hazardous Materials are being or have been treated, stored or disposed on any of
the Purchased Assets or other property relating to the Business currently owned
or operated by Sellers or any of their respective subsidiaries; and Hazardous
Materials have not been released, discharged or disposed of on, under or from

Assets, net of any Inventory and accounts receivable relating to Excluded
Products will be no less than forty seven million dollars ($47,000,000),
calculated in accordance with GAAP.

         5.27     Suppliers and Customers. To the Knowledge of Sellers and

or the compliance by Purchasers with any of the provisions hereof or thereof
will (i) conflict with, or result in a violation of, any provision of the
certificate of incorporation or by-laws of any Purchaser, (ii) conflict with,
violate, result in the breach of, or constitute a default under, or result in
the termination, cancellation or acceleration (whether after the filing of
notice or lapse of time or both) of any material right or obligation of any
Purchaser under, any Contract or Permit to which such Purchaser is a party or by
which such Purchaser or its properties or assets are bound or (iii) violate any
Order of any Governmental Body applicable to any Purchaser or any of the
properties or assets of such Purchaser or (iv) any applicable Law, except, in
the case of clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv), for such violations, breaches,
defaults, terminations, cancellations or accelerations as would not have a
material adverse effect on the ability of any Purchaser to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

                  (b)      No consent, waiver, approval, Order, Permit or
authorization of, or declaration or filing with, or notification to, any Person
or Governmental Body is required on the part of Purchasers in connection with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement or Purchaser Documents, the
compliance by Purchasers with any of the provisions hereof or thereof, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or the taking by Purchasers
of any other action contemplated hereby, or for Purchasers to conduct the
Business, except for compliance with the applicable requirements of the HSR Act.

         6.4      Litigation. There are no Legal Proceedings pending or, to the
knowledge of Purchasers, threatened against Purchasers, or to which any
Purchaser is otherwise a party before any Governmental Body, which, if adversely
determined, would reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on
the ability of Purchasers to perform their obligations under this Agreement or
to consummate the transactions hereby. Purchasers are not subject to any Order
of any Governmental Body which would reasonably be expected to have a material
adverse effect on the ability of Purchasers to perform their obligations under
this Agreement or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

         6.5      Financial Advisors. No Person has acted, directly or
indirectly, as a broker or finder for Purchasers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and no person is entitled to any fee
or commission or like payment in respect thereof.

         6.6      Financial Capability. At the Closing, Purchasers will have
sufficient internal funds (without giving effect to any unfunded financing
regardless of whether any such financing is committed) available to pay the
Purchase Price and any expenses incurred by Purchasers in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and will have the resources and
capabilities (financial or otherwise) to perform their obligations hereunder and
have not incurred any obligation, commitment,

                                       38

restriction or Liability of any kind, which would have a material adverse effect
on such resources and capabilities.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                            BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL

         7.1      Break-up Fee. In consideration for Purchasers having expended
considerable time and expense in connection with this Agreement and the
negotiation thereof and the identification and quantification of the assets of
the Sellers, in the event that any of the Sellers (i) consummates a transaction
in respect of a Bid, other than that of Purchasers, or (ii) sells, transfers,
leases or otherwise disposes directly or indirectly, including through an asset
sale, stock sale, merger, reorganization or other similar transaction, of all or
substantially all or a material portion of the Purchased Assets (or agrees to do
any of the foregoing) in a transaction or series of transactions within 12
months from the date hereof (either of clause (i) or (ii) being an "Alternative
Transaction"), Sellers shall pay in cash in immediately available funds to
Purchasers a break-up fee in an amount equal to three million four hundred
thirty five thousand dollars ($3,435,000) (the "Break-Up Fee") plus expense
reimbursement equal to the reasonable costs and reasonable out-of-pocket fees
and expenses of counsel, accountants, financial and other advisors incurred by
Purchasers in connection with their legal, financial and business due diligence
and the preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and any Ancillary
Agreements (the "Expense Reimbursement"); provided that in no event shall the
Break-Up Fee or Expense Reimbursement be payable to Purchasers if this Agreement
is terminated by Sellers pursuant to Section 4.4(e). Sellers' obligation to pay
the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement shall survive termination of this
Agreement, and on the Petition Date, Sellers shall make a motion seeking an
order that provides that the Break-Up Fee and Expense Reimbursement shall be
paid as administrative expense claims in the Bankruptcy Case under Sections
503(b) and 507(a)(1) of the Bankruptcy Code and that (i) the Break-Up Fee shall
be payable upon the earlier to occur of the closing of the Alternative
Transaction and consummation of a plan of reorganization or liquidating plan of
reorganization and (ii) the Expense Reimbursement shall be paid in accordance
with this Agreement as soon as possible upon termination of this Agreement.

         7.2      Bidding Procedures Order. Sellers acknowledge that this
Agreement is the culmination of an extensive process undertaken by Sellers to
identify and negotiate a transaction with a bidder who was prepared to pay the
highest and best purchase price for the Purchased Assets while assuming or
otherwise satisfying certain liabilities in order to maximize the value for
Sellers' constituents. Set forth below are the bidding procedures (the "Bidding
Procedures") to be employed with respect to this Agreement concerning the sale
of the Purchased Assets of Sellers to Purchasers. The sale is subject to
competitive bidding as set forth herein and approval by the Bankruptcy Court at
a hearing under Sections 363 and 365 of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Sale
Hearing"). The following overbid provisions and related bid protections are
designed to compensate Purchasers for their efforts and agreements to date and
to facilitate a full and fair process designed to maximize the value of the
Purchased Assets for the benefits of Sellers' stakeholders.

                  (a)      Bid Deadline. All bids must be submitted to and
actually received by Sellers, with a copy to Purchasers, not later than 11:00
a.m. on a date that is three days prior to the date scheduled by the Bankruptcy
Court for the Auction (the "Bid Deadline"). For purposes of this Agreement,
"Bid" shall mean a letter from a person who the Boards of Directors of Sellers
has determined in the exercise of its fiduciary duty is financially able to
consummate the purchase of the Purchased Assets (a "Qualified Bidder") stating
that (i) such Qualified Bidder offers to purchase the Purchased Assets upon the
terms and conditions set forth in a copy of this Agreement, together with all
Exhibits and Schedules hereto (the "Definitive Sale Documentation"), marked to
show those amendments and modifications to the Definitive Sale Documentation,
including, but not limited, to, price and the time of closing, that such
Qualified Bidder proposes; (ii) such Qualified Bidder is prepared to enter into
and consummate the transaction within not more than ten days after approval by
the Bankruptcy Court of the Sale Order; and (iii) such Qualified Bidder's offer
is irrevocable until the closing of a purchase of the Purchased Assets.

                  (b)      Qualified Bid. Only Qualified Bids will qualify for
consideration at the Auction (defined below). For purposes of this Agreement, a
"Qualified Bid" is a Bid that:

                           (i)      complies in all respects with 7.2(a);

                           (ii)     has a cash component of at least an amount
         equal to the sum of (a) the cash component of Purchasers' Bid
         (including the Deposit Amount and the Indemnity Escrow Amount) plus (b)
         the Break-Up Fee plus (c) the Expense Reimbursement (for purposes of
         this subsection only, the Expense Reimbursement shall be estimated at
         one million dollars ($1,000,000)) plus (d) such portion of the three
         million seven hundred thousand dollars ($3,700,000) of Liabilities
         constituting Employee and Related Liabilities to the extent the
         Qualified Bid does not propose to assume all or any portion of such
         Liabilities plus (e) in the case of the initial Qualified Bid, two
         million dollars ($2,000,000), and in the case of any subsequent
         Qualified Bids, one million dollars ($1,000,000) over the preceding
         Qualified Bid;

                           (iii)    is a proposal that Sellers determine, in the
         good faith opinion of the Boards of Directors of Sellers, and after
         taking into account the benefits of this Agreement to its
         constituencies (as well as the potential costs of pursuing other
         transactions) is not materially more burdensome or conditional than the
         terms of this Agreement and is in the best interest of the estate and
         its constituencies;

                           (iv)     is substantially on the same or better terms
         and conditions as set forth in a copy of the Definitive Sale
         Documentation;

                           (v)      is accompanied by satisfactory evidence of
         committed financing or other ability to perform and is not subject to
         any due diligence, financing or other contingencies;

                                       40
<PAGE>

                           (vi)     is accompanied by a cash deposit of two
         million dollars ($2,000,000) (the "Deposit"), which shall be refunded
         by the Sellers in the event that such Qualified Bid is not a Successful
         Bid and which shall be credited towards the Purchase Price in the event
         such Bid is the Successful Bid, provided that Purchasers shall pay the
         Deposit upon the entry of an order approving the Bidding Procedures in
         accordance with Section 3.2 above; and

                           (vii)    does not entitle or seek to entitle the
         Qualified Bidder to any expense reimbursement or termination or similar
         fee.

If Sellers do not receive any Qualified Bids, Sellers will report the same to
the Bankruptcy Court and will proceed with a sale and assignment of the
Purchased Assets to Purchasers. This Agreement executed by Purchasers shall
constitute a Qualified Bid for all Purposes.

                  (c)      Auction, Bidding Increments, and Bids Remaining Open.

                           (i)      If Sellers receive a Qualified Bid or
         Qualified Bids, Sellers will conduct an auction (the "Auction") in New
         York City at a location specified by Sellers on the date that is no
         later than the later of (i) October 23, 2003 or (ii) twenty (20) days
         after entry of the Bidding Procedures Order. Only Purchasers, Sellers,
         any representative of any official committee appointed in the
         Bankruptcy Case, and any Qualified Bidders who have timely submitted
         Qualified Bids shall be entitled to attend the Auction, and only
         Purchasers and Qualified Bidders will be entitled to make any
         subsequent Qualified Bids at the Auction. Bidding at the Auction will
         continue until such time as the highest and best offer is determined,
         provided that Qualified Bidders shall be required to bid in cash (i.e.
         no party shall be entitled to "credit bid" claims that they may have
         against the estate). Sellers may announce at the Auction additional
         procedural rules that are reasonable under the circumstances (e.g., the
         amount of time allotted to make subsequent overbids) for the Auction so
         long as such rules are not inconsistent with these Bidding Procedures.

                           (ii)     Sellers shall provide Purchasers with copies
         of all Qualified Bids. In addition, Sellers will inform Purchasers and
         each Qualified Bidder who has expressed its intent to participate in
         the Auction of the identity of all Qualified Bidders that may
         participate at the Auction.

                           (iii)    Prior to the conclusion of the Auction,
         Sellers shall in their business judgment determine the highest and best
         Qualified Bid (the "Successful Bid") and shall seek Bankruptcy Court
         authority to enter into the transaction evidenced by the Successful
         Bid.

         7.3      Bankruptcy Court Filings. On the Petition Date, Sellers shall
file with the Bankruptcy Court a motion seeking entry of the Sale Order and the
Bidding Procedures Order. Purchasers agree that they will promptly take such
actions as are reasonably

                                       41
<PAGE>

requested by Sellers to assist in obtaining the Sale Order and the Bidding
Procedures Order for the purposes, among others, of providing necessary
assurances of performance by Purchasers under this Agreement and demonstrating
that each Purchaser is a "good faith" purchaser under Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code. In the event the entry of the Sale Order or the Bidding
Procedures Order shall be appealed, Sellers and Purchasers shall use their
respective reasonable efforts to defend such appeal.

         7.4      Section 363(m) Protection. Sellers shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Bankruptcy Court to enter a Sale Order which
provides, in either the findings of fact or conclusions of law to be made by the
Bankruptcy Court as part of the Sale Order, that the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement are undertaken by Purchasers and Sellers at arm's length,
without collusion and in good faith within the meaning of Section 363(m) of the
Bankruptcy Code, and such parties are entitled to the protections of Section
363(m) of the Bankruptcy Code.

         7.5      No Shop. Prior to the entry of the Bidding Procedures Order on
the Bankruptcy Court's docket, and except as otherwise required by this
Agreement or by the Bankruptcy Code, Sellers shall not, directly or indirectly,
through any officer, director, employee, agent or adviser, solicit any
Alternative Transaction or participate in any negotiations with respect to any
Alternative Transaction, regardless of whether any proposal or offer for any
Alternative Transaction was unsolicited. Subsequent to the entry of the Bidding
Procedures Order on the Bankruptcy Court's docket, Sellers shall not, directly
or indirectly, through any officer, director, employee, agent or adviser,
solicit any Alternative Transaction or participate in any negotiations with
respect to any Alternative Transaction other than as expressly permitted under
the Bidding Procedures Order; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
prohibit Sellers from seeking to sell, pursuant to a Qualified Bid in connection
with the Auction established in the Bidding Procedures Order, the Purchased
Assets.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    COVENANTS

         8.1      Access to Information. Sellers agrees that, prior to the
Closing Date, Purchasers shall be entitled, through their respective officers,
employees and representatives (including its legal advisors and accountants), to
make such investigation (including review of documentation and inspections of
Real Property, but only if such inspection and testing does not interfere with
Seller's business and operations at such property and Purchasers provide Sellers
with proof of Purchasers' insurance covering such inspections and testing) of
the properties, businesses and operations of the Business and such examination
of the books, records and financial condition of the Business, the Purchased
Assets and the Assumed Liabilities as they reasonably request and to make
extracts and copies of such books and records. Any such investigation and
examination shall be conducted during regular business hours upon reasonable
advance notice and under reasonable circumstances and shall be subject to
restrictions under applicable Law. Sellers shall cause their officers,
employees, consultants, agents, accountants, attorneys

                                       42
<PAGE>

and other representatives to cooperate with Purchasers and Purchasers'
representatives in connection with such investigation and examination, and
Purchasers and their representatives shall cooperate with Sellers and their
representatives and shall use their reasonable efforts to minimize any
disruption to the Business. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
such investigation or examination shall be permitted to the extent that it would
require Sellers or any Affiliate to disclose information subject to
attorney-client privilege or conflict with any confidentiality obligations to
which Sellers or any Affiliates are bound, from which Sellers will use
commercially reasonable efforts to be released.

         8.2      Conduct of the Business Pending the Closing.

                  (a)      Prior to the Closing, except (1) as otherwise

(3) as may be required to comply with the debtor in possession budget agreed
upon in connection with the debtor in possession credit facility as such budget
may be amended from time to time with the consent of the Purchasers (provided,
however, that Purchasers shall not unreasonably withhold or delay their consent
to such amendment) (the "DIP Budget"), Sellers shall:

                           (i)      operate the Business in a manner consistent
         with the DIP Budget;

                           (ii)     maintain all of the Purchased Assets in good

         Course of Business; and

         the present business operations, organization and goodwill of the
         Business, and (B) preserve the present relationships with customers and
         suppliers of the Business.

                  (b)      Except (1) as may be required by the DIP Budget, (2)
as otherwise expressly contemplated by this Agreement or (3) with the prior
written consent of Purchaser (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld
or delayed), solely as it relates to the Business, Sellers shall not:

                           (i)      (A) materially increase the annual level of
         compensation of any employee, (B) increase the annual level of
         compensation payable or to become payable by any Seller to any of its
         respective executive officers, (C) grant any unusual or extraordinary

         Plan or (E) enter into or amend any employment, deferred compensation,
         severance, consulting, non-competition or similar agreement (or amend
         any such agreement) to which any Seller is a party or involving a
         director, officer or employee of any Seller in his or her capacity as a
         director, officer or employee of such Seller, except, in each case, in
         the Ordinary Course of Business, or as required by applicable Law from
         time to time in effect or by any of the Employee Benefit Plans or
         Pension Plans;

                           (ii)     make any material change to any of their

         in any Person;

                           (vi)     commence or continue any "going out of
         business" or inventory liquidation sales or offer any discounted sales
         of Inventory, other than quantity discounts heretofore offered by
         Sellers in the usual, regular and Ordinary Course of Business,
         consistent with past practice;

                           (vii)    enter into any contract, license or other
         agreement that contains any provision that, as a result of the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the
         Ancillary Agreements, would (assuming that the other party's consent or
         approval is not obtained, to the extent required) result in any
         penalty, additional payments or forfeiture that would be payable on or
         after the Closing Date;

<PAGE>

                           (xi)     sell, assign, transfer, license, abandon or

         Course of Business;

                           (xii)    except as would not adversely affect
         Purchasers, the Business and the Purchased Assets, settle any material
         claim regarding Taxes;

         representation, warranty, covenant, condition or agreement of Sellers
         in this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements to be or become untrue in
         any respect or intentionally omit to take any action necessary to
         prevent any such representation, warranty, covenant, condition or

         in all respects with all Laws applicable to the Business, the Purchased

         Section 8.2.

                  (c)      Sellers will promptly notify Purchasers in writing of
(i) any event known to Sellers which would render any representation or warranty
of Sellers contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, if made on or
as of the date of such event or the Closing Date, untrue or inaccurate, (ii) any
change, condition or event that has or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect or (iii) any failure of Sellers to comply with or
satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied
hereunder. Notwithstanding the disclosure to Purchasers of any matter pursuant
to this Section 8.2(c), Sellers shall not be relieved of any Liability for, nor
shall the provision of such information by Sellers to Purchasers be deemed a
waiver of, the breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, condition or
agreement of Sellers contained in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement.

         8.3      Regulatory Approvals.

                  (a)      If legally required, Purchasers and Sellers shall,
make or cause to be made all filings required of them or any of their respective
subsidiaries or Affiliates under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable.
Sellers and Purchasers may, as each deems advisable and necessary, reasonably
designate any competitively sensitive material provided to the other under this
Section 8.3 as "outside counsel only." Such materials and the information
contained therein shall be given only to the outside legal counsel of the
recipient and will not be disclosed by such outside counsel to employees,
officers, or directors of the recipient, unless express written permission is
obtained in advance from the source of the materials (Sellers or Purchasers, as
the case may be).

                  (b)      If a filing under the HSR Act is legally required,
each Purchaser and Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts to resolve
such objections, if any, as may be asserted by any Governmental Body with
respect to the transactions contemplated by

                                       45
<PAGE>

this Agreement under the HSR Act, the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act,
as amended, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, and any other
applicable Laws that are designed to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions
having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade
(collectively, the "Antitrust Laws").

         8.4      Further Assurances.

                  Each Seller and Purchaser shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to (i) take all actions necessary or appropriate to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) cause the

         8.5      Confidentiality.

                  (a)      Prior to the Closing, Purchasers shall keep
confidential, and cause their Representatives to keep confidential, any and all
Confidential Information relating to Sellers and Sellers' business and
operations. Following the Closing, Purchasers shall keep confidential, and cause
their respective Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents and
controlling Persons (collectively, their "Representatives") to keep
confidential, any and all Confidential Information relating to the Excluded
Products, Excluded Liabilities, Excluded Assets and the business and operations
of the Sellers, other than the Business. Sellers shall, at all times, keep
confidential, and cause their Representatives to keep confidential, any and all
Confidential Information regarding the Purchasers and the Purchasers' business
and operations. Following the Closing, Sellers shall keep confidential, and
cause their Affiliates to keep confidential, any and all Confidential
Information regarding the Business, the Purchased Assets and the Assumed
Liabilities. In the event this Agreement is terminated in accordance with
Article IV, Purchasers shall, at all times, keep confidential, and cause their
Representatives to keep confidential, any and all Confidential Information
regarding the Sellers. The provisions of this Section 8.5 supercede any
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement entered into between any Seller and
Purchasers, which agreement is hereby terminated in its entirety and of no
further force or effect.

                  (b)      As used herein, "Confidential Information" means any
and all confidential information of the other party or parties that one party
either receives from another party in connection herewith or in the course of
performing its obligations hereunder (except that such information may be
shared, on a confidential basis, with the party's attorneys, lenders and
auditors); provided, however, that Confidential Information does not include
information which (A) is or becomes public other than as a result of a breach of
the terms of this Section 8.5, (B) was available to the disclosing party on a
non-confidential basis prior to its disclosure by such party or (C) becomes
available to a disclosing party on a non-confidential basis from a Person (i)
who is not a party to this agreement, (ii) who is not otherwise known to the
disclosing party to be in violation of a confidentiality agreement with the
party whose information is the subject of such

                                       46
<PAGE>

disclosure, or (iii) not otherwise known to be prohibited from transmitting the
information to the disclosing party.

                  (c)      Notwithstanding anything else in this Section 8.5, a
party hereto may disclose Confidential Information of another party hereto as
required by Law or Order to the extent so required (in which case the legally
obligated party shall promptly notify the other parties and give the other
parties an opportunity to oppose such disclosure prior to the making of such
disclosure).

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth
herein or in any other agreement to which the parties hereto are parties or by
which they are bound, the obligations of confidentiality contained herein and
therein, as they relate to the transactions described in this Agreement, shall
not apply to the Tax structure or Tax treatment of the transactions described in
this Agreement, and each party hereto (and any employee, representative, or
agent of any party hereto) may disclose to any and all persons, without
limitation of any kind, the Tax structure and Tax treatment of the transactions
described in this Agreement and all materials of any kind (including opinions or
other Tax analysis) that are provided to such party relating to such Tax
treatment and Tax structure; provided, however, that such disclosure shall not
include the name (or other identifying information not relevant to the Tax
structure or Tax treatment) of any person and shall not include information for
which nondisclosure is reasonably necessary in order to comply with applicable
securities laws.

         8.6      Preservation of Records. Sellers and Purchasers agree that
each of them shall preserve and keep the records held by it or their respective
Affiliates relating to the Business for a period of seven (7) years from the
Closing Date and shall make such records and personnel available to the other as
may be reasonably required by such party in connection with, among other things,
administration of the Bankruptcy Case, preparation of the plan and disclosure
statement for filing in the Bankruptcy Case and confirmation of the plan in the
Bankruptcy Case, any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or Tax audits
against or governmental investigations of Sellers or Purchasers or any of their
Affiliates or in order to enable Sellers or Purchasers to comply with their
respective obligations under this Agreement, each Ancillary Agreement and each
other agreement, document or instrument contemplated hereby or thereby;
provided, however, that no providing party shall be required to (i) incur any
out-of-pocket expenses, (ii) provide information or records under circumstances
which the providing party believes in its sole reasonable determination may
expose it to Liability to any Person or may prejudice any interest, commercial,
legal or otherwise, of the providing party or (iii) take any action that in the
providing party's sole reasonable determination unreasonably interferes with its
business. Without limiting the foregoing, Purchasers agree to make available to
Sellers on a reasonable and as-needed basis Transferred Employees, including
former members of management of Sellers, to assist Sellers undertaking of the
foregoing, subject to reasonable compensation to be agreed upon between
Purchasers and Sellers. In the event Sellers, on the one hand, or Purchasers, on
the other hand, wish to destroy such records after that time, such party shall
first give ninety (90) days prior written notice to the other and such other
party shall have the right at its option and

                                       47
<PAGE>

expense, upon prior written notice given to such party within that ninety (90)
day period, to take possession of the records within one hundred and eighty
(180) days after the date of such notice.

         8.7      Publicity. Neither Sellers, on the one hand, nor Purchasers,
on the other hand, shall issue any press release or public announcement
concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
obtaining the prior written approval of the other party hereto, which approval
will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless, in the sole judgment of
such Purchasers or Sellers, disclosure is otherwise required by applicable Law
or with respect to filings to be made with the Bankruptcy Court in connection
with this Agreement or by the applicable rules of any stock exchange on which
Purchasers, or Sellers lists securities, provided that the party intending to
make such release shall consult with the other party with respect to the text
thereof and give the other party reasonable opportunity to review such text.

         8.8      Use of Name. Following the Closing Date, except as otherwise
required by the Bankruptcy Court or the Bankruptcy Code and the regulations
promulgated thereunder, Sellers shall not use any corporate, trade, or service
name that includes Purchased Intellectual Property or, in each case, any
confusingly similar words.

         8.9      Receipt of Property Relating to Purchased Assets. If Sellers
or any of their respective Affiliates, or any other Person acting for or in
concert with any of the foregoing Persons, shall receive any money, check, note,
draft, instrument, payment or other property relating to or as proceeds of the
Purchased Assets or the Assumed Liabilities or any part thereof, each such
Person shall receive all such items in trust for, and as the sole and exclusive
property of, Purchasers and, immediately upon receipt thereof, shall notify
Purchasers in writing of such receipt and shall remit the same (or cause the
same to be remitted) in kind to Purchasers in the manner specified by
Purchasers.

         8.10     Consents. Sellers shall use their best efforts to obtain (a)
entry of the Bidding Procedures Order and the Sale Order by the Bankruptcy
Court, and (b) the consents or approvals of each other Governmental Body and
each other Person necessary for the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

         8.11     Transfer of Permits. Except for those Permits that are not
transferable by law or are immaterial to the Business, Sellers shall cause the
issuance or transfer of all Permits relating to the Business to Purchasers on or
before the Closing Date in form and substance the same as the Permits that were
held by Sellers. Sellers shall give and make all required notices and reports to
each appropriate Governmental Body and other Persons with respect to the Permits
that may be necessary for the sale and purchase of the Business and the
ownership, operation and use of the Purchased Assets by Purchasers following the
Closing.

<PAGE>

         8.12     Assignment of Contracts. The Sale Order shall provide that
effective on the Closing Date the Sellers shall assume, cure all monetary
defaults with respect to and assign the Purchased Contracts to, Purchasers,
subject to the Purchasers showing adequate assurance of future performance.

         8.13     Plan of Reorganization. The Sellers and each of their
Affiliates shall use their best efforts to ensure that any plan of
reorganization or liquidation proposed by the Sellers or any of their affiliates
in their Bankruptcy Cases shall (i) provide for a release of the Purchasers from
any product liability or similar claims pursuant to Section 1141(c) of the
Bankruptcy Code, (ii) enjoin any suits brought against the Purchasers in
connection with such claims and (iii) provide that existing insurance policies
will continue to be used to pay any product liability claims.

         8.14     Adjustments to Schedules. Purchasers and Sellers agree to work
together in good faith to make adjustments to the Schedules from the date hereof
until the day prior to the hearing on the Bidding Procedures Order, provided
that such changes are not material individually or in the aggregate. Any such
changes so agreed upon shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of the
execution of this Agreement.

                         EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

         9.1      Employment.

                  (a)      Transferred Employees. Purchasers shall offer
employment to all individuals employed by Sellers in connection with the
Business as of the Closing Date to commence immediately following the Closing,
each such offer contingent upon the issuance of the Sale Order of the Bankruptcy
Court and the Closing. Each such offer shall be made in accordance with
applicable Law and shall be on such terms that, when taken as a whole for each
employee, are substantially similar to those currently offered by Sellers.
Subject to the terms of any employment agreement entered into by the Purchasers
with any of the Key Employees, Purchasers' employment of the Continuing
Employees shall be on an "at-will" basis and on such other terms and conditions
of employment as Purchasers shall offer in their sole discretion. Except as
otherwise agreed to in writing, Purchasers shall be under no obligation to
employ or continue to employ any individual for any period. The Employees who
accept Purchasers' offer of employment and who commence employment with
Purchasers shall be referred to herein as the "Transferred Employees."

                  (b)      Standard Procedure. Pursuant to the "Standard
Procedure" provided in Section 5 of Revenue Procedure 96-60, 1996-2 C.B. 399,
(i) Purchasers and Sellers shall report on a predecessor/successor basis as set
forth therein, (ii) Sellers will not be relieved from filing a Form W-2 with
respect to any Transferred Employees, and (iii) Purchasers will undertake to
file (or cause to be filed) a Form W-2 for each such Transferred Employee with
respect to the portion of the year during which such

                                       49
<PAGE>

Employees are employed by Purchasers that includes the Closing Date, excluding
the portion of such year that such Employee was employed by Sellers.

                  (c)      With respect to each Transferred Employee, Sellers
hereby waive and release each such individual from any and all contractual,
common law or other restrictions enforceable by Sellers on the employment,
activities or other conduct of such individuals after their termination of
employment with Sellers; provided, however, that Sellers shall assign to the
Purchasers their rights to all obligations not to disclose confidential
information relating to the Business and all obligations not to compete with the
Business owed to Sellers by such Transferred Employee.

                  (d)      Except as expressly provided herein, nothing herein
shall be construed as transferring to Purchasers (i) any Contract or agreement
with any current or former employee of Sellers or for the employment of any
Person or engagement of any independent contractor by Sellers or (ii) any rights
or obligations Sellers may owe to or be owed by any current or former employee,
officer, director, consultant, independent contractor, or agent of Sellers.

                  (e)      Nothing herein, express or implied, shall confer upon
any employee or former employee of Sellers any rights or remedies (including any
right to employment or continued employment for any specified period) of any
nature or kind whatsoever, under or by reason of this Agreement. Purchasers and
Sellers agree that the provisions contained herein are not intended to be for
the benefit of or otherwise be enforceable by, any third party, including any
employee or former employee of Sellers.

                  (f)      Purchasers shall have no obligation to pay severance
to any employee who does not accept an offer of employment to join Purchasers
and any such obligations remain obligations of the Sellers.

         9.2      Employee Benefits

                  (a)      Effective as of the Closing Date, Purchasers shall
assume sponsorship of the Employee Benefit Plans agreed upon between the
Purchaser and the Sellers set forth on Schedule 9.2(a) and Sellers shall assign
any trusts or funding vehicles associated with such plans to Purchasers.

                  (b)      If Purchasers adopt any new employee benefit plans on
behalf of any Transferred Employees following the Closing ("Purchaser Plans"),
for purposes of eligibility and vesting (but not benefit accrual) under such
Purchaser Plans, Purchasers shall credit each Transferred Employee with his or
her years of service with Sellers and any predecessor entities thereof as if
such service was performed for the Purchasers. The Purchaser Plans shall not
deny Transferred Employees coverage on the basis of pre-existing conditions
(except to the extent that a Transferred Employee was denied coverage under an
Employee Benefit Plan for a pre-existing condition) and any expenses incurred by
or on behalf of such Transferred Employee, on or before the Closing Date, shall
be taken into account under the Purchaser Plans for purposes of satisfying

                                       50
<PAGE>

applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions under
the applicable Purchaser Plans.

                  (c)      Except as set forth in the next sentence, nothing
contained in this Section 9.2 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall be construed
to limit Purchasers' ability to terminate the employment of any individual
Transferred Employee or amend, modify or terminate any employee benefits
available to any individual Transferred Employee, it being understood and agreed
that if Purchasers shall terminate the employment of any Transferred Employee
within 18 months after the Closing other than for cause, then Purchasers shall
provide to each such Transferred Employee (i) outplacement services valued at
not less than five thousand dollars ($5,000) and (ii) all severance benefits no
less favorable than those to which such Transferred Employee would be entitled
if he or she was terminated at that time by Sellers in accordance with Sellers'
severance practice in effect as of the date hereof, a copy of which is attached
as Schedule 9.2(c). Purchasers agree not to terminate fifty (50) or more
Transferred Employees in either New York and/or Utah within the sixty (60) day
period following the Closing.

                  (d)      Continuation and Portability of Employee Benefits.
Purchasers shall be responsible for administering compliance with the
continuation coverage requirements for "group health plans" under Title X of the
Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985, as amended ("COBRA"),
and the portability requirements under the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act of 1996 ("HIPAA") with respect to Transferred Employees whose
coverage under the Employee Benefit Plans terminates on or after the Closing
Date and any other employee or former employee of the Sellers (and their
eligible dependents) who had a "qualifying event" (within the meaning of Section
4980B(f)(d) of the Code on or prior to the Closing (the "COBRA Beneficiaries").
Purchasers shall be responsible for administering compliance under COBRA and
HIPAA for the COBRA Beneficiaries and those Transferred Employees whose coverage
terminates subsequent to their becoming participants in the Purchaser Plans.

                  (e)      Key Employees. Sellers shall afford to Purchasers and
their representatives reasonable access to those employees whom Purchasers and
Sellers agree are key employees (the "Key Employees") in order to permit
Purchasers to solicit for employment the Key Employees and to negotiate
employment agreements reflecting retention, confidentiality, non-competition and
other terms and conditions of employment with the Key Employees.

extent of its knowledge thereof, cause prompt written notice of the commencement
of such proceedings or the assertion of such claim or demand to be given to the
indemnifying party, and shall afford to such indemnifying party the right, to
the extent of its indemnification, at its option and at its own expense, to be
represented by counsel of its choice and to defend against, negotiate, settle,
or otherwise deal with any such legal proceeding, claim or demand; provided,
however, that the failure by any party seeking indemnification hereunder to give
prompt notice shall not release the indemnifying party of its indemnification
obligations hereunder, except to the extent such failure actually prejudices
such indemnifying party; provided further, however, that no indemnifying party
shall agree to any settlement of any claim against any Person seeking
indemnification without the consent of such Person (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld) unless such settlement requires no payment on the part of
such Person and contains a full release of such Person, with no admission of any
wrongdoing on the part of such Person; and provided further, however, that if
the liability or obligation which is the subject matter of such claim shall
arise out of a transaction or cover any period or periods wherein Sellers and
Purchasers shall be responsible for part of any such liability

                                       55
<PAGE>

or obligation, then Sellers and Purchasers jointly shall defend, contest,
litigate, settle and otherwise deal with any such claims, each bearing its own
expenses and each choosing its own counsel. After any final judgment or award
shall have been rendered by a court, arbitration board, or administrative agency
of competent jurisdiction, or a settlement shall have been consummated, or the
parties shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement, with respect to any
matter which is the subject matter of an indemnity hereunder, the indemnified
party shall forward to the indemnifying party notice of any sums due and owing
by the indemnifying party with respect to such matter and the indemnifying party
shall be required to pay all of the sums so owing to the indemnified party, by
certified or bank cashier's check, within ten (10) Business Days after the date
of such notice. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each other in
connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such legal
proceeding, claim or demand, and none of Purchasers or Sellers will compromise
or settle any such legal proceeding, claim or demand without the prior written
consent of the other, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                  (d)      Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the indemnification provisions with respect to the representation on
Current Assets set forth in Section 5.26 shall be subject to the additional
provisions set forth on Schedule 11.2(d).

         11.3     Indemnity Escrow. Pursuant to the terms of Section 3.3 hereof,
on the Closing Date, Purchasers shall deposit in an account (the "Indemnity
Account"), in immediately available funds, a portion of the Purchase Price in an
amount equal to three million dollars ($3,000,000) (the "Indemnity Escrow
Amount"). Any payment that Sellers are obligated to make to any Purchaser
Indemnified Parties pursuant to this Article XI, including under Section
11.2(d), shall be paid solely from the Indemnity Escrow Amount and following the
Closing Sellers shall have no liability to Purchasers for breaches of, defaults
under, or non-performance of this Agreement above amounts held in such Indemnity
Escrow Account, except for fraud or willful breach of this Agreement. The Escrow
Agreement shall provide that on the first anniversary of the Closing Date, so
long as no claims for indemnification are outstanding, Sellers shall withdraw
from the Indemnity Account the Indemnity Escrow Amount (to the extent not
utilized to pay Purchasers for any indemnification claim).

                                   ARTICLE XII

                                   TAX MATTERS

         12.1     Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Purchaser shall share equally any
sales, use, stamp, documentary stamp, filing, recording, transfer or similar
fees or taxes or governmental charges (including any interest and penalty
thereon) payable in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement ("Transfer Taxes"). Seller shall seek to include in the Sales Order a
provision that provides that the transfer of the Purchased Assets shall be free
and clear of any stamp or similar taxes under Bankruptcy Code Section 1146(c).
Sellers and Purchasers shall cooperate and consult with each other prior to
filing any Tax Returns in respect of Transfer Taxes. Sellers and Purchasers
shall

                                       56
<PAGE>

cooperate and otherwise take commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any
available refunds for Transfer Taxes.

         12.2     Cooperation. Purchasers and Sellers agree to furnish or cause
to be furnished to each other, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating to the Purchased Assets as is reasonably necessary for the
preparation and filing of any Tax Return, for the preparation for and proof of
facts during any tax audit, for the preparation for any tax protest, for the
prosecution or defense of any suit or other proceeding relating to tax matters
and for the answer of any governmental or regulatory inquiry relating to tax
matters. From and after the Closing Date, Purchasers agree that they will
provide reasonable access to Sellers and their attorneys, accountants and other
representatives (after reasonable notice and during normal business hours and
without charge) to such files, books and records as Sellers may reasonably deem
necessary to prepare for, file, prove, answer, prosecute or defend any claim,
suit, inquiry or other proceeding, related to Taxes in connection with the
Purchased Assets or the Business.

         12.3     Prorations. All real and personal property Taxes or similar ad
valorem obligations levied with respect to the Purchased Assets for any taxable
period that includes the Closing Date and ends after the Closing Date, whether
imposed or assessed before or after the Closing Date, shall be prorated between
Sellers and Purchasers as of 12:01 a.m. (Eastern time) on the Closing Date. If
any Taxes subject to proration are paid by Purchasers, on the one hand, or
Sellers, on the other hand, the proportionate amount of such Taxes paid (or in
the event a refund of any portion of such Taxes previously paid is received,
such refund) shall be paid promptly by (or to) the other after the payment of
such Taxes (or promptly following the receipt of any such refund).

         12.4     Real Estate Tax Protests. Prior to the Closing, all real
estate assessment protests and proceedings, if any, affecting the Real Property
or any portion thereof for the tax year in which the Closing occurs (the
"Closing Date Tax Year") and prior years will be prosecuted under Sellers'
direction and control, provided that Sellers shall not settle, without
Purchasers' prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
any such protest or proceeding affecting the Closing Date Tax Year or any
subsequent Tax Year. From and after the Closing, all real estate assessment
protests and proceedings for the Closing Date Tax Year and all tax years
thereafter occurring shall be prosecuted under the Purchasers' direction and
control and Sellers shall do everything reasonably necessary to transfer over to
the Purchasers the right to prosecute and settle such protests and proceedings
for the Closing Date Tax Year. In the event of any reduction in the assessed
valuation of the Real Property for the Closing Date Tax Year or any prior tax
year, the amount of any tax savings shall (a) with respect to tax years ending
prior to the Closing, be payable to Sellers; and (b) with respect to the Closing
Date Tax Year, after deduction of customary expenses and attorneys fees incurred
in connection with obtaining same, be adjusted between Sellers and Purchaser as
of the Closing.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         13.1     Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
Sellers and Purchasers shall bear their own expenses incurred in connection with
the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other agreement,
document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Purchasers and Sellers shall
bear their respective filing fees associated with HSR Act filings, if any.

         13.2     Injunctive Relief. Damages at law may be an inadequate remedy
for the breach of any of the covenants, promises and agreements contained in
this Agreement, and, accordingly, any party hereto shall be entitled to
injunctive relief with respect to any such breach, including specific
performance of such covenants, promises or agreements or an order enjoining a
party from any threatened, or from the continuation of any actual, breach of the
covenants, promises or agreements contained in this Agreement. The rights set
forth in this Section 13.2 shall be in addition to any other rights which a
party may have at law or in equity pursuant to this Agreement.

         13.3     Submission to Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

                  (a)      Without limiting any party's right to appeal any
order of the Bankruptcy Court, (i) the Bankruptcy Court shall retain exclusive
jurisdiction to enforce the terms of this Agreement and to decide any claims or
disputes which may arise or result from, or be connected with, this Agreement,
any breach or default hereunder, or the transactions contemplated hereby, and
(ii) any and all proceedings related to the foregoing shall be filed and
maintained only in the Bankruptcy Court, and the parties hereby consent to and
submit to the jurisdiction and venue of the Bankruptcy Court and shall receive
notices at such locations as indicated in Section 13.7 hereof; provided,
however, that if the Bankruptcy Case has closed, the parties agree to
unconditionally and irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York sitting in
New York County or the Commercial Division, Civil Branch of the Supreme Court of
the State of New York sitting in New York County and any appellate court from
any thereof, for the resolution of any such claim or dispute. The parties hereby
irrevocably waive, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any
objection which they may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
such dispute brought in such court or any defense of inconvenient forum for the
maintenance of such dispute. Each of the parties hereto agrees that a judgment
in any such dispute may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the
judgment or in any other manner provided by Law.

                  (b)      Each of the parties hereto hereby consents to process
being served by any party to this Agreement in any suit, action or proceeding by
delivery of a copy thereof in accordance with the provisions of Section 13.7.

<PAGE>

         13.4     Waiver of Right to Trial by Jury. Each party to this Agreement
waives any right to trial by jury in any action, matter or proceeding regarding
this Agreement or any provision hereof.

         13.5     Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement
(including the schedules and exhibits hereto), together with the Ancillary
Documents, represents the entire understanding and agreement between the parties
hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement can be amended,
supplemented or changed, and any provision hereof can be waived, only by written
instrument making specific reference to this Agreement signed by the party
against whom enforcement of any such amendment, supplement, modification or
waiver is sought. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any
investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a
waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein. The waiver by any party hereto
of a breach of any provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed
as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay
in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy
by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of
any other right, power or remedy. All remedies hereunder are cumulative and are
not exclusive of any other remedies provided by law.

         13.6     Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to
contracts made and performed in such State.

Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) when delivered

following the day sent by overnight courier (with written confirmation of
receipt), in each case at the following addresses and facsimile numbers (or to

         13.8     Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any law or public policy,
all other terms or provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in
full force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially
adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision
is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner in order
that the transactions contemplated hereby are consummated as originally
contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

         13.9     Binding Effect; Assignment. This Agreement shall be binding
upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Nothing in this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create
any third party beneficiary rights in any person or entity not a party to this
Agreement except as provided below. No assignment of this Agreement or of any
rights or obligations hereunder may be made by any Seller, on the one hand, or
any Purchaser, on the other hand, (by operation of law or otherwise) without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto and any attempted assignment
without the required consents shall be void except that any Purchaser may (i)
assign any or all of its rights and interests hereunder and obligations
hereunder to one or more Affiliates and (ii) designate one or more Affiliates to
perform its obligations hereunder (in any or all of which cases, the applicable
Purchaser nonetheless shall remain responsible for the performance of all its
obligations hereunder). No assignment of any obligations hereunder shall relieve
the parties hereto of any such obligations. Upon any

                                       60
<PAGE>

such permitted assignment, the references in this Agreement to Purchaser shall
also apply to any such assignee unless the context otherwise requires.

         13.10    Non-Recourse. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney
or representative, of any Seller shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of any Seller under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements of or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney
or representative of Purchasers shall have any liability for any obligations or
liabilities of Purchasers under this Agreement or the Ancillary Agreements or
for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby.

         13.11    Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more

                                Schedule 11.2(d)

                  (a)      Not later than sixty (60) days after the Closing
Date, Purchasers shall prepare and deliver to Sellers a statement (the "Final
Closing Statement"), which shall include a worksheet setting forth a reasonably
detailed calculation of (i) consolidated Current Assets of Sellers (the "Final
Current Assets") as of the Closing Date, prepared in accordance with GAAP in a
manner consistent with past practice and the books and records of each Seller as
of the Closing Date.

                  (b)      (i)      If the Final Current Assets, net of any
Inventory and accounts receivable relating to Excluded Products, exceeds forty
seven million dollars ($47,000,000) by more than two hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($250,000) (the amount of such excess over two hundred fifty thousand
dollars ($250,000) being referred to as the "Excess"), Purchasers shall pay to
Sellers the Excess.

                           (ii)     If the Final Current Assets, net of any
Inventory and accounts receivable relating to Excluded Products, is less than
forty seven million dollars ($47,000,000) by more than two hundred fifty
thousand dollars ($250,000) (the amount of such difference over two hundred
fifty thousand dollars ($250,000) being referred to as the "Deficit"), Seller
shall pay to Purchasers the Deficit provided that the Deficit shall be paid
solely from the Indemnity Account.

                           (iii)    Any amount payable by Purchasers or Sellers
pursuant to clause (i) or (ii) of this paragraph (b) is referred to as the
"True-Up Amount."

                           (iv)     Any True-Up Amount shall be paid in cash
within ten (10) days following Sellers' receipt of the Final Closing Statement
by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by the
receiving party, plus interest thereon from and including the Closing Date
through and including the day before the date of such payment, at a per annum
rate equal to the prime rate (the "Prime Rate") as reported in the Wall Street
Journal (under the heading "Money Rates") on the Closing Date.

                  (c)      Upon receipt of the Final Closing Statement, Sellers
shall have thirty (30) days to review the Final Closing Statement. Upon the
expiration of such 30-day period, Sellers shall be deemed to have accepted, and
shall be bound by, the Final Closing Statement and the calculation therein of
the Final Current Assets, unless Sellers have informed the other parties in
writing of their disagreement with the Final Closing Statement prior to the
expiration of such thirty (30) day period (the "Objection"), specifying each of
the disputed items and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis for each
such dispute (each, a "Disputed Item"). Purchasers shall have thirty (30) days
from the date on which it receives the Objection (the "Objection Date") to
review and respond to such Objection. If Sellers and Purchasers are able to
negotiate a mutually agreeable resolution of each Disputed Item, and each signs
a certificate to that effect, the Final Closing Statement and the calculation
therein of the True-Up Amount, as adjusted to reflect such resolution, shall be
deemed final, non-appealable and binding for purposes of this Agreement.

                                       64
<PAGE>

                  (d)      If within thirty (30) days of the Objection Date,
Purchasers and Sellers are unable to resolve all of their disagreements with
respect to the Disputed Items, Purchasers and Sellers shall refer the Disputed
Items to a mutually acceptable "Big Four" accounting firm (the "Accounting
Firm") to make a final, non-appealable and binding determination as to such
Disputed Items. The Accounting Firm shall be directed to make a determination of
the Disputed Items in accordance with GAAP promptly, but no later than thirty
(30) days, after acceptance of its appointment. Purchasers and Sellers shall
make readily available to the Accounting Firm all relevant books, records and
employees of the Business reasonably requested by the Accounting Firm in
connection with the Accounting Firm's review of any Disputed Item.

                  (e)      The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be
borne by Purchasers and Sellers in the same proportion that the dollar amount of
Disputed Items which are not resolved in favor of Purchasers and Sellers (as
applicable) bears to the total dollar amount of Disputed Items resolved by the
Accounting Firm. For illustration purposes only, (A) if the total amount of
Disputed Items by Sellers is $1,000,000, and Sellers are awarded $500,000 by the
Accounting Firm, Purchasers and Sellers shall bear the Accounting Firm's fees
and expenses equally; or (B) if the total amount of Disputed Items by Sellers is
$1,000,000, and Sellers are awarded $250,000 by the Accounting Firm, Sellers
shall bear 75 percent (75%) and Purchasers shall bear 25 percent (25%) of the
Accounting Firm's fees and expenses. Each of Purchasers and Sellers shall bear
the fees, costs and expenses of its own accountants and all of its other
expenses incurred in connection with matters contemplated by this Schedule
11.2(d).

                  (f)      In the event an Objection is submitted, payment of
any True-Up Amount, shall be made within ten (10) days following the final
resolution of all Disputed Items by the parties or the Accounting Firm by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account designated by Purchasers
or Sellers, as the case may be, plus interest thereon through and including the
day before the date of such payment, at a per annum rate equal to the Prime Rate
as in effect on the Closing Date.
