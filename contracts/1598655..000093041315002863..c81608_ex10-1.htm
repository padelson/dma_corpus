Buyer, the Sponsor agrees to cause the Seller to sell to the Buyer and the
Buyer agrees to purchase from the Seller for the applicable Purchase Price
and in accordance with and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, the Shares which in turn shall result in the Buyer indirectly
owning the Vessels (the " _Acquisition_ "). The Seller shall transfer the
Shares to GPHL, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer, at Closing, unless Buyer
shall before Closing nominate a different Buyer Entity to receive the Shares.

  



  

SECTION 2.02. _Closing._ On the terms of this Agreement and subject to the
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article XII, the sale
and transfer of the Shares and payment of the Purchase Price shall take place
on the date that is five business days after the satisfaction or waiver of
all of the conditions set forth in Article XII (other than those conditions to
be satisfied on the Closing Date) (such date, the " _Closing Date_ ") or such
other date as the Sponsor, Seller and Buyer shall otherwise agree. The
sale and transfer of the Shares is hereinafter referred to as " _Closing_ ".

  



  

SECTION 2.03. _Place of Closing._  The Closing shall take place at Gildo
Pastor Center, 7 Rue du Gabian, MC 98000, Monaco or any other place as
designated by the Sponsor.

  



  

SECTION 2.04. _Purchase Price for Shares._  On the Closing Date, (i) the
Buyer shall pay to the Seller (to such account and beneficiary being a Seller
Entity as the Seller shall designate) the amount of U.S. dollars $161,000,000
(the " _GAS-nineteen Purchase Price_ ") in exchange for the GAS-nineteen
Shares, (ii) the Buyer shall pay to the Seller (to such account and
beneficiary being a Seller Entity as the Seller shall designate) the amount
of U.S. dollars $161,000,000 (the " _GAS-twenty Purchase Price_ ") in exchange
for the GAS-twenty Shares, and (iii) the Buyer shall pay to the Seller (to

the transfer of associated debt obligations of the Vessel Owners under the
Credit Facility and the granting of the MLP Guarantee. The Buyer shall have
no responsibility or liability hereunder for the Seller's allocation and
distribution of the Purchase Price among the Seller Entities.

(a) No later than one Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Seller
shall deliver to the Buyer a calculation of the Estimated Adjustment Amount,
and the Purchase Price payable on the Closing Date shall be adjusted by

(b) As soon as practicable, but no later than 30 days after the Closing Date,
Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Seller a proposed calculation of the
Net Working Capital, including the components thereof (the " _Proposed
Calculations_ "). If the Seller does not give written notice of dispute (a "
_Dispute Notice_ ") to Buyer within 30 days of receiving the
Proposed Calculations, the Proposed Calculations shall be deemed to set forth
the final Net Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Dispute
Notice may include only objections based on (x) noncompliance with the
standards set forth in this Agreement for the preparation of the Net Working
Capital or (y) mathematical errors in the calculation of the Net Working
Capital. If the Seller gives a Dispute Notice to Buyer (which Dispute Notice
must set forth, in reasonable detail, the items and amounts in dispute and
all other items and amounts not so disputed shall be deemed final) within such
30-day period, Buyer and the Seller shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to resolve the dispute during the 30-day period commencing on the date Buyer
receives the Dispute Notice from the Seller. If the Seller and Buyer do not
agree upon a final resolution with respect to such disputed items within such
30-day period, then the remaining items in dispute shall be submitted
immediately to an independent accounting firm mutually acceptable to Buyer
and the Seller. Any accounting firm so agreed (the " _Accounting Firm_ ")
shall be required to render a determination of the applicable dispute within
45 days after referral of the matter to such Accounting Firm, which
determination must be in writing and must set forth, in reasonable detail, the
basis therefor; _provided_ that the Accounting Firm may (i) only consider
those items and amounts as to which the Seller and Buyer have disagreed within
the time periods and on the terms specified above and (ii) only make
adjustments based on noncompliance with the standards set forth in this
Agreement for the determination of the Net Working Capital. The determination
made by the Accounting Firm with respect to the remaining disputed items
shall not exceed or be less than the amounts proposed by the Seller and Buyer,
as the case may be. The terms of appointment and engagement of the Accounting
Firm shall be as agreed upon between the Seller and Buyer, and any
associated engagement fees shall be borne 50% by the Seller and 50% by Buyer.
The determination of such Accounting Firm shall be conclusive and binding for
all purposes of this Agreement. Buyer and Seller shall provide each other
reasonable access to financial and other records in connection with the
determination of the Net Working Capital under this Section 2.05(b).

  



  

(c) Adjustment to Estimated Closing Payment:

  



  

(i) If the Actual Adjustment is a positive amount, Buyer shall pay to the
Seller an amount equal to such positive amount by wire transfer or delivery
of immediately available funds, in each case, within three Business Days after
the date on which the Net Working Capital is finally determined pursuant to
Section 2.05(b).

  



  

(ii) If the Actual Adjustment is a negative amount, Seller shall pay to Buyer
an amount equal to such negative amount by wire transfer or delivery of
immediately available funds, in each case, within three Business Days after

Section 2.05(b).

(together, the " _Vessels_ "), the Ship Management Agreement (such agreement,
including as it may be subsequently amended, the " _GAS-nineteen Ship

together with the GAS-nineteen Ship Management Agreement and the GAS-twenty

between Buyer, GasLog Services and GasLog Carriers (the " _First Depot Spares

Andrea_ and the _Methane Jane Elizabeth_ (the " _Earlier Two Vessels_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Letter of Agreement, GasLog Services may purchase
and remove any of the items (the " _Depot Spares_ ") listed in Appendices A
and B to the Letter of Agreement that are currently held at the warehouse
located at 8146 Big Lake Road, Lake Charles, Louisiana 70605 (the "

WHEREAS, pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Buyer has agreed to purchase
the share capital of the companies that own the Vessels from the Seller;

   


--- 

 

| 
---|--- 

    

NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties hereto agree as follows, to be effective upon
closing of the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement:

  



  

(a) GasLog Services shall act under the Ship Management Agreements on behalf
of GAS-nineteen Ltd., GAS-twenty Ltd. and GAS-twenty one Ltd., on an equal and
ratable basis with other vessels subject to the Letter of Agreement in the
GasLog Ltd. fleet and the Earlier Two Vessels subject to the First Depot
Spares Letter in the Buyer's fleet, in any further negotiations or discussions
with Methane Services Limited regarding the Depot Spares and GasLog Services
shall not agree to any amendment, modification or waiver of the Letter of
Agreement without the written consent of Buyer.

  



  

(b) GasLog Services shall procure Depot Spares under the Letter of Agreement
as necessary for use on the Vessels during the term of the Ship Management
Agreements on behalf of GAS-nineteen Ltd., GAS-twenty Ltd. and GAS-twenty one
Ltd., and GasLog Services shall act with respect to the Vessels on an equal
and ratable basis with other vessels subject to the Letter of Agreement in the
GasLog Ltd. fleet and the Earlier Two Vessels subject to the First Depot
Spares Letter in the Buyer's fleet. GAS-nineteen Ltd., GAS-twenty Ltd. and
GAS-twenty one Ltd. shall reimburse GasLog Services for the Listed Prices of
any such procured Depot Spares in accordance with the Ship
Management Agreements.

  



  

(c) Should either or both of the Ship Management Agreements be terminated on
or prior to the Removal Date, this Agreement shall remain in effect and GasLog
Services shall continue to grant GAS-nineteen Ltd., GAS-twenty Ltd. and GAS-
twenty one Ltd. access to procure the Depot Spares, on an equal and ratable
basis with other vessels subject to the Letter of Agreement in the GasLog Ltd.
fleet and the Earlier Two Vessels subject to the First Depot Spares Letter in

the Buyer shall pay or cause to be paid to GasLog Services one-half of any
costs associated with such transfer.

  



  

(e) On the Removal Date:

  



   | (i)| GasLog Services and Buyer shall, acting in good faith, ratably
divide and allocate the remaining Depot Spares such that the Buyer shall be
responsible for all costs and liability associated with removing one-half (or
the nearest possible allocation to one-half) (or, for clarity, as of the date
of this Agreement, five-sixths when the three Vessels are combined with the
Earlier Two Vessels under the First Depot Spares Letter) of the then
remaining Depot Spares (the " _Buyer Depot Spares_ ") from the Warehouse,
GasLog Services shall convey title to the Buyer Depot Spares to the Buyer, and
the Buyer shall pay to GasLog Services the Listed Prices for the Buyer Depot
Spares; or 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| acting in good faith, the Parties shall then agree to an
alternative equitable allocation of any then remaining Depot Spares and the
purchase consideration therefor. 
---|---|--- 
   


--- 

 

|

The Parties recognize and agree that the only section of the Letter of
Agreement to which this Agreement applies is the section of the Letter of
