WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have approved  the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the  conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

 

WHEREAS,  in furtherance of such acquisition, Parent proposes to cause Sub to

under this  Agreement, the " _Offer_ ")  to  purchase all the outstanding
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share  (together with any share
purchase rights associated therewith) of the Company  (the " _Company 
Common Stock_ "),  at a  price per share of Company Common Stock equal to
$16.55;

 

 

WHEREAS,  the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, Sub and the Company
have approved  this Agreement and the merger (the " _Merger_ ")  of Sub 
into the Company, on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in

WHEREAS,  if the sale of the MBO Business is consummated pursuant to an
agreement other  than the MBO Agreement, Parent and Sub may become obligated
to make an  additional payment to the holders of Company Common Stock and

expiration date of the Offer shall be the later of the 45th Business Day 
following the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-2 of the 
SEC)  or the day of the MBO Pre-Closing. Sub expressly reserves the right to
waive  any  condition to the Offer or modify the terms of the Offer, except
that, without  the prior written consent of the Company, Sub shall not (i)
reduce the number  of  shares of Company Common Stock subject to the Offer,
(ii) reduce the price  per  share of Company Common Stock to be paid
pursuant to the Offer, (iii) waive  the  Minimum Tender Condition (as

extend the  Offer for one or more periods of time that Sub reasonably
believes are necessary  to cause the conditions of the Offer set forth in

Offer, any of the  conditions to Sub's obligation to purchase shares of

of time  not exceeding five (5) Business Days beyond the latest expiration
date of the  Offer that would otherwise be permitted under subclauses (A),

diluted basis) has been validly  tendered and not withdrawn pursuant to the
Offer, or (E) revise the terms of  the  Offer to be consistent with any
amendment to the MBO Agreement or the terms  of  any other agreement for the
sale of the MBO Business entered into pursuant  to  Section 4.02(e) hereof.
Parent and Sub agree that if all of the conditions  to  the Offer are not
satisfied on any scheduled expiration date of the Offer,  then,  if
requested by the Company, Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Sub to, extend 
the Offer for one or more periods of time that **** Company  reasonably
believes are necessary to cause the conditions of the Offer set  forth  in
Exhibit A hereto to be satisfied, from time to time, until such conditions 
are satisfied or waived, provided that Sub shall not be required to extend 
the  Offer beyond the Outside Date (as defined in Section 7.01(b)(i). Parent
and  Sub  shall not terminate the Offer prior to any scheduled expiration
date (as the  same may be extended or required to be extended) without the
prior written  consent of the Company except in the event this Agreement is
terminated pursuant  to Section 7.01. If the Minimum Tender Condition has
been satisfied, Sub may,  without the consent of the Company, elect to
provide a subsequent offering  period for the Offer in accordance with Rule
14d-11 of the Securities Exchange  Act of 1934, as amended (the " _Exchange 
Act_ ")  following its acceptance for payment of shares of Company Common
Stock in the  Offer. On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer

Parent  and Sub agree that the Offer Documents shall comply as to form in all

comments. If the Offer is terminated or withdrawn by Sub,  Parent and Sub
shall use their respective best efforts to cause all tendered  Company Common
Stock to be promptly returned to the registered holders of such  Company
Common Stock.

 

 

(c) Parent  or  any of its Affiliates shall provide or cause to be provided
to Sub on a timely  basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of
Company Common Stock that  Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to the
Offer. In addition, Parent  will contribute, or cause to be contributed, all
shares of Company Common Stock  owned by Parent or its Affiliates to Sub
prior to the Acceptance Date.

and the Financing Commitment, Parent shall  cause Sub to accept and pay for
the tendered shares of Company Common Stock  in  accordance with the terms
of this Agreement. Upon delivery of notice by Parent  and Sub to C-W Co.,

Company's stockholders. Subject to the  requirements of Applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are necessary  to  disseminate the Offer Documents

the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement  and the Tender
Agreements, Parent and Sub shall hold in confidence the  information

ARTICLE  II.

 

_EFFECT  OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE_

 

_CONSTITUENT  CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES_

 

 

Section  2.01. _Effect  on Capital Stock_.  At the  Effective Time, by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part  of  the holder of
any shares of capital stock of the Company, Parent or  Sub:

 

 

(a) _Capital  Stock of Sub_.  Each  issued and outstanding share of common
stock of Sub shall be converted into  and  become one fully paid and
nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving  Corporation.

 

 

(b) _Cancellation  of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_.  Each  share
of Company Common Stock and/or Company Preferred Stock that is owned  by 
the Company (as treasury stock), Parent or Sub immediately prior to the 
Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist and 
no  consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.

 

 

(c) _Conversion  of Company Common Stock_.  Each  share of Company Common
Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the  Effective Time (other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with Section  2.01(b) and the
Appraisal Shares as defined in Section 2.01(d)) shall be  converted into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation in cash,  without interest,
the price per share paid in the Offer (the " _Merger  Consideration_ "). 
At  the Effective Time all such shares shall no longer be outstanding and
shall  automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each record
holder  of  such shares or of a certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time  represented any such shares (a " _Certificate_ ")  shall 
cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive 
the  Merger Consideration.

 

 

(d) _Appraisal  Rights_.  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal  Shares_ ")  of  Company Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective  Time that are held
by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands  appraisal of
such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with,  the 
provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section  262_ ")  shall  not be
converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided  in
Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of 
the  fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section
262.  At  the Effective Time, all Appraisal Shares shall no longer be
outstanding and  shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of  Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except  appraisal rights pursuant to Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if  any  such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose  the  right to appraisal under
Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall  determine that such
holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section  262, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's  Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall  be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have  become, the
right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section  2.01(c).

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

The  Company shall serve prompt notice to Parent of any demands for appraisal
of  any  shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to
participate  in and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
such demands.  Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not, without
the prior written  consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to, or
settle or offer to  settle, any such demands, or agree to do any of the
foregoing.

 

 

Section  2.02. _Exchange  of Certificates_.

 

 

(a) _Paying  Agent_.  Prior  to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate
a bank or trust company reasonably  acceptable to the Company to act as agent
for the payment of the Merger  Consideration upon surrender of Certificates
(the " _Paying  Agent_ "),  and,  at the Effective Time, Parent or any of
its Affiliates shall provide, or cause  the Surviving Corporation to provide,
to the Paying Agent funds in amounts  necessary for the payment of the Merger
Consideration pursuant to Section  2.01(c) upon surrender of Certificates, it
being understood that any and all  interest or income earned on funds made
available to the Paying Agent pursuant  to this Agreement shall be the income
of and turned over to Parent.

 

 

(b) _Exchange  Procedure_.  As soon  as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but not later than five  (5)  Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Parent shall cause the Paying  Agent  to mail to each
holder of record of a Certificate (i) a form of letter of  transmittal (which
shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk  of  loss and title
to the Certificates held by such Person (as defined in Section  8.03) shall
pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying  Agent and
shall be in customary form and have such other provisions as Parent  may
reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender 
of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender 
of  a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent
or  agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal,  duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents
as may reasonably  be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such
Certificate shall be  entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of
cash into which the  shares formerly represented by such Certificate shall
have been converted  pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so
surrendered shall forthwith  be canceled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Company Common Stock  that is not registered in the stock
transfer books of the Company, the proper  amount of cash may be paid in
exchange therefor to a Person other than the  Person in whose name the
Certificate so surrendered is registered if such  Certificate shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for  transfer and the Person
requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other  similar taxes
required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the  registered
holder of such Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent  that
such tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid  or 
shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Certificate.

 

 

(c) _No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_.  All  cash paid
upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms  of  this
Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all 
rights pertaining to the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

shares  of  Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate.
From and after  the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time
occurs, there  shall  be no further registration of transfers on the stock
transfer books of the  Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common
Stock that were  outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If,
after the Effective  Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying  Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall
be canceled and exchanged  as  provided in this Article II except as
otherwise provided by law.

 

 

(d) _No  Liability_.  None of  Parent, Sub, the Company or the Paying Agent
shall be liable to any Person  in  respect of any cash properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to any  applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. If any Certificate shall  not have been surrendered prior to the
date that is ten Business Days prior  to  the date on which any Merger
Consideration would otherwise escheat to or became  the property of any
Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 3.01(d)), any  such Merger
Consideration in respect thereof shall, to the extent permitted  by 
Applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and 
clear  of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled  thereto.

 

 

(e) _Lost  Certificates_.  If any  Certificate shall have been lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an  affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost,  stolen or destroyed and, if required
by the Surviving Corporation, the posting  by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation  may direct as indemnity
against any claim that may be made against it with  respect to such
Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay in respect of such lost,  stolen or
destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration.

 

 

(f) _Withholding  Rights_.  Parent,  the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and  withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement  to  any holder of shares of
Company Common Stock such amounts as Parent, the  Surviving Corporation or
the Paying Agent is required to deduct and withhold  with respect to the
making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code  of  1986, as amended
(the " _Code_ "),  or  any provision of state, local or foreign tax law. To
the extent that amounts  are  so withheld and paid over to the appropriate
taxing authority by Parent, the  Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent,
such withheld amounts shall be  treated for all purposes of this Agreement as
having been paid to the holder  of  the shares of Company Common Stock in
respect of which such deduction and  withholding was made by Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying  Agent.

 

 

Section  2.03. _Stock  Options_. 

 

 

(a) Each  Company Stock Option (as defined in Section 3.01(c) hereof) granted
under any  Company Option Plan or otherwise that is outstanding immediately
prior to the  Effective Time shall be cancelled as of the Effective Time and,
following such  cancellation, shall solely represent the right to receive an
amount in cash  equal to (i) the Option Consideration with respect to such
Company Stock  Option multiplied by

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(ii) the  aggregate number of shares of Company Common Stock then subject to
such Company  Stock Option. For purposes of this Section 2.03, " _Option 
Consideration_ " means  the **** greater  of (1) $0.10 or (2) the excess,
if any, of the Merger Consideration over the  per  share exercise price of
the applicable Company Stock Option. In the case of  Company Stock Options
outstanding under the Company's Amended and Restated  Employee Stock Purchase
Plan, the number of shares of Company Common Stock  subject to any such
Company Stock Option shall be determined by treating the  day  immediately
prior to the Effective Time as the last day of the then-current  offering
period. The Company shall, on or prior to the Effective Time, take  all 
requisite action, if any, necessary to effect the option treatment set forth 
in  the preceding sentences. Any payment made pursuant to this Section
2.03(a)  to  the holder of any Company Stock Option shall be reduced by any
required income  or employment tax withholding. To the extent that any
amounts are so withheld,  those amounts shall be treated as having been paid
to the holder of that Company  Stock Option for all purposes under this
Agreement. Parent shall cause the  Surviving Corporation to make the payments
in respect of the Company Stock  Options as promptly as practicable following
the Effective Time by wire  transfers or checks payable to the holders of
such Company Stock Options. Prior  to the Acceptance Date, the Company shall
obtain all necessary consents or  releases (which shall be effective as of
the Effective Time) from holders of  Company Stock Options and take all such
other lawful action as may be necessary  to give effect to the transactions
contemplated by this Section 2.03, such  that  no Company Stock Options will
be outstanding after the Effective Time or after  payment of Option
Consideration to persons subject to Section 16(b) of the  Exchange Act, as
the case may be. The Company shall take all requisite action  so  that,
immediately following the payments described in this Section 2.03, all 
Company Option Plans shall be terminated.

 

 

(b) Prior  to  the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company, or
an appropriate  committee of non-employee directors of the Company, shall, if
necessary, adopt  a  resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance of
the SEC to approve  the  disposition by any officer or director of the
Company who is a covered person  of  the Company for purposes of Section 16
under the Exchange Act (" _Section  16_ ")  of  shares of Company Common
Stock or Company Stock Options pursuant to this  Agreement and the Merger for
purposes of qualifying the disposition as an exempt  transaction under
Section 16.

 

 

ARTICLE  III.

 

_REPRESENTATIONS  AND WARRANTIES_

 

 

Section  3.01. _Representations  and Warranties of the Company_.  Each 
representation and warranty contained in this Section 3.01 is qualified by 
the  documents filed by the Company with the SEC since January 1, 2005 and by
the  disclosure schedule delivered by the Company to Parent prior to the
execution  of  this Agreement (the " _Company  Disclosure Schedule_ "). 
Company shall disclose all items in the Company Disclosure Schedule with

the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has all requisite corporate, 
company or partnership power and authority to carry on its business as now 
being  conducted and (iii) is duly qualified or licensed to do business and
is in  good  standing in each jurisdiction in which the nature of its
business or the  ownership, leasing or operation of its properties makes such
qualification  or  licensing necessary, other than (except in the case of
clause (i) above with  respect to the Company) where the failure to be so
organized, existing,  qualified or licensed or in good standing, individually

organizational documents) of each of  its  Significant Subsidiaries, in each
case as amended to the date of this Agreement.  The Company has made
available to Parent and its representatives true and  complete copies of all
minutes prepared and approved by the Board of Directors  of all meetings of

(b) _Subsidiaries_.  Section  3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule

by the Company, by another wholly owned Subsidiary  of  the Company or by
the Company and another wholly owned Subsidiary of the  Company, free and
clear of all pledges, claims, liens, charges, encumbrances  and  security
interests of any kind or nature whatsoever (collectively, " _Liens_ "), 
and  are duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
Except as  set  forth on Section 3.01(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
and except for  the  capital stock of, or other equity or voting interests
in, its Subsidiaries,  the  Company does not own, directly or indirectly,
any capital stock of, or other  equity or voting interests in, any

(c) _Capital  Structure_.  The  authorized capital stock of the Company
consists of 40,000,000 shares of Company  Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares
of Company Preferred Stock. As of the close  of  business on September 30,
2006, (i) 17,692,577 shares of Company Common Stock  (excluding treasury

were issued and outstanding, (ii) 1,333,757 shares of Company  Common Stock

Incentive  Compensation Plan (such plans, collectively, the " _Company 
Stock Plans_ "),  were  as set forth in Section 3.01(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule (including,  without limitation, shares subject to any
stock options granted to individuals  outside of any Company Stock Plan, and
shares subject to issuance upon the  achievement of performance goals). No
shares of Company Common Stock are owned  by any Subsidiary of the Company.
The Company has set forth in Section 3.01(c)  of the Company Disclosure
Schedule a list of: (1) all outstanding options to  purchase Company Common
Stock granted under the Company Stock Plans (other  than  the Amended and
Restated Employee Stock Plan), whether vested or unvested;  (2)  all
participants in the current offering period under the Amended and Restated 
Employee Stock Plan, and the amount being contributed thereunder; (3) all 
outstanding options to purchase capital stock of the Company granted outside 
the  Company Stock Plans; (4) all outside rights to acquire capital stock of
the  Company upon achievement of performance goals and (5) all other rights
to  purchase or receive any capital stock of the Company (all such options
and  other  rights to acquire capital stock of the Company described in (1),
(3), (4) and  (5) above being collectively referred to herein as " _Company 
Stock Options_ "),  the  number of shares subject to each such Company Stock
Option, the grant dates  and  exercise prices of each such Company Stock
Option, the names of the holder  thereof and whether such Company Stock
Option is subject to a change of control  provision, along with a brief
description of such provision. The Company has  also set forth in Section
3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule a list  of  all outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock with respect to which receipt  of  the Merger
Consideration will result in a failure to meet any of the holding  period
requirements of section 422(a)(1) or section 423(a)(1) of the Code, 
including the names of the holders thereof and the amount of the resulting 
increase in the income of each such individual pursuant to section 421(b) of 
the  Code. **** Except  as  set forth above or in Section 3.01(c) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, as  of  the close of business on September 30,
2006, no shares of capital stock of,  or  other equity or voting interests
in, the Company, or options, warrants, Company  SARs (as defined below in
this Section 3.01(c)) or other rights to acquire  any  such stock or
securities were issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding.  All 
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company are, and all shares that 
may  be issued pursuant to the Company Stock Plans will be when issued in
accordance  with the terms thereof, duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and  nonassessable and not subject to preemptive rights. The exercise
price of each  Company Stock Option is no less than the fair market value of
a share of Company  Common Stock as determined on the date of grant of such
Company Stock Option.  All grants of Company Stock Options were validly
issued and properly approved  by  the Board of Directors of the Company in
material compliance with all Applicable  Law and recorded on the Company
financial statements included in the SEC  Documents in accordance with GAAP,
and no such grants involved any "back-dating,"  "forward dating" or "spring
loading" or similar practices with respect to the  effective date of grant.
There  are  no stock appreciation rights linked to the price of Company
Common Stock and  granted under any Company Stock Plan (" _Company  SAR_
").  There  are no bonds, debentures, notes or other indebtedness of the
Company or any  of  its Subsidiaries, and no securities or other instruments
or obligations of  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the value of
which is in any way based  upon  or derived from any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

12  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

capital  or voting stock of the Company, having the right to vote (or
convertible into,  or exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote)
on any matters on  which stockholders of the Company may vote. Except as set
forth above or in  Section 3.01(c) of the Company Disclosure Schedule and
except as specifically  permitted under Section 4.01(a), there are no
Contracts (as defined in Section  3.01(d)) of any kind to which the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries is a party  or by which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is bound, obligating the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be  issued, delivered or sold, additional
shares of capital stock of, or other  equity or voting interests in, or
securities convertible into, or exchangeable  or exercisable for, shares of
capital stock of, or other equity or voting  interests in, the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or obligating the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries to
issue, grant, extend or enter into any such  security, option, warrant, call,
right or Contract. **** There  are  no outstanding contractual obligations
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  to (x) repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any shares of capital stock  of,  or other equity or
voting interests in, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries  except pursuant
to the Company Stock Plans or as contemplated by Section 5.04  (and no such
repurchase, redemption or other acquisition of Company Common  Stock  and/or
Company Preferred Stock has occurred since January 1, 2006) or (y) vote  or
dispose of any shares of the capital stock of, or other equity or voting 
interests in, any of its Subsidiaries. To the Knowledge of the Company as of 
the  date of this Agreement, there are no irrevocable proxies and no voting 
agreements with respect to any shares of the capital stock or other voting 
securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(d) _Authority;  Noncontravention_.

 

 

(A) The  Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute
and deliver  this Agreement and, subject only to, if required by law,
adoption of this  Agreement by an affirmative vote or the written consent of
the holders of a  majority of the outstanding shares of the Company Common
Stock (the " _Company  Stockholder Approval_ "),  to  consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. The execution and delivery  of  this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the 
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized by all necessary 
corporate action on the part of the Company, subject, in the case of this 
Agreement, only to the Company Stockholder Approval if such approval is
required  by law, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of the
Company are  necessary to approve this Agreement or to consummate the
transactions  contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by  the  Company and, assuming due execution and delivery by
Parent and Sub, constitutes  a valid and binding obligation of the Company,
enforceable against the Company  in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforceability may be limited  by  bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
moratorium and similar laws relating  to  or affecting creditors generally
and by general equity principles regardless  whether enforceability is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law. The  Board of Directors of
the Company, at a meeting duly called and held at which  a  quorum of
directors of the Company was present, duly adopted resolutions (i)  declaring
advisable this Agreement and approving the Offer, the Merger, this  Agreement
and the Tender Agreements and, subject to Sections 4.02 and 7.01(e)  hereof,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby,  (ii)

unaffiliated stockholders that the Company enter into this Agreement and

13  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

parties  consummate the Offer and the Merger on the terms and subject to the
conditions  set forth in this Agreement, (iii) recommending that the
Company's stockholders  accept the Offer, tender their shares pursuant to the
Offer and adopt this  Agreement (if required by Applicable Law) and (iv)
approving the acquisition  of  the shares of the Company Common Stock by Sub
pursuant to the Offer and the  other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

 

 

(B) Except  as  set forth in Section 3.01(d) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the execution  and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation
of the transactions  contemplated hereby and compliance with the provisions
hereof do not and will  not conflict with, or result in any violation or
breach of, or default (with  or  without notice or lapse of time, or both)
under, or give rise to a right of,  or  result in, termination, cancellation
or acceleration of any obligation or to  loss of a material benefit under, or
result in the creation of any material  Lien  in or upon any of the material
properties or assets of the Company or the  material properties or assets of
any of its Subsidiaries under, or give rise  to  any increased, additional,
accelerated or guaranteed rights or entitlements  under or require consent
under, any provision of (1) the Certificate of  Incorporation or By-laws of
the Company or the certificate of incorporation  or  by-laws (or similar
organizational documents) of any of its Significant  Subsidiaries, (2) any
loan or credit agreement, bond, debenture, note, mortgage,  indenture,
guarantee, lease or other contract, agreement, instrument,  obligation,
Permit (as defined in Section 3.01(i)), Environmental Permit (as  defined in
Section 3.01(1)), concession, franchise or license, whether written  or, to
the Knowledge of the Company, oral (each of the foregoing which contains  a
binding obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including all 
amendments thereto, a " _Contract_ "),  to  which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or any of their  respective properties or assets is
subject or (3) subject to the satisfaction  of  the governmental filings and
other matters referred to in the subsection (C)  below, any (A) statute, law,
ordinance, rule or regulation or (B) judgment,  order or decree, in each case
applicable to the Company or any of its  Subsidiaries or their respective
properties or assets, other than, in the case  of clauses (2) and (3), any
such conflicts, violations, breaches, defaults,  rights, losses, Liens or
entitlements that, individually and in the aggregate,  would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(C) No  consent, approval, order or authorization of, or registration,
declaration  or  filing with, any domestic (whether national, federal, state
or local) government  or any court, administrative agency or commission or
other governmental or  regulatory authority or agency, domestic, foreign or
supranational (a " _Governmental  Entity_ "),  is  required by or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in  connection with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company  or  the
consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or 
thereby or compliance with the provisions hereof and thereof, except for (1) 
the  filing of a premerger notification and report form by the Company under
the  Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "
_HSR  Act_ "),  or  any other applicable competition, merger control,
antitrust or similar laws  or  regulations, (2) the filing with the SEC of
(A) the Schedule 14D-9, (B) a proxy  statement or information statement
relating to Company Stockholder Approval  if  such approval is required by
law (as amended or supplemented from time to time,  the " _Proxy  Statement_
"),  and  (C) such reports under the Exchange Act, as may be required in

documents  with the relevant authorities of other states in which the Company
or any of  its  Subsidiaries is qualified to do business, (4) any filings
required under the  rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange ("
_NYSE_ "),  (5)  such other consents, approvals, orders, authorizations,
registrations,  declarations and filings (including those required under
Environmental Laws  (as  defined in Section 3.01(l)(vi))) the failure of
which to be obtained or made,  individually and in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have  a  Material Adverse Effect or to prevent or
materially delay the consummation  of  the Offer, the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement  and (6) any filings required
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as  amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Investment  Advisers Act_ ").

 

 

(e) _SEC  Documents_.  The  Company has timely filed with the SEC, and has
heretofore made available to  Parent true and complete copies of, all forms,
reports, schedules, statements  and other documents required to be filed with
the SEC by the Company since  January 1, 2003 (as such filings may be deemed
to include all information  incorporated therein by reference, the " _SEC 
Documents_ ");  provided, however, that the Company will not be required to
furnish reports  or  other communications or information that is available
on the SEC's EDGAR system.  Except as set forth in Section 3.01(e) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule,  no  Subsidiary of the Company, other than the
BD Subsidiary or the IA Subsidiary,  is  required to file any form, report,
schedule, statement or other document with  the SEC. As of their respective
dates, the SEC Documents complied in all  material respects with the
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as  amended (the " _Securities 
Act_ "),  or  the Exchange Act, as the case may be, each as amended by the
Sarbanes-Oxley  Act  of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley  Act_ ")  and  the
rules and regulations of the SEC promulgated thereunder applicable to such 
SEC Documents, and the continued listing requirements of the NYSE, and
except  to  the extent that information contained in any SEC Document filed
and publicly  available prior to the date of this Agreement (a " _Filed  SEC
Document_ ")  has  been revised or superseded by a later Filed SEC Document,
none of the SEC  Documents when filed contained any untrue statement of a
material fact or  omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary  in  order to make the statements therein, in light of
the circumstances under which  they were made, not misleading. The financial
statements (including the related  notes) included in the SEC Documents
comply as to form in all material respects  with applicable accounting
requirements and the published rules and regulations  of the SEC and the
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (" _PCAOB_ ")  with  respect
thereto, were prepared in accordance with then applicable generally  accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ")  (except, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of  the  SEC) applied on a consistent
basis during the periods involved (except as may  be  indicated in the notes
thereto) and fairly present in all material respects  the  consolidated
financial position of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries 
described therein as of the dates thereof and their consolidated results of 
operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in the case 
of  unaudited statements, to normal and recurring year-end audit adjustments
and  the  absence of footnotes). Each of the Principal Executive Officer and
Principal  Financial Officer of the Company has made all certifications
required by SEC  order, NYSE rule, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and
regulations of the  SEC promulgated thereunder with respect to the Company's
filings

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

15  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

pursuant  to the Exchange Act, and the statements contained in all such
certifications  were as of the respective dates made, complete and correct
except for such  failures to be complete and correct as have not had, and
would not reasonably  be  expected to have, a Material Adverse Effect.
Neither the Company nor any of  its  officers has received notice from the
SEC or the NYSE questioning or challenging  the accuracy, completeness,
content, form or manner of filing or submission  of  such certifications.
The Company is, and through the Effective Time will be,  otherwise in
material compliance with all applicable effective provisions of  the 
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the applicable listing and corporate governance rules 
of  the NYSE. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "Principal Executive
Officer" and "Principal Financial Officer" shall have the meanings given to
such terms in  the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

 

 

(f) _Absence  of Certain Changes or Events_.  Except  as disclosed in
Section 3.01(f) of the Company Disclosure Schedule, since  December 31, 2005,
the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their  respective businesses

been (i) to the Company's Knowledge, any state of facts,  change,
development, effect, event, condition or occurrence that individually  or 
in the aggregate constitutes, has had, or would reasonably be expected to
have,  a Material Adverse Effect, (ii) prior to the date of this Agreement,

a wholly owned  Subsidiary of the Company to its parent, (iii) prior to the

split, combination  or  reclassification of any of the Company's or any of
its Subsidiaries' capital  stock or any issuance or the authorization of any
issuance of any other  securities in respect of, in lieu of or in
substitution for shares of capital  stock or other securities of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, (v) (x)  any  granting by the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries to any current or former  director, officer, employee or
consultant of any increase in compensation,  bonus  or other benefits or any
such granting of any type of compensation or benefits  to any current or
former director, officer, employee or consultant **** not  previously
receiving or entitled to receive such type of compensation or  benefit,
except for increases of cash compensation in the ordinary course of  business
consistent with past practice or required under any agreement or  benefit
plan in effect as of September 30, 2006, (y) any granting to any current  or
former director, officer, employee or consultant of the right to receive 
any  severance or termination pay, or increases therein, except (A) for
severance  obligations which have been satisfied prior to the date hereof, or
(B) for  increases in severance or termination pay in the ordinary course of
business  consistent with past practices not exceeding $300,000 in the
aggregate, provided  that this $300,000 aggregate limit shall not apply to
persons employed by the  business segments comprising the MBO Business if
they are added to the list  of  Assumed Employees which C-W Co. will employ
following the closing of the MBO  Agreement, or (z) any entry by the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries into,  or  any material amendment of, any Company
Benefit Agreement or any Company Benefit  Plan (each as defined in Section
3.01(j)), except as required to

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

16  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

comply  with Applicable Law, (vi) any payment of any benefit or the grant or
amendment  of any award (including in respect of stock options, stock
appreciation rights,  performance units, restricted stock or other stock-
based or stock-related awards  or the removal or modification of any
restrictions in any Company Benefit  Agreement or Company Benefit Plan or
awards made thereunder) except as required  to comply with any Applicable Law

date, (vii) any damage, destruction or loss,  whether or not covered by
insurance, that, individually or in the aggregate,  would reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect, (viii) any  material change in

assets of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

 

 

(g) _Litigation_.  As of  the date of this Agreement and except as set forth
in Section 3.01(g) of the  Company Disclosure Schedule, there is no suit,
claim, action, charge, complaint,  investigation or proceeding pending or, to
the Knowledge of the Company,  threatened against or affecting the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or any  of  their respective assets that,
individually or in the aggregate, if decided  adversely to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries would have a Material  Adverse Effect, nor is there any
judgment, order, injunction or decree, of  any  Governmental Entity or
arbitrator outstanding against, or, to the Knowledge  of  the Company,
investigation, proceeding, notice of violation, charge, order  of 
forfeiture or complaint by any Governmental Entity involving, the Company or 
any  of its Subsidiaries that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably  be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Section 3.01(g)
of the Company  Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list of
all pending suits,  actions, proceedings, charges made by a Governmental
Entity, and to the  Company's Knowledge, all claims, complaints and
investigations and each  settlement or similar agreement resolving any
pending or threatened suit, claim,  action, charge, complaint, investigation,
proceeding, rule, judgment, order,  injunction or decree of any Governmental
Entity or arbitrator which the Company  or any of its Subsidiaries has
entered into or to which any of them has become  bound and which has not been
satisfied according to its terms.

 

 

(h) _Contracts_.  Except  for Contracts set forth in Section 3.01(h) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule  or  listed as an exhibit to the Filed SEC
Documents (together, the " _Material  Contracts_ "),  neither Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, and none of their  respective
properties or assets are bound by, any "material contract" (as such  term is
defined in Item 601(b)(10) of Regulation S-K of the SEC). Section  3.01(h) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and complete list  of:

 

 

(i) all  Contracts to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party
that  contain: (A) a covenant restricting the ability of the Company or any
of its  Subsidiaries (or which, following the consummation of the Offer or
the Merger,  could restrict the ability of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

17  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Parent  or  any of its Subsidiaries, including the Company and its
Subsidiaries) to compete  with any Person or engage in any business or
activity in any geographic area  or  pursuant to which any benefit is

other than territorial and market restrictions set forth  in license or
distributorship agreements concerning exclusively products  utilized,
marketed or sold by the Company or its Subsidiaries; (B) all Contracts 
pursuant to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is restricted in
any  material respect in the development, marketing or distribution of
their  respective products or services, or (C) all material agreements and 
understandings, written or oral, between the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries  and Governmental Entities which require the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries  to take, or refrain from taking, any action;

 

 

(ii) all  loan  agreements, credit agreements, notes, debentures, bonds,
mortgages, and  indentures pursuant to which any indebtedness of the Company
or any of its  Subsidiaries is outstanding or may be incurred and all
guarantees of or by  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
indebtedness of any other Person  (except for such indebtedness or guarantees
of indebtedness the aggregate  principal amount of which does not exceed
$500,000), including the respective  aggregate principal amounts outstanding
as of the date of this  Agreement;

 

 

(iii) with  respect to each operating segment of the Company within its

of  calendar year 2005 and the first six (6) calendar months of 2006;  and

 

 

(v) with  respect to each operating segment of the Company within its
Corporate Solutions  division, all Contracts with the five (5) largest
producers, consultants or  similar third parties (" _Producers_ ") 
marketing the Company's programs, products and services measured in terms of

To  the  Knowledge of the Company, all contracts that are material to the
Company or  any  of its Significant Subsidiaries, including all Material
Contracts, are valid  and  binding obligations of the respective parties
thereto and are enforceable in  accordance with their respective terms. None
of the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries is in violation of or default
(with or without notice or lapse  of  time or both) under, or has waived or
failed to enforce any rights or benefits  under, any such contracts and, to
the Knowledge of the Company or such  Subsidiary, no other party to any
contract that is material to the Company  or  any of its Significant
Subsidiaries, including all of its Material Contracts,  is  in violation or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) under,  or has
waived or failed to enforce any rights or benefits under, and there  has 
occurred no event giving to others any right of termination, amendment, 
rescission or cancellation of or defense or counterclaim to, with or without 
notice or lapse of time or both, any such contracts except, in each case,
for  violations, defaults, waivers or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

18  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

failures  to enforce benefits that, individually and in the aggregate, would
not  reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Client,
Carrier  or  Producer set forth in Section 3.01(h) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule has  notified the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that it intends
to stop or  decrease in any material respect the volume of business which it
does with  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for such Clients,
Carriers or  Producers identified in Section 3.01(h) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule,  no  Person accounted for more than 5% of the combined
revenue of the Company and  its  Subsidiaries during calendar year 2005 or
the first six (6) months of 2006.  As  of the date hereof, all contracts
that are material to the Company or any of  its  Significant Subsidiaries,
including all Material Contracts, are either publicly  filed with the SEC or
Company has made true and complete copies of such  contracts available to
Parent or its Representatives. Except as specified in  Section 3.01(h) the
Company Disclosure Schedule, no contract that is material  to  the Company
or any of its Significant Subsidiaries, including any Material  Contract, has
been amended, modified, supplemented or otherwise altered orally,  in writing
or by course of conduct except to the extent such amendment,  modification,
supplement or alteration has been provided to Parent or its  representatives,

respectively, and not this Section 3.01(i) or as set forth in  Section

limited to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the USA Patriot Act of 2001 and all 
Applicable Laws relating to the retention of electronic mail and other

which are the  subject of Sections 3.01(l) and 3.01(n), respectively, and not
this Section  3.01(i) or as set forth in Section 3.01(i) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule,  to the Company's Knowledge none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has  received, since January 1, 2003, a written notice or
other written communication  alleging a possible violation of Applicable Law,
except for violations that  individually or in the aggregate would not
reasonably be expected to have a  Material Adverse Effect on the line or
lines of business to which the violation  relates. Also except with respect
to Environmental Laws (as defined in Section  3.01(l) and taxes (as defined
in Section 3.01(n), which are the subject of  Sections 3.01(l) and 3.01(n),
respectively, and not this Section 3.01(i) or  as  set forth in Section

Governmental Entities (collectively, " _Permits_ "),  necessary or advisable
for them to own, lease or operate their properties and  assets and to carry
on their businesses as now conducted, except where the  failure to have such
Permits would not reasonably be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect,
and there has occurred no violation of, default (with or without  notice or
lapse of time or both) under, or event giving to others any right  of 
termination, amendment or cancellation of, with or without notice or lapse 
of  time or both, any such Permit, where such termination, amendment or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

19  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

cancellation  would reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.
The records,  systems, controls, data and information of the Company and its
Subsidiaries  are  recorded, stored, maintained and operated under means
(including any electronic,  mechanical or photographic process, whether
computerized or not) that are under  the exclusive ownership and direct and
non-direct control that would not  reasonably be expected to have a
materially adverse effect on the system of  internal accounting controls

SEC Documents filed with the SEC prior to the date  hereof, the Company and
its Subsidiaries have devised and maintain a system  of  internal controls
over financial reporting sufficient to provide reasonable  assurances
regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation  of
financial statements in accordance with GAAP and disclosure controls and 
procedures to ensure that the information required to be disclosed in the
SEC  Documents is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the
time  periods specified by the SEC's rules and forms.

Except  as disclosed in the Filed SEC Documents or in Section 3.01(j) of the
Company  Disclosure Schedule, since December 31, 2005, other than any actions
required  by  the terms of this Agreement, the MBO Agreement or by
Applicable Law or actions  taken in the ordinary course of business
consistent with past  practice, **** none  of  the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has terminated, adopted, amended or  agreed to amend in any

Plans_ "),  except with respect to all Company Benefit Plans (other than tax-
qualified  retirement plans, the Execu-Flex Benefit Plan, Deferred Retention
Plan,  Severance Pay Plan and the Deferred Compensation Plan) where such
termination,  adoption or amendment, individually or in the aggregate, would
not reasonably  be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. Since
December 31, 2005, none of  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
changed the manner in which contributions  to any Company Pension Plan are
made or the basis on which such contributions  are determined. Except as
disclosed in the Filed SEC Documents or in Section  3.01(j) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule, (i) there exist no employment,  consulting, deferred

arrangements between the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,  on  the one
hand, and any current or former director, officer, employee or  consultant of

Plan provides benefits that are contingent, or the terms  of  which are
materially altered, upon the occurrence of a transaction involving  the

full to their respective employees all material  wages, salaries,
commissions, bonuses and other direct compensation for all  services
performed by them, other than amounts that have not yet become payable  in
accordance with the Company's or any such Subsidiary's customary practices 
and (ii) none of the Company and its Subsidiaries are liable for any
material  severance pay or other payments on account of termination of any
former  employee, nor have the Company or any of its Subsidiaries received
notice of  any  claim with respect thereto. To the Company's Knowledge
neither the Company nor  any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in any unfair
labor practice. There are  no  unfair labor practice complaints against the

threat thereof, by or with respect to any employee of the Company or any of 
its  Subsidiaries **, ** except  where such dispute, strike, work stoppage
or lockout, individually and in the  aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  The Company and its Subsidiaries
have not experienced any labor dispute, or  any  strike, work stoppage or
lockout. Each individual who is classified by the  Company or any Subsidiary
as an "employee" or as an "independent contractor" is  properly so classified
for tax purposes, except where the effect of any improper  classification
would not, individually or in the aggregate, be reasonably  expected to cause
material loss or damage to the Company or its  Subsidiaries.

 

 

(l) _Environmental  Matters_.

 

 

(i) Each  of  the Company and its Subsidiaries possesses all Environmental
Permits (as defined  below) necessary to conduct their respective businesses

such Environmental  Permits, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected  to  have a Material Adverse Effect.

 

 

(ii) Each  of  the Company and its Subsidiaries is and has been in
compliance with all  Environmental Laws (as defined below) and all
Environmental Permits, except  where the failure to be in such compliance,

Material Adverse Effect. 

 

 

(iii) There  are  no Environmental Claims (as defined below) pending or, to
the Knowledge of  the  Company, threatened (A) against the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or (B)  against any Person whose liability for any such

(m) _ERISA  Compliance_. 

 

 

(i) Section  3.01(m)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule contains a true
and complete  list  of all "employee welfare benefit plans" (as defined in
Section 3(1) of the  Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as
amended "ERISA")), "employee  pension benefit plans" (as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA) ("Company Pension  Plans") and all other Company Benefit Plans
currently maintained or contributed  to or required to be currently
maintained or contributed to by the Company  or  any of its Subsidiaries or
any Person or entity that, together with the Company  or any of its
Subsidiaries, is treated as a single employer (a "Commonly  Controlled
Entity") under Section 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code, for the  benefit
of any current or former directors, officers, employees, or consultants  of
the Company or any of

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

22  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

its  Subsidiaries. Section 3.01(m)(i) of the Company Disclosure Schedule
separately  sets forth a complete list of all Company Benefit Plans which
will be  transferred pursuant to the sale of the MBO Business. The Company
has provided  to Parent true, correct and complete copies of (1) each Company
Benefit Plan  (or, in the case of any unwritten Company Benefit Plans,
descriptions thereof),  (2) the most recent Annual Report on Form 5500 filed
with the Department of  Labor with respect to each Company Benefit Plan (if
any such report was  required), (3) the most recent summary plan description
or similar document  for  each Company Benefit Plan for which such summary
plan description is required  or  was otherwise provided to plan
participants or beneficiaries, (4) each trust  agreement and insurance
annuity contract relating to any Company Benefit Plan  and (5) each third
party vendor agreement relating to a Company Benefit Plan.  Each Company
Benefit Plan has been administered in all material respects in  accordance
with its terms, and the Company and its Subsidiaries and all the  Company
Benefit Plans are in compliance in all material respects with all  applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code and all other Applicable  Laws.

 

 

(ii) Except  for matters that would not, individually or in the aggregate,
materially and  adversely affect any Company Pension Plan, each Company
Pension Plan which  is  intended to qualify under Code Section 401(a) has
been issued a favorable  determination letter by the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS") and has not been  amended in a manner, and no event has occurred
since the date of such  determination, which would cause any such plan to
fail to remain so qualified.  There is no material pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened  litigation relating to the Company
Benefit Plans. With respect to the Company  Benefit Plans, individually and
in the aggregate, no event has occurred and,  to  the Company's Knowledge,
there exists no condition or set of circumstances,  including claims (other
than routine claims for benefits), audits and  investigations, in connection
with which Company or any of its subsidiaries  could be subject to any
liability under ERISA, the Code or any other Applicable  Law, that would have
or reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect. The Company has
provided the Parent true and complete favorable  determination letters issued
by the IRS with respect to each Company Pension  Plan to the extent
applicable.

 

 

(iii) None  of  the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any entity that is
considered one  employer with the Company under Section 4001 of ERISA or
Section 414 of the  Code  contributes or has during the past six years ever
contributed or been obligated  to contribute to any "multiemployer plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(37) of  ERISA or to any defined benefit
pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA or  to  Part 3 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA. No Company Pension Plan had, as of  the  respective last
annual valuation date for each such Company Pension Plan, any  "unfunded
benefit liabilities" (as such term is defined in Section 4001(a)(18)  of
ERISA), based on actuarial assumptions that have been furnished to Parent, 
and there has been no material adverse change in the financial condition of 
any  Company Pension Plan since its last such annual valuation date other
than those  attributable to general economic conditions affecting the market
value of its  investments. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company, any of its  Subsidiaries, nor any officer of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or  any  of the Company Benefit Plans which are subject to
ERISA, including the Company  Pension Plans, any trusts created thereunder or
any trustee or administrator  or,  to the Knowledge of the Company, other
fiduciary thereof, has engaged in a  non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (as
such term is defined in Section 406 of  ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code) or
any other breach of fiduciary  responsibility that could subject the Company,
any

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

23  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Subsidiaries  of the Company or any officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to  the  tax or penalty on prohibited transactions imposed by
such Section 4975 or to  any  liability under Section 502(i) or 502(l) of
ERISA, except with respect to  Company Benefit Plans that are not tax-
qualified retirement plans, and only  with  respect to such plans, where
such tax or penalty, individually or in the  aggregate, would not reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.  Except as set forth in
Section 3.01(m) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,  none  of the Company
Benefit Plans that are tax-qualified Pension Plans or trusts  has  been
terminated in the last six years, nor to the Company's Knowledge has there 
been any "reportable event" (as that term is defined in Section 4043 of
ERISA)  for which the thirty (30) day reporting requirement has not been
waived with  respect to any tax-qualified Company Pension Plan during the
last five years,  and no notice of a reportable event will be required to be
filed in connection  with the Transactions. All contributions and premiums
required to be made by  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries under the
terms of any Company Benefit Plan  as of the date hereof have been timely
made or have been reflected on the most  recent consolidated balance sheet
filed or incorporated by reference in the  Filed SEC Documents. Neither any
Company Pension Plan nor any single-employer  plan of a Commonly Controlled
Entity has an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as  such term is defined in
Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code),  whether or not waived.

 

 

(iv) With  respect to any Company Benefit Plan that is an employee welfare
benefit plan  within the meaning of Section 3(1) of ERISA, (i) each such
Company Benefit  Plan  is either unfunded or funded through insurance, and
no such Company Benefit  Plan  is funded through a trust (as such term is
defined in Sections 501(c)(9) and  501(c)(17) of the Code), (ii) no benefits
under any Company Benefit Plan are  provided through a multiple employer
welfare arrangement within the meaning  of  ERISA Section 3(40), and (iii)
each such Company Benefit Plan that is a "group  health plan" (as such term
is defined in Section 5000(b)(1) of the Code),  complies with the applicable
requirements of Section 4980B(f) of the Code except  where the effect of any
noncompliance would not, individually or in the  aggregate, be reasonably
expected to cause material loss or damage to the  Company or any of its
Subsidiaries. Neither the Company nor any of its  Subsidiaries has any
obligations for retiree health and life benefits under  any  Company Benefit
Plan or Company Benefit Agreement, except for health  continuation benefits
required by Section 4980B of the Code.

 

 

(v) Except  as  set forth in Section 3.01(m)(v) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, neither  the  consummation of the Offer nor the Merger nor any
other transaction contemplated  by this Agreement will (x) entitle any
employee, officer or director, consultant  or independent contractor of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to severance  pay, (y) accelerate the time
of payment or vesting or trigger any payment or  funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of compensation or benefits  under, increase the amount
payable or trigger any other material obligation  pursuant to, any of the
Company Benefit Plans or Company Benefit Agreements  other than pursuant to
the provisions of Section 5.04 hereof, or (z) result  in  any breach or
violation of, or a default under, any of the Company Benefit  Plans  or
Company Benefit Agreements.

 

 

(vi) Any  amount that could be received (whether in cash or property or the
vesting of  property) as a result of the Offer, the Merger or any other
transaction  contemplated by this Agreement (including as a result of
termination of  employment on or following the

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

24  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Effective  Time) by any employee, officer or director of the Company or any
of its  Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (as such term is
defined in  Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G 1) under any Company Benefit
Plan or Company  Benefit Agreement or otherwise would not be characterized as
an "excess  parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code), and no  disqualified individual is entitled to receive any additional
payment from  the  Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any other Person in
the event that the  excise tax under Section 4999 of the Code is imposed on
such disqualified  individual. The Company has separately delivered to Parent
(i) the estimated  maximum amount that could be paid to each Company
executive listed on such  schedules as a result of the Merger and the other
transactions under all Company  Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements
and (ii) the "base amount" (as  defined in Section 280G(b)(3) of the Code)
for each disqualified individual  calculated as of the date of this
Agreement.

 

 

(vii) The  deduction of any amount payable pursuant to the terms of any
contract, the  Company Benefit Plans or any other employment contract,
employment understanding  or employment arrangement (including by reason of
the transactions contemplated  hereby) will not be subject to disallowance
under either Section 162(m) or  Section 404 of the Code.

 

 

(viii) All  contributions (including all employer contributions and employee
salary  reduction contributions) or premiums or other payments by the Company
or its  Subsidiaries with respect to any Company Benefit Plan for any period
ending  on  or before Closing that are due have been timely made and
substantially all  contributions or premiums or other payments that are not
yet due have been  made  or accrued in accordance with the past custom and
practice of the Company or  its  Subsidiary, as appropriate.

 

 

(ix) The  Company, its Subsidiaries and entities which Section 4001 of ERISA
and Section  414 of the Code required that the Company treat as one employer,
have terminated  all "defined benefit plans" as Section 414(j) of the Code
defines that term. The  IRS has issued favorable determination letters on the
terminations of all such  defined benefit plans, and the Company has provided
to the Parent true and  complete copies of the IRS favorable determination
letters on such terminations.  The terminated defined benefit plans have
distributed all of their assets and  all Final Form 5500s for all such
defined benefit plans have been filed on  a  timely basis. The Company has
provided to the Parent true and correct copies  of  all such Final Form
5500s.

 

 

(x) Neither  the Offer nor the Merger will cause any Company Benefit Plan to
be in violation  of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

 

 

(xi) To  the  Knowledge of the Company, the Company has no material
liability for taxes  imposed by Sections 4971 through 4980G of the Code.

 

 

(n) _Taxes_.

 

 

(i) Each  of  the Company and its Subsidiaries has timely filed or will
timely file (taking  into account any extension of time within which to file)
all domestic and  foreign (whether national, federal, state, provincial,
local or otherwise)  tax  returns and reports

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

required  to be filed by it on or prior to the date hereof and the Closing
Date, and  all  such returns and reports are true and complete except to the
extent any such  failures to file or any such inaccuracies individually or in
the aggregate  would  not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect. Each of the  Company and its Subsidiaries has timely paid, or will
timely pay, all taxes  due  on or prior to the date hereof and the Closing
Date, with respect to the taxable  periods covered by such returns and
reports and all other taxes otherwise due  on  or prior to the date hereof
and the Closing Date, except to the extent any  such  failures to timely
pay, individually and in the aggregate, would not reasonably  be expected to
have a Material Adverse Effect, and the most recent financial  statements
contained in the Filed SEC Documents reflect an adequate provision  for all
current and deferred taxes payable by the Company and each of its 
Subsidiaries for all taxable periods and portions thereof through the date 
of  such financial statements except to the extent that failure to have
such  adequate provision would not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse  Effect.

 

 

(ii) No  material domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state,
provincial,  local or otherwise) income or franchise tax return or report or
any other  material tax return or report of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is  under  audit or examination by any taxing authority, and no
written notice of such  an  audit or examination has been received by the
Company or any of its  Subsidiaries. No taxing authority is now asserting or,
to the Company's  Knowledge, threatening to assert any deficiency, proposed
adjustment or matter  in controversy with respect to any taxes due and owing
by the Company or any  of  its Subsidiaries, except to the extent any such
deficiencies, individually  or in  the aggregate, would not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect. Each tax deficiency resulting
from any completed audit or examination  by  any taxing authority or any
concluded litigation and that is currently due  and  payable has been timely
paid. All federal income tax returns (whether separate,  combined or
consolidated) of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries have  been  closed
by virtue of the expiration of the relevant statute of limitations for  all
years through 2002. The Company has provided Parent with copies of original 
and amended Federal income tax returns and material state income tax returns 
for  all years after 2002.

 

 

(iii) There  is  no currently effective agreement or other document
extending, or having the  effect of extending, the period of assessment or
collection of any material  taxes and no power of attorney with respect to
any material taxes has been  executed or filed with any taxing authority.

 

 

(iv) No  Liens  for taxes exist with respect to any assets or properties of
the Company or  any  of its Subsidiaries, except for statutory Liens for
taxes not yet due, Liens  for  taxes that are not material, and Liens for
taxes that the Company or any of  its  Subsidiaries is contesting in good
faith through appropriate proceedings and  for  which adequate reserves have
been established.

 

 

 

(v) None  of  the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party to or bound
by any tax  sharing  agreement, tax indemnity obligation or similar
agreement, arrangement or  practice with respect to taxes, other than
agreements between Company and  its  wholly-owned Subsidiaries.

or otherwise.

distribution of stock qualifying  for tax-free treatment under Section 355(e)
of the Code (A) in the two years  prior to the date of this Agreement or (B)
in a distribution that could  otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or
"series of related transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e) of the
Code) in conjunction with the  Merger.

 

 

(ix) No  written notice of a claim or pending investigation has been received
or, to  the  Knowledge of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, has been
threatened by  any  domestic or foreign (whether national, federal, state,
provincial or otherwise)  jurisdiction with which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries does not  currently file tax returns, alleging that the Company
or such Subsidiary has  a  duty to file tax returns and pay taxes or is
otherwise subject to the taxing  authority of such jurisdiction, except in

reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse  Effect.

proceeding or audit  (collectively, " _Actions_ ")  pending against or with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in  respect of any tax and
not settle or compromise any such Action without Parent's  consent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or  conditioned),
_provided_   that  Parent's consent shall not be required if the amount of

amount specifically  reserved by the Company in respect of such Action in the
books and records  and  financial statements of the Company or any of its

counsel to the Company (after  consultation with outside counsel to Parent)
determines should not be exchanged  because of the competitive sensitivity of

Section  4.02. _No  Solicitation_.

 

 

(a) From  the  date of this Agreement until the earlier of the Effective
Time or the  termination hereof, the Company shall not, nor shall it permit
any of its  Subsidiaries to, nor shall it authorize or permit any director,
officer or  employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any
investment banker,  attorney, accountant or other advisor or representative
of the Company or any  of  its Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly  encourage, or take any other action intended
or designed to facilitate, any  Takeover Proposal (as defined below); or (ii)
enter into, continue or otherwise  participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any  Person any non-public information
with respect to, any Takeover Proposal;  _provided_   that at  any time
prior to the time at which the Sub accepts shares of Company Common  Stock
for payment and pays for such shares pursuant to and subject to the 
conditions of the Offer (the " _Acceptance  Date_ "),  the  Board of
Directors of the Company may, subject to compliance with Sections  4.02(c)
and (d) of this Agreement, in response to a Superior Proposal (as  defined
below) or a bona fide Takeover Proposal (the definition of which shall,  for
purposes of this sentence only, be amended such that all references to  20% 
shall be changed to 50.1%) that such Board of Directors determines in good 
faith  is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal (a " _Likely 
Superior Proposal_ "),  in  each case that was unsolicited (which term for
all purposes of this Agreement  shall mean unsolicited after the date of this
Agreement) and that did not  otherwise result from a breach of this Section
4.02, if such Board of Directors  determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside counsel) that its  fiduciary obligations require it
to do so, (x) furnish information with respect  to the Company and its
Subsidiaries to the Person making such Superior Proposal  or Likely Superior
Proposal (and its representatives) pursuant to a customary  confidentiality
agreement, which confidentiality agreement contains terms that  are
equivalent to, and in no respect less favorable to the Company than (but 
need not contain a standstill provision), the terms of the Confidentiality 
Agreement dated October 5, 2006, between Parent and the Company (as it may 
be  amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality  Agreement_ ")  and 
(y) participate in discussions or negotiations with the Person making such 
Superior Proposal or Likely Superior Proposal (and its representatives) 
regarding such Superior Proposal or Likely Superior Proposal.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior  Proposal_ " means  any
unsolicited offer made by a third party to consummate a tender offer, 
exchange offer, merger, asset acquisition, consolidation or similar
transaction  which would result in such third party (or its shareholders)

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

43  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

owning,  directly or indirectly, more than 50% of the shares of Company
Common Stock  then  outstanding (or of the surviving entity in a merger) or
all or substantially  all  of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries
and otherwise on terms which  the Board of Directors of the Company
determines in good faith (following  consultation with a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation)  to be  more favorable to the holders of
Company Common Stock than the Offer and the  Merger, taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement proposed  by Parent to the Company in
writing in response to such Superior Proposal or  otherwise.

 

 

For  purposes of this Agreement, " _Takeover  Proposal_ " means  any
inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person relating to any direct or 
indirect acquisition or purchase of 20% or more of the assets of the Company 
and  its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or 20% or more of any class or
series of  equity securities of the Company or 20% or more of any class or
series of equity  securities of any of its Subsidiaries representing in
excess of 20% of the  voting power or equity represented by all the Company's
outstanding capital  stock, any tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result  in  any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of
any class or series of equity  securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any merger,  consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution  or similar transaction involving
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other  than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, except that a Takeover  Proposal shall not
include an inquiry, proposal or offer relating solely to  the  MBO Business.

 

 

(b) Except  as  set forth below, neither the Board of Directors of the
Company nor any committee  thereof shall (i) withdraw (or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent or Sub)  or  publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a
manner adverse to Parent or Sub)  the approval or recommendation by such
Board of Directors or any such committee  of this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger, (ii) adopt, approve or recommend,  or  publicly propose to adopt,
approve or recommend, any Takeover Proposal, (iii)  cause or permit the
Company to enter into any letter of intent, memorandum  of  understanding,
agreement in principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement,  option
agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or other  agreement
(each, an " _Acquisition  Agreement_ ")  constituting or related to, or
which is intended to or is reasonably likely  to  lead to, any Takeover
Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement referred  to in Section
4.02(a) entered into under the circumstances referred to in such  Section
4.02(a)) or (iv) agree or resolve to take any of the actions set forth  in
clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) of this sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing 
and anything else in this Agreement to the contrary: (i) if, the Board of 
Directors of the Company determines in good faith, after consultation with 
outside counsel, that it is necessary to do so in order to comply with its 
fiduciary obligations, the Board of Directors of the Company may, prior to 
the  Acceptance Date, withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation of
the Offer,  the Merger and this Agreement; and (ii) the Board of Directors of
the Company  may, prior to the Acceptance Date, in response to a Superior
Proposal that  was  unsolicited and that did not otherwise result from a
breach of Section 4.02(a)  of this Agreement, terminate this Agreement (and
concurrently with or after  such  termination cause the Company to enter
into any Acquisition Agreement with  respect to any Superior Proposal), but
only after the fourth (4th) Business  Day  following Parent's receipt of
written notice advising Parent that the Board of  Directors of the Company is
prepared to accept a Superior Proposal,  specifying

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

44  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

the  material terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal and identifying
the  Person making such Superior Proposal.

 

 

(c) In  addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in paragraphs
(a) and  (b)  of this Section 4.02, the Company shall promptly (and in no
event later than  forty-eight (48) hours) advise Parent orally and in writing
of any request  for  information that the Company reasonably believes could
lead to a Takeover  Proposal, any receipt of a Takeover Proposal, or any
inquiry the Company  reasonably believes could lead to any Takeover Proposal,
the written and any  material terms and conditions of such request, Takeover
Proposal or inquiry  (including any subsequent amendment or other
modification to such terms and  conditions) and the identity of the Person
making any such request, Takeover  Proposal or inquiry. The Company shall
promptly keep Parent informed in all  material respects of the status and
details (including amendments or proposed  amendments) of any such request,
Takeover Proposal or inquiry and shall provide  to Parent all documentation
and material information provided to any Person  who  has made a Superior
Proposal or Likely Superior Proposal, which has not  previously been provided
to Parent. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary  herein, the Company
shall not be obligated to provide information to Parent  or  Sub in
violation of any confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance  with
Section 4.02(a) hereof.

 

 

(d) Nothing  contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit  the  Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position  contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the
Exchange Act, or (ii) making  any disclosure to the Company's stockholders
if, in the good faith judgment of  the Board of Directors of the Company,
after consultation with outside counsel,  failure so to disclose would be
inconsistent with Applicable Law; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that,  subject
to Section 4.02(b), in no event shall the Board of Directors of the  Company
or any committee thereof withdraw or modify (in a manner adverse to  Parent
and Sub), or propose to withdraw or modify (in a manner adverse to Parent 
and Sub), its position with respect to this Agreement, the Offer or the
Merger,  or adopt, approve or recommend, or propose to adopt, approve or
recommend,  any  Takeover Proposal.

 

 

(e) Notwithstanding  the provisions of this Section 4.02, the Company shall
not be prohibited or  otherwise limited in any way from soliciting,
initiating, encouraging,  facilitating, or responding to any offer or
indication of interest with respect  to a purchase of the MBO Business. The
parties expressly agree that the Company  may enter into an agreement for the
sale of the MBO Business pursuant to an  agreement other than the MBO
Agreement provided that Parent has approved the  terms and conditions in
writing. Parent agrees that it shall not withhold  consent to such an
agreement, provided the representations and warranties  therein do not
survive the closing and the Company has no post-closing indemnity 
obligations. Parent also agrees it will not unreasonably withhold consent to 
such an agreement that contains post-closing indemnity obligations provided 
that  such agreement provides that an amount equal to the Company's maximum 
post-closing contingent obligations thereunder, including indemnity
obligations  and defense costs, will be held in escrow until satisfaction or
expiration  of  any and all such post-closing obligations.

(f) If  the  Company agrees to sell the MBO Business pursuant to an
agreement other than  the  MBO Agreement, Parent and Sub also agree to
increase the Offer consideration  by  61.7% of the amount, if any, on a per
share basis, by which the consideration  received by the Company for the MBO
Business, net of any escrow established  to  satisfy post-closing indemnity
obligations pursuant to Section 4.02(g), exceeds  the amount set forth in the
MBO Agreement.

 

 

(g) In  the  event that an escrow is established as described in the last
sentence of 4.02(e)  above, Parent agrees that it shall, upon satisfaction or
expiration of any  and  all post-closing obligations, pay, on a pro rata
basis and net of transaction  costs, any amount not required to satisfy the
Company's post-closing obligations  to the stockholders of the Company who
tender shares in the Offer, whose shares  are cashed out in the Merger, and
to the holders of in the money Company Stock  Options whose options are
cashed out in the Merger.

_ADDITIONAL  AGREEMENTS_

 

 

Section  5.01. _Preparation  of the Proxy Statement; Company Stockholders
Meeting_.

 

 

(a) If  the  Company Stockholder Approval is required by law in order to
complete the Merger,  the Company and Parent shall, as promptly as
practicable following the  Acceptance Date, prepare and file with the SEC the
Proxy Statement and the  Company shall use its commercially reasonable
efforts to respond as promptly  as  practicable to any comments of the SEC
with respect thereto and to cause the  Proxy Statement to be mailed to the
Company's stockholders as promptly as  practicable following the Acceptance
Date. The Company shall promptly notify  Parent upon the receipt of any
comments from the SEC or its staff or any request  from the SEC or its staff
for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement  and shall provide
Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company  and its
representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC and its staff, on the  other
hand. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Proxy 
Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any
comments  of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide
Parent an  opportunity to review and comment on such document or response,
(ii) shall  include in such document or response all comments reasonably
proposed by Parent,  and (iii) shall not file or mail such document or
respond to the SEC prior  to  receiving Parent's approval, which approval
shall not be unreasonably withheld,  delayed or conditioned.

 

 

(b) If  Company Stockholder Approval is required by law in order to complete
the Merger,  and this Agreement shall not have been terminated, the Company
shall, as  promptly as practicable following the Acceptance Date, establish a
record date  (which will be as promptly as reasonably practicable following
the Acceptance  Date) for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of its  stockholders (the " _Company  Stockholders Meeting_ ") 
for  the purpose of obtaining the Company Stockholder Approval. The Company
shall,  through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders that
they adopt  this Agreement, and shall include such

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

46  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

recommendation  in the Proxy Statement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the  Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this
Section 5.01(b) (except  for  the obligations imposed by the preceding
sentence) shall not be affected by  (i)  the commencement, public proposal,
public disclosure or communication to the  Company or any other Person of any
Takeover Proposal, or (ii) the withdrawal  or  modification prior to the
Acceptance Date, by the Board of Directors of the  Company or any committee
thereof, of such Board's or committee's approval or  recommendation of the
Offer, the Merger or this Agreement (unless the Agreement  shall have been
terminated by Parent, Sub or the Company). Once the Company  Stockholders
Meeting has been called and noticed, the Company shall not postpone  or
adjourn (other than for the absence of a quorum and then only to the next 
possible future date) the Company Stockholders Meeting without the written 
consent of a majority of the Independent Directors. Notwithstanding the 
foregoing, if Sub or any other Subsidiary of Parent shall acquire at least 
90%  of the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, the parties shall
take all  necessary and appropriate action to cause the Merger to become
effective as  soon  as practicable after the expiration of the Offer in
accordance with Section  253  of the DGCL.

 

 

(c) Parent  agrees to cause all shares of Company Common Stock purchased
pursuant to the  Offer and all other shares of Company Common Stock owned by
Parent and any  Subsidiary or Affiliate of Parent to be voted in favor of
adoption of this  Agreement, if a stockholder vote is required by Applicable
Law in order to  complete the Merger.

 

 

Section  5.02. _Access  to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

 

Subject  to Section 4.01(d), the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries  to, use commercially reasonable efforts to afford to Parent,
and to Parent's  officers, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other  advisors and representatives, reasonable and prompt
access during normal  business hours during the period prior to the earliest
to occur of the Control  Date, the Effective Time or the termination of this
Agreement to all their  respective properties, assets, books, contracts,
commitments, directors,  officers, employees, attorneys, accountants,
auditors, other advisors and  representatives and records and, during such
period, the Company shall, and  shall cause each of its Subsidiaries to, make
available to Parent on a prompt  basis (i) a copy of each report, schedule,
form, statement and other document  filed or received by it during such
period pursuant to the requirements of  domestic or foreign (whether
national, federal, state, provincial, local or  otherwise) laws, and (ii) all
other information concerning its business,  properties and personnel in the
Company's custody and control, in the case of  (i) and (ii) as Parent may
reasonably request (including the work papers of  Ernst and Young LLP, provided
that Ernst and Young LLP consents to furnish  such workpapers). If any material
is withheld from Parent pursuant to the  provisions of the preceding
sentence, the Company shall inform Parent as to  what, to Company's
Knowledge, is being withheld. **** Except  as  required by law, Parent will
hold, and will direct its officers, employees,  investment bankers,
attorneys, accountants and other advisors and  representatives to hold, any
and all information received from the Company,  directly or indirectly, in
confidence in accordance with the Confidentiality  Agreement.

Section  5.03. _Commercially  Reasonable Efforts; Notification_.

 

 

(a) Upon  the  terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this
Agreement, including  Section 4.02, each of the parties agrees to use, to the
fullest extent permitted  by Applicable Law, all commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to  be  taken, all actions, that are necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and  make effective the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated  by  this Agreement and the Tender
Agreements, including using all commercially  reasonable efforts to
accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all  commercially reasonable acts
necessary to cause the conditions to the Offer  and  the Merger to be
satisfied, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or  nonactions,
waivers, consents, approvals, orders and authorizations from  Governmental
Entities and the making of all necessary registrations,  declarations and
filings, and (iii) the obtaining of all necessary consents,  approvals or
waivers from third parties. In connection with and without limiting  the
foregoing and subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the 
Company and its Board of Directors shall, if any state takeover statute or 
similar statute or regulation is or becomes applicable to this Agreement,
the  Tender Agreements, the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions  contemplated hereby or thereby, use its commercially reasonable
efforts to  ensure that the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions by
the Company  contemplated by this Agreement may be consummated as promptly as
practicable  on  the terms contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise to
minimize the effect  of  such statute or regulation on this Agreement, the
Tender Agreements, the Offer,  the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby. The  Company and Parent will provide such
assistance, information and cooperation  to  each other as is reasonably
required to obtain any such waivers, consents,  approvals, orders and
authorizations and, in connection therewith, will notify  the other Person
promptly following the receipt of any comments from any  Governmental Entity
and of any request by any Governmental Entity for  amendments, supplements or
additional information in respect of any  registration, declaration or filing
with such Governmental Entity and will  supply the other Person with copies
of all correspondence between such Person  or  any of its representatives,
on the one hand, and any Governmental Entity, on  the  other hand.

 

 

(b) The  Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt
notice to  Parent after acquiring Knowledge of, (i) any representation or
warranty made  by  it contained in this Agreement becoming, or determined to
have been, untrue  or  inaccurate, or (ii) the failure by it to comply with
or satisfy any covenant,  condition or agreement to be complied with or
satisfied by it under this  Agreement such that the conditions in paragraph
(d) or (e) of Exhibit A would  not be satisfied; _provided_   that no  such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants or 
agreements of the parties or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties  under this Agreement.

 

 

(c) Parent  shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give prompt notice
to the Company  after acquiring Knowledge of, (i) any representation or
warranty made by it  or  Sub contained in this Agreement becoming, or
determined to have been, untrue  or  inaccurate, (ii) the failure by it to
comply with or satisfy any covenant,  condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this  Agreement, or

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

48  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(iii)  the  existence of any fact or circumstance which makes it
significantly unlikely  that  Parent will be able to satisfy its
representation and warranty in Section  3.02(d) at the Closing Date;
_provided_   that no  such notification shall affect the representations,
warranties, covenants or  agreements of the parties or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties  under this Agreement.

 

 

(d) The  Company shall give prompt notice to Parent regarding any
developments in the  sale of the MBO Business, including, but not limited to,
(i) any proposed  amendment to the MBO Agreement or (ii) any bona fide offer
to purchase the  MBO  Business other than pursuant to the MBO Agreement.

 

 

Section  5.04. _Company  Stock Options_.  As soon  as practicable
following the date of this Agreement, the Company Board of  Directors (or, if
appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock  Plans) shall take
or cause to be taken such actions consistent with the Company  Stock Plans
and Applicable Law as are required to cause (x) the Company Stock  Plans to
terminate as of the Effective Time and (y) the provisions in any other 
Company Benefit Plan providing for the issuance, transfer or grant of any 
capital stock of the Company or any interest in respect of any capital stock 
of  the Company to be deleted as of the Effective Time. Subject to the
provisions  of  Section 2.03, the Company shall take such actions as
necessary to ensure that  following the Effective Time no holder of a Company
Stock Option or any  participant in any Company Stock Plan or other Company
Benefit Plan shall have  any right thereunder to acquire any capital stock of
the Company or the  Surviving Corporation.

 

 

Section  5.05. _Indemnification,  Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

 

(a) From  and  after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
indemnify, defend  and  hold harmless, and Parent shall itself indemnify,
defend and hold harmless  (jointly and severally with the Surviving
Corporation), in each case, to the  fullest extent permitted by Applicable
Law, the present and former officers,  directors, employees and employee
benefit plan fiduciaries (each an "Indemnified  Party") of the Company and
its Subsidiaries against all judgments, losses,  claims, damages, fines,
penalties and liabilities in respect of acts or  omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time (including acts or  omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement, the MBO Agreement and  the  transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby), including amounts paid in  settlement or
compromise with the approval of Parent (which approval shall  not  be
unreasonably withheld, delayed or, conditioned) ("Indemnified Amounts") if 
such Indemnified Amounts result from actions brought by reason of the fact 
that  such Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of the
Company  or is or was serving at the request of the Company as a director,
officer,  partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, employee, agent or similar
functionary  of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, sole
proprietorship, trust,  nonprofit entity, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, whether arising  prior to or after the Effective Time. Parent and
Sub agree that all rights  to  exculpation, advancement of expenses and
indemnification for acts or omissions  occurring prior to the Effective Time
now existing in favor of the Indemnified  Parties as provided in the DGCL,
the Certificates of Incorporation or the Bylaws  of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, in each case in effect as of the date  hereof, shall survive
the Merger and shall continue in full force and effect 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

49  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

in  accordance with their terms and without amendment thereof. Without
limiting  the  generality of the preceding sentence, in the event that any
Indemnified Party  becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit,
claim, proceeding  or  investigation covered by this Section 5.05 after the
Effective Time, Parent  shall, and the Surviving Corporation shall (jointly
and severally), to the  fullest extent permitted by law, promptly advance to
such Indemnified Party  his  or her legal or other expenses (including the
cost of any investigation and  preparation incurred in connection therewith),
subject to the providing by  such  Indemnified Party of an undertaking to
reimburse all amounts so advanced in  the  event of a non-appealable
determination of a court of competent jurisdiction  that such Indemnified
Party is not entitled thereto. For at least six years  after the Effective
Time, Parent and the Surviving Corporation will jointly  and  severally,
without any lapse in coverage, provide officers\' and directors\'  liability
insurance in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the  Effective
Time covering each such Person currently covered by the Company\'s 
officers\' and directors\' liability insurance policy (each an "Insured
Party")  on  terms with respect to coverage and amount no less favorable in
any material  respect than those of such policy in effect on the date hereof;
provided, that  the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated to expend
annual premiums  for  such insurance during such period in excess of 200%
**** of  the  per annum rate of the aggregate annual premium currently paid
by the Company  for  such insurance on the date of this Agreement; provided
that if the annual  premium for such insurance shall exceed such **** 200% 
in  any year, the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy
with  the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding such  amount.

 

 

(b) The  provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit
of, and  will  be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party and Insured Party,
his or her heirs  and his or her representatives.

 

 

Section  5.06. _Fees  and Expenses_.

 

 

(a) Except  as  set forth in Sections 5.06(c), (d) and (e), all fees and
expenses incurred  in  connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by
the party incurring such fees  or  expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated.

 

 

(b) In  the  event that (i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made
known to the Company  or has been made directly to its stockholders or any
Person has announced an  intention (whether or not conditional and whether or
not withdrawn) to make  a  Takeover Proposal, (B) thereafter this Agreement
is terminated by either Parent  or the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i), and (C) within six (6) months  after such termination, the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries enters into  any  Acquisition Agreement
with respect to, or consummates, any Takeover Proposal  (the definition of
which in Section 4.02(a) shall, for the purposes of this  Section
5.06(b)(i)(C) only, be amended such that all references to 20% shall  be 
changed to 30%), or (ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to 
Section 7.01(c) or by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(e), then the
Company  shall pay Parent as its sole remedy a fee equal to $8.0 million
(the " _Termination  Fee_ ")  by  wire transfer of same day funds to an

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

50  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

account  designated by Parent (x) in the case of a termination by Parent
pursuant to  Section 7.01(c), within two (2) Business Days after such
termination, (y) in  the  case of a termination by the Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(e), within one  (1)  Business Day of the date of such
termination, or (z) in the case of a payment  as  a result of more than one
event referred to in Section 5.06(b)(i)(C), upon  the  first to occur of
such events. The Company acknowledges that the agreements  contained in this
Section 5.06(b) are an integral part of the transactions  contemplated by
this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, Parent  would  not enter
into this Agreement; accordingly, if the Company fails promptly to  pay  the
amounts due pursuant to this Section 5.06(b), and, in order to obtain such 
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company  for the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06(b), the Company shall
pay to  Parent interest on the amounts set forth in this Section 5.06 at the
prime  rate  of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was
required to be  made.

 

 

(c) The  Company shall reimburse Parent and Sub for all their expenses
incurred in  connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement in the event that (i) the
Termination Fee is  not  payable and (ii) this Agreement is terminated by
Parent pursuant to Section  7.01(d) and Parent is not in breach of its
representations, warranties and  covenants under this Agreement; _provided_
  that the  aggregate amount of such reimbursement shall not exceed $1.5
million . All  payments made pursuant to this Section 5.06(c) shall be made
by wire transfer  of  same day funds to an account designated by Parent
within 2 Business Days of  such  termination.

 

 

(d) In  the  event that this Agreement is terminated by Company pursuant to
Section 7.01(f)  solely as a result of a breach of Section 3.02 (d), then
Parent shall pay  Company, as its sole remedy, a fee equal to the Termination
Fee by wire transfer  of same day funds to an account designated by Company.
In addition, Parent  shall  reimburse the Company for all expenses incurred
in connection with this  Agreement, the Offer, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by  this  Agreement in the event that this
Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant  to Section 7.01(f)
(including as a result of a breach of Section 3.02(d));  _provided_   that
the  aggregate amount of such reimbursement shall not exceed $1.5 million.
All  payments made pursuant to this Section 5.06(d) shall be made within two
Business  Days of such termination by the Company by wire transfer of same
day funds  to an  account designated by the Company.

 

 

(e) Parent  and Company shall each pay one-half of any filing fees required
in connection  with the HSR filing required under the HSR Act.

 

 

Section  5.07. _Information  Supplied_.

 

 

(a) The  Company agrees that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by the  Company specifically for inclusion or incorporation by
reference in (i) the  Offer Documents or the Schedule 14D-9 or Schedule 13E-3
or any information  statement to be filed by the Company in connection with
the Offer pursuant  to  Rule 14f-1 under the Exchange Act (the "
_Information  Statement_ ")  will  (except to the extent

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

51  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

revised  or superseded by amendments or supplements contemplated hereby), at
the time  it  is filed with the SEC or first published, sent or given to the
Company's  stockholders, or at the time of any amendment or supplement
thereof, or (ii)  the  Proxy Statement will, at the date it is filed with
the SEC or mailed to the  Company's stockholders, at the time of the Company
Stockholders Meeting or at  the time of any amendment or supplement thereof,
contain any untrue statement  of  a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein  or necessary in order to make
the statements therein, in light of the  circumstances under which they are
made, not misleading, except that no covenant  is made by the Company with
respect to statements made in the Offer Documents,  the Schedule 14D-9 or
Schedule 13E-3, the Information Statement or the Proxy  Statement based on
information supplied by Parent or Sub or information relating  to C-W Co. and
its members supplied by C-W Co. or its members, in each case,  specifically
for inclusion or incorporation by reference therein. The Offer  Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9, the Schedule 13E-3, the Information Statement  and 
Proxy Statement will comply as to form in all material respects with the 
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated 
thereunder.

 

 

(b) Parent  and Sub agree that none of the information supplied or to be
supplied by Parent  or Sub specifically for inclusion in the Offer Documents,
the Schedule 14D-9,  the Information Statement or the Proxy Statement will
(except to the extent  revised or superseded by amendments or supplements
contemplated hereby), at  the  date (i) the Offer Documents or the
Information Statement is filed with the  SEC  or first published, sent or
given to the Company's stockholders or at the time  of any amendment or
supplement thereof, or (ii) the Proxy Statement is filed  with the SEC or
mailed to the Company's stockholders or at the time of the  Company
Stockholders Meeting, in each case, contain any untrue statement of  a 
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein  or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of
the  circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.

 

 

(c) The  parties agree to treat the transactions contemplated hereby as a
transaction  subject to Rule 13e-3 under the Exchange Act solely for purposes
of disclosure  requirements under the Exchange Act. Neither Parent nor Sub,
however, believes  that either of them or any of their affiliates is a person
that, directly or  indirectly, through one or more intermediaries, controls,
is controlled by,  or  is under common control, with the Company. For
purposes of this paragraph,  the  term "control" means the possession,
directly or indirectly, of the power to  direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of the Company,  whether through the ownership of
voting securities, by contract, or  otherwise.

 

 

Section  5.08. _Benefits  Matters_. 

 

 

(a) During  the period commencing upon the Acceptance Date and ending on the
last day of  the  month during which the Acceptance Date occurs (the
"Continuation Period"),  except for those Company Benefit Plans set forth in
Section 5.08(a) of the  Company Disclosure Schedule, Parent shall cause the
Company (and after the  Effective Time the surviving corporation ) to
maintain, without adverse  amendment

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

52  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

except  as  required by law, the MBO Agreement or this Agreement, each of
the Company  Benefit Plans and Company Benefit Agreements (excluding any
equity-based  compensation plans or annual incentive compensation plans but
including, without  limitation, any Company Benefit Plan that is a severance
plan or which provides  welfare benefits to former employees), and shall
permit the current and former  employees, directors and officers of the
Company and its Subsidiaries who  participate in such plans immediately prior
to the Acceptance Date to continue  such participation during the
Continuation Period (subject to the terms of  the  applicable Company
Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement).

 

 

(b) With  respect to welfare or pension benefits provided to Company
Employees following  the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide that, (i)
service credited to  Company Employees with respect to employment with the
Company or its  Subsidiaries (or predecessors) prior to the Acceptance Date
shall be recognized  for purposes of eligibility to participate in the
applicable plans and vesting  of benefits (but not for benefit accrual) under
such plans and under vacation  or  other paid-time off programs or policies
to the extent such service was  recognized by the Company as of such date and
(ii) all pre-existing condition  limitations and eligibility waiting periods
under any group health plan shall  be  waived with respect to such Company
Employees and their eligible dependents  who  were participants in
comparable Company Benefit Plans prior to the end of the  Continuation
Period; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 5.08(b)  shall
require the payment of duplicative benefits. For purposes of this Section 
5.08(b) "Company Employees" shall mean the employees of the Company and its 
Subsidiaries immediately following the closing of the sale of the MBO
Business. 

 

 

(c) As  of and  following the Acceptance Date, Parent shall cause the
Company (and after the  Effective Time the Surviving Corporation) to honor in
accordance with their  existing terms and without adverse amendment the
annual incentive bonus plans  of  the Company set forth in Section 5.08(d)
of the Company Disclosure Schedule  (the "Bonus Plans") with respect to the
Company's fiscal year ending December 31,  2006 and shall cause participants
in such Bonus Plans to be paid any amounts  due  under the Bonus Plans based
on the Company's performance during such fiscal year  determined without
regard to the effects of the transactions contemplated by  this Agreement
(including, without limitation, any transaction fees, write  downs  or other
costs incurred in connection with the negotiation, execution and 
consummation of this Agreement or the integration of the applicable
businesses  by Parent). Parent shall cause such bonuses to be determined and
paid in  accordance with the Company's past practice (including with respect
to  determination of the attainment of personal objective components under
the  Bonus  Plans); provided, however, that any involuntary, not-for-cause
termination  of  the employment of a participant in a Bonus Plan following
the Acceptance Date  shall be disregarded for purposes of determining
eligibility for the payment  of  an award under the applicable Bonus Plan.

 

 

(d) Prior  to  the Effective Time, (i) the Company shall take all necessary
actions to maintain  the qualified status of the Company's 401(k) Retirement
Plan with Section 401 of  the Code and (ii) the Board of Directors of Company
shall have adopted a  resolution freezing contributions to the Deferred
Compensation  Plan.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

53  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Section  5.09. _Public  Announcements_.  Parent  and Sub, on the one hand,
and the Company, on the other hand, shall, to the  extent reasonably
practicable, consult with each other before issuing, and  give  each other a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press  release or
other public statements with respect to this Agreement, the Offer,  the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The 
parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to
the  transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form
heretofore  agreed to by the parties.

 

 

Section  5.10. _Directors_.

 

 

(a) Promptly  upon the acceptance for payment of, and payment by Sub for, any
shares of  Company Common Stock representing in excess of the Minimum Tender
Condition  pursuant to the Offer, Sub shall be entitled to designate such
number of  directors on the Board of Directors of the Company as will give
Sub, subject  to  compliance with Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act,
representation on the Board  of Directors of the Company equal to at least
that number of directors, rounded  up to the next whole number, which is the
product of (a) the total number of  directors on the Board of Directors of
the Company (giving effect to the  directors elected pursuant to this
sentence) multiplied by (b) the percentage  that (i) such number of shares of
Company Common Stock so accepted for payment  and paid for by Sub plus the
number of shares of Company Common Stock otherwise  owned by Sub or any other
Subsidiary of Parent bears to (ii) the fully diluted  number of such shares
outstanding, and the Company shall, at such time, cause  Sub's designees to
be so elected; _provided_ ,  _however_ ,  that in  the event that Sub's
designees are appointed or elected to the Board of  Directors of the Company,
until the Effective Time the Board of Directors of  the  Company shall have
at least three directors, or such other number as may be  required by the
rules of the NYSE, who are Directors on the date of this  Agreement and who
are independent directors for purposes of the continued  listing requirements
of the NYSE (the " _Independent  Directors_ ");  and  _provided  further_
  that, in  such event, if the number of Independent Directors shall be
reduced below three  for any reason whatsoever, any remaining Independent
Directors (or Independent  Director, if there shall be only one remaining)
shall be entitled to designate  persons to fill such vacancies who shall be
deemed to be Independent Directors  for purposes of this Agreement (and
Parent and Sub shall cause such persons  to  be elected as such) or, if no
Independent Directors then remain, the other  directors shall designate three
persons, or such other number as may be required  by the rules of the NYSE,
to fill such vacancies who are not officers,  stockholders or Affiliates of
the Company, Parent or Sub (and Parent and Sub  shall cause such persons to
be elected as such), and such persons shall be  deemed to be Independent
Directors for purposes of this Agreement. Subject  to  Applicable Law, the

advising Parent that the Board of Directors of the Company is prepared  to 
accept a Superior Proposal;

 

 

(d) by  Parent  prior to the Acceptance Date if the Company shall have

or is incapable of being cured  by  the Company within thirty Business Days
after its receipt of written notice  thereof from Parent;

 

 

(e) prior  to  the Acceptance Date by the Company in accordance with Section

forth in this Agreement.

 

 

Section  7.03. _Amendment_.  This  Agreement may be amended by the parties

further  approval by stockholders without the further approval of such
stockholders.  This  Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in

required number of Independent  Directors and the affirmative vote of a

exercise or waive any of the Company's rights or  remedies under this
Agreement or (iii) extend the time for performance of Parent  and Sub's

efforts to prevent  the occurrence of, such action unless there shall be
Independent Directors  in  office and such action shall have received

are not Independent Directors. The Board of  Directors of the Company shall
not delegate any matter covered by the preceding  sentence of this Section
7.03 to any committee of the Board of Directors of  the  Company unless such

obligations or other acts of the other parties, (b)  waive any inaccuracies
in the representations and warranties contained herein  or  in any document
delivered pursuant hereto or (c) waive compliance with any  of  the
agreements or conditions contained herein. Any agreement on the part of  a 
party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an 
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure or delay 
by  any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement  or  otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights nor
shall any partial  exercise by any party to this Agreement of any of its
rights under this  Agreement preclude any other or further exercise of such
rights or any other  rights under this Agreement.

Acceptance Date with the  same effect as though made as of the Acceptance
Date (except that the accuracy  of the representations and warranties that by
their terms speak as of a  specified date will be determined only as of such
date), except in each of  the  above cases, where the failure of such
representations and warranties to be  true  and correct, individually and in

(e) the  Company shall have failed to perform in any material respect any
obligation  required to be performed by it under this Agreement at or prior
to the  Acceptance Date;

 

 

(f) Parent  and the Company shall not have obtained (i) all material

conditions set forth  in  clauses (i) and (ii) of the first paragraph of
Exhibit A may not be waived.  The  failure by Parent, Sub or any other
Affiliate of Parent at any time to exercise  any of the foregoing rights
shall not be deemed a waiver of any such right,  the  waiver of any such
right with respect to particular facts and circumstances  shall not be deemed
a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances  and each such
right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at  any  time
and from time to time prior to the Acceptance Date.
