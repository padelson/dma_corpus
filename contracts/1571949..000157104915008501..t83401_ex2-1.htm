the Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement represent the entire understanding and agreement between the parties with respect
to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended, restated, supplemented or otherwise modified or waived by a written
instrument signed by each of the parties hereto; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that after receipt of the Company Stockholder
Approval, any amendment that would require approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL shall be subject to receipt
of such required approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL. No action taken pursuant to this Agreement, including
any investigation by or on behalf of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance
with any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation contained herein. The waiver by any party of a breach of any provision
of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other
or subsequent breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or remedy by such party preclude
any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or remedy.</P>

STB shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the Surviving
