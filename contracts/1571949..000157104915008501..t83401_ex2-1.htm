that is no earlier than five (5) Business Days after the Closing Date, and
(B) any Additional Company Option Merger Consideration shall be made (without
interest and net of the Applicable Withholding Amount) by or on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation to such Company Optionholders no later than the next
regularly scheduled payroll date that is no earlier than five (5) Business
Days, after the date the Surviving Corporation receives such Additional
Company Option Merger Consideration (if any) pursuant to _Section 3.6(f)(iv)_
 or _Section 3.13(b)_ , as applicable. At the time of each payment covered by
this _Section 3.2(b)(iii)_ , the Applicable Withholding Amount in respect of
such payment shall be applied first to reduce the portion of such payment that
is cash and then, only if and to the extent that such Applicable Withholding
Amount exceeds such cash portion, to reduce the portion of such payment that
is Parent Common Stock.

  



  

(c) _Unpaid Dividend Payments_. Each Company Optionholder holding
any Vested Company Option, including any such option that is an
Underwater Option, shall be entitled to receive any Unpaid Dividend Payments
in respect thereof, with the payment of any such Unpaid Dividend Payments to
be made (without interest and net of such amounts as are required to be
withheld or deducted under the Code or any applicable provision of Law) by or
on behalf of the Surviving Corporation to such Company Optionholder no later
than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is no earlier than five
(5) Business Days after the Closing Date. _Schedule 3.1(c)_ sets forth, as of
the date hereof, a list of the Unpaid Dividend Payments payable to each
Company Optionholder in respect of his or her Company Options. Each Company
Optionholder holding any Unvested Performance-Based Company Option shall not
be entitled to payment of any Unpaid Dividend Payments in respect thereof.

  



  

(d) _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is
entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to,
and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 (the "
_Dissenting Shares_ ") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Company Common Stock Merger Consideration, but instead such holder shall
be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with
the provisions of Section 262. At the Effective Time, all Dissenting Shares
shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and shall
cease to exist, and each holder of Dissenting Shares shall cease to have any
rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of
such Dissenting Shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or
otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section
262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is
not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such
holder to be paid the fair value of such holder's Dissenting Shares under
Section 262 shall cease and each such Dissenting Share shall be deemed to
have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the
right to receive the Company Common Stock Merger Consideration. The Company
shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any written demands for appraisal of
any shares of Company Common Stock, and Parent shall have the right to direct
(and the Company may participate in) all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do any
of the foregoing.

(c) _Exchange Procedures_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall
mail or otherwise deliver, or cause the Paying Agent to mail or
otherwise deliver, to (i) each Company Stockholder a Letter of Transmittal
substantially in the form of _Exhibit F_ attached hereto, with such changes
as may be agreed between the Company and Parent prior to the Closing or as may
be reasonably required by the Paying Agent (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ")
and (ii) each Company Optionholder a Company Optionholder
Participation Agreement, substantially in the form of _Exhibit B_ attached
hereto (the " _Company Optionholder Participation Agreement_ "), together
with any notice required pursuant to Section 262 (solely for purposes of such

the Closing Date (x) a Company Stockholder does not deliver to the Paying
Agent a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal and the
certificate(s) (if any) representing the Company Common Stock held by such
Company Stockholder (" _Certificates_ ") (or, in the event any such
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, a customary lost certificate
affidavit, which shall not require the posting of any bond in connection
therewith) or (y) a Company Optionholder does not deliver to the Company a
duly executed and completed Company Optionholder Participation Agreement,
then, in each such case, such failure shall not alter, limit or delay the
Closing;  _provided_ , that such Company Stockholder or Company Optionholder,
as the case may be, shall not be entitled to receive the Company Common Stock
Closing Consideration contemplated herein at the Closing and shall not be
entitled to receive such Company Common Stock Closing Consideration unless
and until such Person delivers a duly executed and completed Letter of
Transmittal and Certificate(s) (or affidavit, if applicable) or Company
Optionholder Participation Agreement, as applicable, to the Paying Agent (in
the case of a Letter of Transmittal) or the Surviving Corporation (in the case

Stockholder to deliver a duly executed and completed Letter of Transmittal
and Certificate(s) (or affidavit, if applicable) at least three (3) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date shall be held by the Paying Agent in the
Paying Agent Fund. Upon surrender of such Certificate(s) (or affidavit, if
applicable), if any, and delivery of such duly executed Letter of Transmittal
by such Company Stockholder to the Paying Agent, such Company Stockholder
shall be entitled to receive, subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, the Company Stockholder Merger Consideration in respect of his,
her or its shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Certificate(s),
no later than five (5) Business Days after the date the Paying Agent receives
such Certificate(s) (or affidavit, if applicable), if any, and duly executed
Letter of Transmittal, and any Certificate(s) so surrendered shall forthwith
be cancelled. Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.2(c)_ ,
any Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to
represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Company Common
Stock Merger Consideration. Upon the delivery to the Surviving Corporation of
a duly executed Company Optionholder Participation Agreement, payment of the
Company Option Merger Consideration (without interest) to such Company
Optionholder in respect of his, her or its Company Options shall be made by or
on behalf of the Surviving Corporation to such Company Optionholder no later
than the next regularly scheduled payroll date that is no earlier than five

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. All
shares of Parent Common Stock and cash paid upon the surrender of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms of this _ARTICLE III_ shall
be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the shares of Company Common Stock. From and after the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and there shall be no
further registration of transfers on the transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

  



  

(e) _Dividends_. No dividends or other distributions declared with
respect to Parent Common Stock the record date for which is at or after the
Effective Time shall be paid to any Company Stockholder who has not delivered
a properly completed, duly executed Letter of Transmittal or to any Company
Optionholder who has not delivered a properly completed, duly executed Company
Optionholder Participation Agreement. After the delivery of such materials,
the Company Stockholder or Company Optionholder, as applicable, shall be
entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without any
interest thereon, which theretofore had become payable with respect to
the shares of Parent Common Stock which the Company Common Stock or Company
Options, as applicable, have been converted into the right to receive.

  



  

(f) _Changes in Parent Common Stock_. If at any time between the
date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the outstanding shares

exchanged for a different number or kind of shares or securities as a result
of a subdivision, reorganization, recapitalization, reclassification, stock
dividend, stock split, reverse stock split, combination or other similar
change in capitalization, the definition of Aggregate Share Consideration
shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and, if such change occurs
on or after any date used to calculate the Parent Common Stock Closing Price,
the Parent Common Stock Closing Price shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
such change as well; _provided_ , that nothing in this _Section 3.2(f)_ shall
be construed to permit Parent to take any action with respect to its
securities that is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

(g) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no certificates or evidence of book-entry shares
representing fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in
exchange for Company Common Stock or in exchange for Company Options, no
dividend or distribution with respect to Company Common Stock shall be payable
on or with respect to any fractional share, and such fractional share
interests shall not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any other rights
of a shareholder of Parent. In lieu of the issuance of any such fractional
share, Parent shall pay to each former holder of Company Common Stock or
Company Options who otherwise would be entitled to receive such fractional
share an amount in cash (rounded up to the nearest cent) determined by
multiplying (i) the Parent Common Stock Closing Price by (ii) the fraction of
a share (rounded to the nearest thousandth when expressed in decimal form) of
Parent Common Stock which such holder would otherwise be entitled to receive
pursuant to this _ARTICLE III_.

(h) _Unpaid Merger Consideration_. Any portion of the Paying Agent
Fund that remains undistributed to the Company Stockholders for twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Thereafter, any Company Stockholders or Company Optionholders
shall look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws) and only as general creditors thereof for
payment of their claim for any portion of the Company Common Stock Merger
Consideration or Company Option Merger Consideration, as applicable, to which
they are entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, in each case
without any interest thereon. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the
Equityholders' Representative, the Escrow Agent, the Paying Agent or any
other Person shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  



  

3.3 _Certain Accounts_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent
shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, (a) to the Escrow Agent in
accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement an amount equal to the

3.4 _Transaction Costs_. Simultaneously with the Closing, Parent
shall pay, or cause to be paid, the Transaction Costs by wire transfer of
immediately available funds as directed by each payee thereof.

deposit of funds with the Trustee as trust funds pursuant to Section 11.01 of
each of the 2012 Indenture and the 2014 Indenture to cause the discharge of
each such Indenture, assuming a notice of redemption of the applicable Notes
is made in accordance with Sections 3.03 and 3.07 of each such Indenture on

Company and its Subsidiaries, any outstanding amount of Indebtedness
(excluding obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as
lessee that are capitalized in accordance with GAAP), of the Company and its
Subsidiaries and any Breakage Costs related thereto by wire transfer of
immediately available funds, in the case of Indebtedness other than the Notes,

_Section 6.16(c)_. As of the Closing, with respect to each of the letters of
credit, bankers' acceptances and similar facilities of the Company or its
Subsidiaries issued pursuant to Indebtedness of the Company or its
Subsidiaries or commitments under agreements governing Indebtedness of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, Parent shall cause such letter of credit to be
returned to the issuers thereof, provide to the issuer of such letter of
credit a letter of credit in the same amount, on terms satisfactory to the
issuers of such letters of credit, or otherwise satisfy the issuers of such
letters of credit as to the disposition or retention of such letters of

3.6 _Post-Closing Determination of Additional Merger
Consideration_.

  



  

(a) From and after the Closing Date until the determination of the
Final Closing Statement pursuant to this _Section 3.6_ , Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to,
permit the Equityholders' Representative and its Representatives reasonable
access to the personnel, accountants and properties of the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries, and provide reasonable access (with the
right to make copies), during business hours upon reasonable advance notice,
to all of the books, records, contracts and other documents (including
auditor's work papers) of the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries that
are or could reasonably be relevant to the calculations set forth in the
Closing Statement, a Dispute Notice or otherwise related to the negotiation
or resolution of the Final Closing Statement.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing, Parent shall prepare a good faith
calculation of (i) the Final Merger Consideration, (ii) the Final Merger
Consideration Elements and (iii) the Additional Merger Consideration (if
any). The calculations described under the foregoing clauses (i), (ii) and
(iii) are collectively referred to herein as the " _Closing Statement_." The
Final Closing Statement shall be prepared in accordance with the terms
(including the definitions) of this Agreement, including _Exhibit A_ attached
to this Agreement with respect to Net Working Capital. The Closing Statement
will entirely disregard (A) any and all effects on the Company and its
Subsidiaries (including the assets and liabilities of the Company and its
Subsidiaries) as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including fees and expenses resulting therefrom) or of any debt or equity
financing arrangements entered into at any time by Parent, Merger Sub or
their respective Affiliates or any other transaction entered into by
Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (B) any
of the plans, transactions, fundings, payments or changes that Parent or its
Affiliates initiates or makes or causes to be initiated or made after the
Closing with respect to the Company and its Subsidiaries or their business or
assets, or any facts or circumstances that are unique or particular to Parent
or its Affiliates or any of their respective assets or liabilities. Parent
shall deliver the Closing Statement, together with reasonable supporting
detail as to each of the calculations (including with respect to the Final
Merger Consideration Elements) set forth in the Closing Statement, to the
Equityholders' Representative no later than seventy five (75) days following
the Closing Date. If Parent fails to deliver the Closing Statement in
accordance with the immediately preceding sentence within such seventy five
(75) day period, then, at the election of the Equityholders' Representative
in its sole discretion either (x) the Estimated Closing Statement delivered by
the Company to Parent pursuant to  _Section 3.2_ shall be deemed to be the
Final Closing Statement for all purposes herein or (y) the Equityholders'
Representative shall retain (at the sole cost and expense of Parent) a
nationally recognized independent accounting firm to provide an audit of the
Company's books, determine the calculation of, and prepare, the Closing
Statement consistent with the provisions of this  _Section 3.6_ , the
determination of such accounting firm being conclusive, final and binding on
the parties hereto; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Equityholders' Representative reserves any and all other
rights granted to it in this Agreement. Parent shall promptly reimburse the
Equityholders' Representative upon its request for all fees, costs and
expenses incurred by the Equityholders' Representative in connection with the
foregoing clause (y). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
parties acknowledge and agree that the Closing Statement, and the component
items and calculations therein, including the Final Merger Consideration
Elements, shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the terms
(including the definitions) of this Agreement, including _Exhibit A_ attached
to this Agreement with respect to Net Working Capital. The Closing Statement
shall be final and binding on all parties absent manifest error unless the
Equityholders' Representative gives Parent written notice (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") of any disputes or objections thereto (collectively, the "
_Disputed Items_ ") with reasonable supporting detail as to such Disputed
Items, within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Closing Statement (such
period, the " _Review Period_ "). In the event the Equityholders'
Representative fails to give Parent a Dispute Notice prior to the expiration
of the Review Period or otherwise earlier notifies Parent in writing that the
Equityholders' Representative has no disputes or objections to the Closing
Statement, the Purchase Price Escrow Account shall be distributed, and
payments shall be made by Parent, in accordance with _Section 3.6(f)_. In the
event the Equityholders' Representative gives Parent a Dispute Notice prior
to the expiration of the Review Period then, within two (2) Business Days
after such Dispute Notice has been given to Parent, Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to make the distributions in accordance with _Section 3.6(f)_
, solely to the extent applicable in light of, and to the extent which, the
Equityholders' Representative has not objected to the calculation set forth
in the Closing Statement.

(c) Parent and the Equityholders' Representative shall, for a period
of thirty (30) days (or such longer period as Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative may agree in writing) following delivery of a
Dispute Notice to Parent (the " _Resolution Period_ "), attempt in good faith
to resolve their differences (all such discussions and communications related
thereto shall (unless otherwise agreed by Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative in writing) be governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of
Evidence and any applicable similar state rule), and any such resolution by
them as to any Disputed Items shall be conclusive, final and binding on all
parties absent manifest error. Any Disputed Items agreed to by Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative in writing, together with any items or
calculations set forth in the Closing Statement not disputed or objected to by
the Equityholders' Representative in the Dispute Notice, are collectively
referred to herein as the " _Resolved Matters_." Any Resolved Matters shall
be conclusive, final and binding on all parties absent manifest error, except
to the extent such component could be affected by other components of the
calculations set forth in the Closing Statement that are the subject of a
Dispute Notice. If at the end of the Resolution Period, Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative have been unable to resolve any
differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Dispute Notice, either of Parent or the Equityholders' Representative may,
upon written notice to the other, refer all matters that remain in dispute
with respect to the Dispute Notice (the " _Unresolved Matters_ ") for
resolution to the Independent Accountant. If one or more Unresolved Matters
are submitted to the Independent Accountant for resolution, Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative shall enter into a customary engagement letter
with, and to the extent necessary each party to this Agreement will waive
and, to the extent required, cause its controlled Affiliates to waive any
conflicts with, the Independent Accountant at the time such dispute is
submitted to the Independent Accountant and shall cooperate with the
Independent Accountant in connection with its determination pursuant to this
_Section 3.6_. Within ten (10) days after the Independent Accountant has been
retained, each of Parent and the Equityholders' Representative shall furnish,
at its own expense, to the Independent Accountant and substantially
simultaneously to the other a written statement of its position with respect
to each Unresolved Matter. Within five (5) Business Days after the expiration
of such ten (10)-day period, each of Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative may deliver to the Independent Accountant its response to
the other's position on each Unresolved Matter; _provided_ , that it delivers
a copy thereof substantially simultaneously to the other. With each
submission, each of Parent and the Equityholders' Representative may also
furnish to the Independent Accountant such other information and documents as
it deems relevant or such information and documents as may be requested by
the Independent Accountant; _provided_ , that it delivers a copy thereof
substantially simultaneously to the other. The Independent Accountant may, at
its discretion, conduct one or more conferences (whether in person or by
teleconference) concerning the disagreement and each of Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative shall have the right to present additional
documents, materials and other information and to have present its
Representatives at such conferences.

  



    

-33-

(d) The Independent Accountant shall be directed to promptly, and in
any event within thirty (30) days after its appointment pursuant to  _Section
3.6(c)_ acting as an expert in accounting and not as a valuation expert,
render its decision on the Unresolved Matters (and not on any other matter or
calculation set forth in the Closing Statement) in a manner consistent with
the terms (including the definitions) of this Agreement, including _Exhibit
A_ attached to this Agreement with respect to Net Working Capital. The
Independent Accountant's determination as to each Unresolved Matter shall be
set forth in a written statement delivered to each of Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative, which shall include the Independent
Accountant's (i) determination as to the calculation of each of the
Unresolved Matters and (ii) the corresponding corrective calculations set
forth in the Closing Statement that are derived from its determination as to
the calculations of the Unresolved Matters, all of which shall be
conclusive, final and binding on all parties absent manifest error. In
resolving any Unresolved Matter, the Independent Accountant may not assign a
value to such item greater than the greatest value for such item claimed by
Parent in the Closing Statement or by the Equityholders' Representative in
the Dispute Notice or less than the lowest value for such item claimed by
Parent in the Closing Statement or by the Equityholders' Representative in
the Dispute Notice. The Independent Accountant shall also determine the
proportion of its fees and expenses to be paid by each of Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative based on the degree (as determined in good
faith by the Independent Accountant) to which the Independent Accountant has
accepted the positions of Parent and the Equityholders' Representative. The
Independent Accountant's fees and expenses payable by Parent (if any)
shall be paid to the Independent Accountant directly by Parent, and the
Independent Accountant's fees and expenses payable by the Equityholders'
Representative (if any) shall only be paid from the funds in the
Equityholders' Representative Account pursuant to _Section 3.11_. To the
extent the funds then held in the Equityholders' Representative Account are
insufficient to cover all of the Independent Accountant's fees and expenses
payable by the Equityholders' Representative, Parent shall pay any such
remaining fees and expenses.

  



  

(e) For purposes of this Agreement, the " _Final Closing Statement_
" shall be (i) in the event that no Dispute Notice is delivered by the
Equityholders' Representative to Parent prior to the expiration of the Review
Period, the Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the Equityholders'
Representative pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_ , (ii) in the event that a
Dispute Notice is delivered by the Equityholders' Representative to Parent
prior to the expiration of the Review Period, the Closing Statement delivered
by Parent to the Equityholders' Representative pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_ ,
as adjusted pursuant to the agreement of Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative in writing, or (iii) in the event that a Dispute Notice is
delivered by the Equityholders' Representative to Parent prior to the
expiration of the Review Period and Parent and the Equityholders'
Representative are unable to agree on all matters set forth in such Dispute
Notice, the Closing Statement delivered by Parent to the Equityholders'
Representative pursuant to _Section 3.6(b)_ , as adjusted by the
Independent Accountant to be consistent with (A) the Resolved Matters and (B)
the Independent Accountant's determination as to the calculation of the
Unresolved Matters in accordance with _Sections 3.5(c)_ and _3.5(d)_.

(f) _Payment of the Additional Merger Consideration_.

  



  

(i) If the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration, then within five (5) Business Days after the
final determination of the Final Closing Statement, Parent shall deposit, or
cause to be deposited, in immediately available funds, with the Escrow Agent
in the Purchase Price Escrow Account an amount in cash equal to the lesser of
(A) the Purchase Price Escrow Amount and (B) the full amount by which the
Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger Consideration and
immediately thereafter, Parent and the Equityholders' Representative shall
provide a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly
from the Purchase Price Escrow Account by wire transfer of immediately
available funds in accordance with this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement
all proceeds in the Purchase Price Escrow Account to the Company Stockholders
and the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company Optionholders), in
each case as set forth in _Section 3.6(f)(iv)_. In the event that the full
amount by which the Final Merger Consideration exceeds the Estimated Merger
Consideration is greater than the Purchase Price Escrow Amount, the
Equityholders' Representative, the Company Stockholders and the Company
Optionholders shall have no recourse against Parent, Merger Sub or any other
Person.

  



  

(ii) If the Final Merger Consideration equals the Estimated Merger
Consideration, then within five (5) Business Days after the
final determination of the Final Closing Statement, Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Purchase Price Escrow Account by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with this
Agreement and the Purchase Price Escrow Agreement all proceeds in the Purchase
Price Escrow Account to the Company Stockholders and the Surviving
Corporation (on behalf of the Company Optionholders), in each case as set
forth in  _Section 3.6(f)(iv)_.

  



  

(iii) If the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration, then within five (5) Business Days after the
final determination of the Final Closing Statement, Parent and the
Equityholders' Representative shall provide a joint written instruction to
the Escrow Agent to deliver promptly from the Purchase Price Escrow Account by
wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with this
Agreement and the Escrow Agreement (A) the lesser of (1) the full amount by
which the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration and (2) the funds then held in the Purchase Price Escrow Account
to Parent, and (B) the funds remaining (if any) in the Purchase Price Escrow
Account, after giving effect to clause (A), to the Company Stockholders and
the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the Company Optionholders), in each
case as set forth in _Section 3.6(f)(iv)_. In the event that the full amount
by which the Estimated Merger Consideration exceeds the Final Merger
Consideration is greater than the funds then held in the Purchase Price
Escrow Account, Parent shall have no recourse against the Equityholders'
Representative, the Company Stockholders, the Company Optionholders or any
other Person.

3.8 _Private Placement; Non-Accredited Investors_.

  



  

(a) The parties understand and agree that the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued and transferred as contemplated in this
Agreement as part of the consideration for the Merger to Company Stockholders
and Company Optionholders have not been registered under the securities Laws
of the United States, including the Securities Act, or any other jurisdiction
and will be issued and transferred pursuant to a "private placement" exempt
from registration under the Securities Act by virtue of Regulation
D promulgated thereunder. The shares of Parent Common Stock comprising such
consideration will be characterized as "restricted securities" under the
Securities Act and may only be transferred pursuant to a registration
statement or an applicable exemption under the Securities Act. Any book
entries recording the record ownership of shares of Parent Common Stock (it
being understood and agreed by the parties that the Parent Common Stock is
uncertificated) shall bear such annotations as Parent may reasonably deem
necessary and desirable in connection therewith.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, the shares of Parent
Common Stock comprising such consideration for the Merger shall only be
issued to Accredited Investors. In order for Parent to verify that a Company
Stockholder or Company Optionholder is an Accredited Investor, each such
Company Stockholder or Company Optionholder to whom shares of Parent Common
Stock are to be issued in the Merger shall have either (i) made to Parent in
writing such customary representations and warranties as may be reasonably
required by Parent or (ii) duly executed and completed a Letter of
Transmittal or Optionholder Participation Agreement in accordance with terms
herein, and confirmed in such document that such Person is an Accredited
Investor. No shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued in the Merger to a
Non-Accredited Investor. In lieu thereof, a Non-Accredited Investor shall be
entitled to receive, at the Effective Time, an amount in cash as set forth in
_Section 3.1(a)_ , with respect to Company Stockholders, and _Section 3.1(b)_
, with respect to Company Optionholders. For the purposes of this Agreement,
" _Non-Accredited Investor_ " means a Person who is not an Accredited
Investor as determined in good faith by Parent, and " _Accredited Investor_ "
means a Person that is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined in
Rule 501 promulgated under the Securities Act, or would otherwise be excluded
under Rule 501(e)(1) under the Securities Act from any calculation of the
number of purchasers of shares of Parent Common Stock in the Merger, as
determined in good faith by Parent, in each case after taking into
consideration such information as deemed relevant by Parent; provided, that
if any Company Stockholder or Company Optionholder has duly executed and
completed a Letter of Transmittal or Optionholder Participation Agreement, and
confirmed in such document that such Person is an Accredited Investor , such
Person shall be deemed to be an Accredited Investor for all purposes herein.
Parent shall have the right to determine (in good faith) whether each such
Company Stockholder and Company Optionholder is an Accredited Investor or a
Non-Accredited Investor for the purposes of this Agreement and shall
memorialize such determination with respect to each Company Stockholder and
Company Optionholder in a document to be filed with the books and records of
the Company and be delivered at the Effective Time to the Paying Agent
pursuant to _Section 3.2(b)(i)_ (the " _Investor Designation_ ").

any or all of such payments to the Equityholders' Representative Account for

in reliance upon any notice, direction, instruction, consent, statement or
other documents believed by such Person to be genuinely and duly authorized,
nor for any other action or inaction except its own Willful Breach as may
be determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Equityholders' Representative may, in all questions arising
under this Agreement, or any other agreement (including the Escrow Agreement)
in connection with this Agreement, rely on the advice of counsel, accountants
and other advisors, and the Equityholders' Representative shall not be liable
to any Company Stockholder or Company Optionholder for any action taken or
omitted or suffered in good faith by the Equityholders' Representative based
on such advice. The Equityholders' Representative is authorized by the Company
Stockholders and the Company Optionholders to incur documented out-of-pocket
fees, costs and expenses on behalf of the Company Stockholders and
Company Optionholders in acting hereunder, including expenses of counsel,
accountants and other advisors. If the Equityholders' Representative in
connection with acting in such capacity shall incur any liabilities, losses,
damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties in
connection with acting as such that is not reimbursed from the Purchase Price
Escrow Account or the Equityholders' Representative Account, the Company
Stockholders and Company Optionholders will, on the written request of the
Equityholders' Representative, reimburse the Equityholders' Representative
for its Fully Diluted Per Share Portion of such liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments or penalties. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Equityholders' Representative
is authorized to deduct (or cause to be deducted) from any payment or release
due to any of the Company Stockholders or Company Optionholders from the
Purchase Price Escrow Account, the Equityholders' Representative Account, the
amount of such reimbursement. The Equityholders' Representative and its
equityholders, controlling persons, members, limited or general partners,
Affiliates and Representatives are acting solely on behalf of, and as agents
for, the Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders and not in their
personal capacity, and in no event shall the Equityholders' Representative or
any of its former, current or future equityholders, controlling persons,
members, limited or general partners, Affiliates and Representatives, or
their respective successors, predecessors or assigns (or any successors,
predecessors or assigns of the foregoing), be personally liable to any of the
Company Stockholders or the Company Optionholders hereunder other than, solely
in the case of the Equityholders' Representative, a Willful Breach as may be
determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of
competent jurisdiction.

  



    

-39-

(b) Each Company Stockholder and Company Optionholder agrees to
indemnify the Equityholders' Representative and its current, former and
future equityholders, controlling persons, members, limited or general
partners, Affiliates and Representatives and their respective successors,
predecessors or assigns (or any successors, predecessors or assigns of the
foregoing) for its respective Fully Diluted Per Share Portion of any and all
liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards,
judgments and penalties (including the reasonable fees and expenses of any
legal counsel retained by the Equityholders' Representative) or
disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever which may at any time be
imposed on, incurred by or asserted against the Equityholders' Representative
or any of its equityholders, controlling persons, members, limited or general
partners, Affiliates and Representatives and their respective successors,
predecessors or assigns (or any successors, predecessors or assigns of the
foregoing) in any way relating to, or arising out, of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of the Equityholders'
Representative's duties hereunder or under the Escrow Agreement or any
documents contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any of the
terms hereof or thereof; _provided_ , _however_ , that no Company Stockholder
or Company Optionholder shall be liable for any of the foregoing to the extent
they arise from the Equityholders' Representative's Willful Breach as may be
determined by a final, non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction. The Equityholders' Representative shall be fully justified in
refusing to take or to continue to take any action hereunder unless it and
its equityholders, controlling persons, members, limited or general partners,
Affiliates and Representatives and its and their respective successors,
predecessors or assigns (or any successors, predecessors or assigns of the
foregoing) shall first be fully indemnified to its reasonable satisfaction by
the Company Stockholders and the Company Optionholders (based on
their respective Fully Diluted Per Share Portions) against any liabilities,
losses, damages, claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and
penalties that may be incurred by such Person by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action. 

  



  

(c) All obligations (but for the avoidance of doubt none of the
rights) of the Equityholders' Representative under this Agreement shall
terminate upon the final distribution of the funds in the Purchase Price
Escrow Account pursuant to _Section 3.6(f)_ , and the Equityholders'
Representative Account pursuant to _Section 3.13_.

time as may be determined by the Equityholders' Representative in its sole
and absolute discretion, the remaining funds in the Equityholders'
Representative Account (if any) shall be released as follows (such release,

Account Distribution minus the aggregate payment required by _Section 3.13(a)_
with respect to such Equityholders' Representative Account Distribution (such
difference the " _Net Equityholders ' Representative Account Distribution_"),
_multiplied_ by (z) the aggregate number of such shares of Company Common
Stock held by such Company Stockholder immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (2) to the Surviving Corporation (on behalf of the

Salable Value" means the amount that may be realized if the aggregate assets
of such Person (including goodwill) are sold as an entirety with reasonable
promptness in an arm's length transaction under present conditions for the

Subsidiaries have designed and maintained a system of internal control over

Material Adverse Effect, the "disclosure controls and procedures" (as defined

are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information required to
be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or submits under the
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time
periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all such
information is accumulated and communicated to the chief executive officer
and chief financial officer of Parent as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure and to make the certifications
of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent required
under the Exchange Act with respect to such reports. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, Parent has
disclosed, based on its most recent evaluation prior to the date hereof, to
Parent's outside auditors and the audit committee of the board of directors
of Parent (i) any significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the
design or operation of internal control over financial reporting (as defined
in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Exchange Act) which are reasonably likely to
adversely affect Parent's ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial information, and (ii) any fraud that involves management or other
employees who have a significant role in Parent's internal controls over
financial reporting.

occur in accordance with _Section 2.2_ or (y) otherwise prevent, delay or
impede in any material respect the consummation of such financing on the date
on which Closing would otherwise occur in accordance with _Section 2.2_ ;

  



  

(ix) take any action that is reasonably likely to prevent, delay or
impede the consummation of the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; or

  



  

(x) enter into any Contract, resolve by corporate action, commitment
or arrangement to do any of the foregoing.

  



  

(d) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that: (i) nothing
contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or Merger Sub, directly
or indirectly, the right to control or direct the operations of the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) prior to the
Effective Time, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall exercise, consistent
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and
supervision over their respective operations. The failure of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to take any actions prohibits by this Section 6.1
shall not be a breach of this Agreement.

(e) Merger Sub agrees that, during the Interim Period, it shall not,
directly or indirectly, engage in any business activities or incur
any liabilities or obligations other than solely in connection with the
Merger or as expressly contemplated by this Agreement.

  



  

6.2 _Access to Information_. During the Interim Period and
subject to applicable Laws and _Section 6.3_ , Parent shall be
entitled, through itself and its Representatives, to have such access to the
properties, businesses and operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries and
such examination of the books and records, contracts, data, files and
information of the Company and its Subsidiaries as it reasonably requests
upon reasonable advance written notice in connection with Parent's efforts to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Any such access
and examination shall be conducted during regular business hours and under
reasonable circumstances and shall be subject to restrictions under
applicable Law. The Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause its Representatives, and the Representatives of its Subsidiaries, to
reasonably cooperate with Parent and Parent's Representatives in connection
with such access and examination, and Parent and its Representatives shall
reasonably cooperate with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their
respective Representatives and shall use their commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any disruption to the business. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, (a) no such access or examination shall be permitted
to the extent that (i) it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or (ii) such access or examination would
jeopardize the attorney-client privilege or contravene any Law or Contract and
(b) the Company may elect to limit, or cause any of its Subsidiaries to
limit, disclosure of any information to certain Persons designated, at the
request of the Company, as a "clean team" by Parent (which Persons must be
reasonably acceptable to the Company). Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein, during the Interim Period, (x) without the prior
written consent of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall not, and shall
cause their Representatives and Affiliates not to, contact any
suppliers, customers, independent contractors, landlords, lessors, banks, or
any other Person whom the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have or have had
a business relationship, other than in the ordinary course of business of
Parent or any of its Affiliates with respect to matters not involving the
Company or its Subsidiaries, this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby; _provided_ , that the Company shall have the right to have one or
more Representatives present during any such contact in the event that
it consents to such contact, and (y) neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall have
any right to perform invasive or subsurface investigations of the properties
or facilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries without the prior
written consent of the Company (which consent may be withheld for any or no
reason). Parent shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries from and against all liabilities, losses, damages, claims,
costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties that may be
incurred by any of them arising out of or related to the use, storage or
handling of (A) any personally identifiable information relating to
employees, providers or customers of the Company or its Subsidiaries and (B)
any other information that is protected by applicable Law (including privacy
Laws) or Contract to which Parent or its Representatives are afforded access
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The Company does not make any
representation or warranty as to the accuracy of any information provided (if
any) pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ , and neither Parent nor Merger Sub may
rely on the accuracy of any such information, in each case other than as
expressly set forth in the Company's representations and warranties contained
in _ARTICLE IV_ ;  _provided_ , that no investigation pursuant to this
_Section 6.2_ by Parent, Merger Sub or their Representatives shall be deemed
to modify any of the Company's representations and warranties contained in
_ARTICLE IV_. Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees that, prior to the
Closing, it will not, and will cause its Representatives and Affiliates not
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 6.2_ for any
competitive or other purpose unrelated to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

6.3 _Confidentiality_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree
that the information provided to them in connection with this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby is subject to the terms of the
confidentiality agreement between the Company and Parent dated as of July
23, 2015 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), the terms of which are
incorporated herein by reference.

  



  

6.4 _Consents_. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use
(and the Company shall cause its Subsidiaries to use) their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals required
as a result of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement as set forth on _Schedule 6.4_ ; _provided_ , _however_ , that (a)
no party shall be obligated to, and the Company shall not be obligated to
cause its Subsidiaries to, pay any fees, costs, or other consideration (other
than immaterial administrative costs) to any third party from whom any such
consent or approval is requested under any Contract and (b) the prior written
consent of Parent shall be required with respect to any amendment or
modification to any Contract for the purposes of obtaining any such consent
or approval that (i) would give rise to rights or obligations of any Person at
or following the Closing or (ii) would result in terms and conditions under
any such Contract that are, at or following the Closing, less favorable
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries than are in
effect as of the date hereof; _provided_ , _further_ , that each of the
parties acknowledges and agrees that obtaining any such consent or approval
shall not be a condition of Closing.

  



  

6.5   _Further Assurances; Regulatory Approvals_.

  



  

(a) Subject to _Section 6.4_ , without limiting any other covenant
in this Agreement (including the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub set
forth in this _Section 6.5_ ), each of the Company, on the one hand, and
Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, agrees to use its respective reasonable
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action, and to do, or cause to
be done, as promptly as reasonably practicable, all things necessary, proper
and advisable under applicable Laws to (i) consummate and make effective as
promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
(ii) cause the fulfillment at the earliest practicable date of all of the
conditions to their respective obligations to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to appropriate confidentiality
protections, each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other, shall furnish to the other such necessary information and
reasonable assistance as such other party may reasonably request in
connection with the foregoing.

  



    

-75-

(b) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other, shall cooperate with one another and use their reasonable best
efforts to (i) prepare all necessary documentation (including furnishing all
information required under the Competition Laws) to effect promptly all
necessary filings with any Governmental Body and (ii) obtain all consents,
waivers and approvals of any Governmental Body necessary to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of the Company, on the one
hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, shall (1) allow the other
party to review in advance and to the extent practicable, consult with one
another on and consider in good faith the views of the other with respect to
any written communication or submission to any Governmental Antitrust Entity
relating to any inquiry, investigation or proceeding involving the
transaction/information relating to that party that is to be submitted to any
Governmental Antitrust Entity in connection with any inquiry, investigation or
proceeding relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (2)
provide to the other copies of all correspondence between it (or its
advisors) and any Governmental Antitrust Entity or other Governmental Body
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any of the
matters described in this _Section 6.5_ and (3) promptly inform the other of
any oral communication with, and provide copies of written communications
with, any Governmental Body regarding any such filings or any such
transaction. Neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other, shall independently participate in any meeting or conference
call with any Governmental Body in respect of any such filings, investigation,
or other inquiry without giving the other prior notice of the meeting and, to
the extent not prohibited by such Governmental Body, the opportunity to attend
or participate. To the extent permissible under applicable Law, each of the
Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub, on the other, will
consult and cooperate with one another in connection with any analyses,
appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs, arguments, opinions and
proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any party hereto relating to
proceedings under the Competition Laws; provided, however, that Parent shall
control and lead all communications and strategy in connection with any
Competition Law. The parties may, as they deem advisable, designate any
competitively sensitive materials provided to the other under this
_Section 6.5(b)_ or any other Section of this Agreement as "outside counsel
only." Such materials and the information contained therein shall be given
only to outside counsel of the recipient and will not be disclosed by such
outside counsel to employees, officers, or directors of the recipient without
the advance written consent of the party providing such materials.

  



  

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to
this _Section 6.5_ , each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and
Merger Sub, on the other, shall provide or cause to be provided (including by
their "ultimate parent entities" as that term is defined in the HSR Act) as
promptly as practicable to any Governmental Antitrust Entity information and
documents requested by such Governmental Antitrust Entity or necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including (i) filing any notification and
report form and related material required under the HSR Act no later than
five (5) Business Days after the date hereof, (ii) filing any notification and
report form and related material required under any other Competition Law
regarding preacquisition notifications for the purpose of competition reviews
as promptly as possible and thereafter to promptly respond to any request for
additional information or documentary material that may be made under the HSR
Act and any similar Law regarding preacquisition notifications for the purpose
of competition reviews. Parent and Merger Sub shall not, "pull-and-refile"
any filing made under the HSR Act or take any similar action with respect to
any filing made with any Governmental Antitrust Entity, in each case without
the prior written consent of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent shall otherwise control all timing decisions subject to its obligations
in this _Section 6.5_ , and (iii) filing any notification and report form or
related material required in connection with obtaining the regulatory
approvals (other than any approvals under Competition Law) set forth in
_Schedule 7.1(e)_ no later than five (5) Business Days from the date
hereof. Parent shall cause (and shall cause its "ultimate parent entity" as
that term is defined in the HSR Act to cause) the filings under the HSR Act
to be considered for grant of "early termination," and make any further
filings pursuant thereto that may be necessary, proper, or advisable in
connection therewith. Parent shall be responsible for all filing fees
under the HSR Act and under any other Competition Laws or any such other Laws
or regulations applicable to Parent, as well as all reasonable fees and
expenses of the Company and its Affiliates in responding to any requests for
additional information.

(d) If any objections are asserted with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby under any Competition Law or if any Legal Proceeding is
instituted by any Governmental Antitrust Entity or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Competition Law, each of Parent and the Company shall, at the sole cost and
expense of Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to: (i) oppose or defend
against any action to prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and
the transactions contemplated herein), or (ii) take such action as necessary
to overturn any regulatory action by any Governmental Antitrust Entity to
prevent or enjoin consummation of this Agreement (and the transactions
contemplated herein), including by defending any Legal Proceeding brought by
any Governmental Antitrust Entity in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated, overturned or terminated, including by appeal if necessary, in order
to resolve any such objections or challenge as such Governmental Antitrust
Entity or private party may have to such transactions under such Competition
Law so as to permit consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates to, take all actions necessary to avoid or eliminate each and
every impediment under any Competition Law so as to enable the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger, to occur as
soon as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Outside Date),
including (i) proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition
of businesses, product lines or assets of the Company, Parent or their
respective Affiliates, (ii) terminating existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations of the Company, Parent or their respective
Affiliates, (iii) terminating any venture or other arrangement of the
Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates and (iv) otherwise taking or
committing to take actions that after the Closing Date would limit the
Company's, Parent's or their respective Affiliates' freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, one or more of the businesses, product
lines or assets of the Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates, in
each case as may be required in order to enable the consummation of the Merger
and other transactions contemplated hereby, to occur as promptly as possible
(and in any event no later than the Outside Date) and to otherwise avoid the
entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any preliminary or permanent
injunction which would otherwise have the effect of preventing the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger,
and in that regard the Company and Parent shall, and shall cause their
respective Affiliates to, agree to divest, sell, dispose of, hold separate or
otherwise take or commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action
with respect to the Company's, Parent's or their respective Affiliates'
ability to retain, any of the businesses, product lines or assets of the
Company, Parent or their respective Affiliates. Parent shall not, and shall
not permit any of its Affiliates to, acquire or agree to acquire, by merging
or consolidating with, or by purchasing a substantial portion of the assets
of or equity in, or by any other manner, any Person or portion thereof, or
otherwise acquire or agree to acquire any assets, if such actions would
reasonably be expected to (i) impose any delay in the obtaining of, or
significantly increase the risk of not obtaining, any authorizations,
consents, order, declarations or approvals of any Governmental Body
necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, or the
expiration or termination of any waiting period applicable thereto, (ii)
significantly increase the risk of any Governmental Body entering an order
prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby or,
(iii) delay the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(f) From the date of this Agreement through the date (i) of
termination of the required waiting periods under the HSR Act and all
applicable Competition Laws, (ii) all approvals under applicable Competition
Laws are obtained and (iii) the consents required pursuant to  _Section
6.5(b)_ are obtained, none of Parent, Merger Sub and any of their Affiliates,
on the one hand, or the Company, on the other, shall take any action that
could reasonably be expected to hinder or delay, as applicable, the obtaining
of clearance or the expiration of the required waiting periods under the HSR
Act and obtaining the approvals required under other such
applicable Competition Laws, or the obtaining of the consents required
pursuant to _Section 6.5(b)_.

  



  

6.6 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

  



  

(a) For six (6) years from and after the Closing, Parent shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to, indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, the
individuals who at or prior to the Closing were directors or officers of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (collectively, the " _Indemnitees_ ") with
respect to all acts or omissions by them in their capacities as such or taken
at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time at or
prior to the Closing. Parent agrees that all rights of the Indemnitees to
advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Closing as provided in the
Company Charter Documents or the respective certificate of incorporation or
bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of any of the
Company's Subsidiaries as now in effect, and any indemnification agreements
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall survive the Closing and shall
continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period
of six (6) years following the Closing. Such rights shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect the
rights of the Indemnitees, unless such amendment, repealing or modification
is required by Law or approved by such Indemnitees. In addition, Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries, as the
case may be, to, advance, pay or reimburse any expenses of any Indemnitee
under this _Section 6.6_ as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ , that the person to whom expenses are advanced
provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined
that such person is not entitled to indemnification.

  



  

(b) For six (6) years from and after the Closing, Parent shall cause
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
contain provisions no less favorable to the Indemnitees with respect to
advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation from liabilities than
are set forth as of the date of this Agreement in the Company Charter
Documents or the certificate of incorporation and bylaws or comparable
organizational documents of each Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation,
which provisions in each case shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified in a manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of the
Indemnitees.

(c) The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate, and shall use
reasonable best efforts cause their respective Affiliates to cooperate,
in the defense of any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim or Legal Proceeding of any kind that is subject to advancement of
expenses, indemnification and exculpation from liabilities, and shall provide
access to properties and individuals as reasonably requested and furnish or
cause to be furnished records, information and testimony, and attend such
conferences, discovery proceedings, hearings, trials or appeals, as may be
reasonably requested in connection therewith.

  



  

(d) From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, provide or maintain in effect for
six (6) years, through the purchase of "run-off" coverage or otherwise,
directors' and officers' and corporate liability insurance covering those
individuals who are covered by the directors' and officers' and
corporate liability insurance policy or policies provided for directors and
officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the date hereof (the "
_Existing Policy_ ") on terms comparable in all respects to the Existing
Policy and such coverage shall contain minimum aggregate limits of liability
for directors' and officers' and corporate liability insurance coverage for
directors and officers of the Company and its Subsidiaries with the amount of
coverage at least equal to that of the Existing Policy and deductibles no
larger than the Existing Policy; _provided_ , _however_ , that if such "run-
off" or other coverage is not available at a cost not greater than three
hundred percent (300%) of the annual premiums paid as of the date hereof
under the Existing Policies (the " _Insurance Cap_ ") (which premiums are, as
of the date hereof, set forth in _Schedule 6.6(d)_ ), then the Surviving
Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall be required to obtain as much coverage
as is possible under substantially similar policies for such annual premiums
as do not exceed the Insurance Cap. For the avoidance of doubt, any
policies purchased pursuant to this _Section 6.6(d)_ shall be paid for by
Parent or the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

(e) The provisions of this _Section 6.6_ : (i) are intended to be
for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or her
heirs and his or her representatives and (ii) are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that
any such person may have by Contract or otherwise.

  



  

(f) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates, restructures,
recapitalizes, merges with or into any other Person or otherwise reorganizes
and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation, restructuring, recapitalization, merger or other
restructuring; or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, proper
provision shall be made by Parent and the Surviving Corporation so that the
successors and assigns of the Surviving Corporation shall assume all of the
obligations thereof set forth in this _Section 6.6_.

  



    

-79-

(g) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to
or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors' and
officers' insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence
with respect to the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
respective directors or officers, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 6.6_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

  



  

(h) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Section 6.6_ ,
Parent agrees that any indemnification, advancement of expenses or
insurance available to any Indemnitee who at or prior to the Closing was a
director of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by virtue of such
Indemnitee's service as a partner, member or employee of any investment fund
or management entity affiliated with or managed by a Sponsor at or prior to
the Closing (any such Indemnitee, a " _Sponsor Director_ ") shall be
secondary to the indemnification, advancement of expenses and insurance to be
provided by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries pursuant
to this _Section 6.6_ and that the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
(i) shall be the primary indemnitors of first resort for Sponsor Directors
pursuant to this _Section 6.6_ , (ii) shall be fully responsible for the
advancement of expenses, indemnification and exculpation from liabilities
with respect to Sponsor Directors that are addressed by this _Section 6.6_
and (iii) shall not make any claim for contribution, subrogation or any other
recovery of any kind in respect of any other indemnification or insurance
available to any Sponsor Director with respect to any matter addressed by this
_Section 6.6_.

  



  

(i) The obligations of the Surviving Corporation under this _Section
6.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnitee to whom this _Section 6.6_ applies without the consent
of the affected Indemnitee (it being expressly agreed that the Indemnitees to
whom this _Section 6.6_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this
_Section 6.6_ ).

  



  

6.7 _Preservation of Records_. From and after the Closing, Parent
shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to,
preserve and keep the records held by them relating to the respective
businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries for a period of ten (10) years
from the Closing Date (or longer if required by applicable Law or Contract)
and shall make such records (or copies) and reasonably appropriate personnel
available, at reasonable times and upon reasonable advance notice, to the
Equityholders' Representative, any Company Stockholder and any of their
respective Affiliates or Representatives as may be reasonably required by
such Person in connection with any insurance claims by, Legal Proceedings or
Tax audits against, governmental investigations of, compliance with Law by,
or the preparation of financial statements of, the Equityholders'
Representative, any Company Stockholder or any of their respective
Affiliates, or otherwise in connection with any other matter relating to or
resulting from this Agreement; _provided_ , that any Company Stockholder who
requests access to Confidential Information or any personnel of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries (including the Surviving Corporation or its Subsidiaries)
shall receive access to such information or personnel only after entering
into a reasonable and customary confidentiality agreement with the Surviving
Corporation or Parent.

6.8 _No Publicity_.

  



  

(a) Neither the Company, on the one hand, nor Parent or Merger Sub,
on the other hand, shall issue any press release or public announcement or
public comment concerning this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby without obtaining the prior written approval of Parent or either the
Company (prior to the Closing) or the Equityholders' Representative (at and
after the Closing), respectively (which approval will not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), unless and only to the extent, in the
judgment of such Person upon the advice of its outside counsel, disclosure is
required by applicable Law (including the periodic reporting
requirements under the Exchange Act) or under the rules of any securities
exchange on which the securities of such Person are listed; _provided_ , that
to the extent disclosure is so required by applicable Law, the party intending
to make such release, announcement or comment shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts consistent with applicable Law to consult with the other
parties with respect to the text thereof in advance of such release,
announcement or comment.

  



  

(b) Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub agrees that this
Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the terms
and conditions set forth herein shall be kept strictly confidential and shall
not be disclosed or otherwise made available to any other Person and that
copies of this Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) shall
not be publicly filed or otherwise made available to the public, except in
each case (i) by the Company as required by the Indentures, the Credit
Agreement or any Contract to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is bound,
(ii) where such disclosure, availability or filing, upon the advice of
outside counsel, is required by applicable Law and only to the extent required
by such Law or under the rules of any securities exchange on which the
securities of Parent or the Company are listed, (iii) in connection with any
Legal Proceeding by a party to this Agreement against one or more parties
hereto, (iv) customary disclosure by a Sponsor or their respective Affiliates
in connection with ordinary course business operations, including fund
raising, marketing, borrowing or reporting obligations, or to their
respective Affiliates who are subject to customary confidentiality obligations
or (v) as otherwise agreed in writing by each of Parent or either the Company
(prior to the Closing) or the Equityholders' Representative (at and after the
Closing), respectively. In the event that such disclosure, availability or
filing is required by applicable Law, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
"confidential treatment" or similar treatment of this Agreement (including
the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and to redact such terms of this Agreement
(including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto) as either the Company (prior to
the Closing) or the Equityholders' Representatives (at and after
the Closing), in the case of Parent and Merger Sub, or Parent, in the case of
the Company, shall reasonably request.

  



  

6.9 _Employment and Employee Benefits_.

  



  

(a) Parent covenants and agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries to provide to each employee of the Company or
its Subsidiaries who continues to be employed by the Surviving Corporation
and its Affiliates immediately following to the Closing (collectively, the
"Continuing Employees") (i) for a period of one (1) year following the Closing
Date, annual base salary and base wages, and cash target incentive
compensation opportunities (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding equity
incentives), in each case, that are no less favorable than such annual base
salary and base wages, and cash target incentive compensation
opportunities (for the avoidance of doubt, excluding equity incentives)
provided to the Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing, (ii)
for a period of one (1) year following the Closing Date, severance
compensation and benefits to any Continuing Employee at levels that are no
less favorable than the levels of such severance compensation and benefits as
in effect under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing
and (iii) for the period commencing on the Closing Date and ending on December
31, 2016, defined contribution and health and welfare benefits that are no
less favorable, in the aggregate, than those provided to Continuing Employees
under the Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Closing

  



    

-81- 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) For purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefits (but
not for purposes of benefit accruals under any defined benefit pension plan,
retiree medical program or any grandfathered or frozen plan) under the benefit
and compensation plans, programs, agreements and arrangements of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries in which
Continuing Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing (the
"Parent Plans"), Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall credit each
Continuing Employee with his or her years of service with the Company, its
Subsidiaries and any predecessor or other entities, to the same extent as
such Continuing Employee was entitled immediately prior to the Closing to
credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit Plan; provided,
however, that no such service shall be credited to the extent that it would
result in a duplication of benefits with respect to the same period of
service. In addition, Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries will cause (i) each Continuing Employee to be
immediately eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all
Parent Plans, (ii) for purposes of each Parent Plan providing medical, dental,
pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any Continuing Employee, all pre-
existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of such Parent
Plan to be waived for such Continuing Employee and his or her covered
dependents, to the extent such conditions were inapplicable or waived
under the comparable Company Benefit Plans in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing, and (iii) for the plan year in
which the Closing occurs, the crediting of each Continuing Employee with any
co-payments, deductibles and out-of-pocket expenses paid prior to the
Effective Time in satisfying any applicable copayments, deductibles or out-of-
pocket requirements under any Parent Plan.

  



  

(c) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, if requested by Parent

9.2 _No Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.
The parties, intending to modify any applicable statute of
limitations, acknowledge and agree that representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements of the parties contained in this Agreement shall not
survive beyond the Effective Time and there shall be no liability in respect
thereof, whether such liability has accrued prior to or after the Effective
Time, on the part of any party, its Affiliates or any of their respective
Representatives, except for (i) those covenants and agreements that by their
terms apply or are to be performed in whole or in part at or after the
Effective Time and (ii) _ARTICLE X_.

  



  

ARTICLE X 
  
  _MISCELLANEOUS_

  



  

10.1 _Remedies_.

  



  

(a) The parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would
occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at Law in the
event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in accordance
with its specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that money damages or
other legal remedies would not be an adequate remedy for any such failure to
perform or any such breach. Accordingly, the parties hereto acknowledge and
hereby agree that in the event of any breach or threatened breach by the
Company, on the one hand, or Parent or Merger Sub, on the other hand, of any
of their respective covenants or obligations set forth in this Agreement,
Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand,
shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or restrain
breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the other party (as
applicable), and to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of, or to enforce
compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the other (as applicable)
under this Agreement, without proof of actual damages or inadequacy of legal
remedy and without bond or other security being required. The pursuit of
specific enforcement or other equitable remedies by any party hereto will not
be deemed an election of remedies or waiver of the right to pursue any other
right or remedy (whether at Law or in equity) to which such party may be
entitled at any time.

  



    

-92- 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) Any and all remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party
will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other remedy
conferred hereby, or by Law or equity upon such party, and the exercise by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise at any time of any
other remedy.

  



  

(c) Each of the Company, on the one hand, and Parent and Merger Sub,
on the other hand, hereby agrees not to raise any objections to
the availability of the equitable remedy of specific performance to prevent
or restrain breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement by the Company,
or Parent or Merger Sub, as applicable, and to specifically enforce the terms
and provisions of this Agreement to prevent breaches or threatened breaches
of, or to enforce compliance with, the covenants and obligations of the
Company, or Parent and Merger Sub, as applicable, under this Agreement. The
parties hereto further acknowledge and agree that (i) by seeking the remedies
provided for in this _Section 10.1_ , a party shall not in any respect waive
its right to seek at any time any other form of relief that may be available
to a party under this Agreement (including monetary damages) and (ii) nothing
set forth in this _Section 10.1_ shall require any party hereto to institute
any proceeding for (or limit any party's right to institute any proceeding
for) specific performance under this _Section 10.1_ prior or as a condition to
exercising any termination right under _ARTICLE VIII_ (and pursuing damages
after such termination (subject to the terms of this Agreement)), nor
shall the commencement of any Legal Proceeding pursuant to this _Section
10.1_ or anything set forth in this _Section 10.1_  restrict or limit any
party's right to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms of
_ARTICLE VIII_ or pursue any other remedies under this Agreement that may be
available then or thereafter.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein or
otherwise, if a court has determined to grant an award of damages in
connection with any breach by Parent or Merger Sub of the terms or conditions
set forth in this Agreement, the Equityholders' Representative may, on behalf
of the Company Stockholders and Company Optionholders, enforce such award and
accept damages for such breach, and Parent and Merger Sub agree that such
damages shall not be limited to reimbursement of expenses or out-of-pocket
costs, and shall, in addition to any damage to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, include the benefit of the bargain lost by the Company
Stockholders and Company Optionholders (taking into consideration all
relevant matters, including the loss of the expected premium, other
combination opportunities and the time value of money) (such damages, "
_Expectation Damages_ ").

  



  

10.2 _Payment of Transfer Taxes_. All Transfer Taxes, applicable to,
or resulting from, the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
borne by the Surviving Corporation.

  



  

10.3 _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, each
of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall bear its own expenses incurred in
connection with the negotiation and execution of this Agreement and each other
agreement, document and instrument contemplated by this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. Parent and
Merger Sub shall pay the fees and expenses of the Company as contemplated by
_Sections 6.5(c)_ , _6.16(c)_ and _10.2_ and shall be responsible for the
fees and expenses of the Escrow Agent relating to the Escrow Agreement and the
Paying Agent relating to the Paying Agent Agreement.

10.4 _Entire Agreement; Amendments and Waivers_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto),
the Parent Registration Rights Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement and the Paying Agent Agreement represent the entire
understanding and agreement between the parties with respect to the subject
matter hereof. This Agreement may only be amended, restated, supplemented or
otherwise modified or waived by a written instrument signed by each of the
parties hereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that after receipt of the Company
Stockholder Approval, any amendment that would require approval of the
Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL shall be subject to receipt of such
required approval of the Company Stockholders pursuant to the DGCL. No action
taken pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf
of any party, shall be deemed to constitute a waiver by the party taking such
action of compliance with any representation, warranty, covenant or
obligation contained herein. The waiver by any party of a breach of any
provision of this Agreement shall not operate or be construed as a further or
continuing waiver of such breach or as a waiver of any other or subsequent
breach. No failure on the part of any party to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, power or remedy hereunder shall operate as a waiver
thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of such right, power or
remedy by such party preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or remedy.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, this _Section 10.4(b)_ , and _Sections 10.5(b)_ , _10.9(a)(ix)_ , 
_10.10_ , and _10.14_ (in each case, together with any related defined terms
as they affect such Section) may not be amended, modified, waived or
terminated, directly or indirectly (solely insofar as they directly relate to
the interests of the Financing Sources), in a manner that is adverse to the
rights expressly provided for therein to any Financing Source without the
prior written consent of such Financing Source.

10.5 _Governing Law; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

  



  

(a) Except as provided in _Section 10.5(b)_ , this Agreement, and
all actions, causes of action, claims, cross-claims, third-party claims or
Legal Proceedings of any kind (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort
or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules hereto), any certificate,
instrument, opinion or other documents delivered hereunder, or the
negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof (including any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim, third-party claim or Legal Proceeding of
any kind based upon, arising out of or related to any representation or
warranty made in or in connection herewith or therewith) shall be governed by
and construed in accordance with the Law of the State of Delaware, regardless
of the Laws that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of
conflicts of Laws. Except as provided in _Section 10.5(b)_ , each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally (i) submits, for itself
and its property, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of
Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court of Chancery declines to accept
jurisdiction over a particular matter, any Federal court of the United States
of America sitting in the State of Delaware), and any appellate court from
any thereof, in any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party
claim or Legal Proceeding of any kind arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, any certificate, instrument, opinion or other documents delivered
hereunder, or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof
(including any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-
party claim or Legal Proceeding of any kind based upon, arising out of or
related to any representation or warranty made in or in connection herewith
or therewith), or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and agrees
that all claims in respect of any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding of any kind shall be heard and
determined in such Delaware Court of Chancery (or, only if the Delaware Court
of Chancery declines to accept jurisdiction over a particular matter, any
Federal court of the United States of America sitting in the State of
Delaware), (ii) waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively
do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue
of any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or
Legal Proceeding of any kind arising out of or relating to this Agreement,
any certificate, instrument, opinion or other documents delivered hereunder,
or the negotiation, execution or performance hereof or thereof (including any
action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal
Proceeding of any kind based upon, arising out of or related to any
representation or warranty made in or in connection herewith or therewith) in
the Delaware Court of Chancery, any Federal court of the United States of
America sitting in the State of Delaware, or in any Delaware State
court, (iii) waives, to the fullest extent permitted by Law, the defense of
an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action, cause of action,
claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding of any kind in any
such court and (iv) agrees that a final judgment in any such action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding of any
kind shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit
on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each of the parties
hereto agrees that service of process, summons, notice or document by
registered mail addressed to it at the applicable address set forth in
_Section 10.6_ below shall be effective service of process for any action,
cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding
of any kind brought in any such court.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, each of the
parties to this Agreement (i) agrees that it will not bring or support, or
permit any of its Affiliates to bring or support, any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (and appellate
courts thereof), or if under applicable law exclusive jurisdiction is vested
in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii) irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by Law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court, (iii) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any manner
provided by Law, (iv) agrees that the Laws of the State of New York shall
govern any such action and (v) agrees that all of the provisions of _Section
10.14_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim, or third party claim referenced in this _Section
10.5(b)_.

10.7 _Release_. Effective as of the Closing, each of Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation), each of their
respective controlled Affiliates, successors and assigns (each a " _Releasing
Party_ "), hereby fully and unconditionally releases, acquits and forever
discharges the current and former managers, partners, officers and directors
of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the Sponsors, the Company Stockholders,
the Company Optionholders, and each of their respective
Affiliates, successors and assigns and each other Non-Party Affiliate (each a
" _Released Person_ ") from all debts, demands, causes of action, suits,
covenants, torts, damages and any and all claims, defenses, offsets,
judgments, demands and liabilities whatsoever, of every name and nature,
whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
known or unknown, accrued or unaccrued (collectively, " _Claims_ "), which
have been or could have been asserted against any Released Person, which any
Releasing Person has or ever had, which arises out of or in any way relates
either to a Released Person's status as a direct or indirect stockholder of
the Company or, to the extent applicable, in its capacity as a manager,
partner, officer or director of the Company, and/or to events, circumstances
or actions occurring, existing or taken prior to or as of the Closing Date in
respect of matters relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries (each a "
_Released Claim_ ");  _provided_ , that each Releasing Party retains, and do
not release, acquit or discharge any of their rights and interests (i)
against the parties to this Agreement, the Shareholders Agreement, the Company
Documents, the Confidentiality Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, the Paying
Agent Agreement or any other agreement delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) with respect to claims, actions,
causes of action or any liabilities that arise as a result of actual and
intentional fraud by a Released Person or (iii) with respect to any claim of,
or liability to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or any successors
thereof) against any Released Person to the extent resulting from the Released
Person's status as an employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub covenants and agrees that it will not, and will
cause the Surviving Corporation and their respective controlled Affiliates
not to, take any action inconsistent with this _Section 10.7_ (including
commencing any litigation with respect to, or, directly or indirectly,
transferring to another Person, any Released Claim). This _Section 10.7_
shall survive the Closing, is intended for the benefit of and may be enforced
directly by each of the Released Persons, and shall be binding on all
successors and permitted assigns of Parent and the Surviving Corporation.

10.8 _Severability_. If any condition, term or other provision of
this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced by any Law
or public policy, all other conditions, terms or provisions of this Agreement
shall nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or
legal substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal, or incapable of being enforced,
the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so
as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in an
acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties intend that the provisions of
_ARTICLE X_ , including the remedies, and limitations thereon, and the
limitations on representations, warranties and covenants, be construed as
integral provisions of this Agreement and that such provisions, remedies and
limitations shall not be severable in any manner that diminishes a party's
rights hereunder or increases a party's liability or obligations hereunder.

  



  

10.9 _Binding Effect; Assignment; Third Party Beneficiaries_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of
the parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns. Nothing in
this Agreement shall create or be deemed to create any third party beneficiary
rights in any Person not a party to this Agreement except (i) prior to the
Effective Time, for the right of the Equityholders' Representative (on behalf
of the Company Stockholders and the Company Optionholders) to pursue claims
for damages (including Expectation Damages) and other relief (including
equitable relief) for any breach of this Agreement by Parent or Merger Sub,
whether or not this Agreement has been validly terminated pursuant to
_ARTICLE VIII_ , which right is hereby expressly acknowledged and agreed by
each of Parent and Merger Sub, (ii) from and after the Effective Time, the
rights of the Company Stockholders and the Company Optionholders to receive
the Estimated Merger Consideration, the Additional Merger Consideration (if
any) and other payments according to the terms of this Agreement, in each
case, as set forth in _ARTICLE III_ , shall be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, the Company Stockholders or the Company Optionholders, as the
case may be, (iii) _Section 6.6_ shall be for the benefit of, and
enforceable by, the Indemnitees, (iv) _Section 6.6(h)_ and _Section 6.8(b)_
shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Sponsors, (v) Sections
_6.7_ , _10.2_ and _10.3_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the
Company Stockholders and the Company Optionholders, (vi) _Section 10.7_ shall
be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, each Released Person, (vii)
_Section 10.10_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Non-Party

of, and enforceable by, STB and (ix) _Sections 10.4(b)_ , _10.5(b)_ , _10.10_
 and _10.14_ shall be for the benefit of, and enforceable by, the Financing
Sources, to the extent, and only to the extent, of any rights of such
Financing Sources expressly provided for in the referenced sections.

  



    

-99- 
--- 

 



    



  

(b) No assignment of this Agreement or of any rights or obligations
hereunder may be made, directly or indirectly (by operation of Law or
otherwise), by (i) the Company, without the prior written consent of Parent,
or (ii) Parent, Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, without the prior
written consent of either the Company (prior to the Closing) or the
Equityholders' Representative (at and after the Closing), respectively. Any
attempted assignment without obtaining such required consent shall be null and
void.

  



  

10.10 _Non-Recourse_. Except as set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement, all claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether
at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) that may be based upon,
in respect of, arise under, out or by reason of, be connected with, or relate
in any manner to this Agreement, or the negotiation, execution, or performance
of this Agreement (including any representation or warranty made in, in
connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be made only
against (and such representations and warranties are those solely of) the
Persons that are expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this
Agreement (the " _Contracting Parties_ "). No Person who is not a Contracting
Party, including any current, former or future equityholder, incorporator,
controlling person, general or limited partner, member, Affiliate, assignee or
Representative of, and any financial advisor, Financing Source or lender to,
any Contracting Party, or any current, former or future
equityholder, incorporator, controlling person, general or limited partner,
member, Affiliate, assignee or Representative of, and any financial advisor,
Financing Source or lender to, any of the foregoing or any of their respective
successors, predecessors or assigns (or any successors, predecessors or
assigns of the foregoing) (collectively, the " _Non-Party Affiliates_ "),
shall have any liability (whether in Law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than as
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement), and, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all
claims, causes of action, obligations, or liabilities arising under, out of,
in connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on,
in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance, or breach (other than as set forth in the Confidentiality
Agreement) against any such Non-Party Affiliates; _provided_ , that, for
clarity, no party to the Confidentiality Agreement shall be deemed a Non-
Party Affiliate. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by Law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, (a) each Contracting Party hereby waives and
releases any and all rights, claims, demands, or causes of action that may
otherwise be available, whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or
otherwise, to avoid or disregard the entity form of a Contracting Party or
otherwise impose liability of a Contracting Party on any Non-Party Affiliate,
whether granted by statute or based on theories of equity, agency, control,
instrumentality, alter ego, domination, sham, single business enterprise,
piercing the veil, unfairness, undercapitalization, or otherwise, in each
case arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner to
this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this Agreement or
its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than as set forth
in the Confidentiality Agreement); and (b) each Contracting Party disclaims
any reliance upon any Non-Party Affiliates with respect to the performance of
this Agreement or any representation or warranty made in, in connection with,
or as an inducement to this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained herein or otherwise, after the Closing, no party may seek
to rescind this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

10.11 _Provision Respecting Legal Representation_. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company (on its behalf and on behalf of the
Surviving Corporation) hereby waives, and agrees to cause its Affiliates to
waive, any conflicts that may arise in connection with STB representing any
of the Sponsors, the Company Stockholders or their respective Affiliates
(including the Equityholders' Representative) after the Closing as such
representation may relate to Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each of
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company (on behalf of the Surviving Corporation)
hereby agrees that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing
between Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and the Equityholders'
Representative, the Sponsors, the Company Stockholders or the
Company Optionholders, on the other hand, STB may represent any or all of the
Equityholders' Representative, the Sponsors, the Company Stockholders or
Company Optionholders in such dispute even though the interests of such
Equityholders' Representative, the Sponsors, the Company Stockholders or
Company Optionholders may be directly adverse to Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates, and even though STB
formerly may have represented the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in
a matter substantially related to such dispute; provided, however, that this
sentence shall not apply if STB, at the time of such dispute, is handling
ongoing matters for Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries. In addition, all communications involving attorney-
client confidences by the Sponsors, any Company Stockholders or their
Affiliates in the course of the negotiation, documentation and consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby shall be deemed to be attorney-
client confidences that belong solely to such Sponsors and Company
Stockholders (and not the Surviving Corporation or its
Subsidiaries). Accordingly, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of STB
relating to the engagement described in this _Section 10.11_ , whether or not
the Closing shall have occurred. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the Sponsors and the applicable
Company Stockholders and their Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation
or its Affiliates) shall be the sole holders of the attorney-client
privilege with respect to such engagement, and none of the Surviving
Corporation or its Affiliates shall be a holder thereof, (ii) to the extent
that the files of STB in respect of such engagement constitute property of the
client, only the applicable Sponsors, Company Stockholders and their
Affiliates (and not the Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates) shall hold
such property rights and (iii) STB shall have no duty whatsoever to reveal or
disclose any such attorney-client communications or files to any of the
Surviving Corporation or its Affiliates by reason of any attorney-client
relationship between STB and any of the Surviving Corporation or its
Affiliates or otherwise; _provided_ , that no such Sponsors, Company
Stockholder or Affiliate thereof may waive such privilege or exercise such
property rights without the prior written consent of the Equityholders'
Representative, on behalf of all of the Sponsors and Company Stockholders.

10.12 _Parent Guarantee_. Parent agrees to take all action necessary
to cause Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to perform
all of its respective agreements, covenants and obligations under this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. Parent unconditionally guarantees to
the Company and, to the extent set forth in _Section 10.9_ , the other Persons
who are entitled to the benefit of this Agreement, the full and complete
performance by each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Corporation, as
applicable, of its respective obligations under this Agreement and shall be
liable for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or obligation
of Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, as applicable, under this
Agreement. Parent hereby waives diligence, presentment, demand of
performance, filing of any claim, any right to require any proceeding first
against Merger Sub or the Surviving Corporation, any protest, any notice and
all demands whatsoever in connection with the performance of its obligations
set forth in this _Section 10.12_ or elsewhere in this Agreement.

  



  

10.13 _Counterparts; Delivery by Facsimile or Email_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement and any amendment, restatement, supplement or
other modification hereto or waiver hereunder, (i) may be executed in
any number of counterparts (including by means of facsimile or email in .pdf
format), each of which will be deemed to be an original copy of this
Agreement and all of which, when taken together, will be deemed to constitute
one and the same agreement and (ii) to the extent signed and delivered by
means of a facsimile machine or scanned pages via e-mail, shall be treated in
all manner and respect as an original contract and shall be considered to
have the same binding legal effects as if it were the original signed version
thereof delivered in person.

  



  

(b) At the request of any party hereto, each other party hereto
shall re-execute original forms hereof and deliver them to all other
parties. No party hereto shall raise the use of a facsimile machine or email
to deliver a signature or the fact that any signature or agreement was
transmitted or communicated through the use of facsimile machine or email as a
defense to the formation of a contract, and each such party forever waives
any such defense.

  



  

(c) This Agreement is not binding unless and until signature pages
are executed, delivered and confirmed as released by each of the
Company, Parent, Merger Sub and the Equityholders' Representative, which
confirmation may be given by any Person designated on _Schedule 10.13(c)_
hereto as having the authority to so confirm with respect to the Company,
Parent, Merger Sub or the Equityholders' Representative, as applicable.

UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim or Legal Proceeding of any
kind (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise) that may
be based upon, arise out of or relate to this Agreement (including the
Exhibits and Schedules hereto), any certificate, instrument, opinion or other
documents delivered hereunder, or the negotiation, execution or performance
hereof or thereof (including any action, cause of action, claim or Legal
Proceeding of any kind or description based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection herewith or
therewith) OR ANY TRANSACTION CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY, WHETHER NOW
EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING, AND WHETHER at Law, in equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO
REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HERETO HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY HERETO WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF LITIGATION,
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (II) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED
THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (III) IT MAKES SUCH WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND
(IV) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,
THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION 10.14_.
