be made) specified by the Seller upon written notice given by the Seller,
together with the appropriate invoices, to the Buyer at least two (2) Business
Days prior to the Closing Date; and

  



  

(iii) an amount equal to the Closing Debt to be Discharged to one or more

specified by the Seller in a written notice given by the Seller to the Buyer
or in the payoff letters delivered pursuant to  _Section 2.5(b)_ , in each
case, at least two (2) Business Days prior to the Closing Date.

Transferred Securities (the "Closing") shall take place remotely by the
electronic exchange of documents or at such offices of Dechert LLP ("Dechert")
as determined by Dechert prior to the Closing, on the second Business Day on
which the last of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ (other

but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at the Closing)
to be satisfied or waived is so satisfied or waived by the appropriate party,
or at such other place, time and date as the parties may agree (the actual
date of the Closing, the "Closing Date").

Section 2.7. _Post-Closing Purchase Price Adjustment_.

  



  

(a) Within ninety (90) calendar days after the Closing Date, the Buyer shall
cause to be prepared and delivered to the Seller a statement (the
"Closing Statement") setting forth the Net Working Capital, the Net Funded
Indebtedness, the Transaction Related Expenses (to the extent unpaid as of

Statement and the calculations set forth thereon shall be prepared and
calculated in good faith, and in the manner and on a basis consistent with the
Accounting Principles (if applicable) and the definitions of "Net Working
Capital," "Net Funded Indebtedness," "Transaction Related Expenses," and
shall be in the same form and include the same line items as the calculations
of the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness,

(b) If the Closing Statement is not so timely delivered, then without any
further action of the parties, the Closing Statement shall consist of
the Estimated Net Working Capital, the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness and
the Estimated Transaction Related Expenses, and shall be deemed delivered as
such by Buyer to Seller under this Agreement (and for the avoidance of doubt,
the Seller shall be entitled to all rights set forth in the remainder of this
_Section 2.7_ ).

  



  

(c) After receipt of the Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ or
deemed receipt pursuant to _Section 2.7(b)_ , the Seller will have ninety
(90) calendar days to review the Closing Statement. Unless the Seller delivers
written notice (which notice shall include the items and amounts in dispute
and supporting documentation related thereto) to the Buyer setting forth the
items disputed by the Seller with respect thereto on or prior to the
ninetieth (90th) calendar day after the Seller's receipt of the Closing
Statement, the Seller will be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the
Closing Statement and such statement (and the calculations contained therein)
will be final, binding and conclusive for purposes of this _Article II_. If
the Seller notifies the Buyer of its objections to items contained in the
Closing Statement (or calculations contained therein) within such ninety (90)
calendar day period, the Buyer and the Seller shall, during the thirty (30)
calendar days following delivery of such notice by the Seller to the Buyer
(or such longer period as they may mutually agree in writing) (the "Resolution
Period"), attempt in good faith to resolve their differences with respect to
the disputed items (or calculations) identified in such notice (the "Disputed
Items"), and all other items (and all calculations relating thereto) will be
final, binding and conclusive for purposes of this _Article II_. Any
resolution by the Buyer and the Seller during the Resolution Period as to any
Disputed Item shall be set forth in writing and will be final, binding and
conclusive, for purposes of this _Article II_.

  



  

(d) If the Buyer and the Seller do not resolve all Disputed Items by the end
of the Resolution Period, then all Disputed Items remaining in dispute will
be submitted to

(i) PwC, or (ii) if such firm is not willing to act in such capacity, to an
independent certified public accounting firm in the United States
of international reputation mutually acceptable to Buyer and the Seller, or
(iii) if Buyer and Seller are unable to agree upon such firm within ten (10)
Business Days after the end of the Resolution Period, then within an
additional ten (10) Business Days, Buyer and Seller shall each select one
such firm and those two firms shall, within ten (10) Business Days after their
selection, select a third firm (PwC or, if applicable, the firm selected in
accordance with clause (ii) or the third firm selected in accordance with
clause (iii), the "Neutral Expert"). The Neutral Expert shall act as an
independent expert, and not an arbitrator, to determine only those Disputed
Items remaining in dispute, consistent with this _Section 2.7_. Within forty-
five (45) days following the selection and engagement of the Neutral Expert,
Buyer on the one hand, and Seller on the other hand, shall have the
opportunity to submit to the Neutral Expert one (1) written statement of
position related to the remaining Disputed Items. Within ten (10) Business
Days following the submission to the Neutral Expert of each such statement of
position, Buyer on the one hand, and Seller on the other hand, shall have the
opportunity and right to submit to the Neutral Expert one (1) written
response to the other party's statement of position. Following the expiration
of such ten (10) Business Day response period and the review of written
submission of the parties (to the extent timely received), the parties shall
request that the Neutral Expert shall make, within ten (10) Business Days
thereafter, a final determination (which shall be binding and conclusive for
purposes of this _Article II_ ) of the appropriate amount of each of the
remaining Disputed Items in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
2.7_ , the Accounting Principles (if applicable) and the definitions of "Net
Working Capital," "Net Funded Indebtedness," "Transaction Related Expenses,"
(in each case, to the extent applicable). Subject to the foregoing sentence,
the Neutral Expert shall rely on the written submissions of the parties with
respect to the matters at issue and shall not undertake an independent
investigation, or hold any hearing or other verbal inquiry. Each of the
parties shall, concurrently with the delivery of any work papers, documents,
information or material to the Neutral Expert, deliver a copy of such items
to the other party. The scope of the disputes to be determined by the Neutral
Expert shall be limited to those remaining Disputed Items, and the Neutral
Expert is not to make any other determination, including as to whether the
statement delivered pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ , the Closing Statement,
Target Net Working Capital, Net Working Capital or Net Funded
Indebtedness was determined in accordance with GAAP (other than in the case
of Net Working Capital or Net Funded Indebtedness, a determination as to
whether such items were calculated on a basis consistent with the Accounting
Principles and the definition of "Net Funded Indebtedness"), and as to
whether the definition or line items (as applicable) of Net Working Capital,
Net Funded Indebtedness, Transaction Related Expenses, or the agreed upon
dollar amount of the Target Net Working Capital is correct or appropriate. In
resolving each Disputed Item, the Neutral Expert shall be bound by the
definitions set forth for each item as set forth in this Agreement and the
principles set forth in this _Section 2.7_ and may not assign a value to any
Disputed Item greater than the greatest value for such Disputed Item claimed
by any party or less than the lowest value for such Disputed Item claimed
by any party. The parties further agree that the adjustment contemplated by
this _Section 2.7_ is intended to show (i) the change between the Estimated
Net Working Capital and the Final Net Working Capital, (ii) the change

   

-7- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

between the Estimated Net Funded Indebtedness and the Final Net Funded
Indebtedness, and (iii) the change between the Estimated Transaction Related
Expenses and the Final Transaction Related Expenses, if any, and that such
changes can only be measured if each calculation is done in a manner
consistent with the Accounting Principles (as applicable) and the definitions
of the defined terms set contained in this sentence. All fees and expenses
relating to the work, if any, to be performed by the Neutral Expert will be
allocated between the Buyer and the Seller in the same proportion that the
aggregate amount of the Disputed Items so submitted to the Neutral
Expert that is unsuccessfully disputed by each such party (as finally
determined by the Neutral Expert) bears to the total amount of such Disputed
Items so submitted. The final, binding and conclusive Closing Statement based
either upon agreement by the parties, or deemed agreement by the Buyer and
the Seller in accordance with this _Section 2.7_ , or the written
determination delivered by the Neutral Expert in accordance with this
_Section 2.7(d)_ will be the "Conclusive Closing Statement." If any party
fails to submit a statement regarding any Disputed Item submitted to the
Neutral Expert within the time determined by the Neutral Expert or otherwise
fails to give the Neutral Expert access as reasonably requested, then the
Neutral Expert shall render a decision based solely on the evidence timely
submitted and the access afforded to the Neutral Expert by the other
party. The Seller shall not have any Liability with respect to Funded
Indebtedness, Closing Date Funded Indebtedness, Transaction Related Expenses
or current assets or current liabilities (including as to accounts receivable
and the collectability thereof) or any other component of Net Working Capital
except as determined by this _Section 2.7_. If the Net Working Capital as set
forth in the Conclusive Closing Statement is greater than the Target Net
Working Capital, such difference shall be the "Final Net Working Capital
Excess Amount." If the Net Working Capital as set forth in the Conclusive
Closing Statement is less than the Target Net Working Capital, such
difference shall be the "Final Net Working Capital Deficiency Amount." If
the Estimated Net Working Capital is greater than the Net Working Capital as
set forth in the Conclusive Closing Statement, such difference shall accrue
interest from (and including) the Closing Date to (and including) the date of
the payment set forth in _Section 2.7(f)_ at a rate equal to the Interest
Rate (the "Seller Payable Interest Amount"). If the Net Working Capital as
set forth in the Conclusive Closing Statement is greater than the Estimated
Net Working Capital, such difference shall accrue interest from (and
including) the Closing Date to (and including) the date of the payment set
forth in _Section 2.7(f)_ at a rate per annum equal to the Interest Rate (the
"Buyer Payable Interest Amount"). The Net Funded Indebtedness as finally
determined in accordance with this _Section 2.7_ and set forth in the
Conclusive Closing Statement shall be the "Final Net Funded Indebtedness."
The Transaction Related Expenses as finally determined in accordance with
this  _Section 2.7_ and set forth in the Conclusive Closing Statement shall
be the "Final Transaction Related Expenses." The "Final Payment Amount" shall
be an amount in Dollars equal to (A) the Base Closing Cash Amount _plus_  (B)
the Final Net Working Capital Excess Amount, if any, _minus_ (C) the Final Net
Working Capital Deficiency Amount, if any,  _minus_ (D) the Seller Payable
Interest Amount, if any, _plus_ (E) the Buyer Payable Interest Amount, if any,
_minus_  (F) the Final Net Funded Indebtedness, _minus_ (G) the Final
Transaction Related Expenses.

(e) Subject to  _Section 2.7(f)_ :

  



  

(i) If the Closing Date Payment Amount is greater than the Final Payment
Amount (the amount by which the Closing Date Payment Amount exceeds the
Final Payment Amount, the "Adjustment Payable to Buyer"), the Seller shall
pay to the Buyer by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount
of the Adjustment Payable to the Buyer.

  



  

(ii) If the Closing Date Payment Amount is less than the Final Payment Amount
(the amount by which the Final Payment Amount exceeds the Closing
Payment Amount, the "Adjustment Payable to Seller"), the Buyer shall pay to
the Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds the amount of the
Adjustment Payable to the Seller.

  



  

Any amount payable to any party pursuant to this _Section 2.7(e)_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

  



  

(f) If, after receipt of the Closing Statement pursuant to _Section 2.7(a)_ :

  



  

(i) the Seller does not deliver a notice of dispute as described in _Section
2.7(c)_ within the ninety (90) day period following the Seller's receipt of
the Closing Statement or if within such period the Seller delivers a notice to
the Buyer stating that the Seller does not dispute any item in the Closing
Statement (such notice, a "Non-Dispute Notice"), then on the second
(2nd) Business Day following the earlier of the last day of such ninety (90)
day period or the date on which Buyer receives such Non-Dispute Notice, as
applicable, the payments set forth in _Section 2.7(e)_ shall be made in favor
of the applicable party; or

  



  

(ii) the Seller delivers a notice of dispute as described in _Section 2.7(c)_
within the ninety (90) day period following the Seller's receipt of the
Closing Statement, then within two (2) Business Days after resolution or
deemed resolution of all the Disputed Items in accordance with _Section
2.7(d)_ (whether by mutual agreement between Buyer and the Seller, or by
decision of the Neutral Expert), the payments set forth in _Section 2.7(e)_
shall be made in favor of the applicable party; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the parties hereby agree that in the event, at any time after the delivery of
such notice of dispute, the aggregate amount of the unresolved Disputed Items
represent less than $50,000.00 in controversy, (1) the payments set forth in
_Section 2.7(e)_  shall be made within two (2) Business Days in favor of the
applicable party in respect of such Closing Statement that is not (or no
longer) subject to dispute and (2) the payment of the amount of all such
unresolved Disputed Items shall be made within two (2) Business Days after
their resolution or deemed resolution in favor of the applicable party.

  



  

(g) After the Closing and until the Net Working Capital, the Net Funded
Indebtedness and the Transaction Related Expenses have been determined to
be final in accordance with _Section 2.7(d)_ , the Buyer shall, and shall
cause each Purchased

Company to, provide to the Seller and its Representatives reasonable access
during normal business hours to the Books and Records and to any
other information (to the extent permitted by applicable Law), including work
papers of their respective accountants (to the extent permitted by such
accountants), and on reasonable advance notice to Buyer and with Buyer's prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), any employees and premises during regular business hours, in each
case to the extent reasonably appropriate or necessary for the Seller to
dispute or object to all or any part of the Closing Statement, and/or
to prepare materials for presentation to the Neutral Expert in connection
with _Section 2.7_ ; _provided_ that the accountants of Buyer and Seller
shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the Neutral Expert
except in accordance with such accountants' normal disclosure procedures and
then only after such Neutral Expert has signed a customary agreement
relating to such access to work papers.

and non-exclusive

   

-14- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

licenses granted by any Purchased Company to any Person, including implied
licenses granted by any Purchased Company in connection with the sale of
products and services).

  



  

(c) Except as set forth on _Schedule 3.11(c)_ , as of the date hereof: (i)
the Purchased Companies have not received any written communication in the
last three (3) years alleging that any Purchased Company has infringed or
misappropriated any Intellectual Property Rights of any Person, (ii) to the
Seller's Knowledge, the products and services of the Purchased Companies, as
currently provided and as provided in the last three (3) years by the
Purchased Companies, do and did not infringe or misappropriate or
otherwise violate any Intellectual Property Right owned by any Person, (iii)
to the Seller's Knowledge, no Person is infringing upon or misappropriating
(or in the last three (3) years has infringed upon or misappropriated) any of
the Company Intellectual Property Rights, and (iv) in the last three (3)
years, the Purchased Companies have not sent any notice to or asserted or

(d) Other than any assets of Seller made available to the Buyer under the
Transition Services Agreement, the Purchased Companies own or have
valid rights to access and use all electronic data processing, software,
record keeping, communications, telecommunications, account management,
inventory management and other computer systems used in connection with the
Business. The Purchased Companies have taken commercially reasonable steps to
secure such systems from unauthorized access or use by any Person, and to
ensure the continued, uninterrupted and error-free operation of such systems.
Such systems are adequate in all material respects for their intended use and
for the operation of the Business as currently operated and as currently
contemplated to be operated by the Purchased Companies, and are in good
working condition (normal wear and tear excepted) and all software licenses
are renewed and up to date. To the Seller's Knowledge, no capital
expenditures are necessary with respect to the use of such systems other than
capital expenditures in the ordinary course of business that are consistent
with the past practice of the Purchased Companies.

  



  

(e) No Purchased Company has any obligation to pay any Person any royalties
or other fees for the continued use of any Company Intellectual

such royalties or other fees arising from the consummation of the

(f) No Purchased Company is subject to any Contract with any Person pursuant
to which any Purchased Company has deposited, or would be required to
deposit, into escrow the source code of any software that is material to the
business of a

   

-15-

--- 

    

Purchased Company. To the Seller's Knowledge, no Purchased Company has
disclosed or delivered the source code for any software that is material to
the operation of the business of any Purchased Company to any Person who is
not an independent contractor (subject to confidentiality obligations) or an
employee of any Purchased Company. To the Seller's Knowledge, no Intellectual
Property Right material in the operation of the business of a Purchased
Company that is comprised of software is subject to the terms of any
"open source" license that requires, or would reasonably be expected to
require, the disclosure, delivery, license or distribution of the source code
of any such software of the Purchased Company to any Person. The Purchased
Companies' use of open source software has been at all times in compliance
with the terms of the Licenses applicable to that software, other than any
noncompliance that would not reasonably be expected to have a material and
adverse impact on any of the Purchased Companies and, to the
Seller's Knowledge, has not created any obligation on any of the software
owned by the Purchased Companies.

  



  

(g) To the Seller's Knowledge, in connection with any Purchased Companies'
collection or use of any third party's personally identifiable information as
part of the Purchased Companies' conduct of their business, the Purchased
Companies have complied in all material respects with all applicable Laws in
all relevant jurisdictions and their publicly available privacy policies (if
any) relating to the collection, storage, use, and onward transfer of all
personally identifiable information collected by the Purchased Companies or
by third parties authorized by the Purchased Companies to access the Purchased
Companies' databases or other records, other than with respect to any non-
compliance that would not reasonably be expected to have a material and
adverse impact on any of the Purchased Companies.

securities exchange, as a result of the execution, delivery or performance by
the Buyer of its obligations under this Agreement or the
Ancillary Agreements, except for such Governmental Authorization or filings

timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



  

(b) No consent, approval, waiver or authorization is required to be obtained
by the Buyer from, or to be given by the Buyer to, or made by the Buyer with,

breach of or constitute a default under any Law or Governmental Authorization
to which the Buyer or its Affiliates are subject, or to which any material
property or asset of the Buyer is bound, in each case, pursuant to which such
conflict, breach, violation or default would reasonably be expected to impair
Buyer's ability to execute, deliver or perform this Agreement or any
Ancillary Agreement, or to timely consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby.

  



  

Section 4.6. _Finders ' Fees_. There is no investment banker, broker, finder

transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.7. _Litigation and Claims_. There are no Litigations pending or, to

the aggregate, would have a material adverse effect on the Buyer's ability to
execute, deliver or perform this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or to
timely consummate the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby. The Buyer
is not subject to any order, writ, judgment, award, injunction or decree of
any Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction or any arbitrator
or arbitrators that, individually or in the aggregate, would have a material
adverse effect on the Buyer's ability to execute, deliver or perform this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, or to timely consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby.

  



  

Section 4.8. _Financial Capability_. The Buyer has, and will have at Closing,
sufficient funds and adequate financial resources to satisfy its monetary and
other obligations (including to consummate the purchase and sale of the
Transferred Securities) under this Agreement, and to make all other payments
required by the terms hereof, to pay all related fees and expenses in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
to otherwise consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The Buyer
acknowledges that the obligations of the Buyer under this Agreement are not
contingent upon or subject to any conditions regarding the Buyer's, its

consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

Section 4.9. _Investment Representations_.

  



  

(a) The Buyer is acquiring the Transferred Securities solely for investment
purposes and not with a view to, or for sale in connection with, any
distribution thereof in violation of any Law (including the Securities Act),
and the Buyer is an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)
promulgated under the Securities Act.

  



  

(b) The Buyer acknowledges the Transferred Securities are not registered
under the Securities Act or any other applicable securities or "blue-sky"
Laws, and that

      

-29- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

such Transferred Securities may not be transferred or sold except pursuant to
the registration provisions of such Securities Act or pursuant to an
applicable exemption therefrom and pursuant to any other applicable
securities or "blue-sky" Laws.

  



  

(c) The Buyer understands that the acquisition of the Transferred Securities
to be acquired by it pursuant to the terms of this Agreement involves
substantial risk and that there is a limited market for the Transferred
Securities. Buyer has experience as an investor in securities of issuers such
as the securities being Transferred pursuant to this Agreement and
acknowledges that it can bear the economic risk of its investment and has
such knowledge and experience in financial or business matters that Buyer is
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of its investment in the
Transferred Securities to be acquired by it pursuant to the
transactions contemplated hereby. The overall commitment of the Buyer to
investments which are not readily marketable is not disproportionate to the
net worth of the Buyer, and the Buyer's acquisition of the Transferred
Securities will not cause such overall commitment to become excessive. In
reaching an informed decision to purchase the Transferred Securities, the
Buyer has sufficient information to evaluate the merits and risks of an
investment in the Transferred Securities and the Buyer has had the opportunity
to ask questions, and representatives of the Purchased Companies have fully
and satisfactorily answered such questions, which Buyer or duly
authorized Representatives of Buyer desired to ask concerning the Purchased
Companies or the Transferred Securities. The Buyer is not relying on any of
the Purchased Companies, the Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates with respect to the corporate tax, legal and economic
considerations involved in its investment in the Purchased Companies Company.
The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that it (i) has had reasonable access to
(A) the Books and Records of the Purchased Companies and (B) the Data Room
maintained in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and (ii) has conducted its own independent investigation of the
Purchased Companies, their respective businesses and the transactions
contemplated hereby, and has not relied on any representation, warranty or
other statement by the Seller, the Company, any other Purchased Company, or
any of their respective Affiliates or Representatives, other than the
representations and warranties of the Company expressly contained in _Article
III_ of this Agreement and that all other representations and warranties are
specifically disclaimed.

  



  

(d) The Buyer acknowledges that the offer and sale of the Transferred
Securities to be acquired by it in the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement has not been accomplished by general solicitation or the publication
of any advertisement, including any advertisement, article, notice or other
communication published in any newspaper, magazine or similar media, or
broadcast over television or radio, or any seminar or meeting whose attendees
have been invited by any general solicitation or general advertising.

  



  

(e) There are no existing Contracts pursuant to which the Buyer will divest
or otherwise dispose of the Transferred Securities or the assets of or equity
in, or by any other manner, any Purchased Company.

respective debts as they become due and shall own property which has a fair
saleable value greater than the amounts required to pay their respective debts
(including a reasonable estimate of the amount of all contingent
liabilities). Immediately after giving effect to the Closing (and any
transactions related thereto or incurred in connection therewith), each of
the Buyer and the Purchased Companies shall have adequate capital to carry on
their respective businesses. No transfer of property is being made and no
obligation is being incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated

or future creditors of the Buyer or any of the Purchased Companies.

expressly set forth in this _Article IV_ or in the officer's
certificate delivered to the Seller pursuant to _Section 2.6(a)_ , the Buyer
does not make any representation or warranty, express or implied, at Law or
in equity, with respect to itself or any of its Affiliates, or any of their
respective assets, liabilities, businesses or operations, and any such other
representations or warranties are hereby expressly disclaimed. The Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly set forth in _Article III_
or in the officer's certificate delivered to the Buyer pursuant to _Section
2.5(e)_ , none of the Seller, the Company or any of their respective
Affiliates has made any representation or warranty, express or implied, at
Law or in equity, with respect to itself, the Purchased Companies or any of
their other Affiliates, or any of their respective assets, liabilities,
business or operations, including in respect of the correctness, accuracy or
completeness of any information made available, or to be furnished or made
available (including by way of information included or referred to in the
Data Room or otherwise), or statement made (whether orally or in writing), by
the Seller, the Company, any of their Affiliates, or their respective
Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated herein. The
Buyer and its Representatives have had access to and the opportunity to
review all of the documents in the virtual data room located at
https://services.intralinks.com/web/index.html?_ga=2.215462295.1418753754.1506957893-1630034229.1464448551#workspace/4287035/documents (the

obligations, (ii) adequately supported by consideration from the Buyer for the
benefit of the Seller and (iii) necessary for the protection of the Business

restrictions or covenants contained in this _Section 5.9_ is held to cover a
geographic area or to be for a length of time which is not permitted by
applicable Law, or in any way construed to be too broad or to any extent
invalid, a court of competent jurisdiction shall construe and interpret or

Affiliate thereof for the benefit of any Employee (such annual cash incentive
plan, the "Annual Cash Incentive Plan" and such long-term cash incentive
plan, the "Long-Term Cash Incentive Plan"), the Buyer shall honor and assume
liability for the existing Annual Cash Incentive Plan for fiscal year 2018

employee shall continue to participate in the applicable long-term disability
plan sponsored by Seller or an Affiliate thereof (each, a "Seller LTD Plan")
in accordance with and subject to the terms thereof, as in effect from time
to time, (II) subject to the LTD Employee notifying the Buyer that such LTD
Employee is no longer entitled to receive benefits under the terms of any
Seller LTD Plan (other than due to the expiration of the stated benefit
payment period under such Seller LTD Plan), the Buyer shall make an offer of
employment, and hire, such LTD Employee on the terms set forth in this
_Article VI_ , and (II) except as required by applicable law or regulation,
such an offer shall only be made if the LTD Employee is able to return to
active employment within one (1) year after the Closing Date. From and after
the Closing, the Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, (A) provide
coverage for Employees and their eligible dependents under its or their
medical, dental, vision, disability, and all other health and welfare plans
without interruption of coverage; (B) cause there to be waived under any such
plan any pre-existing condition, actively at work requirements, waiting
periods and any other similar restriction; and (C) if Buyer can obtain from
the Seller's health insurance provider(s) the necessary and applicable year-
to-date detail of employee deductible and out-of-pocket expenses, cause the
Buyer Plans to honor any expenses incurred by the Employees and their
eligible dependents under similar plans of the Purchased Companies prior to
the Closing in the plan year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of
satisfying applicable deductible, co-insurance and maximum out-of-pocket
expenses, and with respect to any lifetime maximums, as if there had been a
single continuous employer. Nothing herein shall (x) limit the obligation of
the Buyer or any of its Affiliates (which shall include the Purchased
Companies following the Closing) to maintain any compensation arrangement or
benefit plan that, pursuant to an existing contract, must be maintained for a
period longer than the Continuation Period or (y) prevent the Buyer or its
Affiliates (which shall include the Purchased Companies following the
Closing) from terminating the employment of any Employee during the
Continuation Period in compliance with applicable Law and _Section 6.1(b)_.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, and without
limiting the provisions of _Section 6.1(a)_ , during the Continuation Period,
the Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (which shall include the
Purchased Companies following the Closing) to, maintain, assume and continue
to provide severance pay for the benefit of each Employee that is no less
favorable than the severance pay provided by the Purchased Companies or the
Seller or any of its Affiliates in respect of each such Employee as of the
date hereof, as set forth in _Schedule 6.1(b)_.

  



  

Section 6.2. _Credit for Service and Benefit Accrual_. For purposes of

in which Employees are eligible to participate following the Closing
(including any applicable 401(k), medical, dental, disability, life insurance,
vacation, other leave entitlements, incentive, severance or separation pay
plans), the Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates (which shall include
the Purchased Companies following the Closing) to, give each Employee full
credit under each such Buyer Plan for all service with the Purchased
Companies, their Affiliates and any predecessor employer to the same extent
as such service was recognized for such purpose by the Purchased Companies
and/or their Affiliates; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service shall not
be credited to the extent that it would result in a duplication of benefits.

Section 6.3. _Seller Qualified Plans_. As of the Closing, the Buyer shall
cause Employees to be covered under one or more defined contribution
plans intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that is a cash or
deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code (collectively, the
"Buyer 401(k) Plan") and shall permit each Employee participating in any
defined contribution plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code that is a cash or deferred arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Code
and is maintained by any Purchased Company, the Seller or any Affiliate
thereof (the "Seller 401(k) Plan") to effect, and the Buyer agrees to cause
the Buyer 401(k) Plan to accept, in accordance with Law, a trustee to trustee
rollover of the Employee's account balances (including earnings thereon
through the date of transfer and promissory notes evidencing all outstanding
loans) under the Seller 401(k) Plan if such rollover to the Buyer 401(k) Plan
is elected in accordance with applicable Law by such Employee. The Buyer
shall permit each Employee who is eligible for a distribution under the
Seller ESOP to roll any such cash distribution into a defined contribution
plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code that is maintained
by Buyer and that accepts "eligible rollover distributions" as defined in
Section 402 of the Code.

  



  

Section 6.4. _COBRA_. Except as set forth in the Transition Services
Agreement, from and after the Closing, the Buyer and its Affiliates (which

qualified beneficiaries and dependents) whose qualifying event occurs on or
after the Closing.

  



  

Section 6.5. _Flexible Spending Accounts_. Except to the extent provided
under the Transition Services Agreement, as of the Closing Date, the

health care flexible spending account plan and dependent care spending
account plan (each, a "Buyer Spending Account") with an amount available for
reimbursement between the Closing Date and the end of the calendar year in
which the Closing Date occurs equal to the amounts available for
reimbursement for such period under Seller's or its Affiliates' spending
account plans of corresponding type (each, a "Seller Spending Account") with
respect to such Transferred Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date.
The Buyer shall give effect under the Buyer Spending Accounts to elections
made by the Transferred Employees with respect to the corresponding
Seller Spending Accounts in respect of the calendar year in which the Closing
Date occurs, subject to the terms and conditions then applicable to the Buyer
Spending Accounts (including dollar limitations in effect for the year). If
the amounts contributed (by salary reduction or otherwise) by a Transferred
Employee under a Seller Spending Account arrangement for the portion of the
calendar year ending on the Closing Date exceeds the sum of the claims under
such Seller Spending Account already reimbursed to the Transferred
Employee or claimed for reimbursement by the Transferred Employee in respect
of the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs, the Seller shall
transfer to the Buyer on the Closing Date an amount equal to the lesser of (i)
such excess or (ii) the excess of the dollar limitation for the year
applicable to the corresponding Buyer Spending Account over the sum of the
claims reimbursed to or claimed for reimbursement by the Transferred
Employee. If the sum of the claims reimbursed to or claimed for reimbursement
by the Transferred Employee in respect of the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs exceeds the amount of the Seller Spending Account balance
for a Transferred Employee as of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall transfer to
the Seller on the Closing Date an amount equal to the

   

-48- 
--- 

  

--- 

    

lesser of (i) such excess or (ii) the excess of the dollar limitation for the
year applicable to the corresponding Buyer Spending Account over the amount
of the Seller Spending Account balance credited to the Buyer Spending Account.

all vacation days and other paid time off accrued on the Financial
Statements but not yet taken by the Employees as of the Closing Date.

(a) During the period through the Closing Date, the Seller shall not
implement, or permit any Purchased Company to implement, any plant closing or
mass layoff within the meaning of the WARN Act of any similar Law.

  



  

(b) Following the Closing Date, the Buyer shall not implement, or permit any
Purchased Company to implement, any plant closings, mass layoffs,
employee layoffs, or similar events that individually or in the aggregate
would give rise to any obligations or liabilities on the part of the Seller
or any Affiliate thereof under the WARN Act or any similar Law, and the Buyer
shall cause each of the Purchased Companies to provide any required notice
under the WARN Act or any similar Law, and to otherwise comply with any such
Law with respect to any "plant closing" or "mass layoff" (as defined in the
WARN Act or similar Law) or employee layoff or similar event affecting the
employees of any Purchased Company.

  



  

Section 6.8. _No Amendment_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, nothing contained in this _Article VI_ shall (i) be deemed to be
the adoption of, or an amendment to, any employee benefit plan, program,
arrangement, contract or practice, or otherwise limit the right of the
Seller, the Purchased Companies, the Buyer or their respective Affiliates, to
amend, modify or terminate any employee benefit plan, program, arrangement,
contract or practice, (ii) confer upon any individual any right to
employment for any period of time, or any right to a particular term or

The Buyer and the Seller agree to (i) allocate all items (other than items
relating to actions taken on the Closing Date outside the ordinary course of
business at the direction of the Buyer) accruing on the Closing Date for U.S.

in a manner that is consistent with those prepared for prior taxable
periods unless a different treatment of any item is required by applicable
Law. The Seller shall provide a copy of each such Seller Prepared Return (but
not, for the avoidance of doubt, any consolidated, combined, unitary or
similar Tax Return of which Seller is a member) to the Buyer at least sixty
(60) days prior to the due date (or if such filing due date is sooner as soon
as reasonably practicable) of such Seller Prepared Return, and the Buyer and
its authorized representative(s) shall have the right to review and comment
on any such Seller Prepared Return prior to filing. The Seller shall reflect,
or cause to be reflected, any reasonable comments provided in writing by the
Buyer no later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date of such Seller

Return when due (including any extensions), and shall remit any Taxes due with
respect to such Tax Returns.

  



  

(c) The Buyer shall not, without the prior written consent of the Seller
(such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed): (i)

Purchased Company to file, refile, amend, revoke or otherwise modify any Pre-
Closing Tax Return any Tax election or Tax Return with respect to any Pre-
Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period or which could otherwise adversely
impact the Tax Liability of the Seller (or any of the Seller's direct or
indirect owners or Affiliates); (ii) apply to any Taxing Authority for any
binding or non-binding opinion, ruling or other determination in relation to
any act, matter or transaction covered by any Tax Return with respect to any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or any act, matter or transaction occurring on or

-50- 
--- 

  

--- 

   

Transfer Taxes shall be prepared by the Buyer; _provided_ that the Seller

the extent required by applicable Law.

liable.

  



  

(b) The Seller shall have the right to (i) represent the interests of the
Purchased Companies in any Tax Claim relating any Pre-Closing Tax Period or
Straddle Period and (ii) employ counsel of the Seller's choice in connection
therewith; _provided_ , _however_ , that with respect to any such Tax Claim,
the Buyer and the Purchased Companies shall have the right, directly or
through their designated representatives, to review in advance and comment
upon all submissions made in the course of such Tax Claim and
otherwise participate in such Tax Claim, and the Seller shall not settle or
otherwise dispose of any such Tax Claim to the extent any such settlement
would adversely impact any Taxes of the Buyer (or its Affiliates) that would
not be a Pre-Closing Tax without obtaining the prior written consent of the
Buyer, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

  



  

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, control of Tax Claims shall be governed by
this _Section 7.3_ and not _Article IX_.

Agreement, the determination of the amount of Taxes allocable to the
portion of the Straddle Period ending on and including, and the portion of
the Straddle Period beginning after, the Closing Date shall be determined by
assuming that the Straddle Period consisted of two taxable periods, one that
ended at the close of the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing Portion") and the
other that began at the beginning of the day following the Closing Date (the
"Post-Closing Portion"), and items of income, gain and deduction, loss or
credit and state and local apportionment factors of the Purchased Companies
for the Straddle Period shall be allocated between such two taxable periods
on a "closing of the books basis" by assuming that the Straddle Period ended
as of the close of business on the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that (a) exemptions, allowances or deductions that are calculated on an annual
basis, such as depreciation, and (b) periodic Taxes, such as property or
similar _ad valorem_ Taxes, shall be apportioned ratably between the Pre-
Closing Portion and the Post-Closing Portion on the basis of the number of
days elapsed in each such portion of the Straddle Period.

  



  

Section 7.5. _Assistance and Cooperation_. Following the Closing Date, each
of the Buyer and the Seller shall cooperate fully in preparing any Tax

payments in respect thereof, including (a) providing timely notice to the
other of any pending or proposed audits or assessments with respect to Taxes
for which such other party or any of its Affiliates may have a Liability

useful for such purposes, in each case, whether or not in existence as of the
Closing Date.

Books and Records in existence on the Closing Date and, following the Closing
Date, shall provide the Seller access to such Books and Records and the
equivalent Books and Records prepared following the Closing Date for
inspection and copying by the Seller and its Affiliates, or their agents upon
reasonable request and upon reasonable notice. After the expiration of such
period, no Books and Records shall be destroyed by the Buyer without first
advising the Seller in writing and giving the Seller a reasonable opportunity
to obtain possession thereof, with any costs of transferring the Books and
Records to be paid by the Seller.

corresponding provisions of foreign, state, local or other income tax Law, to

the Seller and the Company expressly and specifically set forth in _Article
III_ of this Agreement constitute the sole and exclusive representation,
warranties, and statements (including by omission) of any kind of the Seller,
the Company or any of their respective Representatives or Affiliates in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and neither
the Seller nor the Company, or any of their respective Representatives or
Affiliates, has made, and do not make and each specifically negates
and disclaims any representations, warranties, promises, covenants,
agreements, guaranties or statements (including by omission) of any kind or
character whatsoever, whether express or implied, oral or written, past,
present, or future, of, as to, concerning, with respect to, or in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (except as, and solely to
the extent, specifically set forth in this Agreement), including with respect
to: (A) the future or historical nature, quality or condition (financial
or otherwise) of the assets of the Purchased Companies; (B) the suitability
of the assets of the Purchased Companies for any and all activities and uses
that the Buyer may, or may cause any Purchased Company to, conduct therewith
or thereon; and (C) the accuracy or completeness of any other information
provided to (or otherwise acquired by) the Buyer or any of its Representatives
or Affiliates.

Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all Losses incurred or
suffered by a Buyer Indemnified Party resulting from, arising out of or
related to:

(a) any breach or inaccuracy of any representation or warranty made by the
Buyer in this Agreement;

  



  

(b) any breach of any covenant or agreement of the Buyer or a Purchased

(a) The indemnification provided for in _Section 9.3_ and _Section 9.4_ is
subject to the following limitations:

  



  

(i) The Seller shall not be liable to the Buyer Indemnified Parties for any
Losses with respect to the matters described in _Section 9.3(a)_ (except for
Losses resulting from, arising out of or related to any breach or inaccuracy
of any Company Fundamental Representation) unless such Losses exceed an

(ii) The maximum aggregate Liability of the Seller to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties for claims (x) described in _Section 9.3(a)_  (except for
claims resulting from, arising out of or related to any breach or inaccuracy
of any Company Fundamental Representation) shall not exceed $2,375,000.00
(the "Cap"), and (y) resulting from, arising out of, or related to matters
described in _Section 9.3_ shall not exceed the Base Closing Cash Amount.

  



  

(iii) The maximum aggregate Liability of the Buyer to indemnify the Seller
Indemnified Parties for claims resulting from, arising out of, or related to
matters described in _Section 9.4(a)_ and/or _Section 9.4(b)_ shall not exceed
the Base Closing Cash Amount.

  

  



  

(iv) Neither the Seller nor Buyer shall have any obligations under or
liabilities in respect of _Section 9.3_ or _Section 9.4_ from and after the
applicable Survival Date; _provided_ that any claim for indemnity made by a
Buyer Indemnified Party or Seller Indemnified Party under _Section 9.3_ or
_Section 9.4_ , as the case may be, in accordance with the terms of this
_Article IX,_ prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Date will
survive beyond the applicable Survival Date until such claim is finally and
conclusively resolved.

  



  

(v) Neither any Indemnified Party, nor any Indemnified Parties as a group or
class, shall be entitled to recover from an Indemnifying Party pursuant to
this _Article IX_ more than once in respect of the same Losses suffered.

   

-57- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(vi) An Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any Losses in respect of
any Liability or Loss which is contingent unless and until such
contingent Liability or Loss becomes an actual Liability or Loss and is due
and payable.

  



  

(vii) The Seller shall not be liable under this _Article IX_ for any Losses
in respect of any claim or any matter, act, omission or circumstance (or any
combination thereof) that would not have occurred but for: (A) any action
taken or omitted to the extent expressly required by this Agreement or
otherwise at the request of or with the written approval of any Buyer
Indemnified Party; (B) any action taken or omitted by any Buyer Indemnified
Party after the Closing (including any reorganization, transfer or sale of any
Purchased Company or its business), and/or (C) any Non-Permitted Testing.

  



  

(b) Each Indemnified Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to mitigate
any indemnifiable Loss, and in the event that such Indemnified Party fails to
so mitigate an indemnifiable Loss, the applicable Indemnifying Party shall
have no Liability for any portion of such Loss that reasonably could have
been avoided had such Indemnified Party made such efforts.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, except for a Fraud Claim
and except as provided in _Section 2.7_ (Post-Closing Purchase
Price Adjustment), _Article VII_ (Tax Matters), _Article X_ (Termination),
_Section 11.6_ (Equitable Relief), or _Section 11.17_ (Prevailing Party), the
rights and remedies of an Indemnified Party under this _Article IX_ are
exclusive and in lieu of any and all other rights and remedies which such
Indemnified Party may have under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or
otherwise against each other with respect to this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement and with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby, and the Buyer, the Company and the Seller each expressly waives and
releases and agrees to waive and release any and all other rights or causes
of action it or its Affiliates may have against the other party or its
Affiliates now or in the future under any Law (regardless of the theory of
recourse) with respect to the preceding matters.

  



  

Section 9.6. _Adjustments to Losses_.

  



  

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no Buyer Indemnified
Party shall have any right to indemnification under this _Article IX_  with
respect to any Losses to the extent such Losses relate to any item included
on, or is a Liability reserved or accrued for in the Closing Statement or the
calculation of the Final Payment Amount (or any component thereof) (as finally
agreed upon or determined pursuant to _Section 2.7_ ) or that is otherwise
taken into account in the calculation of any adjustment to the Purchase
Price pursuant to _Section 2.7_.

  



  

(b) For all purposes of this _Article IX_ , "Losses" shall be net of any
amounts paid or payable to an Indemnified Party under any insurance policy or
Contract in connection with the facts giving rise to the right of
indemnification hereunder, and each Indemnified Party shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to recover all amounts payable from an insurer
or other third party under any such insurance policy or Contract

   

-58- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

prior to seeking indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that the amount deemed
to be paid under such insurance policies shall be net of (i) the deductible
for such policies, (ii) any increase in the premium for such policies, if
applicable, arising from such Losses, and (iii) any out-of-pocket costs of
receiving or recovering such amounts under such policies.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this _Article IX_ , no
Indemnifying Party shall have any Liability for any Losses that are
not reasonably foreseeable as of the date of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.7. _Indemnification Procedures_.

  



  

(a) _Third Party Claim_.

  



  

(i) In the event that any written claim or demand for which an Indemnifying
Party may have Liability to any Indemnified Party hereunder is asserted
against or sought to be collected from any Indemnified Party by a third party
(a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party Claim, the amount or the estimated
amount of damages sought thereunder to the extent then ascertainable, any
other remedy sought thereunder, any relevant time constraints relating
thereto, a reasonably detailed explanation of the events giving rise to such
Third-Party Claim and any other material details pertaining thereto (a "Claim
Notice"); _provided_ that the failure to timely give a Claim Notice shall not
relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to
the Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified Party's receipt
thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court
papers) received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(ii) In the event that the Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party
that it elects to defend the Indemnified Party against a Third-Party Claim,
the Indemnifying Party shall have the right to defend the Indemnified Party by
appropriate proceedings and shall have the sole power to direct and control
such defense at its expense. Once the Indemnifying Party has made such
election to control the defense of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall have the right to participate in (but not control) any such
defense and to employ separate counsel of its choosing at such Indemnified
Party's expense. The Indemnifying Party shall not, without the prior written
consent of the Indemnified Party, settle, compromise or offer to settle or
compromise any Third-Party Claim if the terms of such settlement would result
in (A) the imposition of a consent order, injunction or decree that would
restrict the future activity or conduct of the Indemnified Party, or (B) a
finding or admission of a violation of Law by the Indemnified Party that
would have a material and adverse effect on the Indemnified Party. Whether or
not the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third-Party Claim, the
Indemnified Party shall not admit any Liability with respect to, settle,
compromise or discharge, such Third-Party Claim without the

   

-59- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

Indemnifying Party's prior written consent. If the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of a Third-Party Claim and is in good faith contesting such
Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any
settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the
Indemnifying Party may reasonably recommend and that by its terms (x)
obligates the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of Losses in
connection with such Third-Party Claim or (y) releases the Indemnified Party
in connection with such Third-Party Claim.

  



  

(iii) The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall cooperate in
order to ensure the proper and adequate defense of a Third-Party Claim,
including by providing reasonable access to each other's relevant Books and
Records and applicable employees. Such cooperation shall include the
retention and (upon the Indemnifying Party's request) the provision to the
Indemnifying Party of Books and Records and information that are reasonably
relevant to such Third-Party Claim, and making applicable employees and
Representatives available on a mutually convenient basis during normal
business hours. The Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to avoid production of confidential
information (consistent with applicable Law), and to cause all
communications among employees, counsel and others representing any party to
a Third-Party Claim to be made so as to preserve any applicable attorney-
client or work-product privileges.

  



  

(b) _Direct Claim_. Each Indemnified Party shall assert any claim on account
of any Losses which do not result from a Third-Party Claim (a "Direct Claim")
by giving the Indemnifying Party written notice thereof reasonably promptly.
Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall describe the Direct Claim in
reasonable detail, include copies of all available material written evidence
thereof and indicate the estimated amount, if reasonably practicable, of
Losses that have been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party;
_provided_ that the failure to timely give such notice shall not affect the
rights of an Indemnified Party except to the extent that the Indemnifying
Party shall have been actually and materially prejudiced by such failure.

  



  

(c) _Tax Contests_. In the event of any conflict between this _Section 9.7_
and _Section 7.3_ with respect to Tax claims, the provisions of _Section 7.3_
shall control.

  



  

Section 9.8. _Investigation by Indemnifying Parties_. In connection with any
claim pursuant to this _Article IX_ :

  



  

(a) The Indemnified Parties shall allow, and shall cause their Affiliates to
allow, the Indemnifying Party and its financial, accounting or legal
advisers to investigate the fact, matter or circumstance alleged to (or which
may) give rise to such claim and whether and to what extent any amount is or
may be payable in respect of such claim.

  



  

(b) The Indemnified Parties shall disclose to the Indemnifying Party all
material of which they are aware which relates to the claim and shall,
and shall cause their Affiliates and all of their respective employees and
financial, accounting and legal advisors to, provide such information and
assistance as the Indemnifying Party or its financial, accounting or legal
advisers shall reasonably request, as follows:

   

-60- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

  

(i) access to premises and relevant personnel; and

  



  

(ii) the right to examine and copy or photograph any relevant assets,
accounts, correspondence, documents and records.

  



  

Section 9.9. _Characterization of Indemnification Payments_. All payments
made (or deemed to be made, in accordance with this Agreement) by any
Indemnifying Party to an Indemnified Party with respect to any claim pursuant
to _Section 9.3_ or _Section 9.4_ shall be treated, to the fullest extent
possible under applicable Law, as adjustments to the Purchase Price for Tax
purposes.

  



  

Article X 
  
 TERMINATION

  



  

Section 10.1. _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated at any time
prior to the Closing:

  



  

(a) by written agreement of the Buyer, the Company and the Seller;

  



  

(b) by any one of the Buyer, the Seller or the Company, by delivering written
notice of such termination to the other parties if the Closing shall not have
occurred, subject to _Section 11.6_ , on or before May 15, 2018 ( _provided_
that such date may be extended by an additional 210 days, at the Seller's
discretion (such later date, the "Extended Date"), in the event that on May
15, 2018 all of the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_ , other than solely
the condition set forth in _Section 8.1(a)_ , have been satisfied (other than
conditions which are to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing, which
are fully capable of being satisfied at Closing) or waived; the later of May
15, 2018 or the Extended Date, the "Outside Date");  _provided_ that neither
the Seller nor the Company, on the one hand, nor the Buyer, on the other hand,
may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(b)_ at any time
during which the Seller or the Company, on the one hand, or the Buyer, on the
other hand, is in material breach of this Agreement;

  



  

(c) by any one of the Buyer, Seller or Company, by delivering written notice
to the other parties, if any Governmental Entity has issued a final, non-
appealable order that remains outstanding prohibiting or making illegal the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; _provided_
that neither the Seller nor the Company, on the one hand, nor the Buyer, on
the other hand, may terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section
10.1(c)_ in the event such order is issued due to the failure of such party
to have fulfilled any of its obligations under this Agreement;

  



  

(d) by the Buyer, by delivering written notice to the Seller and the Company
at any time prior to the Closing, (i) if there has been a material violation
or breach by any of the Seller or the Company of any representation or
warranty set forth in _Article III_ (or any such representation or warranty
shall have become untrue in any material respect after the date of this
Agreement) or any covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which
would, in either case, prevent the satisfaction of or result in the failure

   

-61- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

of any condition to the obligations of the Buyer to consummate the Closing,
and (ii) such violation or breach has not been waived by the Buyer or, in the
case of a breach of any covenant or agreement under this Agreement that is
curable, has not been cured by the Seller or the Company prior to the earlier
to occur of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by the Seller and Company of
written notice of such breach from the Buyer and (y) the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Buyer may not terminate this Agreement
pursuant to this _Section 10.1(d)_ at any time during which the Buyer is in
material breach of this Agreement; and

  



  

(e) by either the Seller or the Company, by delivering written notice to the
Buyer at any time prior to the Closing, (i) if there has been a material
violation or breach by the Buyer of any representation or warranty set forth
in _Article IV_ (or any such representation or warranty shall have become
untrue in any material respect after the date of this Agreement), or any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement which would, in either
case, prevent the satisfaction of or result in the failure of any condition to
the obligations of the Seller and the Company to consummate the Closing, and
(ii) such violation or breach has not been waived by the Seller or Company,
as applicable, or, in the case of a breach of any covenant or agreement under
this Agreement that is curable, has not been cured by the Buyer prior to the
earlier to occur of (x) thirty (30) days after receipt by the Buyer of written
notice of such breach from the Seller or Company or (y) the Outside Date;
_provided_ , _however_ , that neither the Seller nor the Company may
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 10.1(e)_ at any time during
which the Seller or the Company is in material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 10.2. _Effect of Termination_. In the event of the termination of
this Agreement in accordance with _Section 10.1_ , this Agreement, insofar as
it relates to the parties' rights and obligations relating thereto, shall
thereafter become void and have no effect, and no party shall have any
Liability to the other party or their respective Affiliates, or their
respective directors, officers, shareholders, partners, members, attorneys,
accountants, agents, representatives or employees or their heirs, successors
and permitted assigns, except for the obligations of the parties contained in
_Section 5.4_ , _Section 5.16_ , this _Section 10.2_ , and _Article XI_
(including _Section 11.6)_ (and any related definitional provisions set forth
in _Article I_ or _Appendix A_ ), and except that nothing in this _Section
10.2_ shall relieve either party from Liability for any pre-termination
willful breach of a covenant made by such party in the Agreement. For
purposes of clarification, the parties hereto agree that if a party does not
close the transactions contemplated hereby in circumstances in which all of
the conditions set forth in _Section 8.1,_  and _Section 8.2_ or _Section
8.3_ (as applicable) (other than conditions to be performed at the Closing),
have been satisfied by the other parties, or waived by the first party, such
failure or refusal to close shall be deemed to be a willful breach of a
covenant of such first party under this Agreement by such first party. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force
and effect and survive the termination of this Agreement.

Section 11.2. _Amendment; Waiver_. Any provision of this Agreement may be
amended or waived if, and only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and
signed, in the case of an amendment, by the Buyer, the Company and the Seller,
or in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom such waiver is intended
to be effective. No failure or delay by any party in exercising any right,
power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any
single or partial exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendments to _Section 11.2_ , _Section
11.3_ , _Section 11.9_ , _Section 11.10_ , or _Section 11.15_  (or any other
provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment would modify the
substance of such foregoing Sections), in each case to the extent such
amendment would adversely affect the rights of a Financing Source under such
Section, shall also be approved by such Financing Source.

  



  

Section 11.3. _No Assignment or Benefit to Third Parties_. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party to this Agreement may assign any of
its rights or delegate any of its obligations under this Agreement without the
prior written consent of the other party hereto and any purported assignment
in violation of the foregoing shall be null and void _ab initio;_ _provided_
,  _however_ , that (a) at least five (5) Business Days prior to Closing, in
writing to Seller, Buyer may designate one or more of its Affiliates as a
transferee of all or any portion of the Transferred Securities and/or any
other Equity Interests of the Purchased Companies, and at Closing, such
Transferred Securities or other Equity Interests of the Purchased Companies so
designated shall be sold, assigned, conveyed and delivered to such identified
Affiliate of Buyer, it being acknowledged that the foregoing provision shall
not relieve Buyer of any of its obligations under this Agreement ( _provided_
, _however_ , no such designation or transfer contemplated in this clause (a)
shall be permitted if such designation or transfer could reasonably be
expected to delay the consummation of Closing or cause the Seller, the
Purchased Companies (prior to Closing) or any Affiliate of the foregoing to
incur any out-of-pocket costs, fees, taxes, charges or other expenses of any
nature (unless the Buyer is willing to reimburse the Seller, the Purchased
Companies or any Affiliate for such costs, fees, taxes, charges or expenses)),
and (b) Buyer may collaterally assign its rights under this Agreement to its
debt financing sources (including the Financing Sources) or any
collateral agent or trustee therefor without any other parties' consent.
Except as expressly set forth in _Section 11.15_ , _Section 11.16_ , _Article
IX_ , nothing in this Agreement, express or implied, is intended to confer
upon any Person other than the Buyer, the Company and the Seller, and their
respective successors, legal representatives and permitted assigns, any
rights, benefits or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (A) _Section 11.16_ and this sentence of 
_Section 11.3_ shall be enforceable by Dechert as if Dechert was directly
party hereto, to the extent rights are granted in  _Section 11.16_ to
Dechert, and (B) this

--- 

    

_Section 11.3_ , and _Section 11.2_ , _Section 11.9_ , _Section 11.10_ , and
_Section 11.15_ shall each inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by,
each Financing Source and its successors and assigns.

  



  

Section 11.4. _Entire Agreement; Inconsistency_. This Agreement (including
all Schedules, Exhibits and Appendices hereto), the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements contain the entire agreement among the
parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, with
respect to such matters. In the event and to the extent that there shall be
an inconsistency between the provisions of this Agreement and the provisions
of the Confidentiality Agreement or an Ancillary Agreement, this Agreement
shall prevail. The provisions of this Agreement shall be construed
according to their fair meaning and neither for nor against any party hereto
irrespective of which party caused such provisions to be drafted. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges that it has been represented by an attorney in
connection with the preparation and execution of this Agreement, the
Confidentiality Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements.

  



  

Section 11.5. _Satisfaction of Obligations_. Any obligation of any party to
any other under this Agreement, that is performed, satisfied or fulfilled
completely by an Affiliate of such party shall be deemed to have been
performed, satisfied or fulfilled by such party.

  



  

Section 11.6. _Equitable Relief_. The parties hereto agree that if any of the
provisions of this Agreement were not to be performed by a party hereto, as
required by their specific terms or were to be otherwise breached, irreparable
damage will occur to the other parties hereto, no adequate remedy at Law
would exist and damages would be difficult to determine, and that such
other parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to
prevent breaches, and to specific performance of the terms, of this Agreement
(including causing the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated on
the terms and subject to the conditions thereto set forth in this Agreement)
without posting any bond and without proving that monetary damages would be
inadequate, in addition to any other remedy at Law or equity. No party hereto
shall oppose, argue, contend or otherwise be permitted to raise as a defense
that an adequate remedy at Law exists or that specific performance or
equitable or injunctive relief is inappropriate or unavailable. The parties
hereto further agree that nothing in this _Section 11.6_ shall require any
party to institute any Litigation for (or limit any party's right to institute
any Litigation for) specific performance under this _Section 11.6_ prior or
as a condition to exercising any termination right under _Article X_ , nor
shall the commencement of any Litigation pursuant to this _Section 11.6_ or
anything set forth in this _Section 11.6_ restrict or limit any party's right
to terminate this Agreement in accordance with the terms hereof; it being
understood and agreed by the parties that during the pendency of any
Litigation initiated by any party under this _Section 11.6_ , such initiating
party shall maintain the right to terminate this Agreement under
_Section 10.1_. If a party brings any Litigation to enforce specifically the
performance of the terms and provisions hereof by any other party (or a
Litigation for monetary damages as described in the following sentence) and
the Outside Date has not yet passed, the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended by (x) the amount of time during which such Litigation is
pending, plus twenty (20) Business Days or (y) such other time period
established by the Chosen Court presiding over such Litigation. If a party
institutes a Litigation for injunctive relief or specific performance and a
court of competent jurisdiction does not award injunctive relief or specific

monetary damages against the other party hereto. Notwithstanding anything in
this Agreement to the contrary, if any party is awarded injunctive relief or
specific performance as a result of which the Closing actually occurs, such
equitable relief shall be such party's sole and exclusive remedy against the
other party hereto under this Agreement solely with respect to such other
party's failure to consummate the Closing. The prevailing party in
any Litigation arising under this _Section 11.6_ shall be entitled to
reimbursement of fees, costs and expenses to the extent provided in _Section

Section 11.7. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this

Section 11.8. _Schedules_. The disclosure of any matter, or reference to any
Contract, in any Schedule to this Agreement shall be deemed to be a
disclosure of such matter or Contract for all purposes of this Agreement to
which such matter or Contract could reasonably be expected to be pertinent,
but shall not be deemed to constitute an admission by the Buyer, the Company
or the Seller or to otherwise imply that any such matter or Contract is
material for the purposes of this Agreement and shall not affect the
interpretation of such term for the purposes of this Agreement. In
particular, (a) certain matters may be disclosed on the Schedules that may not
be required to be disclosed because of certain minimum thresholds or
materiality standards set forth in this Agreement, (b) the disclosure of any
such matter does not mean that it meets or surpasses any such minimum
thresholds or materiality standards and (c) no disclosure in the Schedules
relating to any possible breach or violation of any Contract or Law shall be
construed as an admission or indication that any such breach or violation
exists or has actually occurred. In no event shall the listing of such matters
in any Schedule be deemed or interpreted to expand the scope of the Company's
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement. Each Schedule is
qualified in its entirety by reference to specific provisions of the Agreement
and does not constitute, and shall not be construed as constituting,
representations, warranties or covenants of the Buyer, the Company or the
Seller or their respective Affiliates, except as and to the extent provided
in this Agreement. Matters reflected in a Schedule are not necessarily
limited to matters or Contracts required by this Agreement to be disclosed in
such Schedules. Regardless of the existence or absence of cross-references,
the disclosure of any matter in any Schedule shall be deemed to be a
disclosure for purposes of this Agreement and each Schedule to the extent
that the relevance of such disclosure is reasonably apparent from its text.
The section headings in the Schedules are for convenience of reference only
and shall not be deemed to alter or affect the meaning or interpretation of
any information disclosed herein or any provision of this Agreement. All
attachments to the Schedules are incorporated by reference into the Schedule
in which they are directly or indirectly referenced. The information contained
in the Schedules is in all events subject to _Section 5.4_ and the
Confidentiality Agreement.

Law, or otherwise, except for the Buyer's rights to recover from the Seller
(but not any of the Seller Affiliates) under and to the extent provided for
in this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, subject to the

under this Agreement (subject to the limitations described herein) shall be
the sole and exclusive remedy of the Buyer and any other Person against the
Seller or any Seller Affiliate in respect of any Losses, liabilities or
obligations arising under, or in connection with, this Agreement, any

against any Financing Source (in their capacities as such), in any case
whether by the enforcement of any assessment or by any legal or equitable
proceeding, or by virtue of any statute, regulation or other applicable Law,
it being expressly agreed and acknowledged that no liability whatsoever shall
attach to, be imposed on or otherwise be incurred by any Financing Source (in
their capacities as such) for any obligation of the Buyer under this Agreement
or any documents or instruments delivered in connection with this Agreement

acknowledges that Dechert currently serves as counsel to both (i) the

-69- 
--- 

 


--- 

    

negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. There may come a time, including after consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, when the interests of the Seller
and its Affiliates on the one hand, and the Purchased Companies on the other
hand may no longer be aligned or when, for any reason, the Seller, Dechert, or
the Purchased Companies believes that Dechert cannot or should no longer
represent both the Seller and its Affiliates on the one hand, and the
Purchased Companies on the other hand. The parties understand and
specifically agree that Dechert may withdraw from, or the Purchased
Companies may cause Dechert to withdraw from, representing the Purchased
Companies and continue to represent the Seller and its Affiliates, even if
the interests of the Seller and its Affiliates on the one hand, and the
interests of the Purchased Companies on the other hand, are or may be
adverse, including in connection with any dispute arising out of or relating
to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
even though Dechert may have represented the Purchased Companies in a matter
substantially related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing matters for
the Purchased Companies or any of its Affiliates, and the Buyer (on behalf of
itself and, after the Closing, the Purchased Companies) hereby consents
thereto and waives any conflict of interest arising therefrom. Each of the
parties further agrees that, as to all communications relating in any way to
this Agreement, the sale of the Transferred Securities, the evaluation of a
potential sale of the Transferred Securities or all or substantially all of
the assets of any of the Purchased Companies or any alternative transaction
involving the Transferred Securities or the Purchased Companies or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby among Dechert, on the one hand, and any of
the Purchased Companies, the Seller or any of its Affiliates, on the other
hand (the "Privileged Communications"), the attorney-client privilege, the
expectation of client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary
privilege that attach as a result of Dechert representing the Purchased
Companies shall survive the Closing and shall remain in effect, _provided_
that any such privilege, from and after the Closing, with regard to the
Privileged Communications shall belong to the Seller and its Affiliates and
shall not pass to or be claimed by the Purchased Companies or any of its
Affiliates. In furtherance of the foregoing, each of the parties
hereto agrees to take the steps necessary to ensure that any privilege
attaching to the Privileged Communications as a result of
Dechert representing the Purchased Companies shall survive the Closing,
remain in effect and be controlled by the Seller. As to any
Privileged Communications, the Buyer and each of the Purchased Companies,
together with any of their respective Affiliates, successors or assigns,
agree that no such Person may access, use or rely on any of the Privileged
Communications in any action or claim against or involving any of the parties
hereto after the Closing. In addition, if the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement are consummated, the Purchased Companies shall have no right
of access to or control over any of Dechert's records related to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, which shall become the property
of (and be controlled by) the Seller. Furthermore, in the event of a dispute
between the Seller and/or its Affiliates on the one hand, and the Purchased
Companies on the other hand, arising out of or relating to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, none of the attorney-client privilege, the
expectation of client confidence or any other rights to any evidentiary
privilege will protect from disclosure to the Seller and/or its Affiliates
any information or documents developed or shared during the course of
Dechert's joint representation of the Seller and its Affiliates on the one
hand, and the Purchased Companies on the other hand, with regard to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 11.17. _Prevailing Party_. In the event any Litigation or other court
action, arbitration or similar adjudicatory proceeding (a "Proceeding") is
commenced or threatened by any party hereto, any Buyer Indemnified Party or
any Seller Indemnified Party (the "Claiming Party") to enforce its rights
under this Agreement against any other party hereto (the "Defending Party"),
all reasonable and documented out of pocket fees, costs and expenses,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and court costs, incurred by the
prevailing party in such Proceeding shall be reimbursed by the non-prevailing
party; _provided_ , that if a Person prevails in part, and loses in part
in such Proceeding, the court, arbitrator or other adjudicator presiding over
such Proceeding shall award a reimbursement of the reasonable and documented
out of pocket fees, costs and expenses incurred by such Person on an equitable
basis. For purposes hereof, and without limitation, a Person which is a
Defending Party shall be deemed to have prevailed in any Proceeding described
in the immediately preceding sentence if the Claiming Party commences or
threatens any such Proceeding and (i) such underlying claim(s) are
subsequently dropped or voluntarily dismissed and/or (ii) the Defending Party
defeats any such claim(s).
