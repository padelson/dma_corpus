          doubt, the acceptance of any such obligations or conditions by the
          Purchaser shall not in any way affect the Purchase Price or the
          Shareholder Loan Purchase Price or any obligations of the Purchaser
          hereunder.

          Agreement, all rights and obligations of all Parties hereunder shall
          terminate without any liability of any Party to the other Party (other
          than for breach of this Section 3 prior to such termination),
          provided, however, that the confidentiality agreement dated 1 November
          2007 (the "CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT") shall remain in full force and

               and

          (ii) Seller shall be released partially, as described in the following

               EXHIBIT 7.1(B) with Purchaser which provides that such Related

          ownership percentage of all Related Partners, each as at the date of

          Purchaser upon Purchaser's request.

                                    SECTION 8
                                    REMEDIES

8.1  REMEDIES FOR INCORRECTNESS OF REPRESENTATIONS AND BREACHES OF COVENANTS AND
     OTHER AGREEMENTS BY SELLER

     (a)  If any of the representations pursuant to Section 4 of the Seller are
          incorrect or if the Seller breaches any of the covenants pursuant to
          Section 6 or other agreements in this Agreement or any Share Purchase
          Documents (as defined below) (any such incorrectness or breach a
          "BREACH"), Seller, subject to the provisions contained in this Section
          8, shall pay to Purchaser or, at the election of Purchaser, to its
          relevant Affiliate or relevant member of the Group, respectively,
          compensation for any Losses (as defined below) asserted against,
          incurred or suffered by, Purchaser, any of its Affiliates, or any
          member of the Group, respectively, as a result of a Breach of the
          representation, covenant or

<PAGE>

                                                                              31


          other agreement, as the case may be, unless Seller has remedied the
          Breach and has put Purchaser in the same position Purchaser would have
          been in had no Breach occurred within 30 days after Seller has been
          notified of such Breach pursuant to Section 8.5(a).

          Any indemnity payments made by Seller pursuant to this Agreement shall
          be treated by the Parties as adjustments of the Purchase Price due to
          Seller.

     (b)  For the purpose of this Agreement, "LOSSES" shall mean all
          liabilities, obligations, reasonable costs and expenses and other
          damages within the meaning of sections 249 et seq. of the German Civil
          Code on a Euro for Euro basis, but excluding any consequential damages
          (Folgeschaden) or loss of profits (entgangener Gewinn), internal
          administration and overhead costs. Any Loss shall be computed net of
          any amounts which are recovered under insurance or otherwise from any
          third party. Any Losses incurred, including Losses in any member of
          the Group not wholly-owned (directly or indirectly) by Target, shall
          be taken into account only on a pro rata basis in proportion to the
          respective direct or indirect shareholding of Target (durchgerechnete
          Beteiligung).

     (c)  Neither Party shall be liable under this Agreement for any Loss to the
          extent that such Loss is attributable to a failure by the other Party
          to mitigate the Loss (section 254 of the German Civil Code). In
          particular, but without limitation, to calculate the damages, there
          shall be taken into account the net present value of the amount by
          which any taxation, which the Purchaser or any of the Group Companies
          would be obliged to pay, is reduced or extinguished as a result of the
          matter giving rise to such liability, such taxation to be calculated
          on the basis of rates of taxation prevailing at the time of the
          Breach.

     (d)  No liability shall attach to the Seller in respect of any Breach to
          the extent that the same Loss has been recovered by the Purchaser
          under any other representation or warranty or term of this Agreement
          or any other Share Purchase Document and accordingly the Purchaser may
          only recover once in respect of the same Loss.

8.2  DISCLOSED OR KNOWN MATTERS

     (a)  Seller shall not be liable for a Breach of a representation pursuant
          to Section 4, if the underlying facts of the Breach have been duly and
          fairly disclosed to Purchaser prior to the date hereof as part of any
          documents which were in the data room established by the Target (the
          "DATA ROOM") as such data room

          existed at 18.00 hours on December 18, 2007 (the "CUT-OFF TIME"); all
          documents made available in the Data Room at the Cut-Off Time are
          stored on a CD-ROM, copies of which will be delivered by Seller to
          Purchaser or Purchaser's legal counsel and the Notary notarizing the
          signing of this Agreement by December 21, 2007, 18.00 hours; the
          Notary is hereby instructed to retain his copy of the CD-ROM together
          with this Agreement and to provide each party upon request and at its
          expense with print-outs of the documents stored on the CD-ROM, or if
          such matter was actually known to the Purchaser on the date hereof.

     (b)  Except as provided otherwise in Section 8.2(a) the legal principle
          expressed in Section 442 of the German Civil Code (BGB) shall not
          apply.

8.3  THRESHOLDS AND AGGREGATE AMOUNTS OF SELLER'S LIABILITY

     (a)  Seller's aggregate liability for all Breaches of this Agreement
          including, but not limited to breaches of any representation in
          Sections 4.1 and 4.2 and of any covenant in Section 6 and the
          undertaking in Section 7 shall be limited to the sum of all payments
          to be made by Purchaser to Seller at Closing in accordance with

     (iii) claims of Purchaser for a Breach of a covenant contained in Section 6
           or otherwise under or in connection with this Agreement shall be

8.5  INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES

     (a)  In the event of a breach of any representation or covenant, Purchaser
          shall promptly, but in any event no later than twenty (20) Business
          Days after becoming aware of that Breach, notify Seller of that
          Breach, describe its claim in reasonable detail and, to the extent
          then feasible, set forth the calculation of the Loss alleged by
          Purchaser with such claim.

     (b)  In the event that any action, claim, demand or proceeding with respect
          to which Seller may be liable under this Agreement (the "THIRD PARTY
          CLAIM") is asserted or announced by any third party (including any
          governmental authority) against Purchaser, any of its Affiliates or
          the Group (the "CLAIM ADDRESSEE"), subject to Seller indemnifying and
          holding harmless Purchaser, its Affiliates and the Group from and
          against all Losses in connection such Third Party Claim, Purchaser
          shall without undue delay give notice to Seller and shall enable
          Seller to defend the Claim Addressee against the Third Party Claim.
          Seller shall have the right to defend the Claim Addressee by all
          appropriate actions and shall have, at any time during the
          proceedings, the sole power to direct and control such defence, taking
          into account the reasonable requests and requirements of Purchaser and
          the Group. In particular, Seller may participate in and direct all
          negotiations and correspondence with the third party, appoint and
          instruct counsel and request that the Third Party Claim be litigated
          or settled in accordance with Seller's instructions. If Seller elects
          to defend such Third Party Claim, then Purchaser shall be entitled to
          the same rights as Seller has under Section 7.5(c), which will apply
          mutatis mutandis.

     (c)  Purchaser agrees, and shall cause each Claim Addressee, (i) to
          cooperate with, and assist Seller in the defence of any Third Party
          Claim, (ii) to diligently conduct the defence (to the extent that
          Seller is not in control of the defence), (iii) not to acknowledge or
          settle the Third Party Claim without Seller's prior written consent,
          (iv) to provide Seller access, upon reasonable advance notice and
          during normal business hours, to all relevant books and records, other
          information, premises (regardless of owned or leased) and personnel of
          the Group, (v) to allow Seller and its representatives to copy or
          photograph any assets, accounts, documents and records for the purpose
          of avoiding, disputing, defending, appealing, compromising or
          contesting any Third Party Claim or liability as Seller may reasonably
          request, (vi) to deliver to Seller without undue delay copies of all
          relevant orders (Bescheide), decisions, filings, motions and other
          documents of any court, authority or party to the conflict, and (vii)
          to give Seller reasonable opportunity to comment on and discuss with
          Purchaser and the Group any measures which are necessary or
          appropriate to take or to omit in connection with a Third Party Claim,
          and to comment on and review any reports and documents and to
          participate in all relevant court

<PAGE>

                                                                              34


          hearings and any other meetings (it being understood that subsections
          (ii) - (vii) above shall apply, irrespective of whether or not Seller
          has elected to defend the Third Party Claim). Purchaser shall bear any
          costs and expenses it incurs in connection with the cooperation or
          defence in accordance with this Section 8.5(c), unless it can claim
          indemnification in accordance with this Agreement.

     (d)  The failure of any Claim Addressee to materially comply with its
          obligations under this Section 8.5 shall release the Seller from its
          respective indemnification obligation hereunder, but only to the
          extent that Seller has been prejudiced (benachteiligt) by such failure
          and provided that Seller has stated conclusively (schlussig darlegen)
          and in reasonable detail such failure of the respective Claim
          Addressee and the harm suffered in a written statement signed by
          Seller.

8.6  EXCESS RECOVERY

     If:

     (a)  the Seller makes a payment (excluding any interest on a late payment)
          in respect of a Breach (the "DAMAGES PAYMENT");

     (b)  any Group company or the Purchaser receives finally and
          unconditionally any sum other than from the Seller which would not
          have been received but for the circumstance which resulted in that
          Breach (the "THIRD PARTY SUM");

     (c)  the receipt of the Third Party Sum was not taken into account in
          calculating the Damages Payment; and

     (d)  the aggregate of (i) the Third Party Sum, diminished by the reasonable
          costs properly incurred by the Purchaser and the Group companies in
          order to obtain such Third Party Sum, and (ii) the Damages Payment
          exceeds the amount required to compensate the Purchaser in full for
          the Loss resulting from the Breach in question, such excess being the
          "EXCESS RECOVERY",

     the Purchaser shall promptly on receipt of the Third Party Sum by it or the
     relevant Group company, repay to the Seller an amount equal to the lower of
     (i) the Excess Recovery and (ii) the aggregate of all Damages Payments
     made, in either case multiplied by the quotient of the amount of the
     Damages Payment made by the Seller divided by an amount equal to the
     aggregate of all Damages Payments made.

          with this Agreement, claims resulting from Seller's non-compliance
          with such claims for specific performance and termination rights, in
          each case explicitly set forth herein) against Seller in connection
          with Seller's shareholding in the Target and Seller's indirect
          shareholding in the Group, this Agreement or the transactions
          contemplated by this Agreement shall be excluded. Without limiting the
          generality of the foregoing, Purchaser hereby waives any claims under
          statutory remedies for defects of the object of purchase (sections 434
          et seq. of the German Civil Code including any claim for a reduction
          of the purchase price in accordance with section 441 of the German
          Civil Code), statutory contractual or pre-contractual obligations
          (sections 280 through 282, 311 of the German Civil Code) or vicarious
          liability for representatives (section 278 of the German Civil Code)
          or frustration of contract (section 313 of the German Civil Code) or
          tort (sections 823 et seq. of the German Civil Code). Purchaser shall
          have no right to rescind, cancel or otherwise terminate this Agreement
          or to exercise any right or remedy which would have a similar effect,
          except for the termination rights set forth in Section 3.3(d).

     (b)  The provisions of this Section 8.7 shall not affect any mandatory
          rights and remedies of Purchaser for fraud or willful misconduct
          (Vorsatz) of Seller, e.g., section 826 of the German Civil Code or
          section 823 subsection 2 of the German Civil Code in connection with
          criminal offences committed with intent (vorsatzlich).

8.8  NO DOUBLE INDEMNIFICATION

     In the event that a fact or circumstance results in the breach of more than
     one of the statements made in Section 4 above, Purchaser can claim the
     damage caused by such breaches only once.

8.9  PURCHASER AND SELLER RELEASE

     (a)  The Purchaser and the Purchaser's Guarantor undertake that, in the
          absence of willful deceit (Arglist), it has no rights against and may
          not make any claim against any employee, director, agent, officer or
          adviser of any member of the Group on whom it may have relied before
          agreeing to any term of, or entering into, this Agreement or other
          document referred to herein other than as expressly set out herein.
          Any employee, director, agent, officer or adviser of any member of the
          Group may enjoy the benefits and enforce the terms of this Section
          8.9(a) (echter Vertrag zugunsten Dritter).

     (b)  Except as set forth in this Agreement and in the Share Purchase
          Documents, the Parties are in agreement that upon the Closing, none of
          the Group entities shall have any claims, whether known or unknown,
          against the Seller, any member of the Seller Group or any of their
          respective Related Persons, except if such person has intentionally
          (or in a criminal manner) breached a respective agreement with such
          Group company prior to and including the Closing Date or has any
          outstanding primary performance obligation under such agreement or if
          the Group companies have claims against such person based on tort
          (unerlaubte Handlung) committed intentionally (the "EXCEPTED CLAIMS"),
          and, unless prohibited by applicable law, the Purchaser shall cause
          the Group companies to act accordingly and, if necessary, waive any
          claims which they may still have other than Excepted Claims. In
          addition, Purchaser shall hold harmless and indemnify Seller, all
          members of the Seller Group, all of their respective Related Persons,
          all members of any supervisory, advisory or similar board of any Group
          company and all of Seller's advisors, as the case may be, from and
          against any and all damages, costs and expenses arising out of any
          claims, which any Group company may raise against any such person
          after the Closing Date other than Excepted Claims.

     (c)  The Parties are in agreement that upon the Closing and except for any
          amounts specified or referred to in Exhibit 7.2(b)(i) and Exhibit
          7.2(b)(ii), neither Seller nor any member of Seller's Group nor any of
          their respective employees, directors, agents, officers, members of a
          supervisory, advisory or similar board shall have any claims, whether
          known or unknown, against any member of the Group, nor against any of
          their respective employees, directors, agents, officers, members of a
          supervisory, advisory or similar board, except to the extent that such
          person is also a Related Person of the Seller's Group or if such
          person has damaged the Seller intentionally or in a criminal manner,
          and Seller shall cause the members of Seller's Group and the
          aforementioned other persons to act accordingly and, if necessary,
          waive any claims which they may still have. In addition, Seller shall
          hold harmless and indemnify the members of the Group, all of their
          respective employees, directors, agents, officers,

          members of a supervisory, advisory or similar board and any of their
          advisors, as the case may be, except as stated above, from and against
          any and all damages, costs and expenses arising out of any claims,
          which any member of Seller's Group or any of the aforementioned
          potential claimants may raise against any such person after the
          Closing Date.

          Germany. The place of arbitration shall be Frankfurt am Main, Germany.
          The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be English,
          provided that no Party shall be under an obligation to provide to the

          in the German language. The right to obtain injunctive relief before
          state courts shall not be excluded hereby.

10.7 INTERPRETATION

     (b)  Terms to which a German translation has been added shall be
          interpreted as having the meaning assigned to them by the German
          translation.

     (c)  The term "AFFILIATED COMPANY", "AFFILIATE" or "AFFILIATE" shall have
          the meaning assigned to it in section 15 of the German Stock
          Corporation Act (verbundenes Unternehmen).

     (d)  For the purpose of any disclosure thresholds or other amounts referred
          to in any representations and warranties contained in this Agreement,

     (e)  Words such as "hereof", "herein" or "hereunder" refer (unless
          otherwise required by the context) to this Agreement as a whole and
          not to a specific provision of this Agreement. The term "including"
          shall mean "including, without limitation".

     (f)  For the purpose of this Agreement, a "BUSINESS DAY" shall be any day
          other than a Saturday, Sunday or days on which banks in Frankfurt am
          Main, Germany, London, England, Luxembourg, Grand Duchy of Luxembourg,
          or New York, New York, United States of America are generally closed.

          disclosure for all purposes of this Agreement. The fact that a matter

                                                                              42


          materiality) pursuant to the relevant representation or other
          provision of this Agreement.

10.8 DEFINITIONS

     EXHIBIT 10.8 sets forth a list of the capitalized terms used in this
     Agreement, indicating the sections where such terms are defined. Terms
     defined in the singular have a comparable meaning when used in the plural,
     and vice versa.

10.9 SEVERABILITY

     Should any provision of this Agreement, or any provision incorporated into
     this Agreement in the future, be or become invalid or unenforceable, the
     validity or enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement shall
     not be affected thereby. Instead of the invalid or unenforceable provision,
     the Parties shall agree upon a suitable and equitable provision that, so
     far as is lawfully possible, comes as close as possible to the intent and
     purpose of the invalid or unenforceable provision. The same shall apply:
     (i) if the Parties have, unintentionally, failed to address a certain
     matter in this Agreement (Regelungslucke), in which case a suitable and
     equitable provision shall be agreed upon between the Parties which comes as
     close as possible to what the Parties, in the light of the intent and
     purpose of this Agreement, would have agreed upon if they had considered
     the matter; or (ii) if any provision of this Agreement is invalid because
     of the scope of any time period or performance stipulated herein, in which
     case a time period or performance permitted by law shall be agreed upon
     between the Parties which comes as close as possible to the stipulated time
     period or performance.
