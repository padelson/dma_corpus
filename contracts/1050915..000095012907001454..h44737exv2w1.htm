CONVERSION OF SECURITIES  

  

 2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub or Company or their respective stockholders: 

   

 (a) Each share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of Merger Sub (" _Merger Sub Common Stock_ ") issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into one (1) fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, $0.001 par value, of the Surviving Corporation. Such newly issued shares shall thereafter constitute all of the issued and outstanding Surviving Corporation capital stock. 

   

 (b) Subject to the other provisions of this Article II, each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (excluding any shares of Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub or Company or any of their respective direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiaries (which shares shall be cancelled and shall cease to exist with no payment being made with respect thereto) shall be converted into 1.223 shares (the " _Exchange Ratio_ ") of common stock of Parent, par value $0.00001 per share (" _Parent Common Stock_ ") (such stock, the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 2.2 _Surrender and Payment_. 

  

 (a) _Exchange Agent; Exchange Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, for the benefit of the shares of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder of share(s) of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Stockholder_ "), Parent shall designate, or shall cause to be designated (pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to Company), a bank or trust company that is reasonably satisfactory to Company to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of the Stock Certificates upon surrender of such Stock Certificates in accordance with this Article II from time to time after the Effective Time (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Parent will make available to the Exchange 

   ##### 

  

    

Agent, as needed, the Merger Consideration to be delivered in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 2.1(b), including cash in
lieu of fractional shares in accordance with Section 2.2(e). 

   

 (b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the Exchange Agent shall mail to each holder of record of a Stock Certificate (i) a form of letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Stock Certificates held by such Company Stockholder shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent and, in the case of shares in book-entry form, any additional documents specified by the procedures set forth in the form of letter of transmittal and shall be in such customary form and have such other customary provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Stock Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Stock Certificate in proper form for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent or Parent, the holder of such Stock Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) a certificate representing that number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder is entitled to receive pursuant to this Article II, (y) a check in the amount (after giving effect to any required tax withholdings) of (A) any cash in lieu of fractional shares plus (B) any unpaid non-stock dividends and (z) any other dividends or other distributions that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of this Article II, and the Stock Certificate so surrendered shall be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock that is not registered in the stock transfer books of Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for any cash to be paid upon surrender of the Stock Certificate and any other dividends or distributions in respect thereof, may be issued and paid to a Person (as defined in Section 5.2(d)(i)) other than the Person in whose name the Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered if the Stock Certificate shall be properly endorsed and otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes (as defined in Section 3.12(l)) required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the registered holder of the Stock Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that the Tax has been paid or is not applicable. No interest shall be paid or shall accrue on the cash payable upon surrender of any Stock Certificate. 

   

 (c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares; Voting_. 

   

 (i) To the fullest extent permitted by all laws, statutes, orders, rules or regulations promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered, by any Governmental Authority (as defined in Section 3.5(e)), in each case, to the extent applicable (collectively, " _Applicable Laws_ "), all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and outstanding as of the Effective Time and if any dividend or other distribution is declared by Parent in respect of the Parent Common Stock, the record date for which is at or after the Effective Time, that declaration shall include dividends or other distributions in 

   ##### 

  

    

respect of all shares of Parent Common Stock issuable pursuant to this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions in respect of the Parent
Common Stock shall be paid to any holder of any unsurrendered Stock
Certificate until such Stock Certificate is surrendered for exchange in
accordance with this Article II. Subject to the effect of all Applicable
Laws, following surrender of any such Stock Certificate, there shall be
issued and paid to the holder of the certificates representing whole
shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange therefor, without interest,
(A) at the time of such surrender, the dividends or other distributions (1)
with a record date at or after the Effective Time and a payment date on or
before such surrender with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common
Stock and (2) not paid and (B) at the appropriate payment date, the dividends
or other distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent
Common Stock with a record date after the Effective Time but with a payment
date subsequent to surrender. 

   

 (ii) To the fullest extent permitted by Applicable Laws, holders of unsurrendered Stock Certificates shall be entitled to vote after the Effective Time at any meeting of Parent Stockholders (as defined in Section 4.4) the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock represented by such Stock Certificates, regardless of whether such holders have exchanged their Stock Certificates. 

   

 (d) _Stock Transfer Books_. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Stock Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for transfer or any other reason, they shall be cancelled and exchanged as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (e) _Fractional Shares_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will be issued and any Company Stockholder entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent Common Stock but for this Section 2.2(e) shall be entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest) in lieu thereof, which payment shall be calculated by the Exchange Agent and shall represent such holders proportionate interest in a share of Parent Common Stock based on the net proceeds from the sale by the Exchange Agent on behalf of such holder of the aggregate fractional shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder otherwise would be entitled to receive. Any such sale shall be made by the Exchange Agent within five business days after the date upon which the Stock Certificate(s) (or affidavit(s) of loss and indemnity in lieu thereof) that would otherwise result in the issuance of such fractional shares of Parent Common Stock have been received by the Exchange Agent. 

   

 (f) _No Liability_. Any portion of the Merger Consideration held by the Exchange Agent for payment to the holders of unsurrendered Stock Certificates that remains unclaimed one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered, at Parents option, to Parent (including any interest and other income resulting from investments of such Merger Consideration). Any stockholders of Company who have not theretofore 

   ##### 

  

    

complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent for
delivery of any shares of Parent Common Stock and payment of any cash,
dividends and other distributions in respect thereof payable or
deliverable pursuant to Section 2.1, Section 2.2(c) and Section 2.2(e) upon
due surrender of their Stock Certificate (or affidavits of loss and indemnity
in lieu thereof), in each case, without any interest thereon. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, Company or the Exchange Agent
shall be liable to any Person in respect of any cash properly delivered to
a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar law. 

   

 (g) _Lost Stock Certificates_. If any Stock Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming a Stock Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent or the Surviving Corporation may reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to the Stock Certificate, the Exchange Agent shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate the shares of Parent Common Stock and the cash and any unpaid dividends and other distributions that would be payable or deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement had such lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificate been surrendered. 

   

 (h) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The Merger Consideration paid in accordance with the terms of this Article II in respect of Stock Certificates that have been surrendered in accordance with the terms of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock represented thereby. 

  

 2.3 _Treatment of Stock Options; Restricted Stock; Company ESPP_. 

   

 (a) As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, each option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Company Option_ ") granted under Companys 2003 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan (the " _2003 Plan_ "), or Companys 2004 Omnibus Stock Incentive Plan, (the " _2004 Plan_ " and, together with the 2003 Plan, the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent a right to purchase shares of Company Common Stock and shall be converted into an option (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") to purchase, on the same terms and conditions as applied to each such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the same vesting conditions), the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock that is equal to the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (rounded down to the nearest whole share), at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded up to the nearest whole penny) equal to the exercise price for each such share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio; provided, that the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such Adjusted Option shall be determined in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code. Section 2.3(a) of the 

   ##### 

  

    

Company Disclosure Letter (as defined in Article III below) contains a true

 (b) Each share of Company Common Stock that is subject to transfer and/or forfeiture restrictions under the Company Stock Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time (collectively, the " _Company Restricted Shares_ ") shall, upon its conversion into the Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 2.1 hereof, continue to be subject to such restrictions (the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to such transfer and/or forfeiture restrictions after the Effective Time are hereafter collectively referred to as " _Parent Restricted Shares_ ") and, upon the lapsing of such restrictions, Parent shall be entitled to withhold such amounts as may be required to be withheld under the Code and any applicable state or local tax law with respect to the lapsing of such restrictions; provided, that each holder of such Parent Restricted Shares may satisfy such withholding obligations by any approved method under the applicable Company Stock Plan. Section 2.3(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter contains a true and complete list of the Company Restricted Shares held by each holder thereof on the date of this Agreement and sets forth next to the name of each holder (i) the number of Company Restricted Shares such holder holds on a grant by grant basis, (ii) the date on which such Company Restricted Shares were granted, (iii) the vesting schedule pursuant to which the transfer and/or forfeiture restrictions on such Company Restricted Shares shall lapse and (iv) the circumstances pursuant to which the vesting of such Company Restricted Shares will be accelerated.

 (c) The Company Board shall take any and all actions reasonably necessary (including, without limitation, adopting any necessary plan amendment) to terminate all purchases of stock under Companys 2004 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the " _Company ESPP_ ") effective as of the last "Trading Day" of the "Offering Period" (as each such term is defined in the Company ESPP) that is in effect on the date of this Agreement and provide that no additional Offering Periods shall commence under the Company ESPP after the date of this Agreement. Company shall terminate the Company ESPP in its entirety immediately prior to the Closing Date.

   ##### 

  

    

the Effective Time each of the Company Stock Plans shall be amended, if and
to the extent necessary, to reflect the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the conversion of the Company Options and Company
Restricted Shares pursuant to Sections 2.3(a) and (b) above and the
substitution of Parent for Company thereunder to the extent appropriate to
effectuate the assumption of such Company Stock Plans by Parent. From and
after the Effective Time, all references to Company (other than any
references relating to a "Change in Control" of Company) in each Company
Stock Plan and in each agreement evidencing any award of Company Options or
Company Restricted Shares shall be deemed to refer to Parent, unless Parent
determines otherwise. 

   

 (e) Parent shall take all action necessary or appropriate to have available for issuance under an effective registration statement filed with the SEC a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise of the Adjusted Options. 

  

 2.4 _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that Company changes the number of shares of Company Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Company Common Stock, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for shares of Parent Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger, subdivision, issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted. 

  

 2.5 _Withholding_. Each of Parent and the Exchange Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent or the Exchange Agent is required to deduct and withhold under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Applicable Laws, with respect to the making of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the person in respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made by Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

the matters expressly set forth on the Parent Disclosure Letter or the
exceptions in the definition of "Parent Material Adverse Effect"), Parent and
Merger Sub jointly and severally represent and warrant to Company as
follows: 

   

 4.1 _Organization and Standing_. (a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state of Delaware with full corporate power and authority to own, lease, use and operate its properties and to conduct its business as and where now owned, leased, used, operated and conducted.

Parent is not in default in the performance, observance or fulfillment of any provision of Parents Certificate of Incorporation (the " _Parent Certificate_ ") or Parents Bylaws (the " _Parent Bylaws_ "), each of which is in the form as filed and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement in the Parent SEC Documents (as defined in Section 4.5(a)).

 (d) _Superior Proposals_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 5.1(a), in the event that Company receives prior to the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Stockholders pursuant to the terms hereof an unsolicited, bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from a third party that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.1 and that the Company Board has reasonably determined in good faith, 

   ##### 

  

    

after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside counsel,
that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to lead to, a
Superior Proposal (as defined in Section 5.1(g)(ii)), Company may then (1)
furnish confidential or nonpublic information to the third party (and its
representatives) making such Acquisition Proposal and (2) engage in
discussions and negotiations (including exchanging draft agreements) with the
third party and its representatives with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal; _provided_ , _however_ , that: 

   

 (i) Company complies with all of the terms of this Section 5.1; 

   

 (ii) Company shall have notified Parent, in writing, of any decision of the Company Board as to whether to enter into discussions or negotiations concerning any Acquisition Proposal or to provide confidential or nonpublic information to any Person as permitted herein, which notice shall be given as promptly as practicable after such decision (and in any event no later than 24 hours after such determination was reached); 

   

 (iii) Company promptly provides Parent with oral and written notice setting forth all such information as is reasonably necessary to keep Parent currently informed in all material respects of the negotiations, status and material terms (including material amendments or proposed material amendments and any withdrawals or rejections thereof) of any such Acquisition Proposal and shall promptly provide Parent a copy of all written materials subsequently provided to, by or on behalf of such Person or group in connection with such Acquisition Proposal; 

   

 (iv) prior to furnishing any nonpublic information or entering into any negotiations or discussions with such third party, (1) Company receives from such third party an executed confidentiality agreement containing customary limitations on the use and disclosure of all nonpublic written and oral information furnished to such third party on Companys behalf on terms no less restrictive to such third party than (i) the confidentiality agreement, dated as of December 5, 2006, between Parent and Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") and (ii) to the extent such third party is not currently conducting a similar dark fiber business, the confidentiality agreement, dated as of December 29, 2006, between Parent and Company specific to the dark fiber business of Company (the " _Dark Fiber Confidentiality Agreement_ " and together with the Confidentiality Agreement, the " _Confidentiality Agreements_ "), and (2) contemporaneously with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such third party, Company furnishes such confidential or nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such information has not been previously so furnished); and 

   

 (v) the Company Board reasonably determines in good faith, after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to provide such information or enter into such discussion or negotiations would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the Company Boards fiduciary duties to Company and the Company Stockholders under Applicable Laws. 

   ##### 

  

   

 (e) _Change of Recommendation_. Subject to the provisions of Section 5.5 and this Section 5.1, in response to the receipt of a Superior Proposal prior to obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval, (x) the Company Board or a committee thereof may withhold, withdraw, amend or modify the Company Board Recommendation in favor of the Merger, and, in the case of a Superior Proposal that is a tender or exchange offer made directly to the Company Stockholders, may recommend that the Company Stockholders accept the tender or exchange offer, or (y) the Company Board may approve, endorse, or recommend any Superior Proposal (any of the foregoing actions in clauses (x) and (y), an " _Alternative Transaction Recommendation_ "), if all of the following conditions in clauses (i) through (viii) are met:

 (v) after delivering the Change of Recommendation Notice, Company shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and provide Parent with a reasonable opportunity to make adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement during such five business day period such that the Acquisition Proposal would no longer constitute a Superior Proposal and the Company Board could proceed with its recommendation to the Company Stockholders in favor of adoption of this Agreement without making an Alternative Transaction Recommendation; 

   

 (vi) the Company Board shall have determined (A) after consultation with its financial advisor, that the terms of the Superior Proposal are more favorable to the Company Stockholders than the terms of the Merger (as it may be adjusted pursuant to paragraph (v) above) and (B) after consultation with outside legal counsel, that an Alternative Transaction Recommendation is necessary for the Company Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to Company and the Company Stockholders under Applicable Laws; 

   #####

 (i) During the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending at 11:59 p.m. on December 31, 2007, Parent shall (x) provide or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to provide to employees of Company and any Company Subsidiaries (other than those employees who are subject to a collective bargaining agreement) (" _Company Employees_ ") who continue employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a Company Subsidiary after the Effective Time the same base salary or wages, as applicable, that were being paid to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time and (y) maintain or cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain those Company Benefit Plans that provided pension and welfare benefits (excluding benefits under defined benefit pension plans) to Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time.

   ##### 

  

    

Closing (the " _New Plans_ "), and for purposes of accrual of vacation and
other paid time off and severance benefits under New Plans, each Company
Employee who continues employment with Parent, the Surviving Corporation or a
Company Subsidiary after the Effective Time shall be credited with his or her
years of service with Company, the Company Subsidiaries and their respective
affiliates (and any additional service with any predecessor employer) before
the Closing, to the same extent as such Company Employee was entitled, before
the Closing, to credit for such service under any similar Company Benefit
Plan, _provided, however_ , that no such crediting shall result in the
duplication of benefits under any Company Benefit Plan. In addition, and
without limiting the generality of the foregoing: (A) each Company Employee

Subsidiary after the Effective Time shall be immediately eligible to

reasonable efforts to cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and
actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents to the same extent as under the
applicable Company Benefit Plan, and Parent shall use or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents
under an Company Benefit Plan during the portion of the plan year of the New
Plan ending on the date such employees participation in the corresponding
New Plan begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of
satisfying all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
applicable plan year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such
New Plan. 

   

 (iv) Nothing herein expressed or implied shall (A) confer upon any of the Company Employees any rights or remedies (including, without limitation, any right to employment or continued employment for any specified period) of any nature or kind whatsoever under or by reason of the Agreement, or (B) subject to the provisions of Sections 5.4(b)(i) and (ii) above, obligate Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective subsidiaries to maintain any particular Company Benefit Plan or grant or issue any equity-based awards or limit the ability of Parent to amend or terminate any of such Company Benefit Plans to the extent permitted thereunder in accordance with their terms. None of the provisions of this Agreement are intended to constitute an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan and no Company Employee shall have the right to enforce or compel the enforcement of any provisions of this Section 5.4(b) or this Agreement.

The existing indemnification agreements between Company or any Company Subsidiary and the directors and officers of Company as identified on Section 5.4(c)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter shall continue in full force and effect after the Effective Time and shall not be amended, terminated or otherwise modified (unless an amendment or modification is required by Applicable Laws or is consented to by the applicable Indemnified Officer and Director) for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any such individuals with respect to any acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (ii) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the directors and officers of Company who are currently covered by Companys existing directors and officers liability insurance policy(ies) identified on Section 5.4(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter to be covered by a single premium tail directors and officers liability insurance policy acquired on or prior to the Closing Date and maintained by the Surviving Corporation, with limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable to those in the existing policies of Company, for a period of six years from and after the Effective Time with respect to acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time that were committed by such directors and officers in their capacities as such, with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable to the limits, terms and conditions in the existing policies of Company (or with such other limits, terms and conditions as permitted by the following two provisos of this sentence); _provided_ , _further_ , that in no event shall Parent be required to pay an annual premium in excess of 200% of the current annual premium paid by Company for its existing coverage on the date of this Agreement as identified on Section 5.4(c)(ii) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the " _Insurance Amount_ "); and  _provided_ , _further_ , that if Parent is unable to obtain tail coverage with policy limits, terms and conditions at least as favorable to the limits, terms and conditions in the existing policies of Company as a result of the preceding provision, Parent shall obtain the most advantageous tail coverage as is available for the Insurance Amount. Upon written request by a covered person, a copy of the policy will be made available to such covered person.

 (iv) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person or engages in any other transaction such that the Surviving Corporation shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation, merger or transaction or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and assets as an entirety in one or a series of related transactions to any Person(s), then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such continuing or surviving corporation or entity or such Person(s), as the case may be, shall assume and agree to perform the obligations set forth in this Section (c). 

   

 (d) _Parent Contribution to Termination of Credit Agreement_. On or prior to the Effective Time, Parent will provide sufficient funds to Company to (i) pay all outstanding borrowings and fees under the Credit Agreement and the other indebtedness for which payoff letters shall be obtained or described in Section 5.3(b) to the extent Company does not have sufficient funds to pay such amounts incurred in compliance with the terms of this Agreement, including Section 5.3, and (ii) arrange for the replacement or cash collateralization under customary reasonable arrangements as to letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Agreement so that the Credit Agreement and the other indebtedness for which payoff letters shall be obtained or described in Section 5.3(b) may be terminated by Company in accordance with Section 5.3(b). 

  

 5.5 _Stockholders  Meetings_.

   ##### 

  

    

adoption of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
Company agrees that its obligations pursuant to this Section 5.5(a) shall not
be affected by the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or
communication to Company or any other Person of any Acquisition Proposal.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prohibit the Company Board from failing to make or from withdrawing, amending
or modifying its recommendation to the Company Stockholders (collectively, a
" _Change in the Company Board Recommendation_ "), _provided_ that the
Company Board determines in good faith and after consultation with its
outside legal advisors that such action is necessary for the Company Board to
comply with its fiduciary duties to Company or the Company Stockholders under
Applicable Laws, but only after (y) providing written notice to Parent that it
is prepared to make the determination permitted by this Section 5.5(a) and
setting forth the reasons therefor and (z) for a period of five business days
after providing such notice, Company negotiates with Parent in good faith to
make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would

Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prohibit the Parent Board from failing to make or from withdrawing, amending or modifying its recommendation to the Parent Stockholders (collectively, a " _Change in the Parent Board Recommendation_ "), provided that the Parent Board determines in good faith and after consultation with its outside legal advisors that such action is necessary for the Parent Board to comply with its fiduciary duties to Parent or the Parent Stockholders under Applicable Laws, but only after (y) providing written notice to Company that it is prepared to make the determination permitted by this Section 5.5(b) and setting forth the reasons therefor and (z) for a period of five business days after providing such notice, Parent negotiates with Company in good faith to make such adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as

   ##### 

  

    

reviewing such list. There shall be added to such list the names and addresses
of any other Person subsequently identified by either Parent or Company as a

before the date of Company Stockholder Meeting, an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is not such

may direct the Exchange Agent not to issue certificates or other electronic
format representing Parent Common Stock received by any such affiliate until
Parent has received from such Person an Affiliates Letter. Parent may issue
certificates representing Parent Common Stock received by such affiliates
bearing a customary legend regarding applicable Securities Act restrictions
and the provisions of this Section 5.12.
