the attached _Exhibit C_.  As used  herein, " _Outstanding  Common Stock
Number_ " means  the number of shares of Company Common Stock outstanding
immediately prior  to  the Effective Time plus additional shares in the
amount of eighty-one (81)  shares for Roger Newnham ("Born") and thirteen
(13) shares for Albert Morteboy  ("Morteboy") to treat them, for purposes of
calculating the Outstanding Common  Stock Number, as if they had been

collectively referred to as the "Foreign Managers". The  numbers of shares of
Delcorp Common Stock that would otherwise be issuable  pursuant to this
_Section 1.5(a)_  (including EBITDA Shares) to Persons who hold Dissenting

dissenters' rights pursuant to Applicable Nevada Law shall not be  issued to
such Persons and shall be canceled.

 

 

(b) **_Certificates  for Shares_**.  Certificates representing the shares of

_Section 1.6_  (or in  the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate,
upon delivery of an  affidavit (and indemnity, if required) in the manner
provided in _Section 1.8_).  Each  holder shall be issued separate
certificates for such holder's Escrow Shares (as  defined in _Section
1.11_)  and for  the remaining number of shares of Delcorp Common Stock to
which such holder  is  entitled. Certificates for shares of Delcorp Common
Stock representing EBITDA  Shares shall be issued to the Persons who have

release of the audited financial  statements of Delcorp for the year with
respect to which such EBITDA Shares  are  issuable.

direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company or of Delcorp 
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished

(e) **_Fractional  Shares_**.  No  fraction of a share of Delcorp Common
Stock will be issued by virtue of the  Merger, and each holder of shares of
Company Common Stock who would otherwise  be  entitled to a fraction of a
share of Delcorp Common Stock (after aggregating  all  fractional shares of
Delcorp Common Stock that otherwise would be received  by  such holder)
shall, upon compliance with _Section 1.6_,  receive  from Delcorp, in lieu
of such fractional share, one (1) share of Delcorp Common  Stock.

 

 

1.6 **_Surrender  of Certificates_**.

 

 

(a) **_Exchange  Procedures_**.  Upon  surrender of Company Certificates at
the Closing, the holders of such Company  Certificates shall receive in
exchange therefor certificates representing the  Base Shares into which their
shares of Company Common Stock shall be converted  at the Effective Time,
less the Escrow Shares, and the Company Certificates  so  surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding  Company
Certificates will be deemed, from and after the Effective Time, to  evidence

Stock issuable pursuant to _Section 1.5(a)_.

 

 

(b) **_Distributions  With Respect to Unexchanged Shares_**.  No  dividends
or other distributions declared or made after the date of this  Agreement
with respect to Delcorp Common Stock with a record date after the  Effective
Time will be paid to the holders of any unsurrendered Company  Certificates
with respect to the shares of Delcorp Common Stock to be issued  upon
surrender thereof until the holders of record of such Company Certificates 
shall surrender such Company Certificates. Subject to applicable law,
following  surrender of any such Company Certificates with a properly
completed letter  of  transmittal, Delcorp shall promptly deliver to the
record holders thereof,  without interest, the certificates representing
shares of Delcorp Common Stock  issued in exchange therefor and the amount of
any such dividends or other  distributions with a record date after the
Effective Time theretofore paid  with  respect to such shares of Delcorp
Common Stock.

 

 

(c) **_Transfers  of Ownership_**.  If  certificates representing shares of
Delcorp Common Stock are to be issued in  a  name other than that in which
the Company Certificates surrendered in exchange  therefor are registered, it
will be a condition of the issuance thereof that  the  Company Certificates
so surrendered will be properly endorsed and otherwise  in  proper form for
transfer and that the persons requesting such exchange will  have  paid to
Delcorp or any agent designated by it any transfer or other taxes  required
by reason of the issuance of certificates representing shares of  Delcorp
Common Stock in any name other than that of the registered holder of  the 
Company Certificates surrendered, or established to the satisfaction of
Delcorp  or any agent designated by it that such tax has been paid or is
not  payable.

 

 

(d) **_Required  Withholding_**.  Delcorp  and the Surviving Corporation
shall each be entitled to deduct and withhold  from  any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement  to  any holder
or former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as are required  to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision  of 
state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable legal
requirement.  To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
amounts shall  be  treated for all purposes under this Agreement as having
been paid to the person  to whom such amounts would otherwise have been paid.

Common Stock or Company Common Stock  for any amount properly paid to a
public official pursuant to any applicable  abandoned property, escheat or
similar law.

 

 

1.7 **_No  Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_**.  All  shares of
Delcorp Common Stock issued in accordance with the terms hereof shall  be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining 
to  shares of Company Common Stock and there shall be no further registration
of  transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of
Company  Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time.  If,  after the Effective Time, Company Certificates are
presented to the Surviving  Corporation for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided  in  this _Article I_.

 

 

1.8 **_Lost,  Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_**.  In the  event that any
Company Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed,  Delcorp
shall issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Company 
Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the holder 
thereof, the certificates representing the shares of Delcorp Common Stock
that  the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Company  Certificates were converted into and any dividends or distributions
payable  pursuant to _Section 1.6(b)_;  provided, however, that, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of such  certificates representing shares
of Delcorp Common Stock and other  distributions, the owner of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Company Certificates  shall indemnify Delcorp against any
claim that may be made against Delcorp  or  the Surviving Corporation with
respect to the Company Certificates alleged  to  have been lost, stolen or
destroyed.

 

 

1.9 **_Tax  Consequences_**.  It is  intended by the parties hereto that
the Merger shall constitute a reorganization  within the meaning of Section
368(a)(1)(A) of the Code and the regulations  thereunder. The parties hereto

United States Income Tax Regulations  issued with respect to Section 368.

 

 

1.10 **_Taking  of Necessary Action; Further Action_**.  If, at  any time
after the Effective Time, any further action is necessary or desirable  to
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving 
Corporation with full right, title and possession to all assets, property, 
rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company, the officers and 
directors of the Company will take all such lawful and necessary  action.

in escrow an aggregate of  1,807,110 **** of  the  Base Shares received by
such Persons as a result of the Merger (the " _Escrow  Shares_ "),  which 
shares shall be allocated among the Persons entitled to receive them in the 
same  proportions as the shares of Delcorp Common Stock are allocated among
them,  all  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Escrow
Agreement to be  entered into at the Closing between Delcorp, the Company,
the Representative  appointed pursuant to _Section 1.14(b)_  and 
Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company (" _Continental_ "),  as  Escrow

has filed  its Report on Form 10-K pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as  amended (" _Exchange  Act_ "),  for  its 2008 fiscal year or
(ii) one year after the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent  shall release
1,445,688 of the original number of Escrow Shares, less that  number of
Escrow Shares applied in satisfaction of or reserved with respect  to 
indemnification claims made prior to such date, to the shareholders of the 
Company in the same proportions as originally deposited into escrow. The 
remaining Escrow Shares (the " _T/E  Indemnity Shares_ ")  shall  be
available for indemnification only with respect to Tax Indemnification
Claims  and Environmental Indemnification Claims (each as hereinafter
defined). On  the  date (the " _T/E  Escrow Termination Date_ ")  that 
is the first business day following the date that is the third anniversary 
of  the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the T/E Indemnity
Shares,  less  any of such shares applied in satisfaction of a Tax
Indemnification Claim or  an  Environmental Indemnification Claim and any of
such shares related to a Tax  Indemnification Claim or an Environmental
Indemnification Claim that is then  unresolved, to each shareholder of the
Company in the same proportions as  initially deposited in escrow. Any Escrow
Shares held with respect to any  unresolved claim for indemnification and not
applied as indemnification with  respect to such claim upon its resolution
shall be delivered to such Persons  promptly upon such resolution. " _Tax 
Indemnification Claim_ " means  a  claim for indemnification pursuant to
_Article VII_  with  respect to (x) a breach of the representations and
warranties set forth in  _Section 2.15_  and (y)  the matters referred to
in Schedule 2.15. " _Environmental  Indemnification Claim_ " means  a 
claim for indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_  with  respect to a

to this Agreement to "affiliates" of the Company listed in Schedule 1.12 will
be subject to certain resale  restrictions under Rule 145 promulgated under

she or it understands that he,  she  or it must bear the economic risk of
the investment in the Delcorp Common Stock,  which cannot be sold by he, she

opportunity to ask questions and receive answers from  the  officers and
directors of Delcorp and all persons acting on Delcorp's behalf  concerning
the business and operations of Delcorp and to obtain any additional 
information to the extent Delcorp possesses or may possess such information 
or  can acquire it without unreasonable effort or expense necessary to verify
the  accuracy of such information; and (iv) he, she or it has had access to
the  Delcorp SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this Agreement. Each
Signing  Shareholder acknowledges, as to himself, herself or itself only,
that (v) he,  she or it is either (A) an "accredited investor" as such term
is defined in Rule  501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act or (B) a
person possessing  sufficient knowledge and experience in financial and
business matters to enable  it to evaluate the merits and risks of an
investment in Delcorp; and (vi) he,  she or it understands that the
certificates representing the Delcorp Common  Stock to be received by he, she
or it may bear legends to the effect that the  Delcorp Common Stock may not
be transferred except upon compliance with (C)  the  registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the " _Securities 
Act_ "),  or an  exemption therefrom, and (D) the provisions of this
Agreement. Each Signing  Shareholder that is an entity, for itself,

equity interests, to the same  effect as the foregoing provisions of this
_Section 1.13(b)_.

 

 

(c) Each  Signing Shareholder, for himself, herself or itself, represents and
warrants  that the execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Signing
Shareholder  does not, and the performance of his, her or its obligations
hereunder will  not,  require any consent, approval, authorization or permit
of, or filing with or  notification to, any court, administrative agency,
commission, governmental  or  regulatory authority, domestic or foreign (a "
_Governmental  Entity_ "),  except (i) for applicable requirements, if any,
of the Securities Act, the  Exchange Act, state securities laws (" _Blue 
Sky Laws_ "),  and  the rules and regulations thereunder, and (ii) where the
failure to obtain  such  consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or
to make such filings or  notifications, would not, individually or in the
aggregate, reasonably be  expected to have a Material Adverse Effect (as
defined in _Section 10.2(a)_)  on such  Signing Shareholder or the Company
or, after the Closing, the Delcorp, or  prevent consummation of the Merger or
otherwise prevent the parties hereto  from  performing their obligations
under this Agreement.

 

 

(d) Each  Signing Shareholder, for himself, herself or itself, represents and
warrants  that he, she or it owns the shares of Company Common Stock listed
on Exhibit  C  as being owned by him, her or it free and clear of all Liens.

its then members to act on behalf of Delcorp to  take all necessary actions
and make all decisions pursuant to the Escrow  Agreement regarding Delcorp's
right to indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_  hereof.  In the event of
a vacancy in such committee, the Board of Directors of Delcorp  shall appoint
as a successor a Person who was a director of Delcorp prior to  the  Closing
Date or some other Person who would qualify as an "independent" director  of
Delcorp and who has not had any relationship with the Company prior to the 
Closing. Such committee is intended to be the " _Committee_ "  referred to in
_Article VII_  hereof  and the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

(b) **_Representative_**.  The  Signing Shareholders hereby designate Brian
Pratt to represent the interests  of  the Persons entitled to receive
Delcorp Common Stock as a result of the Merger  for purposes of the Escrow
Agreement (such designee and any successor, the  " _Representative_ "). 
If  such Person ceases to serve in such capacity, for any reason, the
Signing  Shareholders shall designate his or her successor. Failing such
designation  within 10 business days after the Representative has ceased to
serve, those  members of the Board of Directors of Delcorp who were directors
of the Company  prior to the Closing shall appoint as successor a Person who
was a former  shareholder of the Company or such other Person as such members
shall designate.  Such Person or successor is intended to be the
"Representative" referred to in  _Section 1.11_  and  _Article VII_ 
hereof  and the Escrow Agreement.

 

 

1.15 **_Outstanding  Company Derivative Securities_**.  The  Company shall
arrange that the holders of all outstanding options, warrants  and  other
derivative securities of the Company exercise such securities after the 
Special Meeting but prior to the Effective Time without the payment of any 
consideration therefor by the Company other than the issuance of shares of 
Company Common Stock and cash that is owed to any of the Foreign Managers

(a) Notwithstanding  _Section 1.5_  hereof,  Dissenting Shares shall not be
converted into a right to receive Delcorp Common  Stock and the holders
thereof shall be entitled only to such rights as are  granted by Applicable
Nevada Law. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who becomes  entitled to payment
for such shares pursuant to Applicable Nevada Law shall  receive payment
therefor from the Surviving Corporation in accordance with  Applicable Nevada
Law, provided, however, that (i) if any shareholder of the  Company who
asserts dissenters' rights in connection with the Merger (a " _Dissenter_
")  shall  have failed to establish his entitlement to such rights as
provided in  Applicable Nevada Law, or (ii) if any such Dissenter shall have
effectively  withdrawn his demand for payment for such shares or waived or
lost his right  to  payment for his shares under the appraisal rights
process under Applicable  Nevada Law, the shares of Company Common Stock held
by such Dissenter shall  be  treated as if they had been converted, as of
the Effective Time, into a right  to  receive Delcorp Common Stock and as
provided in _Section 1.5_.  The  Company shall give Delcorp prompt notice of
any demands for payment received  by  the Company from a person asserting
appraisal rights, and Delcorp shall have  the  right to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such  demands. The Company shall
not, except with the prior written consent of  Delcorp, make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any  such demands.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  8 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) As  used herein, " _Dissenting  Shares_ " means  any shares of Company
Common Stock held by shareholders of the Company who  are  entitled to
rights to receive payment for their shares under Chapter 92A of  the  Nevada
Revised Statutes and who have properly exercised, perfected and not 
subsequently withdrawn or lost or waived their rights to demand payment with 
respect to their shares in accordance therewith.

holders of  Company Certificates, in the aggregate, pursuant to _Section
1.5(b)_,  2,500,000 shares of Delcorp Common Stock.

 

 

(b) Regardless  of whether Delcorp has EBITDA equal to or greater than

(a) The  Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in
good  standing under the laws of the State of Nevada and has the requisite
corporate  power and authority to own, lease and operate its assets and

to own, lease and operate the properties it purports to own, operate  or
lease and to carry on its business as it is now being or currently planned 
by  the Company to be conducted, except where the failure to have such
Approvals  could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have  a  Material Adverse Effect on the Company. Complete and
correct copies of the  certificate of incorporation and by-laws (or other
comparable governing  instruments with different names) (collectively
referred to herein as " _Charter  Documents_ ")  of the  Company, as
amended and currently in effect, have been heretofore made available  to
Delcorp or Delcorp's counsel. The Company is not in violation of any of the

(b) The  Company is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a foreign
corporation  and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character
of the  properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of its
activities  makes  such qualification or licensing necessary, except for
such failures to be so  duly qualified or licensed and in good standing that

have a Material Adverse Effect  on  the Company. Each jurisdiction in which
the Company is so qualified or licensed  is listed in Schedule 2.1.

obligated to make, any future  investment in or capital contribution to any
other entity.

 

 

(b) Each  Subsidiary that is a corporation is duly incorporated, validly

purports to own, operate or lease  and  to carry on its business as it is
now being or currently planned by the Company  to be conducted, except where

Company or such Subsidiary. Complete and correct copies  of  the Charter
Documents of each Subsidiary, as amended and currently in effect,  have been
heretofore delivered to Delcorp or Delcorp's counsel. No Subsidiary is  in
violation of any of the provisions of its Charter Documents.

(c) Each  Subsidiary is duly qualified or licensed to do business as a
foreign corporation  or foreign limited liability company and is in good

qualification or licensing  necessary, except for such failures to be so duly
qualified or licensed and  in  good standing that could not, individually or

on the Company or such Subsidiary.  Each jurisdiction in which each
Subsidiary is so qualified or licensed is listed  in Schedule 2.2.

2.3 **_Capitalization_**.

 

 

(a) The  authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 250,000 shares
of Company  Common Stock, of which 4,368 shares are issued and outstanding as
of the date  of  this Agreement, all of which shares of Company Common Stock
are validly issued,  fully paid and nonassessable. Through Termination
Agreements with the Foreign  Managers, at the time of the Closing of the
Merger, Rhapsody will issue common  stock which would have represented an
equivalent of an additional 94 shares  in  the aggregate to the Foreign
Managers which would have resulted in 4,462 shares  of Company Common Stock
outstanding as of the date of the Closing. Other than  Company Common Stock,
the Company has no class or series of securities  authorized by its Charter
Documents. Schedule 2.3(a) hereto contains a list  of all of the shareholders
of the Company and the Foreign Managers, the number  of shares of Company
Common Stock owned, or to be owned at the time of the  Closing, by each
shareholder and Foreign Manager and each shareholder's state of  residence.
Except as set forth in Schedule 2.3(a) hereto, as of the date of  this
Agreement, no shares of Company Common Stock are reserved for issuance 
upon  the exercise of outstanding options to purchase Company Common Stock
granted  to  employees of Company or other parties (" _Company  Stock
Options_ ")  other  than those issued by Rhapsody to the Foreign Managers.
No shares of Company  Common Stock are reserved for issuance upon the
exercise of outstanding warrants  or other rights (other than Company Stock
Options) to purchase Company Common  Stock other than to the Foreign
Managers. All shares of Company Common Stock  subject to issuance as
aforesaid, upon issuance on the terms and conditions  specified in the
instrument pursuant to which they are issuable, will be duly  authorized,
validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. There are no  commitments or
agreements of any character to which Company is bound obligating  Company to
accelerate the vesting of any Company Stock Option as a result of  the 
Merger. All outstanding shares of Company Common Stock and all outstanding 
Company Stock Options have been issued and granted in compliance with (x)
all  applicable securities laws and (in all material respects) other
applicable  laws  and regulations, and (y) all requirements set forth in any
applicable Company  Contracts (as defined in _Section 2.19_).  The  Company
has heretofore delivered to Delcorp or Delcorp's counsel true and  accurate
copies of the forms of documents used for the issuance of Company  Stock 
Options and shares to the Foreign Managers and a true and complete list of 
the  holders thereof, including their names and the numbers of shares of
Company  Common Stock underlying such holders' Company Stock Options or in
the  alternative the names of the Foreign Managers.

calls, rights (including preemptive  rights), commitments or agreements of
any character to which the Company is  a  party or by which it is bound
obligating the Company to issue, deliver or sell,  or cause to be issued,
delivered or sold, or repurchase, redeem or otherwise  acquire, or cause the
repurchase, redemption or acquisition of, any shares  of  capital stock,
partnership interests or similar ownership interests of the  Company or
obligating the Company to grant, extend, accelerate the vesting  of or 
enter into any such subscription, option, warrant, equity security, call,
right,  commitment or agreement.

 

 

(c) Except  as contemplated by this Agreement and except as set forth in 
Schedule 2.3(c) hereto, there are no registration rights, and there is no 
voting trust, proxy, rights plan, antitakeover plan or other agreement or 
understanding to which the Company is a party or by which the Company is
bound  with respect to any equity security of any class of the Company.

 

 

(d) Except  as set forth in Schedule 2.3(d), no outstanding shares of Company
Common Stock  are unvested or subjected to a repurchase option, risk of
forfeiture or other  condition under any applicable agreement with the
Company.

 

 

(e) The  authorized and outstanding capital stock or membership interests of
each  Subsidiary are set forth in Schedule 2.3(e) hereto. Except as set forth
in  Schedule 2.3(e), the Company owns all of the outstanding equity
securities  of each Subsidiary, free and clear of all Liens, either directly
or indirectly  through one or more other Subsidiaries. There are no
outstanding options,  warrants or other rights to purchase securities of any
Subsidiary.

authorization, execution  and  delivery thereof by the other parties hereto,
constitutes the legal and binding  obligation of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with  its terms, except as may be limited
by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization  or  other similar laws affecting
the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and  by general principles of
equity.

 

 

2.5 **_No  Conflict; Required Filings and Consents_**.  Except  as set

(or an event that with notice  or  lapse of time or both would become a
default) under, or materially impair the  Company's rights or alter the
rights or obligations of any third party under, or  give to others any rights
of termination, amendment, acceleration or  cancellation of, or result in the

provision of any Company Contract, except, with respect to clauses  (ii),

triggerings, accelerations, increases or other occurrences that would not, 
individually and in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect on the 
Company.

 

 

(b) The  execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company does not,
and the  performance of its obligations hereunder will not, require any
consent,  approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any  Governmental Entity or other third party (including,
without limitation, lenders  and lessors), except (i) for applicable
requirements, if any, of the Securities  Act, the Exchange Act or Blue Sky
Laws, and the rules and regulations  thereunder, and appropriate documents
received from or filed with the relevant  authorities of other jurisdictions
in which the Company is licensed or qualified  to do business, (ii) for the
filing of any notifications required under the  Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust

described in Schedule 2.5, and (iv) where the failure to obtain such 
consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or 
notifications, would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be 
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on the Company or, after the
Closing,  the Delcorp or the Surviving Corporation, or prevent consummation

obligations of any  third party under, or give to others any rights of
termination, amendment,  acceleration or cancellation of, or result in the
creation of a Lien on any  of  the properties or assets of Delcorp pursuant
to, any Delcorp Contracts, except,  with respect to clauses (ii) or (iii),
for any such conflicts, violations,  breaches, defaults or other occurrences

the  performance of it hereunder will not, require any consent, approval,

or notifications, would not, individually or in the  aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on Delcorp,  or prevent
consummation of the Merger or otherwise prevent the parties hereto  from
performing their obligations under this Agreement.

untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material  fact 
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements

results of its operations and cash flows for the periods  indicated, except
that the unaudited interim financial statements were, are  or  will be

condition of Delcorp, except (i) liabilities provided for in or otherwise 
disclosed in Delcorp SEC Reports filed prior to the date hereof, and (ii) 
liabilities incurred since September 30, 2007 in the ordinary course of

executed by the parties shall be superseded  in its entirety by the
provisions of this Agreement. Each party agrees to  maintain in confidence
any non-public information received from the other party,  and to use such
non-public information only for purposes of consummating the  transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Such confidentiality obligations  will not
apply to (i) information which was known to the one party or their 
respective agents prior to receipt from the other party; (ii) information
which  is or becomes generally known; (iii) information acquired by a party
or their  respective agents from a third party who was not bound to an
obligation of  confidentiality; and (iv) disclosure required by law. In the
event this  Agreement is terminated as provided in _Article VIII_  hereof,

personnel of the  Company during the period prior to the Closing to obtain
all information  concerning the business, including the status of business
development efforts,  properties, results of operations and personnel of the
Company, as Delcorp  may  reasonably request. No information or knowledge
obtained by Delcorp in any  investigation pursuant to this _Section 5.6_ 
will  affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained
herein  or  the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate
the  Merger.

may reasonably request. No information  or  knowledge obtained by the
Company in any investigation pursuant to this  _Section 5.6_  will  affect
or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty contained herein  or 
the conditions to the obligations of the parties to consummate the  Merger.

 

 

(iii) Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, each party
hereby agrees that, by  proceeding with the Closing, he or it shall be
conclusively deemed to have  waived for all purposes hereunder any inaccuracy
of representation or breach  of  warranty by another party that is actually
known by him or it prior to the  Closing, including knowledge obtained as a
result of a supplement or amendment  to a Disclosure Schedule (as hereinafter
defined) pursuant to _Section 5.14_;  provided that no such supplement or
amendment shall preclude the Company or  Parent from terminating this
Agreement if the Disclosure Schedule, as so  supplemented or amended, does
not satisfy the provisions of _Section 6.2(a)_  or  _Section 6.3(a)_,  as
the  case may be.

Agreement and the transactions governed by  it,  and no party shall issue or
otherwise make any public announcement or  communication pertaining to this
Agreement or the transaction without the prior  consent of Delcorp (in the
case of the Company and the Signing Shareholders)  or  the Company (in the
case of Delcorp), except as required by any legal  requirement or by the
rules and regulations of, or pursuant to any agreement  of  a stock exchange
or trading system. Each party will not unreasonably withhold  approval from
the others with respect to any press release or public  announcement. If any
party determines with the advice of counsel that it is  required to make this
Agreement and the terms of the transaction public or  otherwise issue a press
release or make public disclosure with respect thereto,  it shall, at a
reasonable time before making any public disclosure, consult  with  the
other party regarding such disclosure, seek such confidential treatment 
for  such terms or portions of this Agreement or the transaction as may be
reasonably  requested by the other party and disclose only such information
as is legally  compelled to be disclosed. This provision will not apply to
communications  by  any party to its counsel, accountants and other
professional  advisors.

and its board of directors and the  Company and its board of directors shall,
if any state takeover statute or  similar statute or regulation is or becomes
applicable to the Merger, this  Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, use its  commercially reasonable efforts to
enable the Merger and the other transactions  contemplated by this Agreement
to be consummated as promptly as practicable  on  the terms contemplated by
this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to  the  contrary, nothing
in this Agreement shall be deemed to require Delcorp or the  Company to agree

whatsoever. This paragraph will survive this Agreement  and  will not expire

**ARTICLE  VII**

 

**_INDEMNIFICATION_**

 

 

7.1 **_Indemnification  of Delcorp_**.

 

 

(a) Subject  to the terms and conditions of this _Article VII_  (including
without limitation the limitations set forth in _Section 7.4_),  Delcorp, the
Surviving Corporation and their respective representatives,  successors and
permitted assigns (the " _Delcorp  Indemnitees_ ")  shall  be indemnified,
defended and held harmless by those Persons who receive shares  of Delcorp
Company Stock from Delcorp upon consummation of the Merger, but  only  to
the extent of the Escrow Shares, from and against all Losses asserted 
against, resulting to, imposed upon, or incurred by any Delcorp Indemnitee 
by  reason of, arising out of or resulting from:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  58 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) the  inaccuracy or breach of any representation or warranty of the
Company contained  in or made pursuant to this Agreement, any Schedule or any
certificate  delivered by the Company to Delcorp pursuant to this Agreement
with respect  hereto or thereto in connection with the Closing; and

 

 

(ii) the  non-fulfillment or breach of any covenant or agreement of the
Company contained  in this Agreement;

 

 

(b) As  used in this _Article VII_,  the  term " _Losses_ " shall 
include on a dollar for dollar basis all losses, liabilities, damages, 
judgments, awards, orders, penalties, settlements, costs and expenses 
(including, without limitation, interest, penalties, court costs and
reasonable  legal fees and expenses) including those arising from any
demands, claims,  suits, actions, costs of investigation, notices of
violation or noncompliance,  causes of action, proceedings and assessments
whether or not made by third  parties or whether or not ultimately determined
to be valid. Solely for the   purpose of determining the amount of any
Losses (and not for determining any  breach) for which Delcorp Indemnitee may
be entitled to indemnification pursuant  to _Article VII_,  any 
representation or warranty contained in this Agreement that is qualified by 
a  term or terms such as "material," "materially," or "Material Adverse
Effect" shall be deemed made or given without such qualification and without
giving  effect to such words.

 

 

7.2 **_Indemnification  of Third Party Claims_**.  The  indemnification
obligations and liabilities under this _Article VII_  with  respect to
actions, proceedings, lawsuits, investigations, demands or other  claims
brought against Delcorp by a Person other than the Company (a " _Third 
Party Claim_ ")  shall  be subject to the following terms and conditions:

 

 

(a) **_Notice  of Claim_**.  Delcorp, acting through the Committee, will
give the Representative prompt  written notice after receiving written notice
of any Third Party Claim or  discovering the liability, obligation or facts
giving rise to such Third Party  Claim (a " _Notice  of Claim_ ")  which 
Notice of Third Party Claim shall set forth (i) a brief description of the 
nature of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the total amount of the actual  out-of-
pocket Loss or the anticipated potential Loss (including any costs or 
expenses which have been or may be reasonably incurred in connection
therewith),  and (iii) whether such Loss may be covered (in whole or in part)
under any  insurance and the estimated amount of such Loss which may be
covered under  such  insurance, and the Representative shall be entitled to
participate in the  defense of Third Party Claim at its expense.

 

 

(b) **_Defense_**.  The  Representative shall have the right, at its option
(subject to the limitations  set forth in sub _section  7.2(c)_   below) 
and at its own expense, by written notice to Delcorp, to assume the entire 
control of, subject to the right of Delcorp to participate (at its expense 
and  with counsel of its choice) in, the defense, compromise or settlement of
the  Third Party Claim as to which such Notice of Claim has been given, and
shall  be  entitled to appoint a recognized and reputable counsel reasonably
acceptable  to  Delcorp to be the lead counsel in connection with such
defense. If the  Representative is permitted and elects to assume the defense
of a Third Party  Claim:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  59 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(i) the  Representative shall diligently and in good faith defend such Third
Party Claim  and shall keep Delcorp reasonably informed of the status of such
defense;  provided, however, that in the case of any settlement providing for
remedies  which are not merely incidental to a primary damage claim or claims
for monetary  damages, Delcorp shall have the right to approve any
settlement, which approval  will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned; and

 

 

(ii) Delcorp  shall cooperate fully in all respects with the Representative
in any such  defense, compromise or settlement thereof, including, without
limitation, the  selection of counsel, and Delcorp shall make available to
the Representative  all  pertinent information and documents under its
control.

 

 

(c) **_Limitations  of Right to Assume Defense_**.  The  Representative
shall not be entitled to assume control of such defense and  shall  pay the
fees and expenses of counsel retained by Delcorp if (i) the Third Party 
Claim relates to or arises in connection with any criminal proceeding,
action,  indictment, allegation or investigation; (ii) the Third Party Claim
seeks an  injunction or equitable relief against Delcorp which is not merely
incidental  to  a primary damage claim or claims for monetary damages; or
(iii) there is a  reasonable probability that a Third Party Claim may
materially and adversely  affect Delcorp other than as a result of money
damages or other money  payments.

 

 

(d) **_Other  Limitations_**.  Failure  to give prompt Notice of Claim or
to provide copies of relevant available  documents or to furnish relevant
available data shall not constitute a defense  (in whole or in part) to any
Third Party Claim by Delcorp against the  Representative and shall not affect
the Representative's duty or obligations  under this _Article VII_, 
except  to the extent (and only to the extent that) such failure shall have
adversely  affected the ability of the Representative to defend against or
reduce its  liability or caused or increased such liability or otherwise
caused the damages  for which the Representative is obligated to be greater
than such damages would  have been had Delcorp given the Representative
prompt notice hereunder. So  long  as the Representative is defending any
such action actively and in good faith,  Delcorp shall not settle such
action. Delcorp shall make available to the  Representative all relevant
records and other relevant materials required by  them and in the possession
or under the control of Delcorp, for the use of  the  Representative and its
representatives in defending any such action, and shall  in other respects
give reasonable cooperation in such defense.

 

 

(e) **_Failure  to Defend_**.  If the  Representative, promptly after
receiving a Notice of Claim, fails to defend  such  Third Party Claim
actively and in good faith, Delcorp, at the reasonable cost  and expense of
the Representative, will (upon further written notice) have  the  right to
undertake the defense, compromise or settlement of such Third Party  Claim as
it may determine in its reasonable discretion, provided that the 
Representative shall have the right to approve any settlement, which
approval  will not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  60 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(f) **_Delcorp 's  Rights_**.  Anything in this _Section 7.2_  to the 
contrary notwithstanding, the Representative shall not, without the written 
consent of Delcorp, settle or compromise any action or consent to the entry 
of  any judgment which does not include as an unconditional term thereof the
giving  by the claimant or the plaintiff to Delcorp of a full and
unconditional release  from all liability and obligation in respect of such
action without any payment  by Delcorp.

 

 

(g) **_Representative  Consent_**.  Unless  the Representative has
consented to a settlement of a Third Party Claim, the  amount of the
settlement shall not be a binding determination of the amount  of  the Loss
and such amount shall be determined in accordance with the provisions  of the
Escrow Agreement.

 

 

7.3 **_Insurance  Effect_**.  To the  extent that any Losses that are
subject to indemnification pursuant to this  _Article VII_  are  covered by
insurance paid for by the Company prior to or after the Closing,  Delcorp
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the maximum recovery 
under such insurance; provided that Delcorp shall nevertheless be entitled 
to  bring a claim for indemnification under this _Article VII_  in  respect
of such Losses and the time limitations set forth in _Section 7.4_  hereof 
for bringing a claim of indemnification under this Agreement shall be tolled 
during the pendency of such insurance claim. The existence of a claim by
Delcorp  for monies from an insurer or against a third party in respect of
any Loss  shall  not, however, delay any payment pursuant to the
indemnification provisions  contained herein and otherwise determined to be
due and owing by the  Representative. If Delcorp has received the payment
required by this Agreement  from the Representative in respect of any Loss
and later receives proceeds  from  insurance or other amounts in respect of
such Loss, then it shall hold such  proceeds or other amounts in trust for
the benefit of the Representative and  shall pay to the Representative, as
promptly as practicable after receipt,  a sum  equal to the amount of such
proceeds or other amount received, up to the  aggregate amount of any
payments received from the Representative pursuant  to  this Agreement in
respect of such Loss. Notwithstanding any other provisions  of  this
Agreement, it is the intention of the parties that no insurer or any other 
third party shall be (i) entitled to a benefit it would not be entitled to 
receive in the absence of the foregoing indemnification provisions, or (ii) 
relieved of the responsibility to pay any claims for which it is  obligated.

 

 

7.4 **_Limitations  on Indemnification_**.

 

 

(a) **_Survival:  Time Limitation_**.  The  representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements in this Agreement or  in  any writing delivered by
the Company to Delcorp in connection with this  Agreement (including the
certificate required to be delivered by the Company  pursuant to _Section
6.3(a)_)  shall  survive the Closing for the period that ends on the Basic
Escrow Termination  Date (the " _Basic  Survival Period_ ")  except  that
the right of Delcorp to bring (i) Tax Indemnification Claims and 
Environmental Indemnity Claims shall survive the Closing for the period that 
ends on the T/E Escrow Termination Date (the " _T/E  Survival Period_ ") 
and  (ii) Claims for the breach of the representations and warranties in
Section  2.3  and 1.13(d) shall survive without limitation as to time.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  61 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

(b) Any  indemnification claim made by Delcorp prior to the termination of
the Basic  Survival Period or the T/E Survival Period (each a " _Survival 
Period_ "),  as  the case may be, shall be preserved despite the subsequent
termination of such  Survival Period and any claim set forth in a Notice of
Claim sent prior to  the  expiration of such Survival Period shall survive
until final resolution thereof.  Except as set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, no claim for  indemnification under this _Article VII_ 
shall be  brought after the end of the Survival Period or the T/E Survival
Period, as  the  case may be.

 

 

(c) **_Deductible_**.  No  amount shall be payable under _Article VII_ 
unless  and until the aggregate amount of all indemnifiable Losses otherwise
payable  exceeds $1,400,000 (the " _Deductible_ "),  in  which event the
amount payable shall only be the full amount in excess of the  amount of the
Deductible, and, subject to the limitations set forth in  _Section 7.5(c)_, 
all  future amounts that become payable under _Section 7.1_  from  time to
time thereafter. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Deductible shall  not 
apply to Losses that arise out of (i) a breach of the representations and 
warranties in _Section  1.13(d)_   or  _Section  2.3_ ,  or (ii)  an T/E
Indemnification Claim all of which shall be indemnifiable as to all  Losses
that so arise from the first dollar thereof. It is understood and agreed 
that to the extent that there are reserves in the Audited Financial
Statements  or Unaudited Financial Statements for any matter which may be a
claim against  the Company, any Losses shall first apply against any such
applicable reserve  and thereafter to the extent permitted herein against
the  Deductible.

 

 

(d) **_Aggregate  Amount Limitation_**.  The  aggregate liability for
Losses pursuant to _Section 7.1_  shall  not in any event exceed the Basic
Escrow Shares in the case of Basic Indemnity  Claims or the T/E Indemnity
Shares in the case of Tax Indemnity Claims or  Environmental Indemnity Claims
and Delcorp shall have no claim against the  Company's shareholders other
than for any of such Escrow Shares (and any  proceeds of the shares or
distributions with respect to the Escrow Shares). 

 

 

7.5 **_Exclusive  Remedy_**.  Delcorp, on behalf of itself and the other
Delcorp Indemnitees, hereby  acknowledges and agrees that, from and after the
Closing, the sole remedy of  the  Delcorp Indemnitees with respect to any
and all claims for money damages arising  out of or relating to this
Agreement shall be pursuant and subject to the  requirements of the
indemnification provisions set forth in this _Article VII_.  Notwithstanding
any of the foregoing, nothing contained in this _Article VII_  shall in  any
way impair, modify or otherwise limit a Delcorp Indemnitees right to bring 
any claim, demand or suit against the other party based upon such other
party's  actual fraud or intentional or willful misrepresentation or
omission, it being  understood that a mere breach of a representation and
warranty, without  intentional or willful misrepresentation or omission, does
not constitute fraud. 

 

 

7.6 **_Adjustment  to Merger Consideration_**.  Amounts  paid for
indemnification under _Article VII_  shall be  deemed to be an adjustment to
the value of the shares of Delcorp Common Stock  issued by Delcorp as a
result of the Merger, except as otherwise required by  Law.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

-  62 -  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

7.7 **_Representative  Capacities; Application of Escrow Shares_**.  The 
parties acknowledge that the Representative's obligations under this 
_Article VII_  are  solely as a representative of the Company's stockholders
in the manner set forth  in the Escrow Agreement with respect to the
obligations to indemnify Delcorp  under this _Article VII_  and that  the
Representative shall have no personal responsibility for any expenses 
incurred by him in such capacity and that all payments to Delcorp as a
result  of  such indemnification obligations shall be made solely from, and
to the extent  of, the Escrow Shares. Out-of-pocket expenses of the
Representative for  attorneys' fees and other costs shall be borne in the
first instance by Delcorp,  which may make a claim for reimbursement thereof
against the Escrow Shares  upon  the claim with respect to which such
expenses are incurred becoming an  Established Claim (as defined in the
Escrow Agreement). The parties further  acknowledge that all actions to be
taken by Delcorp pursuant to this  _Article VII_  shall be  taken on its
behalf by the Committee in accordance with the provisions of the  Escrow
Agreement. The Escrow Agent, pursuant to the Escrow Agreement after  the 
Closing, may apply all or a portion of the Escrow Shares to satisfy any
claim  for indemnification pursuant to this _Article VII_.  The  Escrow
Agent will hold the remaining portion of the Escrow Shares until final 
resolution of all claims for indemnification or disputes relating  thereto.

 

 

7.8 **_Tax  Benefits_**.  The  amount of any Losses for which
indemnification is provided shall be reduced  by  any net Tax benefit to
such indemnified party and its Affiliates, to the extent  realized by such
party as a result of such Losses, including the present value  (determined by
discounting at 8%) of the benefit arising from an increase in  the  Tax
basis of assets, net of any Tax costs incurred by the indemnified party  as
a  result of the receipt of the indemnification payments hereunder. In
calculating  the amount of net Tax benefit, the indemnified party and its
Affiliates shall  be  presumed to pay Taxes at a forty percent (40%) Tax
rate. The indemnified party  shall provide the indemnifying party with such
documentation as may be  reasonably requested in order to ascertain or
confirm the amount of any net  Tax  benefit or net Tax cost referred to
herein.

 

 

7.9 **_Mitigation_**.  A  Delcorp Indemnitee shall use commercially
reasonably efforts to mitigate Losses  suffered, incurred or sustained by it
arising out of any matter for which it  is  entitled to indemnification
hereunder; provided that no Delcorp Indemnitee  shall  be required to (i)
take any action or refrain from taking any action that is  contrary to any
applicable Contract, order or law binding on it or any Affiliate  thereof or
(ii) incur any out-of-pocket expense in connection with such  mitigation
(other than de minimus incidental expenses).

 

 

7.10 **_No  Double Recovery_**.  To the  extent that any of the items or
matters that would otherwise constitute a Loss  pursuant to Section 7.1(b) of
this Agreement have been incurred and have already  been incorporated in the
calculation of EBITDA for the purposes of Section  1.18  of this Agreement,
such items or matters shall not also be a Loss for purposes  of indemnity
under this Article VII and shall not apply against the Deductible. 
Conversely, to the extent any Loss has been incurred that has applied
against  the Deductible or has been indemnified, such Loss shall not be
included in  the  calculation of EBITDA for the purposes of _Section  1.18_
  of this  Agreement.

each other document executed in connection with the transactions 
contemplated hereby, and the consummation thereof, may be executed in one 
or  more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same
document  and shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been
signed  by  each of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being
understood  that  all parties need not sign the same counterpart. Delivery

Agreement and the documents and instruments and other agreements among the

10.5   **_Severability_**.  In the  event that any provision of this
Agreement, or the application thereof, becomes  or is declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction to be illegal, void or  unenforceable, the remainder
of this Agreement will continue in full force  and  effect and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances  will be
interpreted so as reasonably to effect the intent of the parties  hereto. 
The parties further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision 
of  this Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will
achieve,  to the  extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes
of such void or  unenforceable provision.

 

 

10.6   **_Other  Remedies; Specific Performance_**.  Except  as otherwise
provided herein, any and all remedies herein expressly conferred  upon a
party will be deemed cumulative with and not exclusive of any other  remedy
conferred hereby, or by law or equity upon such party, and the exercise  by a
party of any one remedy will not preclude the exercise of any other 
remedy.  The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event  that  any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance  with  their specific terms or were otherwise breached. It is
accordingly agreed  that  the parties shall be entitled to seek an
injunction or injunctions to prevent  breaches of this Agreement and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions  hereof in any court of the
United States or any state having jurisdiction,  this  being in addition to
any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or  in  equity.

 

 

10.7   **_Governing  Law_**.  This  Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the law of  the  State of Delaware regardless
of the law that might otherwise govern under  applicable principles of
conflicts of law thereof.

 

 

10.8   **_Rules  of Construction_**.  The  parties hereto agree that they
have been represented by counsel during the  negotiation and execution of
this Agreement and, therefore, waive the  application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing  that ambiguities in an agreement
or other document will be construed against  the  party drafting such
agreement or document.

 

 

10.9   **_Assignment_**.  No  party may assign either this Agreement or any

the right to file with a court of competent jurisdiction  an  application
for temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, writ of attachment,  writ of

rulings by more than one arbitrator. Any disputes  over which arbitrator
shall hear any consolidated matter shall be resolved  by  JAMS.

 

 

(g) **_Power  and Authority of Arbitrator_**.  The  arbitrator shall not

instance. Upon issuance of an  award, costs shall be awarded to the
prevailing party.

 

 

(j) **_Attorneys '  Fees_**.  If a  party to this Agreement shall bring any
action, suit, counterclaim, appeal,  arbitration, or mediation for any relief
against the other parties, declaratory  or otherwise, to enforce the terms

"),  the  non-prevailing party in such Action shall pay to the prevailing
party in  such  Action a reasonable sum for the prevailing party's

written notice by such counsel to such party)  incurred in prosecuting or
defending such Action and/or enforcing any judgment,  order, ruling or award
(referred to herein as a " _Decision_ "),  granted therein, all of which
shall be deemed to have accrued from the  commencement of such Action, and
shall be paid whether or not such Action  is  prosecuted to a Decision. Any
Decision entered into in such Action shall  contain  a specific provision
providing for the recovery of attorneys' fees and expenses  incurred in
enforcing such Decision. The court or arbitrator may fix the  amount  of
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses upon the request of any party. For
