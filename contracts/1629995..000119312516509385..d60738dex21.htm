shall be merged with and into the Company and the separate corporate
existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be the

" _Surviving Corporation_ ") and a wholly owned Subsidiary of US Parent, and
the separate corporate existence of the Company, with all of its rights,
privileges, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected by the Merger,
except as set forth in _Article II_. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property,
rights, privileges, powers and franchises and all and every other interest of

conditions at the Closing) have been satisfied or waived in accordance with
this Agreement, or at such other time and place as the Company and Parent may
agree in writing. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this

(b) The parties hereto shall take all actions necessary so that the bylaws of

_Section 5.08_.

 



-2- SECTION 1.05. _Directors and Officers_.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE

 

CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS

 

SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, US
Parent, Merger Sub or the holders of any shares of capital stock of the
Company, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub:

(a)  _Merger Consideration_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, of the Company (each, a " _Share_ ") issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Shares owned by Ultimate
Parent, Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or indirect wholly
owned Subsidiary of Ultimate Parent, Parent or US Parent and Shares owned by
the Company, including Shares held in treasury by the Company, and in each
case not held on behalf of third parties or held in any rabbi trust in
connection with any Company Benefit Plan (collectively, the " _Cancelled
Shares_ "), which shall be treated in accordance with _Section 2.01(b)_ , and
(ii) the Dissenting Shares, which shall be treated in accordance with
_Section 2.04_ ) shall be converted into the right to receive $25.50 per Share
in cash, without interest (the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ "). At the
Effective Time, all such Shares shall cease to be outstanding, shall be
cancelled and shall cease to exist, and each such Share shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration.

 

(b) _Cancellation of Cancelled Shares_. Each Cancelled Share shall cease to be
outstanding, shall be cancelled without payment of any consideration therefor
and shall cease to exist.

(c) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one (1) validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock (the " _Surviving
Corporation Common Stock_ "), par value $0.01 per share, of the

 



-3-  Surviving Corporation (the " _Converted Shares_ "). In addition to the
foregoing conversion, the Surviving Corporation shall contemporaneously issue
ten million (10,000,000) shares of Surviving Corporation Common Stock (the "
_Issued Shares_ ") to US Parent in consideration for the deposit of the
Exchange Fund by or on behalf of US Parent with the Paying Agent plus payment
of an amount equal to the aggregate par values for such shares. The Converted
Shares and the Issued Shares together shall constitute the only issued and
outstanding shares of the capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

 

SECTION 2.02. _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 

(a) _Treatment of Restricted Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each
restricted stock unit award in respect of Shares granted under a Company
Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and
that vests solely based on a holders continued service (a " _Company RSU_ ")
shall fully vest and shall be cancelled and converted automatically into the
right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably
practicable (but no later than five (5) Business Days) after the Effective
Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each Share underlying
such Company RSU;  _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such Company
RSU is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code,
payment in respect of such Company RSU shall be made at the earliest time
permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plan that will not trigger a Tax
or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, with interest at the U.S. prime
rate as shown at the end of the day on Bloomberg screen BTMM or PRIME INDEX
HP, whichever is higher (the " _Interest Rate_ ") from the Closing Date
through such payment date.

(b) _Treatment of Performance Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, with
respect to each restricted stock unit award in respect of Shares granted under
a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time and that vests, in whole or in part, based on the achievement of a
specified level of performance (a " _Company PSU_ "), such performance shall
be deemed satisfied at the greater of (x) actual performance as objectively
determined by the Human Resources and Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of the Company (the " _Compensation Committee_ ") prior to the
Effective Time based on performance through a day that is no more than five
(5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time and (y) the target level of one
hundred percent (100%), and shall be cancelled and converted automatically
into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation, as soon as
reasonably practicable (but no later than five (5) Business Days) after the
Effective Time, the Per Share Merger Consideration in respect of each Share
underlying such Company PSU; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such
Company PSU is nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of
the Code, payment in respect of such Company PSU shall be made at the
earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plan that will not
trigger a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, with interest at the
Interest Rate from the Closing Date through such payment date.

 

(c) _Treatment of Phantom Stock Units_. At the Effective Time, each phantom
stock unit award in respect of Shares granted under a Company Stock Plan that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Phantom
Unit_ ") shall, to the extent not previously vested, fully vest and shall be
cancelled and converted automatically into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation, as soon as reasonably practicable (but no later than
five

 



-4-  (5) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Per Share Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share underlying such Company Phantom Unit;
_provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent such Company Phantom Unit is
nonqualified deferred compensation subject to Section 409A of the Code,
payment in respect of such Company Phantom Unit shall be made at the earliest
time permitted under the applicable Company Stock Plan that will not trigger
a Tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code, with interest at the Interest
Rate from the Closing Date through such payment date.

 

(d) _Company ESPP_. Prior to the Closing Date, the Company shall, in
accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP, take all actions that are
necessary to provide that with respect to the Company ESPP: (i) the Savings
Period (as defined in the Company ESPP) in progress as of the Closing Date
(the " _Final Savings Period_ ") shall end no later than the tenth (10th)
Business Day prior to the anticipated Closing Date (or, if the anticipated
Closing Date becomes known less than ten (10) Business Days prior thereto,
then as soon as practicable after such anticipated Closing Date becomes known
and prior to the Closing Date); (ii) each Company ESPP participants
accumulated contributions under the Company ESPP shall be used to purchase
Shares in accordance with the terms of the Company ESPP as of the end of the
Final Savings Period; and (iii) the Company ESPP shall terminate immediately
following the conclusion of the Final Savings Period.

 

(e) _Corporate Actions_. At or prior to the Effective Time, the Company, the
board of directors of the Company and the Compensation Committee, as
applicable, shall adopt any resolutions and take any actions which are
necessary to effectuate the provisions of _Section 2.02(a)_ through _Section
2.02(d)_. The Company shall take all actions necessary to ensure that,
from and after the Effective Time, none of Parent, US Parent or the Surviving
Corporation will be required to deliver Shares or other capital stock of the
Company to any Person pursuant to or in settlement of Company RSUs, Company
PSUs or Company Phantom Units.

SECTION 2.03. _Surrender of Shares_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent or US Parent will
appoint a paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") which agent and the terms of
such appointment are reasonably acceptable to the Company for purposes of
exchanging the Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration to which the
holders of the Shares shall become entitled pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_. At
or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall cause US Parent to, and US Parent
shall, deposit or cause to be deposited with the Paying Agent, in trust for
the benefit of the holders of Shares, a cash amount in immediately
available funds sufficient in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary
for the Paying Agent to make payments under _Section 2.01(a)_ (such cash being
hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). The Paying Agent shall
invest the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent (on behalf of US Parent) or by
US Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in
obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial
paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of
deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial
banks with capital exceeding $1 billion, or in money market funds having a
rating in the highest investment category granted by a recognized credit
rating agency at the time of acquisition or a combination of the foregoing
and, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three (3) months.

 



-5-  Subject to _Section 2.03(c)_ , to the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt cash payment of the aggregate Per
Share Merger Consideration as contemplated hereby, Parent shall cause US
Parent to, and US Parent shall, promptly replace or restore the cash in the
Exchange Fund lost through such investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is at all applicable times maintained at a level
sufficient to make such payments. Any interest and other income resulting from
such investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund, and any amounts in
excess of the amounts payable under _Section 2.01(a)_ shall be promptly
returned to US Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as requested by Parent (on
behalf of US Parent) or by US Parent. The funds deposited with the Paying
Agent pursuant to this  _Section 2.03(a)_ shall not be used for any purpose
other than as contemplated by this _Section 2.03(a)_.

(b) _Exchange Procedures_.

(i) _Transmittal Materials_. Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any
event within three (3) Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail or otherwise provide to each holder of
record of Shares (other than holders of Cancelled Shares and Dissenting
Shares) (A) transmittal materials specifying that delivery shall be effected,
and risk of loss and title with respect to Shares held in non-certificated
form and represented by book-entry (each, a " _Book-Entry Share_ ") shall
pass, only upon delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book-entry
transfer of such Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the
transfer as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), such transmittal
materials to be in such form and have such other provisions as Parent may
reasonably determine, and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of the Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent.

 

(ii) _Payment of Per Share Merger Consideration_. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, no holder of Book-Entry Shares
shall be required to deliver a certificate formerly representing Shares or an
executed letter of transmittal to the Paying Agent to receive the aggregate
Per Share Merger Consideration that such holder is entitled to receive as a
result of the Merger pursuant to _Section 2.01(a)_. In lieu thereof, each
holder of record of one or more Book-Entry Shares shall, upon receipt by the
Paying Agent of an "agents message" in customary form (it being understood
that the holders of Book-Entry Shares shall be deemed to have surrendered such
Shares upon receipt by the Paying Agent of such "agents message" or such
other evidence, if any, as the Paying Agent may reasonably request), be
entitled to receive, and Parent shall cause US Parent to, and US Parent shall,
cause the Paying Agent to pay and deliver as promptly as reasonably
practicable after the Effective Time, a cash amount in immediately available
funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in
_Section 2.03(e)_ ) equal to the product obtained by multiplying __ (A) the
number of Book-Entry Shares held of record by such holder by (B) the Per Share
Merger Consideration, and the Book-Entry Shares so surrendered shall
forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any amount
payable upon due surrender of the Shares.

 

(iii) _Unrecorded Transfers; Other Payments_. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company or if payment of the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration is to
be made to a Person other

 



-6-  than the Person in whose name the surrendered Book-Entry Share is
registered, a check for any cash to be exchanged upon due surrender of the
Book-Entry Share may be issued to such transferee or other Person if the
Book-Entry Share formerly representing such Shares is presented to the Paying
Agent accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such
transfer and to evidence that any applicable transfer or other similar
Taxes have been paid or are not applicable.

(iv) Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 2.03(b)_ , each
Share shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only
the right to receive upon such surrender (together with such documents as may
reasonably be required pursuant to the instructions included in the applicable
transmittal materials) the applicable Per Share Merger Consideration as
contemplated by this _Article II_. US Parent shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Paying Agent, in connection with the exchange
of Shares for the Per Share Merger Consideration.

(c) _Termination of the Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investment thereof) that remains undistributed
one (1) year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to US Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, upon demand by US Parent. Any holders of Shares (other
than Cancelled Shares or Dissenting Shares) who have not theretofore complied
with this _Article_ _ _ _II_ shall thereafter be entitled to look only to US
Parent and the Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger
Consideration (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in _Section 2.03(e)_ ) upon acceptable evidence of Book-Entry Shares,
without any interest thereon in accordance with the provisions set forth in
_Section 2.03(b)_ , and US Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall remain
liable for (subject to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar
Law) payment of their claims for the Per Share Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Book-Entry Shares. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
none of the Surviving Corporation, Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent, the
Company, the Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former
holder of Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official
pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or other similar Law.

(d) _Transfers_. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no
transfers on the stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, acceptable evidence of a Book-Entry Share is presented to the Surviving
Corporation, Parent, US Parent or the Paying Agent for transfer, it shall be
cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in immediately available funds to
which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant to this _Article II_. The Per
Share Merger Consideration paid upon receipt by the Paying Agent of an
"agents message" for Book-Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the Shares formerly represented by such Book-Entry
Shares.

(e) _Withholding Rights_. Each of US Parent, the Surviving Corporation and
their respective agents (including the Paying Agent) shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this
Agreement to any holder of Shares, Company RSUs, Company PSUs or Company
Phantom Units such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code or any other applicable
Law (including any federal, state, local or foreign Tax Law), taking into
account any

 



-7-  applicable exemption under such Law. To the extent that amounts are so
withheld by US Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
agents (including the Paying Agent), as the case may be, such withheld
amounts (i) shall be promptly remitted by US Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective agents (including the Paying Agent), as applicable,
to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii) shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Shares,
Company RSUs, Company PSUs or Company Phantom Units in respect of which such
deduction and withholding were made by US Parent, the Surviving Corporation or
any of their respective agents (including the Paying Agent), as the case may
be.

SECTION 2.04. _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, any Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time and as to which the holders thereof have properly
demanded appraisal in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL and have
not effectively withdrawn such demand (collectively, " _Dissenting Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Per Share Merger
Consideration unless and until such Person shall have effectively withdrawn or
lost such Persons right to appraisal under the DGCL, at which time such
Shares shall be treated as if they had been converted into and become
exchangeable for the right to receive, as of the Effective Time, the Per Share
Merger Consideration as provided in _Section 2.01(a)_ , after giving effect
to any required Tax withholdings pursuant to _Section 2.03(e)_ , and such
Shares shall no longer be deemed Dissenting Shares, and such holder thereof
shall cease to have any other rights with respect to such Shares. Each holder
of Dissenting Shares shall be entitled to receive only the payment provided by
Section 262 of the DGCL with respect to the Dissenting Shares owned by such
holder. The Company shall give Parent and US Parent prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any

be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse
Effect. The Company has made available to Parent prior to the execution of

-13- (e) _SEC Reports; Financial Statements; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(i) Each of the Company and CPPL has filed or furnished, as applicable, all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and other documents required to be
filed or furnished by it with the SEC (the forms, statements, certifications,
reports and other documents of the Company and CPPL so filed or furnished and
those filed or furnished subsequent to the date of this Agreement, including
all exhibits and other information incorporated therein and all amendments and
supplements thereto, the " _SEC_ _Reports_ "). As of their respective dates of
filing, or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing made prior to the
date of this Agreement, as of the date of the last such amendment or
superseding filing prior to the date of this Agreement, the SEC Reports
complied, and, in the case of the Proxy Statement or any registration
statement, complied or will comply, in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be,
and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in
effect on the date of any such filing. As of the time of filing with the SEC
(or, if amended prior to the date of this Agreement, as of the date of such
amendment), none of the SEC Reports so filed contained any untrue statement
of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, except to the
extent that the information in such SEC Reports has been amended or superseded
by a later SEC Report filed prior to the date of this Agreement. Each SEC
Report that is a registration statement or prospectus, as amended, if
applicable, filed pursuant to the Securities Act, as of the date such
registration statement, prospectus or applicable amendment became effective,
did not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements made therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were
made, not misleading.

 

(ii) The audited consolidated financial statements of the Company (including
any related notes thereto) and its Subsidiaries included in the SEC Reports
have been prepared, or, in the case of SEC Reports filed after the date of
this Agreement, will be prepared, in all material respects in accordance with
United States generally accepted accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") applied
on a consistent basis during the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes thereto) and applicable accounting requirements and published
rules and regulations of the SEC, and each fairly present, or, in the case of
SEC Reports filed after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in
all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and
its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof (taking into account
the notes thereto) and the consolidated results of their operations and cash
flows for the periods indicated. The unaudited consolidated financial
statements of the Company (including any related notes thereto) for all
interim periods included in the SEC Reports filed prior to the date of this
Agreement have been prepared, or, in the case of SEC Reports filed after the
date of this Agreement, will be prepared, in accordance with GAAP in all
material respects (except as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC or other
applicable rules and regulations of the SEC) applied on a consistent basis
during the periods involved (except as may be indicated in the notes thereto)
and applicable accounting requirements and published rules and regulations
of the SEC, and each fairly present, or, in the case of SEC Reports filed
after the date of this Agreement, will fairly present, in all material
respects the

 



-14-  consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of
the respective dates thereof (taking into account the notes thereto) and the
consolidated results of their operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated (subject to normal period-end adjustments).

(iii) The Company and CPPL maintain disclosure controls and procedures
required by Rule 13a-15(e) or Rule 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act effective
to ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company and CPPL in
the reports that they file or submit under the Exchange Act is recorded,
processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the
SECs rules and forms. The Company and CPPL each maintain internal control
over financial reporting required by Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) under
the Exchange Act sufficient to provide reasonable assurances regarding the
reliability of financial reporting for the Company and its Subsidiaries, on a
consolidated basis, and CPPL and its Subsidiaries, on a consolidated basis.
The Company and CPPL have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation
prior to the date of this Agreement, to the Companys and CPPLs respective
auditors, the audit committee of the board of directors of the Company and the
audit committee of the board of directors of CPP GP LLC, the general partner
of CPPL, as applicable (A) any known significant deficiencies and material
weaknesses in the design or operation of internal control over financial
reporting which are reasonably likely to adversely affect in any material
respect the Companys or CPPLs ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any known fraud, whether or not material,
that involves management or other employees who have, in each case, a
significant role in the Companys or CPPLs internal control over financial
reporting. The Company has made available to Parent a summary of any such
disclosure made to the Companys and CPPLs respective auditors or audit
committees since, with respect to the Company, the Distribution Date through
the date hereof and, with respect to CPPL, February 11, 2015 through the date
hereof. Since (x) with respect to the Company, the Distribution Date and (y)
with respect to CPPL, February 11, 2015, no attorney representing the Company
or CPPL, whether or not employed by the Company or CPPL, has reported evidence
of a violation of securities Laws or breach of fiduciary duty relating
to periods after such dates. Each of the principal executive officer of the
Company and CPPL and the principal financial officer of the Company and CPPL
(or each former principal executive officer of the Company and CPPL and each
former principal financial officer of the Company and CPPL), as applicable,
has made all certifications required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-
Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder with respect to
the SEC Reports and the statements contained in such certifications are true
and accurate in all material respects as of the date hereof. There are no
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as defined by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act) in the design or operation of the Companys and CPPLs
internal control and procedures which would reasonably be expected to
adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial data.

 

(iv) Since the Distribution Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries and, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any of their respective Representatives have not
received or otherwise obtained knowledge of any material complaint,
allegation, assertion or claim, whether written or oral, regarding the
accounting or auditing practices, procedures, methodologies or methods of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective internal accounting
controls relating to periods after the Distribution Date, including any

 



-15-  material complaint, allegation, assertion or claim that the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries has engaged in questionable accounting or auditing
practices (except for any of the foregoing after the date hereof which have
no reasonable basis).

(v) There are no liabilities or obligations of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries of a nature that would be required under GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated financial statement of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, other than (A) liabilities or obligations reflected or reserved
against in the Companys or CPPLs audited consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015 (or the notes thereto) included in the Companys Annual
Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 18, 2016 or CPPLs Annual

2015, (C) liabilities or obligations incurred under or in accordance with this
Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and (D)

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

 

(f) _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Since December 31, 2015 through
the date of this Agreement, (i) there have not been any changes, effects,
events, occurrences or developments (changes, effects, events, occurrences and
developments being individually and collectively referred to as a " _Change_ "
or " _Changes_ ") that have had or would reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect or would
reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impair the ability of
the Company to consummate the Merger or comply with its obligations under
this Agreement, (ii) except as contemplated or required by this Agreement, the
Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted their respective businesses in all
material respects in the ordinary course of business and (iii) neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries have taken, or committed or agreed to
take, any actions that would have been prohibited pursuant to clauses (i),
(v), (vi), (ix), (xii), (xiii), (xvi), (xix) and (xxi) of _Section 4.01(a)_ if
such covenants had been in effect as of December 31, 2015. Since March 15,
2016 through the date of this Agreement, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries have taken, or committed or agreed to take, any actions that

_Section 4.01(a)_ if such covenants had been in effect as of March 15, 2016.

(g) _Litigation_. Except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect and would
not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or impair the ability
of the Company to consummate the Merger or comply with its obligations under
this Agreement, as of the date hereof (i) there is no suit, action, claim,
arbitration, mediation or legal, arbitral, administrative or other proceeding
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened against, or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, any pending or threatened material governmental or
regulatory investigation of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and (ii)
there is no injunction, order, judgment, ruling, decree or writ of any
Governmental Entity outstanding or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened to be imposed, against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

reservations and encumbrances contained, in any SEC Report, except for such
Rights-of-Way the absence of which has not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

Subsidiaries with an exercise or conversion privilege or a settlement payment
or mechanism at a price related to the value of the Shares or a value

than the termination of the Equity Bridge Commitment Letter from and after the
Equity Financing Closing Date, no amendment, modification or supplement is
contemplated to be made to any of the Debt Commitment Letters and none of the
obligations and commitments contained in the Debt Commitment Letters have been
withdrawn, terminated or rescinded in any respect. Except for the fee letters
(complete copies of which have been provided to the Company, but redacted as
to rates, fee amounts, monetary thresholds or other economic terms (but not as
to any conditions precedent) and excluding (x) the engagement
letter delivered in connection with the Debt Financing (which engagement
letter does not contain any conditions precedent to the funding of the Debt
Financing or other terms that would affect the availability or amount of the
Debt Financing) and (y) those fee letters that only include administrative
agents fees and other fees with respect to the Debt Financing, as of the date
of this Agreement, there are no Contracts or other agreements, arrangements,
side letters or understandings (whether oral or written) or commitments to
enter into agreements, arrangements, side letters or understandings (whether

Letters delivered to the Company on or prior to the date hereof. Ultimate
Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates

the Debt Commitment Letters that are payable on or prior to the date of this
Agreement. Assuming that the representations and warranties of the Company set

de minimis inaccuracies), the proceeds contemplated by the Debt Commitment
Letters, together with other financial resources of Parent and US Parent,
including cash on hand and, if applicable in substitution for the Equity
Bridge Commitment Letter, the net proceeds of the Equity Financing, will in
the aggregate be sufficient for US Parent and the Surviving Corporation to pay
the aggregate Per Share Merger Consideration to holders of Shares pursuant to
_Article II_ , any repayment or refinancing of indebtedness of the Company
required in connection with the Merger or otherwise contemplated by this
Agreement or the Debt Commitment Letters, all amounts payable to holders of

Letters are (i) the legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and, to the
Knowledge of Parent, each of the

 



-33-  other parties thereto, (ii) enforceable in accordance with their terms
against Parent and, to the Knowledge of Parent, each of the other parties
thereto and (iii) in full force and effect. As of the date of this Agreement,
(A) no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or
both, would or would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach
under any Debt Commitment Letter on the part of Parent or, to the Knowledge
of Parent, any other Person, or result in the failure of any condition
precedent under any Debt Commitment Letter to be satisfied, and (B) none of
Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub has any reason to
believe that any of the conditions to the Debt Financing will not be
satisfied or that, other than the termination of the Equity Bridge Commitment
Letter from and after the Equity Financing Closing Date, the Debt Financing
will not be made available to Ultimate Parent, Parent and US Parent on the
Closing Date. There are no conditions precedent or other contingencies related
to the funding of the full amount of the Debt Financing, other than as
expressly set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters. 

(h) _Access to Information_. Each of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent and
Merger Sub acknowledges that it has conducted its own independent

Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub and their Subsidiaries are and have been in
compliance with and are not and have not been in default under or in violation
of any applicable Law, except, in each case, where such noncompliance, default
or violation would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay
or impair the ability of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement. Since January 1, 2013, none of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent,
Merger Sub or their Subsidiaries has received any written notice from any
Governmental Entity regarding any violation of, or failure to comply with, any
Law, except as would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay
or impair the ability of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement. Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub and their
Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits, except as would not reasonably
be expected to prevent, materially

 



-34-  delay or impair the ability of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger
Sub to consummate the Merger or comply with their respective obligations under
this Agreement. All Permits are valid and in full force and effect and are
not subject to any administrative or judicial proceeding that would reasonably
be expected to result in modification, termination or revocation thereof,
except where the failure to be in full force and effect or any modification,
termination or revocation thereof would not reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or impair the ability of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent
or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger or comply with their
respective obligations under this Agreement. Since January 1, 2013, Ultimate
Parent, Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub are and have been in compliance with
the terms and requirements of such Permits, except where the failure to be in
compliance would not reasonably be expected to prevent, materially delay or
impair the ability of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub to
consummate the Merger or comply with their respective obligations under this
Agreement.

 

(k) _No Other Representations or Warranties_. Except for the representations
and warranties contained in this _Section 3.02_ , the Company acknowledges

Person on behalf of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub makes any
other express or implied representation or warranty with respect to

SECTION 4.02. _Acquisition Proposals_.

 

(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company agrees that, except as
permitted by this _Section 4.02_ , neither it nor any of its Subsidiaries nor
any of the officers and directors of it or its Subsidiaries shall, and it
shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and its
Subsidiaries employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other advisors or representatives (such officers, directors, employees,
investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly:

 

(i) initiate, solicit or encourage any, or the making of any, inquiry,
indication of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal;

(ii) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or provide any information or data to any Person

constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition
Proposal; or

inquiry, indication of interest, proposal or offer that constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal.

Notwithstanding anything in the foregoing to the contrary, prior to the time
the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, the Company may, subject to the
Company providing prior notice to Parent, (A) provide information in response
to a request therefor by a Person who has made a bona fide written
Acquisition Proposal that did not result from a breach of this _Section_ _ _
_4.02_ if the Company receives from the Person requesting such information an
executed confidentiality agreement on terms not less restrictive to the other
party than those contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (it being
understood that such confidentiality agreement need not

 



-40-  prohibit the making, or amendment, of an Acquisition Proposal but which
shall not prohibit the Company from fulfilling its obligations under this
_Section 4.02_ ); _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall promptly
after the execution thereof provide a true and complete copy to Parent of any
such confidentiality agreement and any such information to the extent not
previously provided to Parent, in each case, redacted, if necessary, to
remove the identity of the Person making the proposal or offer; or (B) engage
or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person who has made
such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only to
the extent that, (x) prior to taking any action described in clause (A) or (B)
above, the board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after
consultation with its outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be expected to result in a breach of the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law and (y) in each such case referred to in
clause (A) or (B) above, the board of directors of the Company has determined
in good faith based on the information then available and after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and its financial advisor that such Acquisition
Proposal either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be
expected to result in a Superior Proposal. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the restrictions set
forth in the first sentence of this _Section 4.02(a)_ by any director,
officer, investment banker or attorney of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries shall be deemed to be a breach of this _Section 4.02(a)_ by the
Company.

(b)  _Definitions_. For purposes of this Agreement, the following terms shall
have the meanings assigned below:

(i) " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any proposal or offer (whether or not in
writing) from, or public announcement by, any Person or group of Persons
(other than Parent, Merger Sub or their respective Affiliates) relating to
any transaction or series of transactions involving (A) any direct or
indirect sale, lease, transfer, exchange, acquisition or purchase of any
assets or one or more businesses that constitute more than fifteen percent
(15%) of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or more than fifteen percent (15%) of the
total voting power of any class of equity securities of the Company, (B) any
direct or indirect sale, exchange, transfer or other disposition, tender
offer or exchange offer or other similar transaction that, if consummated,
would result in any Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act) of
Persons directly or indirectly acquiring beneficial or record ownership of
more than fifteen percent (15%) of the total voting power of any class of
equity securities of the Company, or (C) any merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, joint venture, partnership, dissolution or similar transaction
involving the Company (or any Subsidiary or Subsidiaries of the Company whose
business constitutes more than fifteen percent (15%) of the net revenues, net
income or consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole).

(ii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this _Section 4.02_ relating to any
acquisition or purchase by a Person or group of Persons of (A) assets that
generate more than fifty percent (50%) of the consolidated total revenues of
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (B) assets that constitute
more than fifty percent (50%) of the consolidated total assets of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (C) more than fifty percent (50%)
of the total voting power of the equity securities of the Company, in each
case, that the board of directors of the

 



-41-  Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) is reasonably likely to be consummated in
accordance with its terms, taking into account (x) the timing and likelihood
of consummation of the proposal (including whether such Acquisition Proposal
is contingent on receipt of third party financing or is terminable by the
acquiring Person or group upon payment of a termination fee), (y) all legal,
financial and regulatory aspects of the Acquisition Proposal and (z) the
Person or group making the Acquisition Proposal (including in respect of the
potential effects of any actions that might be required by any Government
Antitrust Entity in connection with the consummation of such transaction),
and if consummated, would result in a transaction more favorable to the
Companys stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger.

 

(c) _No Change in Recommendation or Alternative Acquisition Agreement_. Except
as set forth in _Section 4.02(d)_ , the board of directors of the Company and
each committee of the board of directors shall not, and shall not agree or

recommend or declare advisable (publicly or otherwise) any Acquisition
Proposal or any action or public announcement inconsistent with the Company
Board Recommendation;

 

(ii) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly propose or resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent, the
Company Board Recommendation (it being understood that, except as specified in
the last sentence of _Section 4.02(e)_ , taking a neutral position or no
position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall be considered an
adverse modification);

(iii) following the date of any Acquisition Proposal or any material
modification thereto is first made public or is sent or given to the
stockholders of the Company, fail to issue a press release that expressly
reaffirms the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days
following Parents request that the Company do so (any action set forth in
the foregoing _Section 4.02(c)(i)_ , _Section 4.02(c)(ii)_ or this _Section
4.02(c)(iii)_ , a " _Change of Recommendation_ ");

 

(iv) cause or permit the Company to enter into any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, acquisition agreement,
merger agreement or other agreement (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section 4.02(a)_ entered into in compliance with _Section
4.02(a)_ ) (an " _Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") relating to any
Acquisition Proposal or requiring the Company to abandon, terminate, delay or
fail to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby; or

 

(v) take any action pursuant to which any Person (other than Ultimate Parent,
Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Affiliates) or
Acquisition Proposal would become exempt from or not otherwise subject to any
Takeover Statute or provision in the Company Certificate of Incorporation or
any comparable organizational document of a Subsidiary of the Company
relating to Acquisition Proposals.

 



-42- (d) _Exceptions_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in

and so long as the Company is in compliance with _Section 4.02(a)_ :

 

(i) the board of directors of the Company may (A) effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal that is not otherwise
withdrawn at the time of the Change of Recommendation or (B) cause the Company
to terminate this Agreement for the purpose of entering into a definitive
agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal that is not otherwise withdrawn
at the time of such termination ( _provided_ that the Company shall have paid
the Termination Payment prior to or concurrently with such termination), which
definitive agreement the Company shall enter into concurrently with or
immediately following such termination, in either case, if and only if the
board of directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation
with its financial advisor and outside legal counsel) that the failure to take
any such action would be inconsistent with the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the board of directors of
the Company may not take any such action unless (1) the Company first provides
written notice to Parent (a " _Superior Proposal Notice_ ") advising Parent
that the board of directors of the Company intends to either effect a Change
of Recommendation or terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.01(c)(i)_
, which notice shall specify the reasons therefor and include the material
terms and conditions of the applicable Superior Proposal and attach a copy of
the most current draft of any written agreement relating thereto, (2) during
the four (4) Business Day period following receipt by Parent of the Superior
Proposal Notice (the " _Superior Proposal Negotiation Period_ ") (it being
understood that the first Business Day following the day on which a Superior
Proposal Notice is received shall be the first day of the Superior Proposal
Negotiation Period), the Company negotiates in good faith with Parent and its
Representatives, to the extent requested by Parent, with respect to any
revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that if during any
Superior Proposal Negotiation Period there shall occur any subsequent
amendment to any material term of the applicable Superior Proposal, the
Company shall provide a new Superior Proposal Notice and a new Superior
Proposal Negotiation Period shall commence ( _provided_ that, with respect to
any Superior Proposal, each new Superior Proposal Negotiation Period that
commences shall be for a period of four (4) days, except that in no event
shall any new Superior Proposal Negotiation Period shorten the four (4)
Business Day duration of the first Superior Proposal Negotiation Period) and
(3) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on the last day of
the Superior Proposal Negotiation Period, the board of directors of the
Company (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) determines that the Superior Proposal would continue to be a Superior
Proposal, taking into account any changes to the terms of this Agreement
theretofore agreed to by Parent in writing; or

(ii) the board of directors of the Company may effect a Change of
Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event (an " _Intervening Event
Recommendation Change_ "), if and only if the board of directors of the
Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) that, in light of such Intervening Event,
the failure of the board of directors of the Company to effect such an
Intervening Event Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with
the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_
, that the board of

 



-43-  directors of the Company may not make such an Intervening Event
Recommendation Change unless (A) the Company first provides written notice to
Parent advising Parent that the board of directors of the Company intends to
effect an Intervening Event Recommendation Change, which notice shall specify
the reasons therefor, (B) during the four (4) Business Day period following
receipt by Parent of such notice (the " _Intervening Event Negotiation
Period_ ") (it being understood that the first Business Day following the day
on which such notice is received shall be the first day of the Intervening
Event Negotiation Period), the Company negotiates in good faith with
Parent and its Representatives, to the extent requested by Parent, with
respect to any revisions to the terms of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement proposed by Parent and (C) at or after 5:00 p.m., New York City
time, on the last Business Day of the Intervening Event Negotiation Period,
the board of directors of the Company (after consultation with its financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) determines that the failure to effect an
Intervening Event Recommendation Change would be inconsistent with the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law, taking into account any
changes to the terms of this Agreement theretofore agreed to by Parent in
writing. " _Intervening Event_ " means an event, fact, occurrence,
development or circumstance that was not known to the board of directors of
the Company as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences of
which were not known to the board of directors of the Company as of the date
of this Agreement); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the
receipt, existence or terms of an Acquisition Proposal or any matter relating
thereto or consequences thereof constitute an Intervening Event.

 

(e) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this _Section 4.02_
or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries from (i) complying with its disclosure obligations under U.S.
federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition Proposal or Change of
Recommendation or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the
board of directors of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries determines in
good faith (after consultation with and receiving advice of its outside legal
counsel) that the failure to do so would reasonably be expected to result in a
breach of the directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (A) solely in the case of clause (ii) above, if such
disclosure would be a breach of _Section 4.02(c)_ but for the provisions of
this _Section 4.02(e)_ , such disclosure shall be deemed to be a breach of
_Section 4.02(c)_ and (B) if such disclosure constitutes the taking of any of
the actions set forth in _Section 4.02(c)(i)_ or _Section 4.02(c)(ii)_ , such
disclosure shall be deemed to be a Change of Recommendation and Parent shall
have the right to terminate this Agreement as set forth in _Section
7.01(d)(i)_. For the avoidance of doubt, the issuance by the Company or the
board of directors of the Company of a "stop, look and listen" communication
as contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any
similar communication to its stockholders) in which the Company indicates that
the board of directors of the Company has not changed the Company Board
Recommendation shall not constitute a Change of Recommendation.

(f) _Existing Discussions_. The Company agrees that it will immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any parties conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Company agrees that it will take the
necessary steps to promptly inform the Persons referred to in the first
sentence of this _Section 4.02(f)_ of the obligations undertaken in this
_Section 4.02_ and in the Confidentiality Agreement. The Company also agrees
that it will promptly request of each Person that has

 



-44-  heretofore executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of acquiring the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to return or
destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person by
or on behalf of it or any of its Subsidiaries.

(g) _Notice_. The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event,
within twenty-four (24) hours) notify Parent if any inquiries, proposals or
offers with respect to an Acquisition Proposal are received by, any
information relating to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or otherwise
in connection therewith is requested from, or any discussions or negotiation
are sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company or any of its
Representatives indicating, in connection with such notice, except as provided
in  _Section 4.02(a)_ , the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements). The
Company shall (i) keep Parent informed, on a reasonably prompt basis, of the
status and terms of any such inquiries, indications of interest, proposals or
offers (including any changes to the terms and conditions thereto) and the
status of any such discussions or negotiations, including any change in the
Companys intentions as previously notified and (ii) provide to Parent as soon
as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within twenty-four (24) hours of
receipt or delivery thereof) true and complete copies of all written material
(including draft agreements) specifying the material terms and conditions of
such Acquisition Proposal exchanged between the Company, its Subsidiaries or
its Representatives, on the one hand, and the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal, on the other hand.

(h) _Takeover Statute_. No Change of Recommendation shall change or
otherwise affect the approval of the board of directors of the Company for
purposes of causing any Takeover Statute to be inapplicable to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby.

 

ARTICLE V

SECTION 5.01. _Proxy Statement; Stockholders Meeting_.

 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement (but, in any
event, no later than thirty (30) days after the date of this Agreement), the
Company shall prepare and file with the SEC a proxy statement in preliminary
form relating to the Stockholders Meeting (such proxy statement, including any
amendment or supplement thereto, the " _Proxy Statement_ "). Subject to
_Section 4.02_ , the Proxy Statement will include the Company Board
Recommendation. The Company agrees, as to itself and its Subsidiaries, that
the Proxy Statement will comply in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. As
promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, Parent, US Parent

Affiliates that is required to be included in the Proxy Statement. The
Company, Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub agree that none of the information
supplied by each of them or any of their respective Subsidiaries (as
applicable) for inclusion or incorporation by reference in the Proxy
Statement will, at the date of mailing to stockholders of the Company or at
the time of the Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

 



-45- (b) If, at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information
relating to the Company, Parent, US Parent or any of their respective
Affiliates, officers or directors is discovered by the Company or Parent which
should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement so
that the Proxy Statement or the other filings shall not contain an untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 5.01(b)_ , prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement or
making the other filings (or, in each case, any amendment or supplement
thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with respect thereto, the
Company shall (i) provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to review and
comment on such document or response and shall consider such comments in good
faith in accordance with _Section 5.02(a)_  and (ii) promptly provide Parent
with a copy of all such filings and responses made with the SEC. The Company
will use its reasonable best efforts to have the Proxy Statement cleared by
the SEC as promptly as reasonably practicable.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly notify Parent of the receipt of all comments of
the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and of any request by the SEC for
any amendment or supplement thereto or for additional information and shall
promptly provide to Parent copies of all correspondence between the Company
and/or any of its Representatives and the SEC with respect to the Proxy
Statement. The Company and Parent shall each use its reasonable best efforts
to promptly provide responses to the SEC with respect to all comments received
on the Proxy Statement by the SEC and the Company shall cause the definitive
Proxy Statement to be mailed as promptly as possible after the date the SEC
staff advises that it has no further comments thereon or that the Company may
commence mailing the Proxy Statement.

 

(d) The Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law, the Company
Certificate of Incorporation and the Company Bylaws, all action necessary to
establish a record date for, duly call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of the holders of Shares (the " _Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly
as reasonably practicable after the execution of this Agreement, for the
purpose of obtaining the Company Requisite Vote, regardless of whether the
board of directors of the Company determines at any time that this Agreement
is no longer advisable, recommends that the stockholders of the Company reject
this Agreement or any other Change of Recommendation has occurred; _provided_
, _however_ , that the Company, acting in good faith after consulting with its
outside legal counsel, may postpone or adjourn the Stockholders Meeting (i)
with the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), (ii) to ensure that any required supplement or amendment to the
Proxy Statement is provided to the stockholders of the Company within a
reasonable amount of time in advance of the Stockholders Meeting consistent
with SEC guidance and applicable Law, (iii) if the Company reasonably believes
that (A) it is necessary and advisable to do so in order to solicit additional
proxies in order to obtain the Company Requisite Vote, whether or not a
quorum is present or (B) it will not have sufficient Shares represented
(either in person or by proxy) to constitute a

 



-46-  quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Stockholders Meeting (but in
the case of clause (B), the date of the Stockholders Meeting is not to be
postponed or adjourned more than an aggregate of fifteen (15) calendar days)
or (iv) as may be required by applicable Law. Subject to _Section 4.02_ , the
board of directors of the Company shall recommend the adoption of this
Agreement and the approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to solicit from the stockholders of
the Company proxies in favor of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions,
and do or cause to be done all things, reasonably necessary, proper
or advisable on their part under this Agreement and applicable Law to

filing made with, or written materials submitted to, any third party and/or
any Governmental Entity, including any Government Antitrust Entity and the
FCC, in connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including the Proxy Statement and any information provided to
any Government Antitrust Entity). Such cooperation shall include, to the
extent permitted by Law, providing copies of all such documents or filings
prior to filing and considering all reasonable additions, deletions and
changes suggested in connection therewith. In exercising the foregoing
rights, each of the Company and Ultimate Parent shall act reasonably and as

Entity, the opportunity to attend and/or participate. Subject to applicable
Law, the parties hereto will consult and cooperate with one another in
connection with any analyses, appearances, presentations, memoranda, briefs,
arguments, opinions and proposals made or submitted by or on behalf of any
party hereto related to proceedings under the HSR Act and other
antitrust Laws; _provided_ , _however_ , that Ultimate Parent, after prior,
good faith consultation with the Company, and after considering in good faith
the Companys views and comments, shall have the principal responsibility for
devising and implementing the strategy for satisfying the condition set forth

Unless Ultimate Parent

 



-47-  provides prior written consent (which consent may be withheld in Ultimate
Parents sole discretion), the Company will not, and will cause its
Subsidiaries not to, offer, accept, agree to or commit to agree to terms,
conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments, sanctions or restrictions
or to take any action imposed upon or otherwise affecting, directly or
indirectly, Ultimate Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, in connection with the consents, registrations,
approvals, permits and authorizations necessary to be obtained from any
Government Antitrust Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any
Governmental Entity in connection with obtaining the CFIUS Clearance.

(b) _Information_. The Company and Ultimate Parent each shall, upon request by
the other, furnish the other with all information concerning itself and its
Subsidiaries, directors, officers and stockholders, and such other matters as

other communications received by Ultimate Parent or the Company, as the
case may be, or any of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Neither the Company nor Ultimate Parent shall
permit any of its officers or any other representatives or agents to
participate in any meeting with any Governmental Entity in respect of any
filings, investigation or other inquiry relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby unless it consults with the other party in advance and,
to the extent permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the
opportunity to attend and participate thereat.

 

(d) _Antitrust Matters_. Subject to _Section 5.02(f)_ and the other terms and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, without limiting the generality of
the undertakings pursuant to this _Section 5.02_ , each of the Company (in the
case of _Section 5.02(d)(i)_ ) and Ultimate Parent (in all cases set forth

(i) (A) make all filings required under the HSR Act with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable after the date of

filings or such transactions and (C) cooperate with each other in
connection with any such filing as described in _Section 5.02(a)_ ;

(ii) all actions necessary to avoid the entry of any permanent, preliminary
or temporary injunction or other order, decree, decision, determination or

consummation of the transactions 

 



-48-  contemplated by this Agreement, including the agreement by Ultimate Parent
of its willingness to sell, lease, license or otherwise dispose of, or hold
separate pending such disposition, and promptly to effect the sale, lease,
license, disposal and holding separate of, such assets, rights, product lines,
licenses, categories of assets or businesses or other operations, or interests
therein, of the Company or Ultimate Parent or their respective Subsidiaries
(and the entry into agreements with, and submission to orders of, the relevant
Government Antitrust Entity giving effect thereto) if, after a reasonable
period of time to permit Ultimate Parent to consult with and engage
in discussions with the relevant Government Antitrust Entity and to permit
the relevant Government Antitrust Entity to consider the matters so consulted
upon and discussed, such action should be reasonably necessary or advisable to
avoid, prevent, eliminate or remove the actual, anticipated or threatened (x)
commencement of any suit, action or proceeding in any forum or (y) issuance of
any order, decree, decision, determination or judgment that would delay,
restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger by
any Government Antitrust Entity; and

(iii) in the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction,
decision, order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or
becomes reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or
inquiry of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger, all actions
(including the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of the
steps contemplated by _Section 5.02(d)(ii)_ ) necessary to resist, vacate,
modify, reverse, suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual,
anticipated or threatened injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination
or decree so as to permit such consummation as promptly as practicable.

(e) _CFIUS_. Subject to _Section 5.02(f)_ , in connection with and
without limiting the generality of _Section_ _ _ _5.02(a)_ , each of Ultimate
Parent and the Company shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to,
use their reasonable best efforts to obtain the CFIUS Clearance. Such
reasonable best efforts shall include, promptly after the date hereof, making
or causing to be made any draft and final CFIUS Notices required in accordance
with 31 C.F.R. Part 800 and the other requirements of the DPA, which draft
CFIUS Notice shall in any event be made within ten (10) calendar days hereof,
unless the parties hereto agree in writing otherwise, and after prompt
resolution of all questions and comments received from CFIUS on such draft,
shall prepare and submit the final CFIUS Notice, which shall in any event be
made within five (5) calendar days of the date of submission of the draft
CFIUS Notice or receipt of comments from CFIUS, whichever occurs first, unless
the parties agree in writing otherwise. Such reasonable best efforts shall
also include providing any information requested by CFIUS or any other agency
or branch of the U.S. government in connection with the CFIUS review or
investigation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, within the
time periods specified by 31 C.F.R. §800.403(a)(3), or otherwise provided by
CFIUS, without the need to request an extension of time. Each of Ultimate
Parent and the Company shall, in connection with the efforts to obtain the
CFIUS Clearance, (i) cooperate in all respects and consult with each other in
connection with the CFIUS Notice, including by allowing the other party to
have a reasonable opportunity to review in advance and comment on drafts of
filings and submissions; (ii) promptly inform the other party of any
communication received by such party from, or given by

 



-49-  such party to, CFIUS, by promptly providing copies to the other party of any
such written communications, except for any exhibits to such communications
providing the personal identifying information required by 31 C.F.R.
§800.402(c)(6)(vi); and (iii) permit the other party to review in advance any
communication that it gives to, and consult with each other in advance of any
meeting, substantive telephone call or conference with CFIUS, and to the
extent not prohibited by CFIUS, give the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate in any in-person meetings with CFIUS, in each of clauses (i),
(ii) and (iii) of this _Section 5.02(e)_ , subject to
confidentiality considerations contemplated by the DPA or required by CFIUS.
Notwithstanding any disclosure set forth in Section 4.01(c) or Section 5.02(e)
of the Parent Disclosure Letter, but subject to _Section 5.02(f)_ , with
respect to Ultimate Parent and its Subsidiaries, such reasonable efforts
shall also include agreeing to any action, condition or restriction required
by CFIUS in connection with the CFIUS Clearance (including entering into any
mitigation agreement with CFIUS as may be required) in order to receive the
CFIUS Clearance as promptly as reasonably practicable and in any event prior
to the sixth (6th) Business Day prior to September 17, 2016, unless Parent, US
Parent and Merger Sub have irrevocably waived the condition set forth in
_Section 6.02(d)_ prior to such date (and, in the case of such waiver, none of
Ultimate Parent or its Affiliates shall have any further obligations under
this Section 5.02(e)). Except as set forth in Section 5.02(e) of the Parent
Disclosure Letter and subject to this _Section 5.02(e)_ , neither Ultimate
Parent nor the Company shall take or permit any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates to take any action that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
materially delay or materially impede the receipt of the CFIUS Clearance.
Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the covenants and agreements set forth in _Section 5.02(a)_ , this
_Section 5.02(e)_ and _Section 5.02(f)_ constitute the sole obligations of the
parties with respect to the efforts required to obtain the CFIUS Clearance.

 

(f) _Efforts_. Nothing contained in this _Section 5.02_ shall be deemed to
require (and reasonable best efforts will in no event require) Ultimate
Parent or its Subsidiaries to offer, accept, agree to or commit to agree to
any terms, conditions, liabilities, obligations, commitments, sanctions or
restrictions or to take any action imposed upon or otherwise affecting,
directly or indirectly, Ultimate Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries, in connection with obtaining the permits, consents,
approvals, clearances and authorizations of any Governmental Entities, that
would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, net of any
benefits arising out of or related to the taking of such action or the making
of such agreement, have a material adverse effect on (i) the business,
condition (financial or otherwise), assets, properties, liabilities,
operations or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken
as a whole, or (ii) the business, condition (financial or otherwise), assets,
properties, liabilities, operations or results of operations of Ultimate
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (except that, solely for
purposes of this _Section 5.02(f)(ii)_ , Ultimate Parent and its Subsidiaries,
taken as a whole, shall be deemed to be the same size as the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole); _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes
of this _Section 5.02(f)_ , any Laws of general applicability to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries are subject and to which Ultimate Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries become subject as a condition to, or by reason of,
the consummation of the Merger shall not be taken into account in determining
whether there has been a material adverse effect on the business, condition
(financial or otherwise), assets, properties, liabilities, operations or
results of operations of Ultimate Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole.

 



-50- (g) _Notification_. Parent and the Company shall give prompt notice to the
other party of (i) any representation or warranty made by the Company or
Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub becoming untrue or incorrect such that the
condition set forth in _Section 6.02(a)_ or _Section 6.03(a)_ , as the case
may be, could not be satisfied or (ii) the failure of the Company or Parent,
US Parent or Merger Sub to perform any obligation to be performed by such
party under this Agreement such that the condition set forth in _Section
6.02(b)_ or _Section 6.03(b)_ , as the case may be, could not be satisfied;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such notification or failure to provide such
notification shall affect the representations, warranties, covenants,
agreements or obligations of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto)
or the conditions to the obligations of the parties under this Agreement.

SECTION 5.03. _Access and Reports; Confidentiality_.

(a) Subject to applicable Law, upon reasonable notice, the Company shall (and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to) afford Parents officers and Representatives
reasonable access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to
the Effective Time, to the Companys and its Subsidiaries officers,
employees, properties, books, Contracts and records and, during such period,
the Company shall (and shall cause its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to
Parent all information concerning its business, properties and personnel as
may reasonably be requested; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that no investigation
pursuant to this _Section 5.03(a)_ shall affect or be deemed to modify any
representation or warranty made by the Company herein, and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that the foregoing shall not require the Company to (i) permit
any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable
judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of
third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable best efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii)
disclose any privileged information of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
or (iii) permit any invasive environmental testing or sampling at any
property. All requests for information made pursuant to this _Section 5.03(a)_
shall be directed to the executive officer or other Person designated by the
Company.

 

(b) The Company shall provide to Parent (i) a copy of the completed actuarial
report that is available for the most recently completed fiscal year for each
pension plan subject to Title IV of ERISA; and (ii) a copy of each Internal
Revenue Service determination or opinion letter application submitted for any
plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(k) of the Code, in each case
as soon as practicable (but no later than fifteen (15) Business Days) after
such items become available to the Company.

(c) Each of Parent, US Parent and Merger Sub will comply with the terms and
conditions of that certain letter agreement, dated as of November 9, 2015,
between Parent and the Company (including Addendum No. 1 thereto, dated
January 28, 2016, and as the same may be amended from time to time, the "
_Confidentiality Agreement_ "), and will hold and treat, and will cause their
respective Representatives to hold and treat, in confidence all documents and
information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries furnished to Parent,
US Parent or Merger Sub in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including pursuant to _Section 5.03(a)_ ) in accordance with
the Confidentiality Agreement, which Confidentiality Agreement shall remain
in full force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 



-51- SECTION 5.04. _Stock Exchange Delisting_. Prior to the Closing Date, the
Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable Law and
rules and policies of the NYSE to enable the delisting by the Surviving
Corporation of the Shares from the NYSE and the deregistration of the Shares
under the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time,
and in any event no more than ten (10) days after the Closing Date.

SECTION 5.05. _Publicity_. The initial news releases regarding the Merger
shall each be reasonably agreed upon by the Company and Parent and thereafter
the Company and Parent each shall (a) consult with each other prior to issuing
any news releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and prior to
making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental Entity
(including any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service)
with respect thereto, (b) provide to each other for review a copy of any
such news release or public announcement and (c) not issue any such news
release or public statement prior to providing the other party with a
reasonable period of time and a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
on such news release or public statement, except, in each case, as may be
required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or
rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation service or
by the request of any Governmental Entity. Prior to making any material,
broad-based written communications to the employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries that primarily relate to the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Company shall use its reasonable
best efforts to provide Parent with a copy of the intended communication
(other than communications that are substantially similar to communications
previously provided to Parent pursuant to this _Section 5.05_ ) and provide
Parent with a reasonable period of time to review and comment on such
communication.

SECTION 5.06. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Following the Effective Time and until December 31, 2017 (the "
_Continuation Period_ "), US Parent shall provide or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to provide the individuals who are employed by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately before the Effective Time,
other than any individual covered by a collective bargaining agreement (the "
_Company Employees_ ") and who continue employment during such time period
with (i) annual base compensation no less than the annual base compensation
provided to such Company Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time;
(ii) annual target cash incentive amounts that are no less than the annual
target cash incentive amounts provided to such Company Employees immediately
prior to the Effective Time; and (iii) severance benefits that are no less
favorable than the severance benefits provided to such Company Employees
immediately prior to the Effective Time. US Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to, maintain during the Continuation Period, without any
amendment or modification thereto that would affect Company Employees who are
eligible for such Company Benefit Plans immediately prior to the Effective
Time, a level of benefits for such Company Employees that are no less
favorable in the aggregate than the level of benefits provided
immediately prior to the Effective Time solely as it relates to benefits
provided under the Company Benefit Plans set forth in Section 5.06(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that US Parent and the
Surviving Corporation may amend such Company Benefit Plans as required to
comply with applicable Law.

 



-52- (b) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.06(a)_ , from and after the
Effective Time, US Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to,
assume and honor each of the agreements as set forth in Section 5.06(b) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as in effect at the Effective Time with respect to
any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in combination with any other
event), without any amendment or modification, other than any amendment or
modification required to comply with applicable Law in accordance with the
terms of such Company Benefit Plans; _provided_ , _however_ , that following
the Effective Time, Parent, US Parent or Surviving Corporation may exercise
its discretion to provide written notice of termination of such agreements
pursuant to their terms as they relate to any subsequent change in control. In
addition, US Parent shall assume and honor all collective bargaining
agreements to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party as
required by the terms thereof.

(c) With respect to all plans maintained by Parent, US Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or their respective Subsidiaries in which the Company Employees
are eligible to participate after the Closing Date (including any vacation,
paid time-off and severance plans) for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits and vesting (but not for benefit accrual under
any defined benefit pension plan), each Company Employees service with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor
employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with
the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary)
shall be treated as service with Parent, US Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any of their respective Subsidiaries, in each case, to the extent such
service would have been recognized by the Company or its Subsidiaries under
analogous Company Benefit Plans prior to the Effective Time; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period
of service.

(d) Without limiting the generality of _Section 5.06(a)_ , US Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, use all commercially reasonable
efforts to waive any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-
at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit
plan maintained by Parent, US Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries in which Company Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Effective Time,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations,
exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have
been satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Benefit Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time. US Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, use all commercially reasonable efforts to recognize the
dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred by
each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs for purposes of satisfying
such years deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which they will be eligible to participate from and after
the Effective Time.

(e) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall adopt an amendment to the 401(k)
Savings Plan contingent upon and effective as of the Closing, to terminate
the Company stock

 



-53-  fund and remove Company stock as an investment alternative under the 401(k)
Savings Plan and to make such amendments as are necessary to accomplish the
foregoing. The Company shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity to
review and comment on any amendment to be made pursuant to this _Section
5.06(e)_ and, subject to plan fiduciary obligations, shall not adopt any
amendment without the prior consent of Parent (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

(f) The provisions of this _Section 5.06_ are solely for the benefit of the
parties to this Agreement, and no other Person (including any Company
Employee or any beneficiary or dependent thereof) shall be regarded for any
purpose as a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 5.06_ , and no provision
of this _Section 5.06_  shall create such rights in any such Persons. No
provision of this Agreement shall be construed (i) as a guarantee of continued
employment of any Company Employee, (ii) to prohibit Parent, US Parent or the
Surviving Corporation from having the right to terminate the employment of
any Company Employee, (iii) to prevent the amendment, modification or
termination of any Company Benefit Plan after the Closing (in each case in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Benefit Plan) or (iv) as
an amendment or modification of the terms of any Company Benefit Plan.

SECTION 5.07. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such
expenses.

SECTION 5.08. _Indemnification, Directors_ __ _and Officers_ __
_ Insurance_.

(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Person to whom expenses are
advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately
determined that such Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present
and former director and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (in each
case, only in connection with the Indemnified Partys service as a director
or officer of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") from and against any costs or expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities incurred in connection with any claim, suit, action, proceeding or
investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative,
arising out of or pertaining to any action or omission occurring or alleged to
have occurred at or prior to the Effective Time, including the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under _Section
5.08(a)_ , upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but the failure to so
notify shall not relieve Parent or the Surviving Corporation of any liability
it may have to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure
materially prejudices the indemnifying party. In the event of any such claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation (whether arising before or after the
Effective Time), (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall have the right
to assume the defense thereof and Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall
not be liable to such Indemnified Parties for any legal expenses of 

 



-54-  other counsel or any other expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnified Parties in connection with the defense thereof, except that if
Parent or the Surviving Corporation elects not to assume such defense or
counsel for the Indemnified Parties advises that there are issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Parent or the Surviving Corporation and the
Indemnified Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory
to them, and Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall pay all reasonable fees
and expenses of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties promptly as
statements therefor are received; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and
the Surviving Corporation shall be obligated pursuant to this _Section
5.08(b)_ to pay for only one (1) firm of counsel for all Indemnified Parties
in any jurisdiction unless the use of one counsel for such Indemnified Parties
would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, _provided_ that the
fewest number of counsels necessary to avoid conflicts of interest shall be
used, (ii) the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such
matter and (iii) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not be liable for
any settlement effected without their prior written consent; and _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not have any
obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party if and when a court of
competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such determination
shall have become final, that the indemnification of such Indemnified Party in
the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by applicable Law.

(c) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is
unable to, Parent shall cause US Parent to cause the Surviving Corporation
to, as of the Effective Time, obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance
policies with a claims period of at least six (6) years from and after the
Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the same or better credit
rating as the Companys current insurance carrier with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits and levels of coverage that
are not, in the aggregate, less favorable than the Companys existing policies
with respect to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby); _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
the Company or the Surviving Corporation expend or, in case of the Surviving
Corporation, be required to expend, for such "tail" insurance policies an
aggregate premium amount in excess of two hundred and fifty percent (250%) of

shall, and Parent shall cause US Parent to cause the Surviving Corporation to,
use reasonable best efforts to purchase comparable DandO Insurance for such six
(6) year period with benefits and levels of coverage that are not, in the
aggregate, less favorable than the coverage provided in the Companys existing
policies as of the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no
event shall Parent, US Parent or the Surviving Corporation be required to
expend for such policies an annual premium amount in excess of two hundred and
fifty percent (250%) of the annual premiums currently paid by the Company for
such insurance; and, _provided_ ,  _further_ , that if the annual premiums of
such insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation shall
obtain a policy with the greatest coverage available for a cost not exceeding
such amount.

respective successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge with or
into any other corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall
transfer all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person,
then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent, US Parent or the Surviving Corporation shall

case, to the extent required under applicable securities Laws to be included
in any prospectus or prospectus supplement for the Financing (which shall not
include in any event any separate financial statements of any of the
Companys Subsidiaries)); (iii) reasonable participation by appropriate
senior management of the Company in the negotiation of the documentation
evidencing the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ , that the effectiveness of

reasonable efforts to provide customary payoff letters and Lien releases
(subject, in each case, to receipt of funds from Parent sufficient to make any
such repayment); (vi) using its commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its independent auditors to cooperate with the Financing (including
participation in underwriter due diligence sessions and the preparation and

not and will not contain any misrepresentation (as defined in the _Securities
Act _ (Alberta)) or any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state
a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein, in light
of the circumstances under which such statements are made, not misleading. The
Company hereby consents to the use of all of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries logos in connection with the Financing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that such logos are used solely in a manner that is not intended or reasonably
likely to harm or disparage the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the
reputation or goodwill of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding any provision in this _Section 5.09(a)_ to the contrary,

financial reporting by the Company) incurred by the Company, its Subsidiaries
and their Representatives in connection with any cooperation provided for in
this _Section 5.09_ , and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and its
Subsidiaries and each of their respective

to the information provided by or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries

except for claims against the Financing Sources Related Parties by Parent
pursuant to any of the Debt Commitment Letters (and any definitive documents
related thereto), (i) none of the parties hereto nor any of their respective
subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders shall have any rights or claims against any
of the Financing Sources Related Parties, in any way relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or in
respect of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in
connection herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of
or relating in any way to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the
performance thereof or the financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or
equity, in contract, in tort or otherwise and (ii) none of the Financing
Sources Related Parties shall have any liability (whether in contract, in
tort or otherwise) to any party hereto or any of their respective
subsidiaries, Affiliates, directors, officers, employees, agents, partners,
managers, members or stockholders for any obligations or liabilities of any
party hereto under this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or
by reason of, the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby or in respect
of any oral representations made or alleged to have been made in connection
herewith or therewith, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any
way to any of the Debt Commitment Letters or the performance thereof or the
financings contemplated thereby, whether at law or equity, in contract, in
tort or otherwise.

(c) Parent, US Parent and Ultimate Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do,
or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange and
consummate the Debt Financing on the terms and conditions described in the
Debt Commitment Letters, including using their respective reasonable
best efforts to (i) maintain in effect the Debt Commitment Letters, (ii)
negotiate any definitive agreements with respect thereto on terms and
conditions contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letters, (iii) satisfy on a
timely basis all conditions to funding under the Debt Commitment Letters,
(iv) consummate the Debt Financing at or prior to the Closing on the terms and
conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letters and (v) enforce their
rights under the Debt Commitment Letters; _provided_ that (A) Parent and US
Parent shall not be required to consummate the Debt Financing to the extent
the commitments thereunder are reduced in accordance with the terms thereof by
the net cash proceeds from (x) asset sales or (y) the issuance of debt or
equity securities received and retained by Ultimate Parent and its
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing and (B) Parent may terminate the Equity
Bridge Commitment Letter from and after the Equity Financing Closing
Date. Ultimate Parent, Parent and US Parent shall use their respective
reasonable best efforts to refrain from taking, directly or indirectly, any
action that could reasonably be expected to result in a failure of any of the
conditions contained in the 

 



-58-  Debt Commitment Letters or in any definitive agreement related to the Debt
Financing. Parent shall keep the Company informed on a reasonably current
basis in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing.

(d) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable (other than, for
certainty, the termination of the financing contemplated by the Equity Bridge
Commitment Letter from and after the Equity Financing Closing Date) or
Ultimate Parent, Parent or US Parent becomes aware of any event or
circumstance that makes, or would reasonably be expected to make, any portion
of the Debt Financing unavailable on the terms and conditions contemplated in
the Debt Commitment Letters (other than, for certainty, the termination of the
financing contemplated by the Equity Bridge Commitment Letter from and after
the Equity Financing Closing Date), Parent shall promptly notify the Company,
and Ultimate Parent, Parent or US Parent shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from alternative
financial institutions on terms not materially less favorable to Ultimate
Parent, Parent, US Parent and their Subsidiaries than in the Debt Financing

Parents existing cash on hand and any proceeds from any equity or similar
offering (whether or not consummated), sufficient to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Ultimate Parent, Parent and US Parent
shall deliver to the Company true, correct and complete copies of all
agreements entered into in connection with the Alternative Financing promptly
following the execution thereof;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Ultimate
Parent, Parent and US Parent shall be permitted to redact rates, fee amounts,
monetary thresholds or other economic terms (but not any conditions
precedent), and exclude those fee letters which only include administrative
agents fees and other fees, from any fee letters required to be delivered
pursuant to this sentence.

(e) If any of the Debt Commitment Letters are amended, replaced, supplemented
or otherwise modified, including as a result of obtaining Alternative
Financing in accordance with _Section 5.09(d)_ , or if Ultimate Parent, Parent
or US Parent substitute other financing for all or a portion of the Debt
Financing, Ultimate Parent, Parent and US Parent shall comply with their
respective covenants in _Section 5.09(a)_ , _Section 5.09(c)_ , _Section
5.09(d)_ and this _Section 5.09(e)_  with respect to the Debt Commitment
Letters as so amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise modified and with
respect to such other financing to the same extent Ultimate Parent, Parent and
US Parent would have been obligated to comply with respect to the Debt
Financing, as applicable.

that the obtaining of any financing is not a condition to the Closing.

directors or officers arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall keep Parent reasonably
informed regarding any such matter. The Company shall not settle any such
stockholder litigation without Parents consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed, except for any such settlement that (a) requires
payments by the Company that are, in aggregate, less than or equal to the
amount set forth in Section 5.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter, (b)
provides for an unconditional release of all claims against the Company,
Ultimate Parent and their respective Subsidiaries by the Persons (including

Parent and the Company will each designate one or more Persons to a working
committee for the purpose of discussing, planning and implementing such

regular basis) (the " _PMO_ ") regarding any updates and developments with
respect to its capital expenditure plans and material growth projects or other
such meetings of its PMO that discuss any material updates and developments
with respect to its capital expenditure plans and material growth projects;

reasonable prior notice to such designees of any such meetings and make

to the extent not provided in advance to the members of the PMO, on the
same basis as provided to such members. The Company will consider in good
faith reasonable comments made by such designees, and make available its EVP

opportunity for follow-up questions regarding the matters discussed at such
meetings.

SECTION 5.18. _Registration Rights Agreement_. The Company shall use

SECTION 5.19. _Other Transactions_. The Company agrees that for the purpose of
facilitating Parents integration planning in connection with the Merger,
upon reasonable prior written request by Parent, the Company shall, subject to

reasonable efforts to effect, as of, or to the extent determined by Parent to
be necessary (and only to such extent) immediately prior to, the Effective
Time, (a) the modification of the Companys cash pooling arrangements
involving the Company and any of its Subsidiaries and (b) the settlement of
any intercompany loans between the Company and any of its Subsidiaries, or
between any of the Companys Subsidiaries (each, a " _Pre-Closing
Reorganization_ "); _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall not be
required to effect any Pre-Closing Reorganization or take any other action
(or fail to take any action) pursuant to this

 



-61-   _Section 5.19_ if the Company determines in good faith that such Pre-
Closing Reorganization or any other action (or failure to take any action)
would, or would reasonably be expected to, (i) where such Pre-Closing
Reorganization is required to be completed prior to the Effective Time, have
any adverse effect on the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Companys
securityholders in the event the Closing does not occur or otherwise have any
adverse effect in more than a de minimis manner on the Companys or any of its
Subsidiaries relationships or goodwill with third parties (through contract
or otherwise), including Governmental Entities, customers, suppliers and
creditors or (ii) impede or delay the completion of the Merger or the receipt
of any governmental approvals or consents necessary to satisfy, or the
satisfaction of, any condition to the obligations of the parties set forth

of any proposed Pre-Closing Reorganization and, notwithstanding anything in
this _Section 5.19_ to the contrary, the Company shall not be required to
complete any proposed Pre-Closing Reorganization not requested by Parent in
writing at least ten (10) Business Days (or such longer period as may be
required to cause such action to be taken without delaying the Closing) prior
to the anticipated Closing Date. Parent and the Company shall work
cooperatively and use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare prior to the
Closing Date all documentation necessary and to take all such other actions as
are reasonably necessary to give effect to any Pre-Closing Reorganization in
accordance with this _Section 5.19_. Parent agrees to waive any breach of a
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by the Company where such
breach is a result of an action taken by the Company in good faith pursuant
to a Pre-Closing Reorganization requested by Parent in accordance with this
_Section 5.19_. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and agree that no failure by
the Company to perform its obligation under this _Section 5.19_ shall be
deemed to be a failure to satisfy the condition for the performance of its
obligations, agreements and covenants under this Agreement as set forth in
_Section 6.02(b)_ or otherwise delay the Closing. Where any Pre-Closing
Reorganization requested by Parent under this _Section 5.19_ occurs prior to
the Effective Time and the Merger is not completed, Parent shall promptly
indemnify and hold the Company and its Subsidiaries harmless from and against
any and all direct and indirect liabilities, losses, damages, claims, costs,
expenses, fees (including advisor fees), interest, Taxes (including any Taxes
imposed with respect to the accrual or receipt of any indemnification payment
pursuant this sentence and any withholding Taxes required to be remitted by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries), judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred (currently or in the future) by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with or as a result of any such Pre-Closing
Reorganization.

_Section 7.02_ , Parent commences a suit, action or proceeding that results
in judgment for Parent for such amount, the Company shall pay to Parent all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Parent (including reasonable

part, by operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the

this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the parties and their respective successors and assigns.

SECTION 8.11. _Specific Enforcement; Consent to Jurisdiction_.

(a) The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage for which monetary
damages, even if available, may not be an adequate remedy, would occur in the
event that the parties hereto do not perform the provisions of this Agreement
(including failing to take such actions as are required of it hereunder in
order to consummate this Agreement) in accordance with its specified terms or
otherwise breach such provisions. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that they each shall be entitled to seek an injunction, specific performance
and other equitable relief to prevent breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The parties hereto hereby further acknowledge and agree that prior to the
Closing, the Company shall be entitled to seek specific performance to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions of, and to prevent or cure
breaches of _Section 5.02_ or _Section 5.09_ by (i) in the case of the
Company, Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub and to cause
Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby, including to effect the Closing in
accordance with _Section 1.02_ , on the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Agreement and (ii) in the case of Ultimate Parent, Parent,
US Parent and Merger Sub, the Company and to cause the Company to

 



-72-  consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
including to effect the Closing in accordance with _Section 1.02_ , on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto further agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein
on the basis that (x) the other party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an
award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at
law or equity ( _it_ _being_ _understood_ that nothing in this sentence shall
prohibit the parties hereto from raising other defenses to a claim for
specific performance or other equitable relief under this Agreement). Any
party hereto seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this
Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably (i) consents to submit itself to
the personal jurisdiction of the Delaware Court of Chancery and any state
appellate court therefrom within the State of Delaware (unless the Delaware
Court of Chancery shall decline to accept jurisdiction over a particular
matter, in which case, in any state or federal court within the State of
Delaware), in connection with any matter based upon or arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the actions of Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent, Merger Sub or
the Company in the negotiation, administration, performance and enforcement
hereof and thereof, (ii) agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat
such personal jurisdiction by motion or other request for leave from any such
court, (iii) agrees that it will not bring any action relating to this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any
court other than the courts of the State of Delaware, as described above, and
(iv) consents to service being made through the notice procedures set forth in
_Section 8.04_. Each of the Company, Ultimate Parent, Parent, US Parent and
Merger Sub hereby agrees that service of any process, summons, notice or
document by U.S. registered mail to the respective addresses set forth in
_Section 8.04_ shall be effective service of process for any suit, action or
proceeding in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert,
by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any suit, action
or proceeding with respect to this Agreement, any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of the above-named courts for any
reason other than the failure to serve process in accordance with this
_Section 8.11_ , that it or its property is exempt or immune from jurisdiction
of any such court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether
through service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise), and to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, that the suit, action or proceeding in
any such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of such
suit, action or proceeding is improper, or that this Agreement, or the subject
matter hereof or thereof, may not be enforced in or by such courts and
further irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law,
the benefit of any defense that would hinder, fetter or delay the levy,
execution or collection of any amount to which the party is entitled pursuant
to the final judgment of any court having jurisdiction. Each party hereto
expressly acknowledges that the foregoing waiver is intended to be irrevocable
under the Law of the State of Delaware and of the United States of America; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that each such partys consent to jurisdiction and
service contained in this _Section 8.11_ is solely for the purpose referred to
in this _Section 8.11_ and shall not be deemed to be a general submission to
said courts or in the State of Delaware other than for such purpose.

 



-73- SECTION 8.12. _WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. EACH PARTY HERETO ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO
INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES, AND THEREFORE IT HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN
RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE AGREEMENTS DELIVERED IN CONNECTION HEREWITH
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT
OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT
HEREOF OR THEREOF. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (A) NO
REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED,
EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT OF
LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (B) IT UNDERSTANDS AND HAS
CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH WAIVER, (C) IT MAKES SUCH
WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (D) IT HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT
BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS _SECTION
8.12_.

 

SECTION 8.13. _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of
the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner adverse to
any party hereto. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties hereto shall
negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original
intent of the parties hereto as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to
the end that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the fullest
extent possible.

 

SECTION 8.14. _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, documentary, sales, use, stamp,
registration and other Taxes and fees (including penalties and interest)
