Closing for immediate payment to such employees, less applicable payroll and
tax withholdings). All such amounts so paid shall nevertheless be deemed paid
to the Seller for all purposes of this Agreement.

Section 2.6 Purchase Price Adjustment

.

(a) Closing Statement

. Within ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, the Purchaser (with the
assistance of the Seller, to the extent reasonably requested by the Purchaser)
will cause to be prepared and delivered to the Seller a statement (the
"Closing Statement") setting forth in reasonable detail the Purchaser's good
faith calculations of (i) the Closing



Date Net Working Capital, (ii) the Closing Cash and (iii) the amount of any
adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price pursuant to Section 2.6(f). The
Closing Statement (A) shall be prepared in accordance with the definitions
contained in this Agreement and (B) to the extent related to the Closing Date
Net Working Capital, shall be prepared in accordance with the accounting-
related principles, policies, procedures and methodologies set forth in
Exhibit D. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Parties hereby acknowledge and agree that under no circumstances
shall any current liability be accrued in the Closing Statement to the extent
such liability or obligation was (1) taken into account as a reduction to the
Preliminary Purchase Price in calculating the Closing Payment (including with
respect to any Closing Date Indebtedness or Transaction Expenses) or (2)
otherwise paid by the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or the Seller prior to
the Closing.

(b) Review Period

. The Seller shall have thirty (30) days following receipt of the Closing
Statement (the "Review Period") during which to notify the Purchaser in
writing of any dispute of any item contained in the Closing Statement,
together with supporting documentation and work papers describing in
reasonable detail how such specific items were derived (a "Notice of
Disagreement"), which notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis
for such dispute. If the Seller does not deliver a Notice of Disagreement
within the Review Period, then the Seller will be deemed to have agreed to the
Closing Statement and the computation of the amounts contained therein will be
final, conclusive and binding on the Parties for all purposes hereunder. Any
determination set forth on the Closing Statement which is not specifically
objected to in Notice of Disagreement from the Seller shall be deemed
acceptable and shall be final and binding upon the Parties, absent fraud or
manifest error.

(c) Dispute Resolution

. If the Seller delivers a Notice of Disagreement to the Purchaser prior to
the expiration of the Review Period, then the Closing Statement shall be
resolved as follows:

(i) The Purchaser and the Seller shall cooperate in good faith to resolve any
such dispute in writing as promptly as possible.

(ii) In the event the Purchaser and the Seller are unable to resolve any such
dispute within thirty (30) days (or such longer period as the Purchaser and
the Seller may mutually agree in writing) following the Purchaser's receipt of
the Notice of Disagreement, such dispute and each Party's work papers related
thereto shall be submitted to, and all issues having a bearing on such dispute
shall be resolved by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator's resolution shall be
final and binding on the Parties absent fraud. The Purchaser and the Seller
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Arbitrator to complete
its work within thirty (30) days following its engagement. The fees, costs and
expenses of the Arbitrator shall be allocated to and borne by the Purchaser
and the Seller in inverse proportion as they may prevail on the items in
dispute, which proportionate allocations shall be calculated on an aggregate
basis based on the relative dollar values of all items in dispute and shall be
determined by the Arbitrator and included in its written decision. For
example, if the items in dispute total $1,000 and the Arbitrator awards $600
in favor of the Purchaser's position and $400 in favor of the Seller's
position, 60% (i.e., 600 ÷ 1,000) of the fees, costs and expenses of the
Arbitrator would be borne by the Seller and 40% (i.e., 400 ÷ 1,000) would be
borne by the Purchaser.

(iii) The Purchaser and the Seller each shall provide the Arbitrator with
their respective determinations of the Closing Statement and the adjustments.
The Arbitrator will consider only those items in dispute as to which the
Parties have disagreed within the time periods and on the terms specified
above and the Arbitrator shall resolve such dispute in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement. In submitting such dispute to the Arbitrator, each of
the Parties shall furnish, at its own respective expense, to the Arbitrator
and the other Party such documents and information as the Arbitrator may
reasonably request. Each Party may also furnish to the Arbitrator such other
information and documents as it deems relevant, with copies of each such
submission and all such documents and



information being concurrently given to the other Party. Neither Party shall
have or conduct any communication, either written or oral, with the Arbitrator
without the other Party, respectively, either being present or receiving a
concurrent copy of any written communication. The Arbitrator shall conduct one
or more conferences concerning the subject matter of the allowed objections
and disagreements between the Parties, at which conference(s) each Party shall
have the right to (A) present its documents, materials and other evidence
(consistent with the requirements herein), and (B) have present its or their
advisors, accountants, counsel and other Representatives. Such conference
shall take place either telephonically and/or at the offices selected by the
Arbitrator. Such conferences shall not exceed more than three (3) days, eight
(8) hours each day of hearings, or such other amount of time reasonably
determined by the Arbitrator. The Arbitrator shall resolve each item of
disagreement based solely on the presentations of supporting material provided
by the Parties and the terms of this Agreement, including the instructions of
the Parties as set forth in Exhibit D. The Purchaser and the Seller shall
cooperate fully with the Arbitrator and respond on a timely basis to all
reasonable requests for information or access to documents or personnel.

(d) Final Amounts.

(i) As used herein, the term "Final Closing Date Net Working Capital" means,

Review Period, or notifies the Purchaser of its agreement with the adjustments
in the Closing Statement prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then
the Closing Date Net Working Capital as set forth in the Closing Statement or
(B) if the Seller delivers a Notice of Disagreement relating to the
Purchaser's calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital as reflected
in the Closing Statement prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then
the Closing Date Net Working Capital is (1) as agreed to in writing by the
Purchaser and the Seller pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(i) or (2) in the absence
of such agreement, as determined by the Arbitrator pursuant to Section
2.6(c)(ii).

does not notify the Purchaser of any such dispute during the Review Period, or
notifies the Purchaser of its agreement with the adjustments in the Closing
Statement prior to the expiration of the thirty (30)-day period, then the
Closing Cash as set forth in the Closing Statement or (B) if the Seller
delivers a Notice of Disagreement relating to the Purchaser's calculation of
the Closing Cash as reflected in the Closing Statement prior to the expiration
of the Review Period, then the Closing Cash is (1) as agreed to in writing by
the Purchaser and the Seller pursuant to Section 2.6(c)(i) or (2) in the
absence of such agreement, as determined by the Arbitrator pursuant to Section
2.6(c)(ii).

(e) Adjustments to the Purchase Price.

(i) If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital exceeds the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital (such excess, the "Working Capital Excess"),
then the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be increased by the Working Capital
Excess;

(ii) If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is less than the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital (the absolute amount of such shortfall, the
"Working Capital Deficit"), then the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be
decreased by the Working Capital Deficit;

(iii) If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is equal to the Estimated
Closing Date Net Working Capital, then there shall be no adjustment to the
Preliminary Purchase Price pursuant to this Section 2.6 with respect to the
Final Closing Date Net Working Capital;

(iv) If the Final Closing Cash exceeds the Estimated Closing Cash (such
excess, the "Closing Cash Excess"), then the Preliminary Purchase Price shall
be increased by the Closing Cash Excess;



(v) If the Final Closing Cash is less than the Estimated Closing Cash (the
absolute amount of such shortfall, the "Closing Cash Deficit"), then the
Preliminary Purchase Price shall be decreased by the Closing Cash Deficit; and

(vi) If the Final Closing Cash is equal to the Estimated Closing Cash, then
there shall be no adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price pursuant to

and the Final Closing Cash, the Preliminary Purchase Price shall be adjusted
as follows:

(i) If the adjustments to the Preliminary Purchase Price contemplated by
Section 2.6(e) above result in an amount due to the Seller (such amount, the
"Upward Adjustment Amount"), then the Purchaser shall pay or cause to be paid
to the Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a bank
account designated in writing by the Seller, the Upward Adjustment Amount;

(ii) If the adjustments to the Preliminary Purchase Price contemplated by
Section 2.6(e) above result in an amount due to the Purchaser (such amount,
the "Downward Adjustment Amount"), then the Seller shall pay or cause to be
paid to the Purchaser, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to a
bank account designated in writing by the Purchaser, the Downward Adjustment
Amount; and

(iii) If the adjustments to the Preliminary Purchase Price contemplated by
Section 2.6(e) above result in no amount being due to the Seller or the
Purchaser, then there shall be no adjustment to the Preliminary Purchase Price
pursuant to this Section 2.6.

(g) Access to Information

. During the period from and after the Purchaser's delivery of the Closing
Statement through the final resolution of any matters contemplated by this
Section 2.6, the Purchaser shall afford the Seller, on a confidential basis,
access to the books and records of the Purchaser, the Company, its
Subsidiaries and their respective Affiliates to the extent related to any
item, matter or calculation included in or relating to the Closing Statement.

. The Purchaser may deduct and withhold from consideration otherwise paid or
deliverable to any Person in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby such amounts that the Purchaser is required to deduct and withhold

withhold any U.S. federal income taxes with respect to any payment of the
Purchase Price to the Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated
hereby. Amounts that are so deducted and withheld and timely remitted to the

and withholding was made.

(ii) Purchaser Prepared Tax Returns

. The Purchaser will prepare or cause to be prepared all Tax Returns other
than those that are the responsibility of the Seller pursuant to Section
6.10(a) with respect to a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period
(collectively, the "Purchaser Prepared Tax Returns"). Such Tax Returns shall
be prepared on a basis consistent with existing procedures and practices and
accounting methods, and, to the extent applicable, the conventions provided in
Section 6.10(a) (in each case except as otherwise required by applicable Law).
At least thirty (30) days prior to the due date (including extensions) of any
Purchaser Prepared Tax Return that is an income Tax Return and fifteen (15)
days prior to the due date (including extensions) of all other Purchaser
Prepared Tax Returns that show a Seller Indemnified Tax, the Purchaser shall
provide a draft of such Tax Return and such work papers as the Seller shall
reasonably request to the Seller for the Seller's review and comment, and the
Seller shall provide any comments within ten (10) days of their receipt of
such documents. The Purchaser shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to
incorporate any comments reasonably made by the Seller in the Tax Return
actually filed; provided, however, that if the Purchaser disagrees with Seller
with respect to any such comments, the Purchaser will notify the Seller of
such disputed item (or items) and the specific basis for its objection (a "Tax
Dispute Notice") within ten (10) days of their receipt of such comments to the
Tax Return. The Parties will act in good faith to resolve any such dispute
prior to the date on which the relevant Tax Return is required to be filed.

Parties cannot resolve any disputed item prior to ten (10) days before the due
date for filing the Tax Return (including extensions), the disputed item (or
items) will be resolved by the Arbitrator in the manner (including sharing of
costs) set forth in Section 2.6(c).

(iii) The Purchaser shall not, and shall not allow the Company or its
Subsidiaries to, voluntarily initiate any other Seller Tax Matter without the
prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned), in each case to the extent such action
would increase the Seller's indemnification obligations under this Agreement
and the Overall Cap has not been reached; provided that the Seller and the
Purchaser shall reasonably cooperate with respect to the filing of all Foreign
Bank and Financial Accounts Reports (FBAR) with respect to all Pre-Closing Tax
Periods and Straddle Periods. The Seller shall elect under Treasury
Regulations Sections 1.1502- 36(d)(6) not to reduce any of the Company's tax
attributes with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby.

(iv) The Seller and the Purchaser agree, to the extent in accordance with
applicable Law, with respect to certain Tax matters as follows: (A) to treat

(and have the Company and its Subsidiaries treat) any gains, income,
deductions, losses or other items realized by the Company or its Subsidiaries
on the Closing resulting from any Purchaser Closing Date Transaction as
occurring on the day after the Closing Date for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; (C) that the taxable year of the corporate Subsidiaries for income
Tax purposes will end at the end of the day on the Closing Date in accordance
with Treasury Regulations Sections 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(1) and -76(b)(2)(i);
and (D) to not make an election under Section 336(e), Section 338(h)(10) or
Section 338(g) of the Code with respect to the Company or its Subsidiaries
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby. Unless otherwise
required by a determination of a Governmental Entity that is final or required
by applicable Law, neither the Purchaser, the Company nor its Subsidiaries
shall file a Tax Return that is inconsistent with any agreement pursuant to
this Section 6.10(a)(iv), and neither the Purchaser, the Company nor its
Subsidiaries shall take any position during the course of any Tax Contest or
any other Tax audit or Tax Proceeding that is inconsistent with any agreement
pursuant to this Section 6.10(a)(iv).

(b) Straddle Period



. For any taxable period of the Company or the Subsidiaries that includes but
does not end on the Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the Seller and the
Purchaser agree to utilize the following conventions for determining the
amount of Taxes attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date: (i) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes
(not based on income, profit, receipts, or gains) imposed on a periodic basis,
the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall equal the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period (or in the
case of such Taxes determined on an arrears basis, the amount of such Taxes
for the immediately preceding Tax period) multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the period
ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of
calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; and (ii) in the case of all other
Taxes (including income Taxes, sales Taxes, employment Taxes and withholding
Taxes), including Taxes income with respect to "subpart F income" (as defined
in Section 952(a) of the Code) and "global intangible low-taxed income" (as
defined in Section 951A of the Code), the amount attributable to the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date shall be determined as if
the Company and its Subsidiaries filed a separate Tax Return with respect to
such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the end of the
day on the Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology." For
purposes of clause (ii), (1) any item determined on an annual or periodic
basis (including amortization and depreciation deductions) shall be allocated
to the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the Closing Date based on the
relative number of days in such portion of the Straddle Period as compared to
the number of days in the entire Straddle Period; and (2) Transaction Tax
Deductions accrued or paid during the Straddle Period shall be allocated in
accordance with Section 6.10(a)(iv); and (3) items of income and gain from any
Purchaser Closing Date Transaction shall be allocated in accordance with
Section 6.10(a)(iv).

Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries (whether or not a Tax
Contest); (iii) making available any information, records or other documents
relating to any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries
(including copies of Tax Returns and related work papers); and (iv) providing
certificates or forms, and timely execute any Tax Return, that are necessary
or appropriate to establish an exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer
Tax.

by the Purchaser and the Seller.

(e) Tax Contest.

(i) If any Governmental Entity issues to the Company or its Subsidiaries (A) a
notice of its intent to audit or conduct another Proceeding with respect to
Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing
Tax Period or Straddle Period or (B) a notice of deficiency for Taxes for any
Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, the Purchaser shall notify the
Seller of its receipt of such communication from the Governmental Entity
within five (5) days of receipt.

(ii) The Purchaser shall control any audit or other Proceeding in respect of
any Taxes or Tax Returns of the Company or a its Subsidiaries (a "Tax

prior written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned).

limited to, royalties) (collectively "Phytout Past Damages"), such Phytout
Past Damages shall to the extent available, be treated as follows and as set
forth in Exhibit H (provided, that Exhibit H shall be for illustrative
purposes only and in the event of any discrepancy between this Section 6.13(b)
and Exhibit H, this Section 6.13(b) shall control):

(i) the Company shall cause USW to pay such Phytout Past Damages to the Seller
to reimburse the Seller for the Phytout Costs incurred by the Seller prior to
the Closing Date that are 2015 Permitted Costs, up to a maximum amount of Two
Million Four Hundred Ninety Thousand Dollars ($2,490,000) (such amounts
actually borne by Seller, the "Pre-Closing Covered Costs"). "2015 Permitted

the Phytout Costs paid by USW or its Affiliates after the Closing Date that
are 2015 Permitted Costs;

(iv) if any amount of the Phytout Past Damages remains after giving effect to
subsections (i), (ii) and (iii), the Company shall cause USW to distribute

(v) if any amount of the Phytout Past Damages remains in Company's possession
after giving effect to subsections (i), (ii), (iii) and (iv), and to the

Covered Costs because they are not 2015 Permitted Costs, Company shall cause
USW to pay such Phytout Past Damages and/or any settlement or judgment amount
paid to USW in connection with the Current Phytout Litigation (excluding that
portion of a settlement or judgment which requires calculation of a future
economic value, other than that for royalties, if awarded or made part of a
settlement), if any, to reimburse the Seller for the remaining Pre-Closing

liability or obligation to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any
nature whatsoever for any matter that arises out of or relates to anything
occurring prior to the Effective Time. Notwithstanding the foregoing, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the foregoing shall
not be construed as a release by the Purchaser of any rights or claims of any
nature arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any of the Ancillary
Agreements, or the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby.

Section 6.15 Redemption

. The Seller shall cause the Company to take all necessary action prior to the
Closing to (a) redeem all of the issued and outstanding capital stock of the

prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed
prior to filing, entering into



or otherwise finalizing any Redemption Document. The Seller shall keep the
Purchaser reasonably informed from time to time or at the request of the

Section 6.18 Insurance

. Where any occurrence-based insurance policy of the Seller or its
Subsidiaries (other than the Company or its Subsidiaries) in effect prior to
the Closing (each, a "Designated Insurance Policy") provides coverage for any
liabilities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries arising out of claims
made after the Closing with respect to an injury, event and/or occurrence
prior to the Closing (collectively, "Covered Claims"), to the extent permitted
under such Designated Insurance Policy, the Seller shall submit a Covered
Claim under such Designated Insurance Policy at the request of Purchaser and
its Subsidiaries, shall have the option to control the prosecution and defense
of such Covered Claim or assign such rights to Purchaser, and may assign to
Purchaser any insurance proceeds with respect thereto, subject to the other
provisions of Article 9 of this Agreement and of this Section 6.18. After the
Closing, the Seller and its Subsidiaries shall administer the Designated
Insurance Policies in their sole discretion; provided, that the Seller shall
not and shall cause its Subsidiaries not to, in connection with such
administration, knowingly limit, inhibit or preclude the right of the
Purchaser and its Subsidiaries to insurance coverage thereunder in accordance
with this Section 6.18, in each case, with respect to Covered Claims, in a
manner disproportionately adverse to the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries
relative to the Seller and its Subsidiaries. The Purchaser shall promptly
notify the Seller of any Covered Claims, and the Seller agrees to reasonably
cooperate with the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries concerning the pursuit by
the Purchaser and its Subsidiaries for coverage of any such Covered Claims
under any applicable Designated Insurance Policy, in each case, at the expense
of the Purchaser (to the extent such expenses are not covered by the
applicable Designated Insurance Policies). The Purchaser shall be responsible
for complying with terms of the applicable Designated Insurance Policies in
respect of such Covered Claims, including if the applicable Designated
Insurance Policy requires any payments to be made in connection therewith
(including satisfying any applicable deductible or self-insured retention
under the Designated Insurance Policies in respect of such Covered Claims),
and the Purchaser shall make or cause to be made any such required payments.
Any amounts received by the Seller or its Subsidiaries under a Designated
Insurance Policy, to the extent that those amounts relate to Covered Claims
submitted by the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries, shall be paid (net of any
costs of recovery incurred by the Seller Parent, Seller or its Subsidiaries)
promptly to Purchaser, subject to Article 9 of this Agreement and the last
sentence of this Section 6.18. In the event that Covered Claims submitted by
the Purchaser or its Subsidiaries relate to the same occurrence for which the
Seller or its Subsidiaries are seeking coverage under a Designated Insurance
Policy, (a) the Seller and the Purchaser shall bear any expenses and/or make
any required payments in connection therewith in proportion to the amounts of
their respective claims (to the extent such expenses are not covered by such
Designated Insurance Policy) and (b) in the event that policy limits under
such Designated Insurance Policy are exhausted by the payment of any amounts
due in respect of such occurrence, such amounts shall be paid to the
respective parties proportionately to the amount due to each such party or its
Subsidiaries.

transactions contemplated hereby would violate any order, decree or judgment
of any court or Governmental Entity having competent jurisdiction; provided
that the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(c) shall not
be available to any party whose failure or whose Affiliate's failure to
perform any material covenant or obligation under this Agreement is the
proximate cause for the issuance of any such order, decree, or judgment;

(d) by the Company or the Seller, provided that the Company or the Seller is
not then in breach of any of their respective obligations hereunder, if either
(i) the Purchaser fails to perform any covenant in this Agreement when

days after the Company or the Seller delivers written notice thereof, or (ii)
any other condition in Section 7.1 or Section 7.3

Article 9

INDEMNIFICATION

Section 9.1 Indemnification of the Purchaser Indemnitees

.

(a) From and after the Closing and subject to the limitations set forth in
this Article 9, the Seller shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Purchaser, its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries) and
their respective officers, directors, managers, employees, successors and
permitted assigns (the "Purchaser Indemnitees") from and against any and all
Damages which may result from, arise out of, relate to or be incurred by any
Purchaser Indemnitee by reason of:

(i) any breach of any warranty or any inaccuracy or falsity of any
representation of the Company or the Seller contained in Article 3 or Article
4 of this Agreement ("Warranty Breaches");

(ii) any breach of, or any failure to perform any covenant or agreement of the
Company or the Seller contained in this Agreement;

(iii) any Transaction Expenses or Closing Date Indebtedness of the Company or
its Subsidiaries, to the extent (A) not paid prior to or in connection with
the Closing or (B) taken into account as a current liability in the Closing
Date Net Working Capital pursuant to Section 2.6 of this Agreement;

(iv) any Seller Indemnified Taxes; or

(v) any matter set forth on Schedule 2.0.

(b) Damage Limitations for Representations and Warranties



. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 9, the Damages that
may be asserted against the Seller for Warranty Breaches under Section
9.1(a)(i) shall be limited by the following:

(i) De Minimis Threshold

. With respect to an individual claim, the amount of Damages incurred or
suffered which the Purchaser Indemnitees would otherwise be entitled to
indemnification for Warranty Breaches under Section 9.1(a)(i) must exceed
$25,000 (the "De Minimis Threshold") and then, in such case, the entire amount
of such Damages count toward the Deductible and the Cap (as defined below)
(provided, that such Damages shall be aggregated for purposes of the De
Minimis Threshold if they arise out of the same matter, fact, circumstance or
event);

(ii) Deductible

. The aggregate amount of all such Damages incurred or suffered which the
Purchaser Indemnitees would otherwise be entitled to indemnification for
Warranty Breaches under Section 9.1(a)(i) (excluding claims less than the De
Minimis Threshold) must exceed (A) during the period from the Closing Date
until the dropdown of the retention under the RandW Policy pursuant to Section 7
of the Declarations thereof, as applicable, $1,350,000 and (B) for the period
thereafter until the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing Date,
$675,000 (the "Deductible"), at which time the Seller shall only be liable for
all Damages which exceed the Deductible, up to a maximum aggregate amount of
Damages equal to the Cap (as defined below);

(iii) CAP

. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL THE SELLER BE LIABLE FOR CLAIMS MADE FOR
WARRANTY BREACHES UNDER SECTION 9.1(a)(i) THAT EXCEED, IN THE AGGREGATE, THE
AMOUNT OF THE DEDUCTIBLE (i.e., during the period from the Closing Date until
the dropdown of the retention under the RandW Policy, $1,350,000, and for the
period thereafter until the eighteen (18)-month anniversary of the Closing
Date, $675,000) (THE "CAP"); and

(iv) Applicability of Limitations

. Notwithstanding the foregoing limitations in this Section 9.1(b), none of
the De Minimis Threshold, the Deductible or the Cap shall apply with respect
to any claim for indemnification based on (A) any breach of a Fundamental
Representation or (B) Fraud by the Seller or the Company.

(c) Other Caps.

(i) Overall Cap. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the Seller's maximum
aggregate liability for breaches of Sections 3.5(c), 3.5(d), 3.5(e), 3.5(f) or
the last sentence of Section 3.13 under Section 9.1(a)(i) and all
indemnification obligations pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(v) of this Agreement
shall not under any circumstances exceed a maximum aggregate amount of
$50,000,000 (the "Overall Cap").

(ii) Purchase Price Cap, Etc. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the
Seller's maximum aggregate liability for all indemnification obligations under
this Agreement shall not under any circumstances exceed the Purchase Price
(the "Purchase Price Cap"); provided, however, that such limitation shall not
apply to Fraud by the Seller or the Company or claims under Section
9.1(a)(iii), which shall not be capped.

(d) No Duplication



. Any liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement. In this regard, there shall be no duplication of
recovery under this Article 9.

(e) Effect of Downward Adjustment Amount on Indemnification Claims

. If the Purchase Price is adjusted downward as a result of a Downward
Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section 2.6 of this Agreement, the Purchaser
Indemnitees shall not also be entitled to indemnification for any loss to the
extent such loss was taken into account in the Downward Adjustment Amount. The
Purchaser Indemnitees shall not be entitled to indemnification under this
Article 9 for any claim to the extent such claim relates to an item included
in the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital or the Final Closing Cash.

(f) Computation of Damages

. Damages shall be determined net of any insurance benefits, amounts received
from a third party or Tax Benefits realized in the year the Damages were
incurred, which are actually realized by the Purchaser Indemnitees, to the
extent related to the Damages. If the Purchaser, the Company, the Subsidiaries
and/or any of their respective Affiliates realizes a Tax Benefit within in the
taxable year in which the applicable Damages are incurred and the immediately
following taxable year and such Tax Benefit was not included in the
computation of Damages, the Purchaser shall within ten (10) days of filing the
Tax Return claiming the Tax Benefit (or, if the Tax Benefit is in the form of
a refund, within ten (10) days of receiving the refund from the Governmental
Entity) pay such amount to the Seller.

(g) Effect of Later Insurance Payment for Claim

. If an indemnification payment is received by the Purchaser Indemnitees, and
the Purchaser Indemnitees later receive insurance proceeds or any other third-
party payment in respect of the related Damages (as provided in the
immediately preceding subsection), the Purchaser Indemnitees shall promptly
pay to the Seller or its designee an amount equal to the lesser of (y) the
actual amount of such insurance proceeds or other third party payment
received, or (z) the actual amount of the indemnification payment previously
paid by the Seller with respect to such Damages.

(h) Order of Claims

.

(i) To the extent the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
for Warranty Breaches pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i) (other than with respect
to Fundamental Representations), then, subject to the De Minimis Threshold and
the Deductible, the Purchaser Indemnitees will seek payment for such Damages
(A) first from the Seller until the retention under the RandW Policy has been
reached with respect to all Damages for such Warranty Damages (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, subject to the Cap), (B) second, if the retention under
the RandW Policy is exceeded and the claim is covered by the RandW Policy, then by
collecting insurance proceeds from the RandW Policy and (C) third, solely with
respect to any claim for indemnification made for any breach of Sections
3.5(c), 3.5(d), 3.5(e), 3.5(f) or the last sentence of Section 3.13, if the
claim is not covered by the RandW Policy or if the RandW Policy limitation is
exceeded, then by collecting from the Seller, until the Overall Cap is
reached.

(ii) To the extent the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to (x) Section 9.1(a)(i) for breaches of a Fundamental
Representation, or (y) Section 9.1(a)(iv) or Section 9.1(a)(v), the Purchaser
Indemnitees will seek payment for such Damages (A) first from the Seller until
the retention under the RandW Policy has been reached with respect to all
Damages under this Agreement, (B) second, if the retention under the RandW
Policy is exceeded and the claim is covered by the RandW Policy, then by
collecting insurance proceeds from the RandW Policy, (C) third, if the claim is
not covered by the RandW Policy or if the RandW Policy limitation is exceeded,
then by collecting



from the Seller, in each case until the Purchase Price Cap is reached (except
in the case of a claim under Section 9.1(a)(v), Damages shall be subject to
the Overall Cap).

(iii) To the extent the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(ii), the Purchaser Indemnitees will seek payment
for such Damages from the Seller until the Purchase Price Cap is reached.

(iv) To the extent the Purchaser Indemnitees are entitled to indemnification
pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(iii), the Purchaser Indemnitees will seek payment
for such Damages from the Seller.

(v) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that, except
for Damages relating to Fraud by the Seller or the Company or Fundamental
Representations, (A) the amount of the Cap and the RandW Policy shall be the
sole and exclusive source for the satisfaction of any Damages indemnifiable
under and pursuant to Section 9.1(a)(i), and (B) once the amount of the Cap
has been exhausted, the Seller shall have no direct or indirect liability with
respect to, and no obligation to satisfy, any claim by the Purchaser
Indemnitees under Section 9.1(a)(i) and the Purchaser Indemnitees shall have
no recourse to the Seller with respect thereto.

Section 9.2 Indemnification of the Seller

. From and after the Closing and subject to the limitations set forth in this
Article 9, the Purchaser shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Seller
and its Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, managers,
employers, successors and permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnitees") from and against any and all Damages which may result from,
arise out of, relate to or be incurred by any Seller Indemnitee by reason of
(i) any breach of any warranty or any inaccuracy of any representation
contained in Article 5, (ii) any breach of, or any failure to perform any
covenant or agreement of the Purchaser, or the Company contained in this
Agreement, and (iii) any claim made against the Seller or any of their
Affiliates for Transaction Expenses incurred by the Purchaser or Indebtedness
of the Company or its Subsidiaries incurred after, in connection with or to
facilitate the Closing; provided, however, the Seller acknowledges and agrees
that the representations and warranties and the covenants and other agreements
made by the Company to or for the benefit of the Purchaser, if breached, shall
under no circumstances give rise to indemnification of the Seller Indemnitees
and the Seller Indemnitees shall have no claim or cause of action against the
Purchaser or the Company under any theory of recovery under such circumstance.

Section 9.3 Indemnification Procedures

. A party making a claim for indemnification under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2
shall be, for the purposes of this Agreement referred to as an "Indemnified
Party" and a party against whom such claims are asserted under Section 9.1 or
Section 9.2 shall be, for the purposes of this Agreement, referred to as an
"Indemnifying Party". All claims by any Indemnified Party under Section 9.1 or
Section 9.2 shall be asserted and resolved as follows:

(a) In the event that (i) any action, application, suit, action, demand,
claim, audit, investigation or legal, administrative, arbitration, or other
alternative dispute resolution proceeding, action, hearing or investigation
(each a "Proceeding") is asserted or instituted by any Person other than the
Parties or their Affiliates which could give rise to Damages for which an
Indemnifying Party could be liable to an Indemnified Party under this
Agreement (such Proceeding, a "Third Party Claim") or (ii) any Indemnified
Party under this Agreement shall have a claim to be indemnified by any
Indemnifying Party under this Agreement which does not involve a Third Party
Claim (such claim, a "Direct Claim" and, together with Third Party Claims,
"Indemnification Claims"), the Indemnified Party shall, promptly after it
becomes aware of a Third Party Claim or facts supporting a Direct Claim, send
to the Indemnifying Party a written notice specifying the nature of such Third
Party Claim or Direct Claim, and the amount or estimated amount thereof (which
amount or estimated amount shall not be conclusive of the final amount, if
any, of such Proceeding) (a "Claim Notice"), together with copies of all
notices and documents (including court papers) served on or received by the
Indemnified Party in the case of a Third Party Claim, provided, however, that
a delay in notifying the Indemnifying Party (or delivering copies of the
aforementioned notices and documents) shall not relieve the



Indemnifying Party of its obligations under Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, except
to the extent that the Indemnifying Party shall have been prejudiced by such
failure to give such notice or deliver such documents or notices, in which
case the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its obligations under Section
9.1 or Section 9.2 only to the extent of such prejudice.

(b) In the event of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall have the
right to defend against and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to defend against and direct the defense of any
Third Party Claim, it shall within thirty (30) days (or sooner, if the nature
of the Third Party Claim so requires) (the "Dispute Period") notify the
Indemnified Party of its intent to do so. If the Indemnifying Party does not
elect within the Dispute Period to defend against and direct the defense of
any Third Party Claim or fails to notify the Indemnified Party of its election
during the Dispute Period, the Indemnified Party may defend against and direct
the defense of such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party elects to
defend against and direct the defense of such Third Party Claim and appoint
counsel in connection therewith, the Indemnified Party may participate, at its
own expense, only by attendance and observation and shall not defend or
otherwise conduct the defense of such Third Party Claim. If reasonably
requested by the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party agrees to cooperate
with the Indemnifying Party and its counsel in defending and contesting any
Third Party Claim which the Indemnifying Party defends. No Third Party Claim
may be settled or compromised, or offered to be settled or compromised, or a
default permitted or an entry of any judgment consented to (each, a
"Settlement") (i) by the Indemnified Party without the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, or (ii) by the Indemnifying Party without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, however, in the case
of a consent being required from an Indemnified Party, such consent shall not
be required in the event such Settlement includes a full release of the
Indemnified Party, and involves only monetary damages. In the event any
Indemnified Party enters into a Settlement with respect to any Third Party
Claim in violation of the preceding sentence, such Indemnified Party shall be
deemed to have waived all rights against the Indemnifying Party for
indemnification under this Agreement with respect to such Third Party Claim.

(c) After any final decision, judgment or award shall have been rendered by a
Governmental Entity or arbitrator of competent jurisdiction and the expiration
of the time in which to appeal therefrom, or a Settlement or arbitration shall
have been consummated, or the Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party
shall have arrived at a mutually binding agreement with respect to an
Indemnification Claim hereunder, the Indemnified Party shall forward to the
Indemnifying Party notice of any sums due and owing by the Indemnifying Party
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to such matter and the Indemnifying
Party shall make prompt payment thereof by wire transfer in immediately
available funds within five (5) Business Days after the date of such notice
or, if required earlier, pursuant to the terms of the agreement reached with
respect to the Indemnification Claim.

(d) In the event of a Direct Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the
Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days of receipt of a Claim Notice whether
the Indemnifying Party disputes such Indemnification Claim; provided that a
delay in notifying the Indemnified Party of such objection shall not waive the
Indemnifying Party's right to make such objection, except to the extent that
(and only to the extent that) the Indemnified Party shall have been prejudiced
by such failure to give such notice, and then only to the extent of such
prejudice. From and after the delivery of a Claim Notice under this Agreement,
at the reasonable request of either Party, each Party shall grant the other
Party and its Representatives reasonable access to the books, records,
employees, Representatives and properties of such Party to the extent
reasonably related to the matters to which the Claim Notice relates. All such
access shall be granted during normal business hours and shall be granted
under conditions which will not unreasonably interfere with the business and
operations of such Party. The Party requesting access will not, and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives not to, use
(except in connection with such Claim Notice) or disclose to any third Person
other than the Party's Representatives (except as may be required by
applicable Law) any information obtained pursuant to this Section 9.3(d) which
is designated as confidential by the other Party.

(e) To the extent that there is an inconsistency between this Section 9.3 and
Section 6.10(e) as it relates to a Tax Contest or other matters relating to
Taxes, the provisions of Section 6.10(e) shall govern.



Section 9.4 Limitation of Remedy

.

(a) No Parties' board members, members, shareholders, or other owners or their
respective directors, officers, employees, agents, attorneys or other
Representatives shall be personally liable for any obligations or other
matters arising under this Agreement except as specifically set forth herein.

(b) From and after the Closing, the rights and remedies set forth in Section
2.6 (Purchase Price Adjustment) and this Article 9 shall constitute the
Purchaser's sole and exclusive rights and remedies based on, arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby
(whether stated as a breach of contract, tort or otherwise) including in
respect of any breach or nonperformance of any representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement; provided, however, the
foregoing shall not preclude any remedy which arises out of a claim for Fraud
or for equitable relief or any claim under an Ancillary Agreement.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the preceding Section 9.4(b), no legal
action sounding in contribution, tort or strict liability (in each case, other
than claims made or contemplated by this Article 9) may be maintained by the
Purchaser, or any of its equity holders, affiliates, Representatives,
successors or assigns, against the Company or the Seller with respect to any
matter that is the subject of this Article 9, and the Purchaser, for itself
and each of its equity holders, affiliates, Representatives, successors and
assigns, hereby waives any and all statutory rights of contribution or
indemnification that any of them might otherwise be entitled to under any
federal, state or local Law except as set forth in this Agreement.

(d) Materiality standards or qualifications in any representation, warranty or
covenant, including references to the terms "material," "materiality," "in all
material respects," "Material Adverse Effect" or any similar term or phrase,
shall not be taken into account in determining whether a breach of or default
in connection with such representation, warranty or covenant (or failure of
any representation or warranty to be true and correct) exists or has occurred
for purposes of indemnification, or in determining the amount of Damages
resulting from any breach of any representation, warranty or covenant in each
case in accordance with this Article 9.

Section 9.5 Treatment of Indemnity Payments

. All indemnification payments made pursuant to this Article 9 shall be deemed
for all applicable federal, state and local Tax purposes to be adjustments to
the Purchase Price, except to the extent required by applicable Law.

Section 9.6 Survival of Representations and Covenants

. No representation or warranty contained herein shall survive the eighteen
(18)-month anniversary of the Closing Date, except that (i) the Fundamental
Representations (other than the Tax Representations and the Company Benefit
Plan Representations) shall survive indefinitely, and (ii) the Tax
Representations and the Company Benefit Plan Representations shall survive
until thirty (30) days after the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. Unless otherwise expressly set forth herein with respect to any
covenant or agreement (including, specifically, the covenants of
indemnification not specifically limited by the immediately foregoing
provision of this Section 9.6), all of the covenants and agreements set forth
herein shall survive until the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations. No Person shall be liable for any claim for indemnification under
this Agreement unless written notice specifying in reasonable detail the
nature of the claim for indemnification is delivered by the Person seeking
indemnification to the Person from whom indemnification is sought prior to the
expiration of the survival period as set forth above, in which case the
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement which is the subject of such
claim shall survive, to the extent of such claim only, until such claim is
resolved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, claims made under the RandW Policy are
not subject to the survival limitations contained in this Section 9.6.



Section 9.7 Further Limitations on Indemnification

. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, no
loss, claim, damage, expense or liability of any type shall constitute Damages
under this Article 9 to the extent that the Purchaser, the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries exercise and recover indemnification or other remedies under
Contracts of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries then in effect with
respect to such loss, claim, damage, expense or other liability, including
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 6.18 (Insurance).
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, to the
extent that the amount of any loss, claim, damage, expense or liability of any
type is included in the calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital
set forth in the Closing Statement (as finally determined pursuant to Section
2.6), such amount associated with such loss, claim, damage, expense or
liability shall not also constitute Damages under this Article 9 to the extent
its inclusion in Damages would constitute a duplication of such a loss, claim,
damage, expense or liability.

Section 9.8 Mitigation

. Each Person entitled to indemnification hereunder shall take all reasonable
steps to mitigate all Damages after becoming aware of any event which could
reasonably be expected to give rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable or
recoverable hereunder or in connection herewith. In addition to the foregoing,
the Purchaser shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to collect and
recover from the RandW Policy with respect to any Damages that could reasonably
be expected to be covered by such policy.

Section 10.2 Assignment; Successors in Interest

. No assignment or transfer by any Party of such Party's rights and
obligations hereunder shall be made except with the prior written consent of
the Purchaser and the Seller, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. No assignment shall relieve the assignee of
its obligations hereunder and any assignment or transfer that is made in
violation of this Section 10.2 shall be null, void, and unenforceable. This
Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the Parties
named herein, and their respective successors and permitted assigns, and any
reference to a Party shall also be a reference to the successors and permitted
assigns thereof.

Section 10.3 Heading and Captions

. The titles, headings, captions and table of contents contained herein are
inserted herein only as a matter of convenience and for reference and (i)
shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement,
nor (ii) in no way define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this
Agreement or the intent of any provision hereof.

Section 10.4 Governing Law; Amendment

. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed and enforced in accordance
with the internal Laws of the State of New York without reference to its
choice of law rules. Each Party hereby waives any right that it might
otherwise have to assert any rights or defenses under the Laws of any nation,
territory or jurisdiction or require that litigation brought by or against it
in connection with this Agreement be conducted in the courts or other forums
of any other nation, territory or jurisdiction. This Agreement may be amended
or supplemented in any and all respects by written agreement of the Seller and
the Purchaser.

Section 10.5 Submission to Arbitration

. Any dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or the breach
thereof, shall be resolved by arbitration before the American Arbitration
Association (the "AAA") in accordance with the AAA Commercial Arbitration
Rules in effect at the time the dispute is submitted to arbitration (the "AAA
Commercial Rules"). To the extent any provision of this Section 10.5 may
conflict with the AAA Commercial Rules, this Section 10.5 shall be
controlling. The arbitration shall be held before a panel of three (3)
arbitrators consisting of one (1) arbitrator selected by each of the Seller
and the Purchaser within fifteen (15) days after filing of the notice of
arbitration and the third, who shall serve as chairperson of the panel, then
selected by the two (2) party-appointed arbitrators within (30) days after
their appointment. If any arbitrator is not appointed within these timeframes,
such arbitrator shall be appointed by the AAA. Any arbitrator selected or
otherwise assigned to decide a matter hereunder, shall be a licensed attorney
with at least ten (10) years of experience in litigating mergers and
acquisitions transactions, but with no prior, existing or potential business
relationship with any of the parties hereto or any of their respective
Affiliates, attorneys or other



advisors and who shall be appointed in accordance with the AAA Commercial
Rules. The Parties agree that a court reporter will record the arbitration
proceedings and that the reporter's record will be the agreed transcript of
the proceedings. The arbitrators shall specify the basis for their decision,
the basis of any damages award and a breakdown of any damages awarded, and the
basis of any other remedy authorized under this Agreement, including but not
limited to specific performance or injunctive relief. The decision of the
arbitrators shall be considered as a final and binding resolution of the
disagreement, shall not be subject to appeal and may be entered as a judgment
and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The exclusive language to
be used for the arbitral proceedings and documentation shall be English and
the seat of the arbitration shall be New York City, New York, United States of
America. Any arbitration proceeding hereunder shall be conducted on a
confidential basis. The arbitrators shall apply the substantive laws of the
State of New York in interpreting and resolving disputes. The Seller and the
Purchaser shall agree in good faith upon what, if any, discovery shall be
permitted. If the Seller and the Purchaser cannot agree on the form and scope
of discovery within thirty (30) days after the appointment of the arbitrators,
then discovery shall be conducted in accordance with the AAA Commercial Rules.

Section 10.6 Severability

. Any provision hereof that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction
shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall
not invalidate or render unenforceable such provision in any other
jurisdiction. To the extent permitted by Law, each Party hereby waives any
provision of Law that renders any such provision prohibited or unenforceable
in any respect.

Section 10.7 Execution in Counterparts and Delivery of Electronic Signatures

. This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts. All such
counterparts will be deemed to be originals and will together constitute but
one and the same instrument. The executed counterparts of this Agreement may
be delivered by electronic means, such as email and/or facsimile, and the
receiving Party may rely on the receipt of such executed counterpart as if the
original had been received.

Section 10.8 Parties in Interest

. Except for Section 6.9 and Article 9, which are intended to benefit and be
enforceable by the parties specified therein, nothing expressed or implied
herein is intended, or shall be construed, to confer upon or give any Person
other than the Parties, and their successors or permitted assigns, any right,
remedy, obligation or liability under or by reason of this Agreement, or
result in such Person being deemed a third-party beneficiary hereof.

Section 10.9 Waiver

. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any extension or waiver of any
provision hereof shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of such Party. A waiver by a Party of the performance of any
covenant, agreement, obligation, condition, representation or warranty shall
not be construed as a waiver of any other covenant, agreement, obligation,
condition, representation or warranty. No waiver shall be deemed to extend to
any prior or subsequent default, misrepresentation, or breach of warranty or
covenant hereunder or affect in any way any rights arising by virtue of any
prior or subsequent such occurrence or omission. A waiver by any Party of the
performance of any act shall not constitute a waiver of the performance of any
other act or an identical act required to be performed at a later time.

Section 10.10 Entire Agreement and Integration

. This Agreement, including the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Exhibits
attached hereto, the documents executed and/or delivered, or to be executed
and/or delivered, and other documents referred to herein pursuant to the terms
hereof together with the Confidentiality Agreement, which shall survive
execution of this Agreement, constitute the entire agreement by and among the
Parties with respect thereto, and supersedes all prior



negotiations, agreements, understandings, and representations by or among the
Parties, written or oral, with respect to, and to the extent that they relate
in any way to, the subject matter hereof.

Section 10.11 Further Assurances

. Following the Closing, each Party shall deliver to the other Parties such
further information and documents and shall execute and deliver to the other
Parties such further instruments and agreements as any other Party shall
reasonably request to consummate or confirm the transactions provided for
herein, to accomplish the purpose hereof or to assure to any other Party the
benefits hereof.

Section 10.12 Attorneys' Fees

. In the event of any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement
or the rights of any party hereunder, the prevailing party in such proceeding
shall be entitled to receive from the other party its reasonable attorneys'
fees and other reasonable costs and expenses incurred therein.

Section 10.13 Expenses

. Except as otherwise expressly set forth herein, each Party shall be
responsible for and shall pay all of its own costs and expenses (including the
fees and expenses of its attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and other
advisors) incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby.

Section 10.14 Concerning the Company's Counsel; Attorney Client Privilege

.

(a) The Parties understand and agree that the Company and its Affiliates have
been represented by Ballard Spahr LLP ("Prior Company Counsel") in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Engagement"). The
Parties further understand and agree that the Company, prior to the Closing,
and the Seller, after the Closing, and except in the case of a third party
dispute, shall have the sole right to control, assert and waive the attorney-
client privilege with respect to any communications at any time between or
among the Company or any of its Affiliates and Prior Company Counsel relating
to the Engagement. Immediately prior to the Closing Date, all documents and
communications generated and maintained by the Company or any of its
Affiliates and Prior Company Counsel exclusively in connection with Prior
Company Counsel confidential legal advice and work product for the Engagement
shall become the exclusive property of the Seller, notwithstanding whether any
such documents or communications may be retained in the Company's or any of
its Subsidiaries' files or may come into the possession of the Purchaser, the
Company or any of the Company's Subsidiaries after the Closing.

(b) The Parties understand and agree that nothing in this Agreement, including
the foregoing provision regarding the ownership and assertion of privilege,
shall be deemed to be a waiver of any applicable attorney-client privilege.
The Parties further understand and agree that the Parties have each undertaken
reasonable efforts to prevent the disclosure of confidential or attorney-
client privileged information. Notwithstanding those efforts, the Parties
further understand and agree that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement may result in the inadvertent disclosure of
information that may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege. The
Parties further understand and agree that any disclosure of information that
may be confidential or subject to a claim of privilege will not prejudice or
otherwise constitute a waiver of any claim of privilege, unless applicable Law
would deem and dictate such an occurrence to be the required result. The
Parties agree to use commercially reasonable efforts to return promptly any
inadvertently disclosed information to the appropriate Party upon becoming
aware of its existence. This Section 10.14 shall be irrevocable, and no term
of this Section 10.14 may be amended, waived or modified, without the prior
written consent of the Parties.

Section 10.15 Equitable Relief; Specific Performance



. The parties agree that irreparable and ongoing damages, for which monetary
damages (even if available) would not be an adequate remedy, would occur in
the event that any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with its specific terms or otherwise were breached. Accordingly,
each party agrees that in the event of any actual or threatened breach of this
Agreement by the other party, the non-breaching party shall be entitled, in
addition to all other rights and remedies that it may have, to obtain
injunctive or other equitable relief (including a temporary restraining order,
a preliminary injunction and a final injunction) to prevent any actual or
threatened breach of any of such provisions and to enforce such provisions
specifically, without the necessity of posting a bond or other security or of
proving actual damages.
