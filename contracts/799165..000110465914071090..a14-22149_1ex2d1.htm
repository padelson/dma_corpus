the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests of their respective
corporations and shareholders that a transaction be effected pursuant to which
(i) Merger Sub will merge with and into the Company, with the Company
continuing as the surviving entity (the " **Merger** "), and (ii) each issued
and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.33 1/3 per share, of the
Company (" **Company Common Stock** ") (other than any Company Common Stock
owned by Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or any wholly-owned Subsidiary of
the Company), shall be converted into the right to receive the shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent (" **Parent Common Stock**
"), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth herein and after
giving effect to the Reverse Stock Split (as defined below). In connection
with the Merger and the issuance of the Parent Common Stock, Parent will
undertake a reverse stock split with respect to the Parent Common stock on a
one-for-three ratio (the " **Reverse Stock Split** ") to reduce the total
number of shares of Parent Common Stock outstanding to approximately 7,333,708
immediately prior to the Merger.

 



 

B. _Intended U.S. Tax Consequences._ The parties to this Agreement intend
that, for federal income tax purposes, the Merger qualify as a reorganization
within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " **Code** "), and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " **Treasury Regulations** ").

 



 

C. _Voting Agreements_. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, or
as soon as practicable after the date hereof, and as a condition and
inducement to ParentÂ’s willingness to enter into this Agreement, certain
officers and directors of the Company (the " **Company Voting Shareholders**
"), who beneficially own, in the aggregate, 2.40% of the outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock as of the date hereof, have each executed and delivered
to Parent a voting agreement in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit A_
(each, a " **Company Shareholder Voting Agreement** "), obligating each such
signatory to, among other things, vote in favor of the approval of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth therein. Concurrently with the execution of this
Agreement, and as a condition and inducement to the CompanyÂ’s willingness to
enter into this Agreement, certain officers and directors of Parent (the "
**Parent Voting Shareholders** "), who beneficially own, in the aggregate,
28.89% of the outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock as of the date hereof,
have each executed and delivered to the Company a voting agreement in the form
attached hereto as _Exhibit B_ (the " **Parent Shareholder Voting Agreement**
"), obligating each such signatory to, among other things, vote in favor of
the approval of the issuance at the Effective Time of Parent Common Stock to
the shareholders of the Company, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth therein.

consideration pursuant to _Section 4.1(c)_), shall, by virtue of the Merger
and without any action on the part of the holder thereof, be converted
automatically into the right to receive, a fraction of a validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of Parent Common Stock on a ratio of 1.760 (the "
**Exchange Ratio** ") (together with any cash in lieu of fractional shares of

of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such

Merger and without any action on the part of the holders thereof, at the

shall cease to exist, and each Certificate and Book Entry Share shall
thereafter cease to have any rights with respect to such share of Company

interest, the Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
4.2(c)_.

 



 

(c) _Cancellation of Remaining Shares of Company Common Stock_. Each share of

of common stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.33 1/3, of
the Surviving Entity.

 



 

(e) _Treatment of Company Equity Awards_.

 



 

(i) All options to acquire shares of Company Common Stock and other awards
(collectively, " **Company Equity Awards** ") made under the CompanyÂ’s stock
plans (collectively, the " **Company Stock Plans** ") prior to the Effective
Time, which are outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, are
identified in _Section 4.1(e)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter.

 



 

(ii) In the event a Company Equity Award constitutes a grant of restricted
stock or restricted stock units and to the extent such award is vested
immediately prior to the Effective Time (" **Company Vested Stock Based
Award** ") (it being understood that any such award that vests pursuant to its
terms as of the Effective Time shall, for purposes of this Agreement, be
deemed to be vested immediately prior to the Effective Time), the holder of
such Company Vested Stock Based Award shall receive the number of shares of
Company Common Stock subject to such Company Vested Stock Based Award in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the applicable Company Stock Plan,
including any terms and conditions regarding any Taxes required by Applicable
Law to be withheld, if any, with respect to the vesting of such Company Vested
Stock Based Award. In the event a Company Equity Award constitutes a grant of
restricted stock or restricted stock units and to the extent such award is,
for purposes of this Agreement, unvested and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (" **Company Unvested Stock Based Award** "), such Company
Unvested Stock Based Award shall be continued and

 



      
 

 



 

assumed by Parent as of the Effective Time pursuant to its terms (such awards
are referred to herein as the " **Rollover Stock Based Awards** "); _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent Common Stock shall replace the shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such awards pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(iii) In the event a Company Equity Award constitutes a stock option grant ("
**Company Stock Option Award** ") and to the extent such award is outstanding
and unexercised as of such time that is immediately prior to the Effective
Time, such Company Stock Option Awards shall be continued and assumed by
Parent as of the Effective Time pursuant to their terms (such awards are
referred to herein as the " **Rollover Stock Option Awards** " and, together
with the Rollover Stock Based Awards, the " **Rollover Awards** "); _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent Common Stock shall replace the shares of Company
Common Stock subject to such awards pursuant to this Agreement and the
exercise price, if any, for such awards, if any, shall be adjusted as provided
pursuant to this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent the
exercise of any such Company Stock Option Award becomes effective after the
date hereof and prior to such time that is immediately prior the Effective
Time, the holder of such Company Stock Option Award shall receive the number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option Award
(to the extent exercised) in accordance with the terms and conditions of the
applicable Company Stock Plan, including any terms and conditions regarding
the payment of the exercise price and any Taxes required by Applicable Law to
be withheld, if any, with respect to the exercise of such Company Stock Option
Award.

 



 

(iv) The assumption of Rollover Awards shall be made pursuant to this _Section
4.1(e)_, so that at the Effective Time, the applicable Company Stock Plans
shall be assumed by Parent (with such adjustments thereto as may be required
to reflect the Merger, including the substitution of Parent Common Stock for
Company Common Stock thereunder) and the Rollover Awards shall be assumed and
adjusted by Parent, subject to the same terms and conditions as set forth in
the applicable Company Stock Plans and the applicable award agreements entered
into pursuant thereto; _provided_ , _however_ , that for periods beginning
immediately following the Effective Time, (A) the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock subject to any such Company Stock Plan shall be the number of
shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Plan immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange Ratio (after taking
into account the transactions contemplated in the first sentence of _Section
4.1(e)(ii)_) (B) each Rollover Award shall only relate to such whole number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole share) of the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject
to such Rollover Award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by
the Exchange Ratio, and, if applicable, (C) the exercise price per share of
Parent Common Stock shall be an amount equal to the exercise price per share
of Company Common Stock subject to such Rollover Award in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time divided by the Exchange Ratio (the price per
share, as so determined, being rounded up to the nearest whole cent);
_provided_ , that in no event shall the exercise price per share be less than
the par value of Parent Common Stock. For the avoidance of doubt, any payment
or exercise in respect of a

 



      
 

 



 

Rollover Award shall be made in accordance with the terms and conditions of
the applicable Company Stock Plan, including any terms and conditions
regarding the payment of the exercise price, if applicable, and any Taxes
required by Applicable Law to be withheld, if any, with respect to the payment
or exercise of such Rollover Award. The adjustments provided in this paragraph
with respect to any Rollover Stock Option Awards shall be and are intended to
be effective in a manner which is consistent with Section 424(a) of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations thereunder, and, to the extent applicable,
Section 409A of the Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder.

 



 

(v) Except as otherwise provided herein or as set forth in _Section
4.1(e)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, from and after the period that
begins as of the date of this Agreement, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall take no action to provide for the extension of the term or exercise
period with respect to any Company Equity Award (unless such extension is
required under such Company Equity Awards or any applicable employment or
change in control agreement pursuant to any terms thereunder that are in
effect as of the date of this Agreement). To the extent such extension is
required under the terms of such Company Equity Awards (or any applicable
employment or change in control agreement) or as set forth in _Section
4.1(e)(v)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter, the Company shall, prior to the
Effective Time, take all actions (if any) as may be required to cause such
extension to occur.

 



 

(vi) Promptly following the Closing Date, Parent shall file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the " **SEC** ") a Registration Statement
on Form S-8 (or any successor form) covering the shares of Parent Common Stock
issuable upon exercise or vesting of the Company Equity Awards, and shall
cause such registration statement to remain effective for as long as there are
outstanding any such Company Equity Awards. Except as otherwise specifically
provided by this _Section 4.1(e)_, the terms of the Company Equity Awards and
the relevant Company Stock Plans, as in effect on the Effective Time, shall
remain in full force and effect with respect to the Company Equity Awards
after giving effect to the Merger and the assumptions by Parent as set forth
above. As soon as practicable following the Effective Time, Parent shall
deliver to the holders of Rollover Awards appropriate notices stating that
such Rollover Awards and such agreements shall have been assumed by Parent and
shall continue in effect on the same terms and conditions (subject to the
adjustments required by this _Section 4.1(e)_).

 



 

(vii) Nothing in this _Section 4.1(e)_ is intended to release any employee or
service provider to the Company from any provisions relating to any non-
competition, non-solicitation, or confidentiality provisions (or similar
provisions) of any Company Equity Award and any associated damages or
forfeitures (the " **Equity Award Restrictive Covenants** "), which shall
survive the Effective Time. The Company shall take such action as may be
necessary to ensure the survival of the Equity Award Restrictive Covenants and
the succession of Parent to the benefits of the Equity Award Restrictive
Covenants.

 



      
 

 



 

Section 4.2 _Exchange of Certificates Representing Company Common Stock_.

to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, in trust for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock for exchange in accordance with this Article IV, plus the
additional cash amounts sufficient to make payments in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock in accordance with _Section 4.2(e)_ (such cash
and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends or
distributions with respect thereto in accordance with _Section 4.2(c)_, being
hereinafter referred to as the " **Exchange Fund** "). Parent shall deposit
such shares of Parent Common Stock with the Exchange Agent by delivering to
the Exchange Agent certificates representing, or providing to the Exchange
Agent an uncertificated book-entry for, such shares.

 



 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Promptly after the Effective Time, Parent shall
cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder of record of one or more
shares of Company Common Stock as of the Effective Time: (i) a letter of
transmittal (the " **Letter of Transmittal** "), which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the shares of
Company Common Stock shall pass, only upon delivery of the corresponding
Certificates to the Exchange Agent or receipt by the Exchange Agent of an
"agentÂ’s message" with respect to Book Entry Shares and shall be in such form
and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may reasonably
specify, and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of such
Certificates or Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger Consideration and
any unpaid dividends and distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock in
accordance with _Section 4.2(c)_. Upon surrender of a Certificate or Book
Entry Shares for cancellation to the Exchange Agent together with such Letter
of Transmittal, duly executed and completed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book Entry Shares
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock which shall be in uncertificated book-entry form unless a
physical certificate is requested (in accordance with _Section 4.2(i)_) and
which shall represent, in the aggregate, that number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section
4.1(a)_ and (y) a check representing cash in lieu of fractional shares, if
any, pursuant to _Section 4.2(e)_ and unpaid dividends and distributions, if
any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article IV, after giving effect to any required withholding Tax, and any
Certificate or Book Entry Shares so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
No interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash in lieu of fractional
shares and unpaid dividends and distributions, if any, payable to holders of
Company Common Stock. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company
Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the Company,
one or more shares of Parent Common Stock which shall be in uncertificated
book-entry form unless a physical certificate is requested (in accordance with
_Section 4.2(i)_) and which shall represent, in the aggregate, the proper
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, together with a check for cash in
lieu of fractional shares, if any and unpaid dividends and distributions, if
any, which such holder has the right to receive pursuant to the provisions of
this Article IV, may be issued to such a transferee if the Certificate

 



      
 

 



 

representing such Company Common Stock is presented to the Exchange Agent,
accompanied by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and
to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes have been paid.

 



 

(c) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. All shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall be deemed issued and
outstanding as of the Effective Time. Notwithstanding any other provisions of
this Agreement, no dividends or other distributions declared or made after the
Effective Time with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock with a record
date after the Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any shares of
Company Common Stock until the holder of such shares shall surrender such
shares in accordance with this Article IV. Subject to Applicable Law,
following surrender of any such shares, there shall be paid to the record
holder thereof, without interest, (i) promptly after such surrender, the
amount of dividends or other distributions with respect to the number of whole
shares of Parent Common Stock that such holder has the right to receive
pursuant to _Section 4.1_, with a record date after the Effective Time but
prior to surrender and with a payment date on or prior to the date of such
surrender and not previously paid, less the amount of any withholding Taxes,
and (ii) at the appropriate payment date, the amount of dividends or other
distributions payable with respect to such whole shares of Parent Common Stock
that such holder receives with a record date after the Effective Time but on
or prior to the date of such surrender and with a payment date subsequent to
such surrender, less the amount of any withholding Taxes.

 



 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Closing of Transfer
Books_. All shares of Parent Common Stock issued, and any cash paid, upon the
surrender for exchange of shares of Company Common Stock in accordance with
the terms of this Article IV shall be deemed to have been issued or paid in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common
Stock previously represented by Certificates or Book Entry Shares. The stock
transfer books of the Company shall be closed immediately upon the Effective
Time and there shall be no further registration of transfers of shares of
Company Common Stock thereafter on the records of the Company. At or after the
Effective Time, any Certificates or Book Entry Shares presented to the
Exchange Agent or Parent for any reason shall represent the right to receive
the Merger Consideration with respect to the shares of Company Common Stock
formerly represented thereby (including any cash in lieu of fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock to which the holders thereof are entitled to pursuant
to _Section 4.2(e)_) and any dividends or other distributions to which the
holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 4.2(c)_.

 



 

(e) _No Fractional Shares_.

 



 

(i) No certificates of Parent Common Stock representing fractional shares of
Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same shall be issued pursuant
hereto, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to have any rights of a shareholder of Parent.

 



 

(ii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of
shares of Company Common Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would
otherwise have been entitled to receive a fractional share of Parent

 



      
 

 



 

Common Stock (after taking into account all Certificates and/or Book Entry
Shares held by such holder) shall receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without
interest) in an amount equal to the product of (x) such fractional part of a
share of Parent Common Stock, multiplied by (y) the closing price for a share
of Parent Common Stock as such price is reported on the NASDAQ and published
in _The Wall Street Journal_ on the business day immediately preceding the
Closing Date adjusted to give effect to the Reverse Stock Split.

 



 

(iii) As promptly as practicable after the determination of the amount of
cash, if any, to be paid to holders of fractional interests, the Exchange
Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent shall deposit or cause the Surviving
Entity to deposit such amount with the Exchange Agent and shall cause the
Exchange Agent to forward payments to such holders of fractional interests
subject to and in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including the proceeds of any investments thereof and any certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock or book-entry credit of the same)
that remains undistributed to the former shareholders of the Company as of the
date six months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent. Any
former shareholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for delivery of the Merger
Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions on the shares of
Parent Common Stock deliverable to such former shareholder pursuant to this
Agreement.

 



 

(g) _No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving
Entity, any Affiliate of any of the foregoing, the Exchange Agent or any other
Person shall be liable to any Person for any portion of the Exchange Fund
delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property,
escheat or similar laws.

 



 

(h) _Lost Certificates_. In the event any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
reasonably required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such
reasonable amount as Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may
be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will
issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the
applicable Merger Consideration and any unpaid dividends and distributions
with respect to shares of Parent Common Stock, as provided in _Section
4.2(c)_, deliverable in respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

 



 

(i) _Parent Book Entry Shares_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the parties intend that Parent may, at its sole
option, be permitted to utilize a direct registration system in accordance
with the NASDAQ rules and Applicable Law for the shares of Parent Common Stock
to be delivered under this Agreement, so that, if Parent so elects, all or any
portion of the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in connection with this
Agreement may be in uncertificated book entry form unless a physical
certificate is requested in writing by a holder of one or more Certificates.

 



       
 

 



 

(j) _Investment of the Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
_provided_ , that no such gain or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to this Article IV. Any
interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid
promptly to Parent.

 



 

(k) _Further Assurances_. After the Effective Time, the officers and directors
of the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company, any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or
assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of the Company, any
other actions and things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in
the Surviving Entity any and all right, title and interest in, to and under
any of the rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Entity as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

 



 

(l) _Withholding_. Each of the Exchange Agent, Parent, and the Surviving
Entity shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration payable
or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or former
holder of Company Common Stock or Company Book Entry Shares, as applicable,
such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld from such
consideration under the Code or any provision of state, local, or foreign Tax
law or under any other Applicable Law. To the extent such amounts are so

incurred in the ordinary course of business consistent with past practice

the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of
NASDAQ.

 



 

(b) The books, records and accounts of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, all of which have been made available to Parent, are complete
and correct in all material respects and represent actual, bona fide
transactions and have been maintained in accordance with sound business
practices.

 



 

(c) Each of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the
Company (or each former chief executive officer and former chief financial
officer of the Company, as applicable) has made all certifications (without
qualification or exceptions to the matters certified) required under Sections
302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations
promulgated by the SEC or NASDAQ with respect to the Company Reports, and the
statements contained in such certifications are complete and correct. Neither
the Company nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental
Authority questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or
manner of filing or submission of such certification.

 



 

(d) The Company has (i) established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange

to its auditors

 



      
 

 



 

and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) any "significant

concluded that such internal controls were effective using the framework
specified in the CompanyÂ’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year

required pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404
of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

 



 

(f) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has, since the enactment

notice, claim or assertion or, to the CompanyÂ’s knowledge, other communication
from any Governmental Authority regarding any actual or possible violation of,

(b) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries hold all material permits,
licenses, certifications, grants, easements, permissions, qualifications,

or other authorizations (the " **Company Permits** ") of all Governmental
Authorities or other Persons necessary for the ownership, leasing and
operation of their respective assets and the lawful conduct of their
respective businesses. All Company Permits are in full force and effect and
there exists no default thereunder or breach thereof in any material respect.
Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received written notice
that any such material Company Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot
be renewed in the ordinary course of business (either before

reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or nonrenewal.

be either subject to an excise tax or non-deductible to the Company under

financial effects of all prior transactions in relation to any such book
reserved plan; and (iii) if intended to be funded, any such non-U.S. plan is
either fully funded or any shortfall is fully recognized as a book reserve,
based upon reasonable GAAP actuarial assumptions and methodology and fully

Section 6.7 _Disclosure and Internal Controls and Procedures_.

 



 

(a) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Parent has been and is in
compliance in all material respects with (i) the applicable provisions of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act and (ii) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of NASDAQ.

 



 

(b) The books, records and accounts of Parent and each of its Subsidiaries,
all of which have been made available to the Company, are complete and correct
in all material respects and represent actual, bona fide transactions and have
been maintained in accordance with sound business practices.

 



 

(c) Each of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of Parent
(or each former chief executive officer and former chief financial officer of
Parent, as applicable) has made all certifications (without qualification or
exceptions to the matters certified) required under Sections 302 and 906 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the related rules and regulations promulgated by
the SEC or NASDAQ with respect to the Parent Reports, and the statements
contained in such certifications are complete and correct. Neither the Company
nor any of its officers has received notice from any Governmental Authority
questioning or challenging the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of
filing or submission of such certification.

 



 

(d) Parent has (i) established and maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange
Act) as required by Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act and (ii) has disclosed
to its auditors and the audit committee of the Parent Board (A) any
"significant deficiencies" or "material weaknesses" (as such terms are defined
in the Public Accounting Oversight BoardÂ’s Auditing Standard No. 5) in the
design or operation of internal controls over financial reporting which could
adversely affect its ability to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that involves
management or other employees who have a significant role in its internal
control over financial reporting.

 



 

(e) Parent has designed and maintains a system of "internal control over
financial reporting" (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the

executive and financial officers, has completed an assessment of the
effectiveness of ParentÂ’s internal controls over financial reporting in
compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2013, and such assessment concluded that
such internal controls were effective using the framework specified in
ParentÂ’s annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31,
2013. To the knowledge of Parent, there is no reason to believe that its
auditors and its chief executive officer and chief financial officer will not
be able to give the certifications and attestations required pursuant to the
rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act, without qualification, when next due.

 



 

(f) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has, since the enactment of the

thereof) of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.

(a) Since January 1, 2011, neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries or the
conduct of their respective businesses has been in violation in any material
respect of any Applicable Law. Since such date, neither Parent nor any of its
Subsidiaries has received any written notice, claim or assertion or, to
ParentÂ’s knowledge, other communication from any Governmental Authority
regarding any actual or possible violation of, or failure to comply with, any
Applicable Law in any material respect. No condition exists which does or
would reasonably be expected to constitute a violation of or deficiency in any
material respect under any Applicable Law by Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries holds all material permits, licenses,
certifications, grants, easements, permissions, qualifications, registrations,
variances, exemptions, consents, orders, franchises, approvals or other
authorizations (the " **Parent Permits** ") of all Governmental Authorities or
other Persons necessary for the ownership, leasing and operation of their
respective assets and the lawful conduct of their respective businesses. All
Parent Permits are in full force and effect and there exists no default
thereunder or breach thereof in any material respect. Neither Parent nor any
of its Subsidiaries has received written notice that any such material Parent
Permit will be terminated or modified or cannot be renewed in the ordinary
course of business (either before or after the Effective Time), and Parent has
no knowledge of any reasonable basis for any such termination, modification or
nonrenewal.

the Code or to any agreement under any similar provision of any state, local
or foreign law, and no agreement has otherwise been entered into with any
Governmental Authority by or with respect to Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
which require Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to adjust any Tax items of
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in any Return due after the date hereof.
Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has been, and none of them will be,
required to include any material adjustment in taxable income for any Tax

contained in credit or similar agreements the primary purpose of which is not
Taxes). Since January 1, 2010, Parent has not rescinded any material election
relating to Taxes or settled or compromised any Proceeding or audit relating
to any Parent Return or any material Taxes or, except as may be required by
Applicable Law, made any material change to any of its methods of reporting

Governmental Authority in any foreign country where Parent and any of its
Subsidiaries have not filed Returns and have not paid Taxes that Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries is subject to Tax by that jurisdiction.

connection with the Parent Benefit Plans that would subject Parent, its
Subsidiaries or Employees or any trustee, administrator or other fiduciary to
any material liability for breach of fiduciary duty under ERISA or any other
Applicable Law and (ii) no prohibited transaction under Section 4975 of the
Code or Section 406 of ERISA with respect to which an individual, class or

any employee, officer or director of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries to be
either subject to an excise tax or non-deductible to Parent under Sections
4999 and 280G of the Code (or similar non-U.S. law), respectively, whether or

such book reserved plan; and (iii) if intended to be funded, any such non-U.S.
plan is either fully funded or any shortfall is fully recognized as a book
reserve, based upon reasonable GAAP actuarial assumptions and methodology and
fully reflects the financial effects of all prior transactions in relation to
such funded plan.

requires a license to the Intellectual Property of any Person, and (v) neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any charge, complaint, claim

general liability, workersÂ’ compensation, liability, pollution liability,
directors and officers and other liability policies) owned by Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries or which names Parent or any of its Subsidiaries as an

Subsidiaries, and all premiums due under each such policy have been paid. With
respect to each such insurance policy, none of Parent, any of its Subsidiaries
or, to ParentÂ’s knowledge, any other party to the policy is in breach or
default in any material respect thereunder (including with respect to the
payment of premiums or the giving of notices), and Parent does not know of any
occurrence or any event which (with notice or the lapse of time or both) would
constitute such a breach or default or permit termination, modification or
acceleration under the policy. None of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has
been refused any insurance with respect to its assets or operations since

Section 7.3 _No Solicitation_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Company and Parent (each, a " **No-Shop Party** " and, with
respect to each other, the " **Other Party** ") agrees that neither it nor any
of its Subsidiaries shall, and each No Shop Party shall cause its and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ Representatives not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit,
initiate, approve, endorse, recommend or encourage, or take any other action
designed to, or which would reasonably be expected to, facilitate, any inquiry
or the making or announcement of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or
that would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal in
respect of such No-Shop Party, (ii) engage, continue or otherwise participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or furnish (or cause to be
furnished) non-public information relating to such No-Shop Party or any of its
Subsidiaries or afford access to properties, books or records of the No-Shop
Party or any of its Subsidiaries to any Person in connection with or in
furtherance of any Acquisition Proposal, (iii) approve or recommend, or
propose to approve or recommend, or consummate, execute or enter into any
letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger

venture agreement, partnership agreement or other agreement, constituting or
related to, or that is intended to or would reasonably be expected to lead to
an Acquisition Proposal (other than confidentiality agreements contemplated by
this _Section 7.3_), or (iv) propose publicly or agree to do any of the
foregoing. Without limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of
the restrictions set forth in this paragraph by any Representative of a No-
Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of such No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries
or otherwise, shall be a breach of this _Section 7.3(a)_ by such No-Shop
Party.

 



      
 

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, as
applicable, a No-Shop Party may, directly or indirectly through its
Representatives, (i) furnish information and access, but only in response to a
written request for information or access, to any person making an Acquisition
Proposal which was not solicited, initiated, knowingly encouraged or knowingly
facilitated by the No-Shop Party or any of its Subsidiaries, Affiliates or
Representatives and (ii) may participate in discussions and negotiate with
such Person concerning any such unsolicited Acquisition Proposal, if and only
to the extent all of the following conditions are met: (A) the No-Shop Party
has not breached this _Section 7.3(a)_ in any material respect with respect
to such Acquisition Proposal, (B) the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel and a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal,
and (C) the No-Shop Party enters into a customary confidentiality agreement
with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal which is (1) no less
favorable to the No-Shop Party and (2) no less restrictive of such Person than
the Nondisclosure Agreement, dated August 11, 2014, between Parent and the
Company (the " **Confidentiality Agreement** ") and all such information
provided thereunder has previously been provided to the Other Party or is
provided to the Other Party concurrently with its provision to such Person.

 



 

(b) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 7.3(b)_, neither the Board
of Directors of a No-Shop Party nor any committee thereof shall (i) fail to
make, withdraw, modify or qualify, or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw,
modify or qualify, in any manner adverse to the Other Party, the Company
Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as applicable, (ii) make any
other public statement that is inconsistent with the Company Recommendation or
the Parent Recommendation, as applicable, (iii) recommend, endorse, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, endorse, adopt or approve, any
Acquisition Proposal or (iv) fail to reaffirm or re-publish within five
business days upon request by the Other Party (publicly if so requested) the
Company Recommendation or the Parent Recommendation, as applicable (any action
or failure described in this clause (i) being referred to as a " **Company
Adverse Recommendation Change** " or a " **Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change** ", as applicable).

 



 

Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time prior to (but not after) obtaining
the Company Shareholder Approval or the Parent Shareholder Approval, as
applicable, and subject to the No-Shop PartyÂ’s compliance at all times with
the provisions of this _Section 7.3_, (i) the Board of Directors of the No-
Shop Party may make a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, or (ii) the No-Shop Party may
terminate this Agreement and enter into an agreement, understanding or
arrangement providing for an Acquisition Proposal (a " **Superior Acquisition
Proposal Termination** "), in each case, if and only to the extent all of the
following conditions are met: (A) the Acquisition Proposal has not been
withdrawn, (B) the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good
faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, (C) the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after receipt of advice from outside counsel, that the failure to
take such action would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of fiduciary
duties to the shareholders of the No-Shop Party under Applicable Law,

 



      
 

 



 

and (D) in the case of a Superior Acquisition Proposal Termination, the
concurrent payment of the applicable Termination Fee in accordance with
_Section 9.5(a)_ or _Section 9.5(b)_, as applicable; _provided_ , _however_
, no Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation
Change, as applicable, or Superior Acquisition Proposal Termination may be
made or occur, in each case,

 



 

(1) until after the third business day following the Other PartyÂ’s receipt of
written notice (a " **Change/Intent to Terminate Notice** ") from the No-Shop
Party advising the Other Party that the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors
intends to take such action or the No-Shop Party intends to terminate this
Agreement, which Change/Intent to Terminate Notice will specify the terms and
conditions of such Superior Proposal (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or any other material term of such Superior
Proposal shall require a new Change/Intent to Terminate Notice and a new three
business day period);

 



 

(2) unless during such three business day period, the No-Shop Party shall, and
shall cause its financial and legal advisors to, upon the Other PartyÂ’s
request, discuss with the Other Party in good faith this Agreement and any
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Other Party
may propose in response to the Acquisition Proposal; and

 



 

(3) if, prior to the expiration of such three business day period, the Other
Party makes a proposal to adjust the terms and conditions of this Agreement
that the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
receipt of advice from outside legal counsel and a financial advisor of
nationally recognized reputation, to be at least as favorable as the
Acquisition Proposal so that such Acquisition Proposal no longer constitutes a
Superior Proposal;

 



 

provided, however, that the No-Shop Party need not comply with the provisions
of subclauses (2) and (3) of this _Section 7.3(b)_ if the No-Shop PartyÂ’s
Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receipt of advice from a
financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that such Superior
Proposal (as specified in the Change/Intent to Terminate Notice issued to the
Other Party pursuant to subclause (1) of this _Section 7.3(b)_) constitutes a
Special Valuation Proposal.

 



 

(c) In addition to the obligations of each No-Shop Party set forth in
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section 7.3_, each No-Shop Party shall
promptly (and in any event within 24 hours after receipt thereof) advise the
Other Party orally and in writing of any Acquisition Proposal or any inquiry
with respect to or that would reasonably be expected to lead to any
Acquisition Proposal, including the material terms and conditions of any such
Acquisition Proposal or inquiry (including any changes thereto). Each No-Shop
Party shall (i) keep the Other Party reasonably informed of the status and
details (including any change to the terms thereof) of any such Acquisition
Proposal or inquiry and (ii) provide to the Other Party as soon as practicable
after receipt or delivery thereof with copies of all correspondence and other
written material sent or provided to such No-Shop Party or any of its
Subsidiaries from any Person that describes any of the terms or conditions of
any Acquisition Proposal;

 



      
 

 



 

provided, however, that such No-Shop Party need not inform the Other Party
regarding the identity of the Person making any such Acquisition Proposal or
inquiry.

 



 

(d) Nothing contained in this _Section 7.3_ shall prohibit any No-Shop Party
or any Board of Directors of a No-Shop Party from taking and disclosing to its
shareholders a position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act, or other Applicable Law, if, in the good
faith judgment of the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors, after receipt of
advice from outside counsel, failure to so disclose would be reasonably likely
to result in a breach of its fiduciary duties to shareholders of the No-Shop
Party under Applicable Law; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the
No-Shop Party or its Board of Directors take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by _Section 7.3(b_).

 



 

(e) Each No-Shop Party (i) shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to,
immediately cease and cause to be terminated and shall cause its and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated, all discussions and negotiations, if any, with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal in respect of
such No-Shop Party and (ii) shall promptly request the return or destruction
of all confidential information previously furnished and immediately terminate
all physical and electronic dataroom access previously granted to any such
Person or its Representatives.

 



 

(f) For purposes of this Agreement:

 



 

(i) " **Acquisition Proposal** " means, with respect to either No-Shop Party,
any inquiry, proposal or offer, whether or not in writing, from any Person
other than the Other Party or its Affiliates relating to, or that would
reasonably be expected to lead to, any (A) direct or indirect acquisition or
purchase, in one transaction or a series of transactions, of (i) assets or
businesses that constitute 20% or more of the consolidated net revenues, net
income or assets (based on either book or fair market value) of such No-Shop
Party and its Subsidiaries, or (ii) 20% or more of any class of equity
securities of such No-Shop Party, (B) tender offer or exchange offer that if
consummated would result in any Person beneficially owning 20% or more of any
class of equity securities of such No-Shop Party, or (C) merger,
consolidation, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution, joint venture, share exchange or similar transaction involving
such No-Shop Party, in each case other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.

 



 

(ii) " **Special Valuation Proposal** " means a Superior Proposal that the No-
Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after receipt of
advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation, that, if
consummated, would result in such No-Shop PartyÂ’s shareholders receiving
consideration valued at 115% or more of the consideration to be received by
such No-Shop PartyÂ’s shareholders pursuant to the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, as such consideration may have then been modified by the Other
Party in response to such Acquisition Proposal.

 



      
 

 



 

(iii) " **Superior Proposal** " means any bona fide written Acquisition
Proposal made by any Person other than the Other Party or its Affiliates,
which, if consummated, would result in such Person (or its shareholders)
owning, directly or indirectly, at least 80% of the shares of Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock, as applicable, then outstanding (or of the
surviving entity in a merger or the direct or indirect parent of the surviving
entity in a merger) or at least 80% of all the assets of the No-Shop Party,
which the No-Shop PartyÂ’s Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
receipt of advice from a financial advisor of nationally recognized reputation
and outside counsel, to be (A) more favorable to the shareholders of the No-
Shop Party from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account
all the terms and conditions of such proposal, the Person making such proposal
and this Agreement (including any break-up fees, expense reimbursement
provisions, conditions to consummation, strategic considerations, legal and
regulatory considerations, and any changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by the Other Party in response to such offer or otherwise pursuant to
this _Section 7.3_) and (B) reasonably likely to be completed on the terms
proposed, taking into account all financial, legal, regulatory and other
aspects of such proposal. For purposes of the definitions of "Acquisition
Proposal," "Special Valuation Proposal" and "Superior Proposal," the term
"Person" shall include any group within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act.

 



 

Section 7.4 _Preparation of Proxy Statement; Meetings of Shareholders_.

 



 

(a) As promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, each of
Parent and the Company shall cooperate and prepare the joint proxy statement
with respect to the meetings of the shareholders of Parent and of the Company
in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
**Proxy Statement/Prospectus** "), and Parent shall prepare and file with the
SEC, a Registration Statement on Form S-4 (with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the " **Form S-4**") under the Securities Act with respect to the
shares of Parent Common Stock issuable in the Merger, a portion of which Form
S-4 shall also serve as the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. The respective parties
will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the Form S-4 to comply as to
form in all material respects with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Each of Parent
and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4
declared effective by the SEC as promptly as practicable and to keep the Form
S-4 effective as long as is necessary to consummate the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated thereby. As promptly as practicable after receipt
thereof, each party shall provide the other party copies of any written
comments, and advise the other party of any oral comments, received from the
SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus. Each of the parties shall
provide the other with a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on any
amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or Form S-4 and,
except for annual, quarterly and current reports filed or furnished with the
SEC under the Exchange Act, which may be incorporated by reference in the Form
S-4, any substantive communications prior to filing such with the SEC, and

communications made with the SEC.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Parent shall use reasonable best efforts, and the Company shall cooperate,
to obtain, prior to the effective date of the Form S-4, all necessary state
securities law or "Blue Sky" permits or approvals required with respect to the
issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the Merger. The Company shall
furnish all information concerning the Company and the holders of Company
Common Stock as may be reasonably requested in connection with any such
action. Each Party shall advise the other party, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective, the
issuance of any stop order, the suspension of qualification of the Parent
Common Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in
any jurisdiction, or any request by the SEC for amendment of the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4.

 



 

(c) Each of Parent and the Company shall cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
to be mailed to its shareholders as promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act.

 



 

(d) Each of Parent and the Company shall ensure that the information provided
by it for inclusion in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and each amendment or
supplement thereto, at the time of mailing thereof and at the time of the
respective meetings of shareholders of Parent and the Company, or, in the case
of information provided by it for inclusion in the Form S-4 or any amendment
or supplement thereto, at the time it becomes effective, (i) will not include
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and (ii)
will comply as to form in all material respects with the provisions of the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time any information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be discovered by Parent
or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to any
of the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus so that any of such
documents would not include any misstatement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party
that discovers such information shall promptly notify the other party hereto
and, to the extent required by Applicable Law, an appropriate amendment or
supplement describing such information shall be filed promptly with the SEC
and disseminated to the shareholders of the Company.

 



 

(e) The Company, acting through the Company Board, shall, in accordance with
Applicable Law and the Company Articles of Incorporation or Company Bylaws,
duly call, give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of
its shareholders (the " **Company Shareholders Meeting** ") as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the
Securities Act for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval.
The Company Board shall, subject to _Section 7.3(b)_, make the Company
Recommendation, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Company Shareholder
Approval. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless
(i) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with
_Section 7.3_ or (ii) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article
IX and subject to compliance with _Section 7.3_, the Company will submit this
Agreement for approval by the shareholders of the

 



      
 

 



 

Company at the Company Shareholders Meeting. The Company shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Shareholders Meeting to be held
on the same date as the Parent Shareholders Meeting.

 



 

(f) Parent, acting through the Parent Board, shall, in accordance with
Applicable Law and ParentÂ’s certificate of formation and bylaws, duly call,
give notice of, convene and hold an annual or special meeting of its
shareholders (the " **Parent Shareholders Meeting** ") as soon as reasonably
practicable after the Form S-4 is declared effective under the Securities Act
for the purpose of obtaining the Parent Shareholder Approval. Except to the
extent permitted by _Section 7.3(b)_, the Parent Board shall make the Parent
Recommendation, include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus
and use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Parent Shareholder Approval.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, unless (i) a
Parent Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred in accordance with _Section
7.3_ or (ii) this Agreement is terminated in accordance with Article IX and
subject to compliance with _Section 7.3_, Parent will submit this Agreement
for approval by the shareholders of Parent at the Parent Shareholders Meeting.
Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Parent Shareholders
Meeting to be held on the same date as the Company Shareholders Meeting.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Parent may, in its
sole discretion, submit a proposal to its shareholders at the Parent
Shareholders Meeting to approve an amendment to the Parent Certificate of
Formation.

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions herein provided, and subject
to _Section 7.3_, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable

be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under Applicable Law or
otherwise to consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, including (i) to satisfy the conditions precedent to the
obligations of any of the parties hereto, (ii) preparing and filing as

Without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall, as soon as
practicable and in any event within ten business days after the date of this
Agreement, file Notification and Report Forms under the HSR Act with the
Federal Trade Commission and the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and make such other filings, notices, petitions, statements,
registrations, submissions of information, applications and other documents as
the parties determine are necessary under applicable Antitrust Laws. Each of
the parties hereto will furnish to the other parties such necessary
information and reasonable assistance as such other parties may reasonably
request in connection with the foregoing; _provided_ , that neither party is
obligated to share any document submitted to or received from a Governmental
Authority that reflects the negotiations between the parties or the valuation
of some or all of any partyÂ’s business.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Each of the parties hereto shall use its reasonable best efforts and shall
cooperate with the other parties to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under Applicable
Law. The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to respond as
promptly as practicable to all inquiries received from the Federal Trade
Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice or the
competition authorities of any other jurisdiction for additional information
or documentation under applicable Antitrust Laws.

 



 

(c) The parties shall cooperate in all respects with each other in connection
with any antitrust defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
in any Proceeding by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Authority or
other Person relating to the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable
Antitrust Law.

 



 

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Agreement to
the contrary, in no event shall any party hereto be obligated to (i) agree to,
or proffer to, divest or hold separate, or enter into any licensing or similar
arrangement with respect to, any assets (whether tangible or intangible) or
any portion of any business of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) agree to, or proffer to, limit in
any respect the ownership or operation by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries of any asset (whether tangible or

Subsidiaries or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, including the ability
of Parent to acquire or hold, or exercise full rights of ownership of, any
shares of capital stock, including the right to vote the Company Common Stock
on all matters properly presented to the shareholders of the Company.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Parent shall
have the right, but not the obligation, to oppose by refusing to consent to,
through litigation or otherwise any request, attempt or demand by any
Governmental Authority or other Person for any divestiture, hold separate
condition or any other restriction with respect to any assets, businesses or
product lines of either Parent or the Company.

 



 

Section 7.6 _Inspection_. Subject to any limitations imposed by Applicable
Law, from the date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, each of the
Company and Parent shall allow all designated officers, attorneys, accountants
and other Representatives of Parent or the Company, as the case may be,
reasonable access, at reasonable times, upon reasonable notice, to its and its
SubsidiariesÂ’ personnel, properties, Contracts, commitments, books and records
and any other information pertaining to the business and affairs of the
Company or Parent (as applicable) or their respective Subsidiaries, as Parent
or the Company may reasonably request, including inspection, testing or
sampling of such properties; provided, that no investigation pursuant to this
_Section 7.6_ shall affect any representation or warranty given by any party
hereunder. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement or a partyÂ’s
provision of information or investigation pursuant to the preceding sentence,
no party shall be deemed to make any representation or warranty except as
expressly set forth in this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no party
shall be required to provide any information which it may not provide to the
other party by reason of any Applicable Law, which constitutes information
protected by attorney/client privilege, or which it is required to keep
confidential by reason of contract or agreement with third parties. The
parties hereto shall make reasonable and appropriate substitute disclosure
arrangements under circumstances in which the

 



      
 

 



 

restrictions of the preceding sentence apply. Each of the Company and Parent
agrees that it shall not, and shall cause its respective Representatives not
to, use any information obtained pursuant to this _Section 7.6_ for any

Agreement. All non-public information obtained pursuant to this _Section 7.6_
shall be governed by the Confidentiality Agreement.

required by Applicable Law or by obligations pursuant to any national

addition to the foregoing, except to the extent disclosed in or consistent
with the Proxy Statement/Prospectus in accordance with the provisions of
_Section 7.4_, neither Parent nor the Company shall issue any such press
release or otherwise make any public statement or disclosure concerning the
other party or the other partyÂ’s business, financial condition or results of
operations without the consent of the other party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as may be required by Applicable Law
or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with any national
securities exchange, in which case the party proposing to issue such press
release or make such public statement shall use its reasonable best efforts to
consult in good faith with the other party before issuing any such press
releases or making any such public statement. The foregoing shall not apply
with respect to any press release or public announcement arising out of a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
effected in accordance with _Section 7.3_. Parent and the Company agree to
issue a mutually acceptable joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Section 7.11 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 



 

(a) The certificate of formation and bylaws of the Surviving Entity and each
of its Subsidiaries shall, for a period of six years after the Effective Time,

Subsidiaries prior to the Effective Time and (ii) provide each Affected
Participant, upon presentment of appropriate documentation such as
explanations of benefits statements with credit for any co-payments and
deductibles paid during the plan year or policy year, as applicable, in which
the Effective Time occurs (or, if later, the plan year or policy year in which
a Company Benefit Plan is terminated to the extent such Company Benefit Plan

purposes of satisfying any analogous deductible or out-of-pocket requirements

Date, and the Company shall take all commercially reasonable actions to ensure
that no Company Qualified Plans, other than the Dawson 401(k), are
established, maintained or contributed to, or are otherwise required to be
contributed to, by the Company as of such time. Parent shall confirm to the
Company no later than such time that is immediately prior to the Closing Date
that such Parent Qualified Plans are terminated. The parties hereto shall take
all necessary and legally permissible actions in order to cause Parent
Qualified Plans to distribute the account balances thereunder for each
individual who participated in such Parent Qualified Plans (" **Covered
Participants** ") as soon as practicable following the Closing Date, and,
subject to Applicable Law, the consent of the Covered Participants, and the
terms of the Dawson 401(k) as assumed and sponsored by the Parent post-Closing
(the " **Post-Closing Plan** "), to accomplish the rollover of the account
balances and outstanding loan balances, if any, with respect to the Covered
Participants, if such Covered Participants so elect, on account of the
transactions contemplated herein to the Post-Closing Plan as soon as
practicable following the Closing Date. In addition, prior to December 1, 2014
and effective as of January 1, 2015, the Company shall amend the Dawson 401(k)

required pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)(i)_ or the payment of a fee by Parent is
required pursuant to _Section 9.5(b)(i)_, and such party has already
reimbursed Parent or the Company, respectively, for its third party costs and
expenses pursuant to _Section 9.5(c)_ or _Section 9.5(d)_, the amount of
such costs and expenses so reimbursed will be offset against the fee payable.

 



 

(f) Each party acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this
_Section 9.5_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the other parties hereto would
not enter into this Agreement. Each party further acknowledges and agrees that
the fee contemplated by this _Section 9.5_ is not a penalty, but rather
liquidated damages in amounts reasonably estimated by the parties to
compensate the other party for efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 



       
 

 



 

Accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to pay the amount due pursuant to
this _Section 9.5_ , and, in order to obtain such payment, the other party
commences a suit that results in a judgment for a fee payable pursuant to this
_Section 9.5_ , such party shall also reimburse the other partyÂ’s costs and
expenses (including attorneysÂ’ fees and expenses) in connection with such
suit, together with interest on the amount of such fee from the date such
payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime lending
rate prevailing during such period as published in _The Wall Street Journal_.
Any payment to be made under this _Section 9.5_ shall be made by wire transfer
of same-day funds.

 



 

(g) Each party agrees that in the event that a termination fee is paid
pursuant to _Section 9.5(a)_ or _Section 9.5(b)_ , the payment of such
termination fee shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the party to which
such fee is paid, its Subsidiaries and any of its respective shareholders,
Affiliates, officers, directors, employees or Representatives (collectively, "
**Related Persons** "), and in no event will the party to which such fee is
paid or any of its Related Persons be entitled to recover any other money
damages or any other remedy based on a claim in law or equity with respect to,
(i) any loss suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be
consummated, (ii) the termination of this Agreement, (iii) any liabilities or
obligations arising under this Agreement, or (iv) any Proceedings arising out
of or relating to any breach, termination or failure of or under this
Agreement, and upon payment to the Company or Parent, as applicable, such
other party shall not have any further liability or obligation to the party
that paid such termination fee or any of its Related Persons relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(h) In the event of termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the
Merger pursuant to _Section 9.1_ through _Section 9.4_ , this Agreement shall
forthwith become null and void and all obligations of the parties hereto and
their Related Persons shall terminate, except the obligations of the parties
pursuant to this Section 9.5, the last sentence of _Section 7.6_ , _Section
7.10_ and Article X; _provided_ , that, except as provided in _Section 9.5(g)_
, nothing herein shall relieve any party from any liability arising out of
actual fraud or for any willful and material breach by such party of any of
its representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement, and all rights and remedies of the nonbreaching party under this
Agreement, at law or in equity, shall be preserved. The Confidentiality
Agreement shall survive any termination of this Agreement, and the provisions
of such Confidentiality Agreement shall apply to all information and material
delivered by any party hereunder.

 



 

Section 9.6 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, each
party may by action taken by its Board of Directors (or by any duly authorized
committee thereof), to the extent legally allowed, (a) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other parties
hereto, (b) waive in whole or in part any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties made to such party contained herein or in any document
delivered pursuant hereto and (c) waive in whole or in part compliance with
any of the agreements or conditions for the benefit of such party contained
herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or
waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of such party. Except as provided in this Agreement, no action taken
pursuant to this Agreement, including any investigation by or on behalf of any
party, or delay or omission in the exercise of any right, power or remedy
accruing to any party as a result of any breach or default hereunder by any
other party, shall be

 



      
 

 



 

deemed to impair any such right, power or remedy, nor will it be deemed to
constitute a waiver by the party taking such action of compliance with any
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this
Agreement. The waiver by any party hereto of a breach of any provision
hereunder shall not operate or be construed as a waiver of any prior or
subsequent breach of the same or any other provision hereunder.

_Sections 3.1_ , _Section 3.2_ , _Section 7.10_ , _Section 7.11_ , _Section
7.14_ and this Article X shall survive the Merger. After a representation and

would have been entitled to that relief on the basis of that representation
and warranty prior to its termination and expiration.

Agreement, the Company Disclosure Letter, the Parent Disclosure Letter, the
Confidentiality Agreement and any documents delivered by the parties in
connection herewith constitute the entire agreement among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect thereto,

Section 10.5 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto, by action taken or authorized by their Boards of Directors, at any
time before or after approval of matters presented in connection with the
Merger by the shareholders of the Company or Parent, but after any such

amendment or modification hereto must be in a written document each party has
executed and delivered to the other parties.

the conflicts of law provisions thereof that would cause the laws of any other
jurisdiction to apply.

trial by jury in respect of any litigation directly or indirectly arising or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 



 

Section 10.12 _No Recourse_. This Agreement may only be enforced against, and
