 **MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT**

 



 

This MEMBERSHIP INTEREST PURCHASE AGREEMENT dated as of December 11, 2017
(this " ** _Agreement_** "), is by and between Acton Resources Holdings LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company (" ** _Seller_** "), and Williams Scotsman
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" ** _Buyer_** "). Capitalized
terms used in this Agreement are defined in _ARTICLE XII_. Seller and Buyer
are referred to herein individually as a " ** _Party_** " and, collectively,
as " ** _Parties_**."

 



 

 _RECITALS_ :

 



 

A. Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding membership interests (the "
** _Membership Interests_** ") of Acton Mobile Holdings, LLC, a Delaware
limited liability company (" ** _Acton Holdings_** ").

 



 

B. Acton Holdings owns all of the issued and outstanding membership interests
of New Acton Mobile Industries LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the
" ** _Company_** " and, together with Acton Holdings, the " ** _Acquired
Entities_** ").

 



 

C. Seller desires to sell to Buyer, and Buyer desires to purchase from Seller,
the Membership Interests, subject to the terms and conditions set forth
herein.

 



 

D. As a condition and material inducement to the execution and delivery of
this Agreement by Buyer, Prophet Equity II-B (Acton AIV), LP, a Delaware
limited partnership (" ** _Guarantor_** "), shall execute and deliver to
Buyer, simultaneously with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, a
guarantee, in the form attached hereto as **_Exhibit A_** (the " **
_Guarantee_** "), pursuant to which, and subject to the terms and conditions
thereof, Guarantor will guarantee the indemnification obligations of Seller
set forth in _ARTICLE XI_ hereof.

 



 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and of the respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, and
other good and valuable consideration, the receipt, adequacy and sufficiency
of which are hereby acknowledged, the Parties hereto agree as follows:

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE I_**

 



 

 ** _Transactions_**

 



 

1.1 _Purchase and Sale_. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, Seller shall sell, assign, transfer, convey and
deliver to Buyer, and Buyer shall purchase from Seller, the Membership
Interests, free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Encumbrances created
by Buyer or those arising under applicable securities laws.

 



 

1.2 _Purchase Price_. The aggregate purchase price for the Membership
Interests shall be $235,000,000.00 (the " ** _Purchase Price_** "), subject to
the adjustments if required pursuant to _Section 1.3_.

 



 

1.3 _Purchase Price Adjustments and Payment._

 



 

(a) At least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall deliver
to Buyer a written statement (the " ** _Estimated Statement_** ") setting
forth in reasonable detail Sellers good faith estimate of the Working
Capital, prepared consistent with the Accounting Principles, Cash and

      
 

 



 

Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness and Transaction Expenses, in each case as of
the Closing Date and including reasonable supporting schedules and data to
support such calculations.

 



 

(b) At the Closing, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted in the following
manner:

 



 

(i) in the event that the estimated Working Capital, as set forth on the
Estimated Statement, is more than the Target Amount, the Purchase Price shall
be increased by an amount equal to the estimated Working Capital minus the
Target Amount;

 



 

(ii) in the event that the estimated Working Capital, as set forth on the
Estimated Statement, is less than the Target Amount, the Purchase Price shall
be decreased by an amount equal to the Target Amount less the estimated
Working Capital;

 



 

(iii) the Purchase Price shall be increased by the Cash and Cash Equivalents
of the Acquired Entities as of the Closing Date;

 



 

(iv) the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the outstanding Indebtedness of
the Acquired Entities as of the Closing Date as specified in the Closing
Indebtedness Certificate;

 



 

(v) the Purchase Price shall be decreased by the amount of unpaid Transaction
Expenses of the Acquired Entities as of the Closing as specified in the
Closing Transaction Expense Certificate; and

 



 

(vi) the Four Million Dollars ($4,000,000.00) (the " ** _Cash Deposit_** "),
which Cash Deposit was paid to Seller on December 1, 2017 pursuant to the
terms and conditions of that certain letter agreement dated December 1, 2017
from Buyer to Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby,
shall be credited to the Purchase Price.

 



 

The net amount after giving effect to the adjustments listed above shall be
the " ** _Closing Date Payment_** _._ "

 



 

(c) _Payment at Closing_. At the Closing, Buyer shall pay:

 



 

(i) the Indebtedness of the Acquired Entities to be paid at Closing as set
forth in the Payoff Letter, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to
the accounts and in the amounts specified on the Closing Indebtedness
Certificate;

 



 

(ii) the Transaction Expenses that are unpaid at Closing, by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the accounts and in the amounts specified on
the Closing Transaction Expense Certificate; and

 



 

(iii) the Closing Date Payment to Seller by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account or accounts specified by Seller to Buyer prior
to the Closing.

 



 

(d) _Closing Statement_. Within 45 days following the Closing Date, Buyer
shall prepare and deliver to Seller a statement of Buyers calculation of
actual Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses as of the Closing Date together with all schedules and
data as may be appropriate to support such calculation (the " ** _Closing
Statement_** "). The calculation of Working Capital included in the Closing
Statement shall be prepared consistent with the Accounting Principles, and the
Closing Statement shall include in separate identifiable line items Buyers
calculation of Working Capital, Cash and Cash Equivalents, Indebtedness and
Transaction Expenses. The parties agree that the purpose of preparing the
Closing Statement and determining the

 



      
 

 



 

actual Working Capital and the related Purchase Price adjustment contemplated
by this _Section 1.3_ is to measure changes in the items comprising Working
Capital, and such processes are not intended to permit the introduction of
different judgments, accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications or estimation methodologies than currently used by
Seller for the purpose of preparing the Closing Statement or determining
Working Capital. In connection with Sellers review of the Closing Statement,
Seller and its Representatives shall have reasonable access to the Companys
books and records and all relevant work papers, schedules, memoranda and other
documents prepared by Buyer or any of its Affiliates or Representatives in
connection with, or supporting, Buyers preparation of the Closing Statement,
and to finance personnel of Buyer and any of its Affiliates and any other
information which Seller reasonably requests, and Buyer shall, and shall cause
its Affiliates to, cooperate reasonably with Seller and its Representatives in
connection therewith.

 



 

(e) _Disputes_. Seller may dispute the Closing Statement and shall notify
Buyer in writing of each disputed item, specifying the amount thereof in
dispute and setting forth, in reasonable detail, the nature of such dispute
and the basis therefor, within 30 days following Sellers receipt of the
Closing Statement from Buyer (the " ** _Dispute Notice_** "). In the event of
such a dispute, Seller and Buyer shall in good faith attempt to resolve any
such dispute, and any resolution by them as to any disputed amounts shall be
final, binding and conclusive on the parties hereto. If the parties are unable
to resolve any such dispute within 15 Business Days after the Dispute Notice
is given by Seller to Buyer, Seller or Buyer may submit the items remaining in
dispute (the " ** _Unresolved Disputes_** ") for resolution to the Independent
Accountant. Buyer and Seller shall jointly retain the Independent Accountant
to resolve the Unresolved Disputes. Promptly, but no later than 20 Business
Days after the Independent Accountant is engaged by Buyer and Seller, the
Independent Accountant shall determine, based solely on written presentations
by Seller and Buyer, and not by independent review, the Unresolved Disputes
and shall render a report as to the Unresolved Disputes and the resulting
computation of actual Working Capital which shall be final, binding and
conclusive on the parties, and shall be used to calculate the actual Purchase
Price. In resolving the Unresolved Disputes, the Independent Accountant shall
be bound by the provisions of this _Section 1.3_ and may not assign a value
greater than the greatest value, or lower than the lowest value, for such item
as provided by Seller in the Dispute Notice or Buyer in the Closing Statement,
as the case may be. The fees, costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant
(i) shall be borne by Seller in the proportion that the aggregate dollar
amount of such remaining disputed items so submitted that are unsuccessfully
disputed by Seller (as finally determined by the Independent Accountant) bears
to the aggregate dollar amount of such items so submitted and (ii) shall be
borne by Buyer in the proportion that the aggregate dollar amount of such
remaining disputed items so submitted that are successfully disputed by Seller
(as finally determined by the Independent Accountant) bears to the aggregate
dollar amount of such items so submitted, and the Independent Account shall
calculate the proportionate share of fees, costs and expenses allocable to
each of Buyer and Seller. Seller and Buyer each shall make available to the
other (upon the request of the other) their respective work papers generated
in connection with the preparation or review of the Closing Statement and
Seller shall have continued access to Company personnel and work papers
through the date of the Independent Accountants determination.

 



 

(f) _Purchase Price Adjustment and Payment_. The actual Working Capital shall
be deemed final for the purposes of this _Section 1.3_ upon the earliest of
(i) the failure of Seller to deliver the Dispute Notice, (ii) the resolution
of all disputes by Seller and Buyer pursuant to _Section 1.3(e)_, and (iii)
the resolution of all disputes by the Independent Accountant pursuant to
_Section 1.3(e)_. Within three Business Days of such amounts being deemed
final, the adjustment or adjustments of the Closing Date Payment shall be made
as follows:

 



 

(i) in the event that the actual Working Capital exceeds the Target Amount by
more than $250,000.00, Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to the actual
Working Capital minus the

 



      
 

 



 

Target Amount (plus any amounts that decreased the Purchase Price at Closing
in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)(ii)_, and less any amounts that increased
the Purchase Price at Closing in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)(i)_);

 



 

(ii) in the event that the actual Working Capital is less than the Target
Amount by more than $250,000.00, Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to
the Target Amount minus the actual Working Capital (plus any amounts that
increased the Purchase Price at Closing in accordance with _Section
1.3(b)(i)_, and less any amounts that decreased the Purchase Price at Closing
in accordance with _Section 1.3(b)(ii)_);

 



 

(iii) in the event that the Cash and Cash Equivalents of the Acquired Entities
is (a) greater than the Cash and Cash Equivalents as of the Closing as
determined for purposes of _Section 1.3(b)(iii)_, then Buyer shall pay to
Seller an amount equal to such increase, and (b) less than the Cash and Cash
Equivalents as of the Closing as determined for purposes of _Section
1.3(b)(iii)_, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such decrease;

 



 

(iv) in the event that the Indebtedness of the Acquired Entities is (a)
greater than the Indebtedness as of the Closing as determined for purposes of
_Section 1.3(b)(iv)_, then Seller shall pay to Buyer an amount equal to such
increase, and (b) less than the Indebtedness as of the Closing as determined
for purposes of _Section 1.3(b)(iv)_, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an
amount equal to such decrease; and

 



 

(v) in the event that the unpaid Transaction Expenses of the Acquired Entities
is (a) greater than the unpaid Transaction Expenses as of the Closing as
determined for purposes of _Section 1.3(b)(v)_, then Seller shall pay to
Buyer an amount equal to such increase, and (b) less than the unpaid
Transaction Expenses as of the Closing as determined for purposes of _Section
1.3(b)(v)_, then Buyer shall pay to Seller an amount equal to such decrease.

 



 

Such payments, in the case of a payment to be made by Seller, shall be made,
within three Business Days of the determination of any such adjustment, to
Buyer by wire transfer in immediately available funds to an account or
accounts designated by Buyer, and, in the case of a payment to be made by
Buyer, shall be made, within three Business Days of the determination of any
such adjustment, to Seller by wire transfer in immediately available funds to
an account or accounts designated by Seller.

 



 

1.4 _Closing_. The closing of the transactions contemplated hereby (the " **
_Closing_** ") shall occur within three Business Days after the date on which
all of the conditions (except those conditions that are to be satisfied at
Closing) set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ and _ARTICLE VII_ have been satisfied or
waived, with such Closing taking place remotely via the exchange of documents
and signatures, or at such other place, date and time as the parties shall
mutually agree in writing; provided, that Buyer agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts to close the transactions contemplated hereby as soon as
commercially practicable, but in no event shall the Closing occur before
December 22, 2017 without Buyers prior written consent. The day of which the
Closing actually occurs is referred to herein as the " ** _Closing Date_** _._
" The delivery of all documents and the performance of all acts at the Closing
shall be deemed to have occurred or to have been taken simultaneously, and the
Closing shall be deemed to be effective as of the close of business (local
time in Dallas, Texas) on the Closing Date.

 



      
 

 



 

1.5 _Closing Deliveries_.

 ** _REPRESENTATIONS and WARRANTIES OF SELLER_**

 



 

Seller hereby represents and warrants to Buyer as of the date hereof, except
as otherwise set forth in (i) the section of the disclosure schedule delivered
by Seller to Buyer concurrently herewith (the " ** _Seller Disclosure
Schedule_** ") corresponding to such section in this _ARTICLE II_, or (ii) in
any other section of the Seller Disclosure Schedule to the extent it is
reasonably apparent from the face of such disclosure that such disclosure
qualifies such section in this _ARTICLE II_, as follows:

 



 

2.1 _Organization; Power and Authority; and Qualification_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Acquired Entities is a limited liability company duly
organized, validly existing, and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Delaware and has all requisite entity power and authority to own, lease and
operate the properties and assets it currently owns or leases and to carry on
the Acton Business as it is currently conducted by it.

 



 

(b) Each of the Acquired Entities is duly licensed or qualified to do business
as a foreign entity in all jurisdictions in which the character of the
properties and assets now owned or leased by it or the nature of the business
now conducted by it requires it to be so licensed or qualified, except, in
each case, where the failure to be so qualified or licensed would not,
individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. _Section 2.1(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth
a complete list of jurisdictions in which each Acquired Entity is authorized
to do business.

 



 

(c) True and complete copies of the Governing Documents of each Acquired
Entity have been made available to Buyer prior to the date hereof, in each
case as currently in effect, and no subsequent action has been taken to amend
or modify any of the Governing Documents of the Acquired Entities. All such
Governing Documents are in full force and effect, no other organizational
documents are applicable to or binding upon the Acquired Entities and no
Acquired Entity is in material violation of any of the provisions of its
Governing Documents.

 



      
 

 



 

2.2 _Seller s Organization; Power and Authority and Approval_. Seller is a
limited liability company duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the Laws of the State of Delaware. Seller has all requisite
limited liability company power and authority to enter into, and perform its
obligations under, this Agreement and the Transaction Documents to which it is
a party. The execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement and each
Transaction Document to which it is a party, and the performance by Seller of
its obligations hereunder and thereunder, have been duly authorized by all
requisite limited liability company action on the part of Seller. This
Agreement has been, and each Transaction Document to which Seller is a party
upon the execution and delivery by Seller thereof will be, duly executed and
delivered by Seller and (assuming the valid authorization, execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Buyer and of the Transaction Documents by each
other party thereto) constitutes a valid and binding obligation of Seller
enforceable against Seller in accordance with its terms, except to the extent
such enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
fraudulent conveyance, moratorium or other similar Laws relating to or
affecting creditors rights generally and by general principles of equity
(regardless of whether enforcement is considered in a Proceeding in equity or
at law).

 



 

2.3 _Capitalization_. Seller is the record and beneficial owner of all of the
Membership Interests. The Company is wholly-owned by Acton Holdings. Other
than the Membership Interests, there are no other equity securities of Acton
Holdings issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. Other than the equity
interests held by Acton Holdings, there are no other equity securities of the
Company issued, reserved for issuance or outstanding. There are no securities
outstanding convertible into, exchangeable for or carrying the right to
acquire, at any time, or any voting agreements with respect to, any equity
securities of the Acquired Entities or any subscriptions, warrants, options,
rights or other arrangements obligating the Acquired Entities to issue or
acquire any of their respective equity securities or securities convertible
into or exchangeable for equity securities of the Acquired Entities. Except as
contemplated by this Agreement or set forth on _Schedule 2.3_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, there are no obligations of any Acquired Entity to make
any payment to any Person, including any holder of any equity securities of
the Acquired Entities, based upon or related to the value of any equity
securities of the Acquired Entities. Other than Acton Holdings ownership of
the Company, neither Acton Holdings nor the Company, directly or indirectly,
owns any equity or similar interest in, or any interest convertible into,
exchangeable for, or carrying the rights to acquire, any equity or similar
interest in, any corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint
venture or other business association or entity.

 



 

2.4 _Title to Membership Interests_. The Membership Interests have been duly
authorized, validly issued in compliance with all applicable securities Laws
or exemptions therefrom and are fully paid and non-assessable. Seller has
good, valid and marketable title to all of the Membership Interests free and
clear of all Encumbrances other than those arising under applicable securities
Laws and Encumbrances existing in connection with Indebtedness of the Acquired
Entities, which Encumbrances will be released at Closing.

 



 

2.5 _Governmental Consents_. No material consent, approval, waiver, or
authorization of, or exemption by, or filing with any Governmental Authority
(a " ** _Governmental Consent_** ") is required in connection with the
execution and delivery by Seller of this Agreement or any Transaction Document
to which it is a party or the performance by it of its obligations hereunder
or thereunder (excluding Governmental Consents, if any, which Buyer is
required to obtain or make, as to which no representations or warranties are
made by Seller), except for such filings as may be required under the HSR Act.

 



 

2.6 _No Conflicts_. Except as set forth on _Section 2.6_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, the execution and delivery of, and performance by Seller
of its obligations under, this Agreement and each Transaction Document to
which it is a party will not, with or without the giving of notice or the
lapse of time, or both, subject to obtaining any Governmental Consents
referred to in _Section 2.5_:

Acquired Entities;

 



 

(b) violate any Law or Order applicable to Seller or the Acquired Entities;

2.7 Financial Statements.

 



 

(a) Seller has delivered to Buyer unaudited financial statements consisting of
copies of the balance sheet of the Company (the " ** _Interim Balance Sheet_**
") as at September 30, 2017 (the " ** _Interim Balance Sheet Date_** ") and
the related statements of income and retained earnings and cash flows for the
period then ended, and the audited financial statements of the Company
consisting of the balance sheet of the Company as at December 31, 2016, the
related statements of income and retained earnings equity and cash flows for
the year then ended (collectively, the " ** _Financial Statements_** "). The
relevant Financial Statements reflect in all material respects the financial
position and results of operations of the Company as at the respective dates
indicated and for the respective periods then ended in conformity with GAAP
applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods covered thereby except
(i) for the adjustments disclosed in _Section 2.7_ of the Seller Disclosure
Schedule or in the Financial Statements, (ii) in the case of the interim
Financial Statements, for the absence of notes and other presentation items
thereto and (iii) that, in the case of the interim Financial Statements, such
interim Financial Statements are prepared consistent with historical reporting
practices and are subject to normal year-end adjustments that will not be
material.

 



 

(b) The Company maintains materially accurate books and records reflecting its
assets and liabilities and maintains proper and adequate internal accounting
controls that provide reasonable assurance that (i) material transactions are
executed with managements authorization, (ii) transactions are recorded as
necessary to permit preparation of the financial statements of the Company in
accordance with GAAP and to maintain accountability for the Companys assets,
(iii) the reporting of the Companys assets is compared with existing assets
at regular intervals and (iv) material accounts and other material receivables
and inventory are recorded in good faith and reserves established against them
based upon actual prior experience and in accordance with GAAP, and proper
procedures are implemented for the collection thereof on a commercially
reasonable basis. To the Knowledge of Seller, there are no material weaknesses
in the design or operation of the Companys internal control structure and
procedures over financial reporting. Seller has heretofore made available to
the Buyer a true and complete copy of any material disclosure (or, if
unwritten, a summary thereof) by any Representative of the Company to the
Companys independent auditors relating to (x) any significant deficiencies in
the design or operation of internal controls that could materially adversely
affect the ability of the Company to record, process, summarize and report
financial data and any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any
fraud, whether or not material, that involves management or other employees
who have a significant role in the internal control over financial reporting
of the Company.

 



 

(c) The Company possesses books and records that contain all material
financial and other information from the date of its inception through the
date hereof necessary for the preparation of financial statements.

 



      
 

 



 

(d) All accounts receivable reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet represent
bona fide, current and valid obligations arising from sales actually made or
services actually performed in the ordinary course of business, subject to any
reserves reflected in the Interim Balance Sheet. Since the Interim Balance
Sheet Date, neither Seller nor any of the Acquired Entities has received
written notice from any obligor of any accounts receivable that such obligor
is refusing to pay or contesting payment other than for any disputes not
exceeding $100,000.

 



 

2.8 _Undisclosed Liabilities_. The Acquired Entities do not have any
liabilities or obligations (accrued, contingent or otherwise) of the nature
that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a balance sheet of the
Company, other than liabilities (i) adequately reflected or adequately
reserved against in the Financial Statements; (ii) disclosed or referred to in
the Seller Disclosure Schedule (or created by, or arising from, the documents
listed therein); (iii) as to which no disclosure is required pursuant to this
_ARTICLE II_ (for example, because the making of the representation and
warranty is disclaimed or because the liability involves an amount which is
less than the threshold above which disclosure is required); (iv) arising
since the Interim Balance Sheet Date in the Ordinary Course; (v) that,
individually or in the aggregate, are not material to the Acton Business; or
(vi) as set forth on _Section 2.8_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule.

 



 

2.9 _Absence of Certain Changes or Events_. Except as permitted or
contemplated by this Agreement or disclosed on _Schedule 2.9_ in the Seller
Disclosure Schedule, (i) since December 31, 2016, neither of the Acquired
Entities has (a) suffered any material damage, destruction or casualty loss to
its physical properties taken as a whole, (b) entered into any other
transaction except in the Ordinary Course and except for transactions that
would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, or (c) suffered any events, developments, occurrences
or changes that, individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect; or (ii) since the Interim Balance
Sheet Date taken any action that would constitute a breach of _Section 4.2_
of this Agreement had such action been taken after the execution of this
Agreement and prior to the Closing Date or termination date of this Agreement.

 



 

2.10 _Title to Assets_. Each of the Acquired Entities has good and valid title
to, a valid leasehold interest in, or an enforceable right to use, all of the
material assets, equipment and other tangible personal property that it
purports to own (including such property reflected on the Interim Balance
Sheet) or uses in the conduct of the Acton Business, free and clear of all
Encumbrances, other than Permitted Encumbrances. All of such tangible assets
and property owned or leased are, in all material respects, in good and
working condition, reasonable wear and tear excepted, and are adequate for the
use to which they are being put. To Sellers Knowledge, there are no physical
conditions affecting any of the material assets and property of the Acquired
Entities which would, individually or in the aggregate, interfere in any
material respect with the use or occupancy of such assets and property or any
portion thereof in the operation of the Acton Business as currently conducted.
The representations and warranties set forth in this _Section 2.10_ do not
address Intellectual Property which is solely and exclusively addressed by
_Section 2.12_.

 



 

2.11 _Sufficiency of Assets_. The assets and properties of the Acquired
Entities, including the assets and properties used or held by either of them
pursuant to leases, licenses and other Contracts, including all of the assets
reflected on the Interim Balance Sheet or acquired in the Ordinary Course
since the Interim Balance Sheet Date, constitute all of the assets and
properties sufficient and necessary for the conduct of the Acton Business as
it is currently conducted.

 



      
 

 



 

2.12 _Intellectual Property_.

 



 

(a) Each of the Acquired Entities is the sole and exclusive owner of all
right, title and interest in and to, or has an enforceable right to use, all
material Intellectual Property used or held for use in the conduct of the
Acton Business as it is currently conducted (collectively, the " ** _Company
IP_** "), free and clear of all Encumbrances, other than Permitted
Encumbrances.

 



 

(b) _Section 2.12(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule contains an accurate
and complete list of all registered and applied for Intellectual Property
which is owned by the Acquired Entities or used by the Acton Business
(collectively, the " ** _Registered IP_** ").

 



 

(c) All Registered IP is subsisting, valid and enforceable. The Acquired
Entities have taken all reasonable and necessary steps to maintain and enforce
the Company IP, and preserve the confidentiality of all Trade Secrets included
therein. After consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, neither Seller nor any current or former Affiliate of Seller (other
than the Acquired Companies) will own or have any right, title or interest in
or to any Company IP. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement will not result in the loss or impairment of or payment of any
additional amounts with respect to, nor require the consent of any other
Person in respect of, the Acquired Companies right to own or use any Company
IP.

 



 

(d) To Sellers Knowledge, (i) no Person has infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated any Company IP, and (ii) each of the Acquired Entities, the
conduct of the Acton Business as currently and formerly conducted, and the
products and services of the Acquired Entities, have not infringed,
misappropriated or otherwise violated the Intellectual Property rights of any
Person. No Proceedings (including any opposition, cancellation, review or
other Proceedings) are settled or pending or, to Sellers Knowledge,
threatened (including any offers to take a license), (x) alleging that either
or both of the Acquired Entities has infringed, misappropriated or otherwise
violated the Intellectual Property rights of any Person, (y) challenging the
validity, enforceability, registrability or ownership of any Company IP, or
(z) alleging that any Person infringed, misappropriated or otherwise violated
any Company IP.

 



 

(e) To Sellers Knowledge, the information technology systems (including any
outsourced systems) used by the Acquired Companies in the Ordinary Course have
not suffered any material security breach or material failure. Each Acquired
Company is in compliance with all binding policies implemented by such
Acquired Company and all applicable Laws, in each case, relating to privacy,
data protection, the payment card industry and the collection, use, storage,
transfer, disclosure and protection of personal information. There are no
settled or pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened claims against any of
the Acquired Companies by any Person or Governmental Authority alleging a
material violation of any such policies or applicable Laws.

 



 

2.13 _Real Property_.

 



 

(a) Neither of the Acquired Entities owns any real property. _Section
2.13(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule sets forth a list of all leases,
subleases, grants or licenses with respect to real property (each, a " **
_Real Property Lease_** ") pursuant to which any Acquired Entity is a party,
together with corresponding street address of all such leased real property
(collectively, the " ** _Leased Real Property_** "). A true and complete copy
of each written Real Property Lease (including all modifications, amendments,
renewals and extensions thereto), and a written summary of the material terms
of any oral Real Property Lease, in each case, as in effect on the date
hereof, has been made available prior to the date hereof to Buyer and there
have been no amendments, modifications or extensions of such Real Property
Leases other than those set forth on _Section 2.13(a)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule. The Leased Real Property constitutes all real property
used or held for use by the Acquired Entities in the operation of the Acton

 



       
 

 



 

Business as currently operated. The Acquired Entities have a valid leasehold
interest in each parcel of Leased Real Property.

_Section 2.13(b)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule:

under any Real Property Lease, and no default by any Acquired Entity or, to

such Real Property Lease materially disturbed and, to the Knowledge of the
Seller, there are no material disputes with respect to any of the Real
Property Leases;

parties thereto, has performed in all material respects all material
obligations required to be performed by it under each Real Property Lease;

 



 

(v) no security deposit or portion thereof deposited with respect to such
lease has been applied in respect of a breach or default under such lease
which has not been re-deposited in full;

 



 

(vi) no Acquired Entity is a party to any written or oral subleases,
assignments, licenses, or other contracts granting to any Person other than an
Acquired Entity the right to use or occupy any Leased Real Property, nor has
such Acquired Entity collaterally assigned or granted any other security
interest in any of the Real Property Leases or any interest therein other than
security interests to be released upon repaying of Indebtedness at the
Closing; and

 



 

(vii) no Acquired Entity is a party to any outstanding options or rights of
first refusal to purchase all or a portion of such Leased Real Property which
is subject to a Real Property Lease.

mechanical defects in any of the buildings, building systems or improvements
on any of the Leased Real Property which materially impair the use of such
Leased Real Property, and (ii) all such buildings, building systems and
improvements (including the roof, HVAC, electrical, plumbing, sprinklers and
fire safety systems) are in good operating condition and repair and are
adequate for the uses to which they are being put. Except as disclosed on
_Section 2.13(c)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, within the last 12
months, neither Seller nor any Acquired Entity has received written notice of
any pending or threatened in writing condemnation or eminent domain
proceedings or their local equivalent affecting or relating to such Leased
Real Property.

the Knowledge of Seller, as of the date hereof, neither Seller nor any
Acquired Entity has received any written claim or notice of material breach of

compliance in all material respects with Environmental Laws.

 



 

(b) The Acquired Entities have not Released Hazardous Materials at the Leased
Real Property nor, to Sellers Knowledge, at any former property or third-
party property, nor, to Sellers Knowledge, has any third party Released
Hazardous Materials at any Leased Real Property, whereby such Hazardous
Material would reasonably be expected to require an Acquired Entity to conduct
or fund material remediation of the Hazardous Materials or result in an
Acquired Entity becoming subject to any other material obligation or liability
pursuant to Environmental Law.

 



 

(c) No Acquired Entity nor to Sellers Knowledge, any Leased Real Property to
the extent it would affect the operations of an Acquired Entity, is subject to

Leased Real Property. No Action is pending or, to the Sellers Knowledge,
threatened in writing to revoke, suspend, cancel or adversely modify any
material Environmental Permit. The transactions contemplated by this Agreement

termination or cancellation of any Environmental Permits.

 



 

(e) There are no pending or, to Sellers Knowledge, threatened in writing
Proceedings against or affecting the Acquired Entities pursuant to or under

(h) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, this _Section
2.15_ contains the sole and exclusive representations and warranties of Seller
with respect to Environmental Laws, Environmental Permits, Releases of
Hazardous Materials or any other environmental matter, and no other statement

be a representation or warranty relating to Environmental Law, Environmental
Permits, Releases of Hazardous Materials or any other environmental matters.

 



 

2.16 _Compliance with Laws_. Each of the Acquired Entities is, and has been
since January 1, 2015, in compliance in all material respects with all Laws

Permits, and have made all required material declarations and filings with,
all Governmental Authorities required under applicable Law, necessary for the
Acquired Entities to own, lease and operate their respective properties and
assets and conduct the Acton Business as presently conducted. No Acquired
Entity is in material default or violation of any Permit to which it is a

negligence, or willful misconduct of any Acquired Entity or their respective
directors, officers, employees, Representatives or advisors or (z) a material
and uncured breach by the Seller of any of its obligations hereunder. For the
avoidance of doubt, the Parties acknowledge and agree that the provisions

the Acquired Entities and their respective Affiliates and Representatives with
respect to cooperation in connection with Buyers borrowing under its ABL
Facility.

 ** _ARTICLE V_**

 



 

 ** _COVENANTS OF BUYER_**

 



 

Buyer hereby covenants and agrees with Seller as follows:

 



      
 

 



 

5.1 _Cooperation by Buyer_.

 



 

(a) Except as specifically set forth in _Section 5.7_ hereof, prior to the
Closing, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all
approvals, and timely submit any notices or filings, required under any
applicable Law or Orders from or to any Governmental Authority in connection
with the purchase of the Membership Interests by Buyer from Seller. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that certain consents, authorizations and approvals to
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement may be required from parties
to Contracts to which an Acquired Entity is a party and such consents,
authorizations and approvals have not been obtained. Prior to the Closing,
Buyer shall assist Seller and the Acquired Entities in obtaining such
consents, authorizations and approvals; __provided__ , that, except as
specifically set forth in _Section 5.7_ hereof, the failure to obtain any
such consent, authorization or approval shall not delay or prevent the Closing
(including by application of _ARTICLE VI_). For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer
agrees that (i) neither Seller nor any of its Affiliates or Representatives
shall have any liability whatsoever to Buyer or any of its respective
Affiliates arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any consents,
authorizations or approvals that may have been or may be required in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or because of
the default, acceleration or termination of any such contract, lease, license
or other agreement as a result thereof and (ii) no representation, warranty or
covenant of Acton Holdings, the Company or Seller contained herein shall be
breached or deemed breached as a result of the failure to obtain any consent,
authorization or approval or as a result of any such default, acceleration or
termination or any Proceeding commenced or threatened in writing by or on
behalf of any Person arising out of or relating to the failure to obtain any
consent, authorization or approval or any such default, acceleration or
termination.

 



 

(b) From the date hereof and prior to the Closing, Buyer agrees that it shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions
necessary, proper or advisable to defend against any Proceedings by any
Governmental Authority challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and seeking to vacate or reverse any
temporary restraining order, preliminary injunction or other legal restraint
or prohibition entered or imposed by any Governmental Authority that is not
yet final and non-appealable.

 



 

(c) From the date hereof through the Closing Date, neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates shall interfere with the conduct of the Acton Business or with
Sellers, Acton Holdings, or the Companys relationships with their
respective employees. Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer shall not, without
the prior written approval of the Due Diligence Manager contact any employee,
customer, supplier or landlord of the Acton Business or any other Person which
has a business relationship with the Acton Business.

 



 

5.2 _Preservation of Books and Records_.

 



 

(a) For a period ending upon the later of (i) seven years from the end of the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs or (ii) the expiration of any
applicable statute of limitations, including any extensions thereof (the " **
_Information Maintenance Period_** "):

 



 

(i) Buyer shall not dispose of or destroy any of the books and records of the
Acquired Entities or the Acton Business relating to periods prior to the
Closing (" ** _Books and Records_** ") without first offering to turn over
possession thereof to Seller by written notice to Seller at least 90 days
prior to the proposed date of such disposition or destruction;

 



 

(ii) Buyer shall allow Seller and its agents and Representatives access to all
Books and Records on reasonable notice and at reasonable times in connection
with any Tax claim, Tax Proceeding or other investigation by a Governmental
Entity, any claim by or against a third party or any other proper purpose (but
excluding in connection with any claim or dispute among the Parties hereto,
other than as contemplated by _Section 1.3_) at Buyers principal place of
business or at any location where

 



      
 

 



 

any Books and Records are stored, and Seller shall have the right (at Sellers
own expense) to make copies of any such Books and Records; _provided_ , that
any such access or copying shall be had or done in such a manner so as not to
unreasonably disrupt or unduly interfere with the normal conduct of business
or operations of the Acquired Entities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer
may restrict the foregoing access solely to the extent that in the reasonable
judgment of Buyer, based on the advice of legal counsel, any Law applicable to
Buyer or any Acquired Entity requires it to restrict access to any such
information of the Acquired Entities and in no event shall any Acquired Entity
be required to provide any documents or other information covered by attorney-
client privilege, the attorney work product doctrine or other similar
protection (provided that Buyer and the Acquired Entities shall use reasonable
efforts to provide extracts or summaries of such protected information or to
otherwise provide such protected information in a manner that does not
jeopardize the applicable protection); and

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make available to
Seller upon reasonable advanced written notice and at times and locations
convenient to Buyer: (1) Buyers personnel to reasonably assist Seller in
locating and obtaining any Books and Records, and (2) any of Buyers personnel
whose assistance or participation is reasonably required by Seller or its
Affiliates in anticipation of or preparation for, or for depositions or
testimony in, existing or future litigation or other matters in which Seller
or any of its Affiliates is involved. Seller shall reimburse Buyer for the
reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred by it in performing
the covenants contained in this Section 5.2(a).

 



 

(b) The Information Maintenance Period shall be extended in the event that any
litigation or investigation has been commenced or is pending or threatened in
writing at the termination of such Information Maintenance Period, and such
extension shall continue until any such litigation or investigation has been
settled through judgment or otherwise or is no longer pending or threatened in
writing.

 



 

5.3 _Insurance_. Buyer shall not and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Acquired Entities after the Closing) not to assert, by way of claim,
litigation or otherwise, any right to any insurance policies of Seller or its
Affiliates or any benefit thereunder; provided, however, that this provision
shall not apply to insurance policies maintained by the Acquired Entities
after the Closing. Seller and its Affiliates shall retain all right, title and
interest under all insurance policies of Seller and its Affiliates.

 



 

5.4 _Indemnity; Directors  and Officers Insurance; Fiduciary and Employee
Benefits Insurance_.

 



 

(a) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Acquired Entities to, ensure that all rights to indemnification and
exculpation existing as of the Closing in favor of any individual who, at or
prior to the Closing Date, was a director, manager, officer, member, trustee
or fiduciary of any of the Acquired Entities or who, at the request of any of
the applicable Acquired Entities, served as a director, manager, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(collectively, with such individuals heirs, executors or administrators, the
" ** _Employee Indemnified Persons_** ") as provided in the respective
Governing Documents of each of the Acquired Entities and any indemnification
agreements by and between any Acquired Entities and any Employee Indemnified
Person shall be assumed by Buyer at the Closing and shall remain in full force
in accordance with their terms; __provided__ , that in the event any claim or
claims are asserted or made within such six year period, all rights to
indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall continue until
final disposition of any and all such claims. Buyer shall not, and Buyer shall
cause the Acquired Entities not to, settle, compromise or consent to the entry
of judgment in any claim related to an Employee Indemnified Person

 



      
 

 



 

or threatened in writing action or investigation against or involving any
Employee Indemnified Person without the written consent of such Employee
Indemnified Person.

 



 

(b) For a period of six years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, or shall
cause the Acquired Entities to, provide or maintain in effect through the
purchase of "run-off" coverage or otherwise, directors and officers and
corporate liability insurance covering those individuals who are covered by
the directors and officers and corporate liability insurance policy or
policies provided for directors, managers, officers, trustees or fiduciaries
of the Acquired Entities as of the date hereof (the " ** _Existing Policy_**
") on terms comparable in all material respects to the Existing Policy, with
the amount of coverage at least equal to that of the Existing Policies and
deductibles no larger than those of the Existing Policy.

 



 

(c) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Buyer and
the Acquired Entities contained in this _Section 5.4_ shall be binding upon
the successors and assigns of Buyer and the Acquired Entities. In the event
Buyer or any of the Acquired Entities, or any of their respective successors
or assigns, (i) consolidates with, merges into, or is otherwise acquired by,
any other Person, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties
or assets to any Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be
made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or any of the Acquired
Entities, as the case may be, honor the indemnification and other obligations
set forth in this _Section 5.4_.

 



 

(d) The obligations of Buyer and the Acquired Entities under this _Section
5.4_ shall survive the Closing and shall not be terminated or modified in such
a manner as to affect adversely any Employee Indemnified Person to whom this
_Section 5.4_ applies without the consent of such affected Employee
Indemnified Person (it being expressly agreed that the Employee Indemnified
Persons to whom this _Section 5.4_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries
of this _Section 5.4_). The provisions of this _Section 5.4_ are (i)
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Employee
Indemnified Person, his, her or its heirs and his or her Representatives, and
(ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by Law, Contract
or otherwise.

 



 

(e) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or shall
release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers insurance
claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with respect to any
of the Acquired Entities or any of their respective directors, managers,
officers, trustees or fiduciaries it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.4_ is not prior to or in
substitution for any such claims under such policies.

 



 

5.5 _Confidentiality_. Prior to the Closing and after any termination of this
Agreement, Buyer shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates, officers,
directors, managers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors
and agents to hold, in confidence, all Confidential Information (as that term
is defined in the Confidentiality Agreement) made available to Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, officers, directors, managers, employees, accountants,
counsel, consultants, advisors and agents, and Buyer shall comply with, and
shall cause all of its Affiliates, officers, directors, employees, managers,
accountants, counsel, consultants, advisors and agents to comply with, all of
its obligations under the Confidentiality Agreement, and, in such event, the
Confidentiality Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

 



 

5.6 _Buyer Actions_. Any acts or omissions of the Buyer, any of its Affiliates
or any party acting for the benefit or at the discretion of the Buyer or any
of its Affiliates before or after the date hereof or the Closing Date shall
not be the basis for a Material Adverse Effect, shall not be the basis upon
which the Buyers closing conditions set forth in _ARTICLE VI_ shall fail to
be satisfied and shall not excuse the Buyer from performing its obligations
under this Agreement and consummating the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



      
 

 



 

5.7 _Antitrust Laws_. If any Proceeding is initiated before or after Closing
by an Antitrust Authority that questions the validity or legality of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the ownership, control, operation or use
of the assets or businesses of Seller by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer under
the Antitrust Laws, or the applicability of the HSR Act to the transactions
contemplated hereby, Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts and
to take any and all steps necessary to resolve promptly any investigation and
to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any Antitrust Laws that
may be asserted by any Antitrust Authority or any other party under any
Antitrust Laws to resolve promptly any objection by any Antitrust Authority or
third party under any Antitrust Laws and, if applicable to enable the parties
hereto to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
possible but in no event later than the Outside Date, including proposing,
negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree, hold separate
orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of any of its
assets, properties or businesses or of the assets, properties or businesses to
be acquired or owned or controlled by Buyer or its Affiliates as are
reasonably necessary to be divested in order to terminate any investigation
prior to the Outside Date and to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order prior to the
Outside Date or other order in any Proceeding, which would otherwise have the
effect of materially delaying or preventing the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any
claim asserted in court by any party in order to avoid entry of, or to have
vacated or terminated, any Orders (whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent) that would prevent the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby by the Outside Date. Seller shall, at Buyers cost and
expense, take commercially reasonable efforts to provide to Buyer information
and documentary material as reasonably requested by Buyer in connection with
the foregoing. In the event any Proceedings are initiated prior to the
Closing, Buyer and Seller (at Buyers cost and expense) shall provide to each
other with: (i) prior notice of and an opportunity to participate in all
meetings, discussions and communications with an Antitrust Authority in
connection with the transactions; (ii) advance notice and an opportunity to
reasonably comment (without causing any undue burden or hardship) on all
submissions, memoranda, presentations and white papers submitted to an
Antitrust Authority in connection with the transactions; and (iii) notice
regarding and keep each other informed regarding any material communications
with an Antitrust Authority.

 



 

5.8 _Further Assurances_. At any time after the Closing Date, Buyer shall, at
Sellers expense and without incurring any legal liability beyond that
provided for in this Agreement, promptly execute, acknowledge and deliver any
other assurances or documents reasonably requested by Seller and necessary for
Seller to satisfy its obligations hereunder or obtain the benefits
contemplated hereby.

opportunities that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to the base
salaries or wages and bonus opportunities provided to such Acton Employees

incentive compensation plans), in each case after taking into account
individual compensation and benefits standards for similarly situated

Employees, and (iii) Buyer shall cause the Acquired Entities to ensure, and
the Acquired Entities immediately following the Closing agree to ensure, that
all Company Employees who were notified of their target bonuses for the

which such employees would be entitled under the applicable bonus arrangements
of the Acquired Entities as of the date hereof, provided that any such payment
shall take into account the amounts paid by Seller as set forth in (i) above,
and shall be dependent upon employees job performance and attendance.

 



      
 

 



 

(c) Following the Closing Date, Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to, or cause the Acquired Entities to, (i) waive limitations or
exclusions as to pre-existing conditions, evidence of insurability or good

plan or arrangement.

 



 

(f) _WARN Act_. Buyer shall be solely responsible for any liability or
obligation under the WARN Act or any similar law incurred or arising as a
result of the termination of any Company Employee or employee of any of the
Acquired Entities by Buyer or the Acquired Entities on or after the Closing
Date. Seller shall notify Buyer of the termination of employment of any
Company Employees in the 90 day period before Closing.

 ** _ARTICLE IX_**

 



 

 ** _TAXES_**

 



 

9.1 _Tax Returns_

 



 

(a) Seller shall, with respect to the Acquired Entities, at its sole cost and
expense, timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and filed,
all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that
are required to be filed after the Closing Date (the " ** _Seller Prepared
Returns_** "). Such Seller Prepared Returns shall be prepared in a manner
consistent with existing procedures and practices and accounting methods, and,
to the extent applicable, the conventions provided in _Sections 9.1(c)_ and
_9.1(d)_.

 



       
 

 



 

(b) Buyer shall timely prepare and file, or cause to be timely prepared and
filed, all Tax Returns of the Acquired Entities for any Post-Closing Tax
Period (the " ** _Buyer Prepared Returns_** "). Such Buyer Prepared Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with existing procedures and
practices and accounting methods, and, to the extent applicable, the
conventions provided in _Sections 9.1(c)_ and _9.1(d)_. At least 90 days
prior to the due date of any Buyer Prepared Return that relates to a Straddle
Period, Buyer shall provide a draft of such Tax Return to Seller for its
review and approval, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed. Buyer shall incorporate any reasonable comments made by Seller to
such Tax Return.

 



 

(c) Buyer shall not, and shall not allow the Acquired Entities to, amend any
Tax Return of the Acquired Entities for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle
Period or otherwise initiate, respond to, or agree to any other Seller Tax
Matter without the prior written consent of Seller except as otherwise
required by applicable Law.

 



 

(d) Buyer agrees that it shall not (and shall not allow the Acquired Entities
or any of its other Affiliates to) make any election to waive the carry back
of any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax credit incurred or
realized in a Pre-Closing Tax Period by either of the Acquired Entities and
Buyer shall not (and shall not allow the Acquired Entities or any of its other
Affiliates to) carry back any net operating loss or other Tax attribute or Tax
credit incurred or realized in a Post-Closing Tax Period to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period of either of the Acquired Entities.

 



 

9.2 _Apportionment of Taxes_. For purposes of this Agreement, if any Tax (or
Tax refund) relates to a Straddle Period (other than Transfer Taxes which
shall be allocated to Buyer in accordance with _Section 9.7_), the parties
shall use the following conventions for determining the portion of such Tax
(or Tax refund) that relates to a Pre-Closing Tax Period and the portion that
relates to a Post-Closing Tax Period:

 



 

(a) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis, the amount attributable to Sellers Pre-Closing Tax Period
shall equal the Taxes for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion of the
period ending on the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number
of calendar days in the entire Straddle Period; __provided__ , __however__ ,
if as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the value
of any asset is reassessed for purposes of determining the amount of any
property or other Tax, any resulting increase in Tax for such Straddle Period
shall be treated as being solely with respect to the portion of the Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date;

 



 

(b) in the case of all other Taxes (including income Taxes, sales Taxes,
employment Taxes and withholding Taxes), the amount attributable to Sellers
Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be determined as if the applicable Acquired
Entity or Seller filed a separate Tax Return with respect to such Taxes for
the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the close of business on the
Closing Date using a "closing of the books methodology";

 



 

(c) for purposes of this _Section 9.2_, exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis and annual property Taxes shall be
prorated on the basis of the number of days in the annual period elapsed as of
the close of business on the Closing Date as compared to the number of days in
the annual period elapsing after the Closing Date;

 



 

(d) all Taxes for a Straddle Period not specifically allocated to Sellers
Pre-Closing Tax Period pursuant to this _Section 9.2_ shall be allocated to
Buyers Post-Closing Tax Period;

 



      
 

 



 

(e) Buyer shall be obligated to reimburse Seller with respect to any Assumed
Taxes to the extent paid by Seller, and such reimbursement shall be made
within 30 business days following notification from Seller with respect to the
amount of Assumed Taxes paid by Seller and due from Buyer; and

 



 

(f) Seller shall be obligated to reimburse Buyer with respect to any Retained
Taxes to the extent paid by Buyer, and such reimbursement shall be made within
30 business days following notification from Buyer with respect to the amount
of Retained Taxes paid by Buyer and due from Seller.

 



 

9.3 _Refunds_.

 



 

(a) All refunds for any Retained Taxes (including all refunds of the Acquired
Entities for a Pre-Closing Tax Period or portion of any Straddle Period ending
on the Closing Date as determined pursuant to _Section 9.2_) whether in the
form of cash received or a credit (or offset) against Taxes otherwise payable
shall be for the benefit of Seller. To the extent that Buyer, Acton Holdings,
or the Company or any of their Affiliates receive a refund that is for the
benefit of Seller, Buyer shall pay the amount of such refund (and interest
received from the Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) to an
account or accounts designated by Seller. The amount due to Seller shall be
payable ten days after receipt of the refund from the applicable Governmental
Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of a credit or offset, ten days
after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such credit or offset). Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all commercially reasonable
actions requested by Seller to timely claim any refunds that will give rise to
a payment under this _Section 9.3_.

 



 

(b) All refunds for any Assumed Taxes (including all refunds of Acton Holdings
or the Company for a Post-Closing Tax Period (or portion of any Straddle
Period beginning after the Closing Date as determined pursuant to _Section
9.2_)) (whether in the form of cash received or a credit (or offset) against
Taxes otherwise payable) shall be for the benefit of Buyer. To the extent that
Seller or any of its Affiliates receive a refund that is for the benefit of
Buyer, Seller shall pay the amount of such refund (and interest received from
the Governmental Authority with respect to such refund) to Buyer. The amount
due to Buyer shall be payable ten days after receipt of the refund from the
applicable Governmental Authority (or, if the refund is in the form of a
credit or offset, ten days after the due date of the Tax Return claiming such
credit or offset).

 



 

9.4 _Audits_.

 



 

(a) If any Governmental Authority issues to Buyer, any Affiliate of Buyer,
Acton Holdings, or the Company (i) a notice of its intent to audit or conduct
another Proceeding that could give rise to a Retained Tax, (ii) a notice of
deficiency for a Retained Tax, or (iii) a notice relating to any other Seller
Tax Matter, Buyer shall notify Seller of its receipt of such communication
from the Governmental Authority within ten days of receipt. If any
Governmental Authority issues to Seller or any Affiliate of Seller (x) a
notice of its intent to audit or conduct another Proceeding that could give
rise to an Assumed Tax or (y) a notice of deficiency for an Assumed Tax,
Seller shall notify Buyer of its receipt of such communication from the
Governmental Authority within ten days of receipt. The failure of a party to
timely provide such written notice shall excuse the other party from their
obligations under this Agreement with respect to any Retained Tax or Assumed
Tax directly or indirectly attributable to any such written notification or
other communication if the failure to provide such written notice adversely
affected the ability of the party not receiving the notice to contest any
claim arising from such notice.

 



 

(b) Seller, at its sole cost and expense, shall control (or in the case of
Acton Holdings or the Company, have the right to assume control of) any audit
or other Proceeding (a " ** _Tax Contest_** ")

 



      
 

 



 

that could give rise to a Retained Tax for Seller (other than a Retained Tax
with respect to a Straddle Period); __provided__ , __however__ , (i) Seller
shall not, and shall not allow Acton Holdings or the Company, to settle,
resolve, or abandon such Tax Contest (whether or not Buyer participates in
such Tax Contest) to the extent it could result in an Assumed Tax without the
prior written consent of Buyer (which shall not be unreasonably withheld,
delayed or conditioned) and (ii) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall be
entitled to participate in any such Tax Contest.

 



 

(c) Buyer, at its sole cost and expense, shall control any Tax Contest that
could give rise to an Assumed Tax (or a Retained Tax for a Straddle Period);
__provided__ , __however__ , (i) Buyer shall not, and shall not allow Acton
Holdings or the Company, to settle, resolve, or abandon such Tax Contest to
the extent it could result in a Retained Tax without the prior written consent
of Seller, which shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned,
and (ii) Seller shall be entitled to participate in any Tax Contest relating
to a Straddle Period.

 



 

9.5 _Cooperation_. Buyer and Seller shall (and shall cause their respective
Affiliates, including the Acquired Entities, to) (a) assist in the preparation
and timely filing of any Tax Return regarding any Retained Tax; (b) assist in
any audit or other Proceeding with respect to a Retained Tax; (c) make
available any information, records, or other documents relating to a Retained
Tax; (d) prepare any documents (including filing powers of attorney to comply
with _Section 9.4_); (e) provide certificates or forms, and timely execute
any Tax Return, that are necessary or appropriate to establish an applicable
exemption for (or reduction in) any Transfer Tax; and (f) obtain, at the
expense of the requesting party, Tax refunds for an Assumed Tax or Retained
Tax.

 



 

9.6 _Entity Classification Elections_. Seller shall not make (and shall not
cause the Acquired Entities to make) an election to treat the Acquired
Entities as corporations for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

 



 

9.7 _Transfer Taxes_. Buyer shall be liable for and shall pay all sales, use,
transfer, real property transfer, documentary, recording, gains, stock
transfer and similar Taxes and fees, including all title transfer and re-
titling Taxes, costs, fees, and expenses, and any deficiency, interest or
penalty asserted with respect thereof arising out of or in connection with the
transactions effected pursuant to this Agreement (collectively, " ** _Transfer
Taxes_** "). Buyer shall timely file or cause to be filed all necessary
documentation and Tax Returns with respect to such Transfer Taxes (and Seller
shall cooperate with respect thereto as necessary).

 



 

9.8 _Purchase Price Allocation Schedule_.

 



 

(a) Buyer and Seller agree to allocate the aggregate purchase price (and all
other capitalized costs) to be paid for the Membership Interests among the
assets of the Acquired Entities in a manner consistent with the principles of
Section 1060 of the Code. Within 30 Business Days of the Closing Date, Buyer
shall deliver to Seller a schedule allocating the Purchase Price among the
assets of the Acquired Entities (the " ** _Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule_** "). If within 30 days of receiving the Purchase Price Allocation
Schedule, Seller has not objected, the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule
shall be final and binding. If within 30 Business Days of receiving the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule Seller objects to the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule, Seller and Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to resolve
their differences, __provided__ , that if after 30 Business Days, Seller and
Buyer are unable to agree, the Parties shall retain the Independent Accountant
to resolve their dispute. The determination of the Independent Accountant
shall be final and binding on the Parties. The cost of the Independent
Accountant shall be shared equally by Seller and Buyer. Buyer and Seller shall
make appropriate adjustments to the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, as
finally determined, to reflect changes in the Purchase Price.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) The Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, as finally determined, shall be
binding on the parties hereto, and subject to appropriate changes to the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, the parties shall file all Tax Returns
(including Internal Revenue Service Form 8594) consistently with the Purchase
Price Allocation Schedule, as finally determined, and not take any position
during the course of any audit or other Proceeding that is inconsistent with
the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, as finally determined, unless
otherwise required by a determination of a Governmental Authority that is
final.

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE X_**

 



 

 ** _TERMINATION_**

 



 

10.1 _Termination_. This Agreement may be terminated only as follows:

 



 

(a) by the mutual written consent of Seller and Buyer at any time prior to the
Closing;

 



 

(b) if Buyer is not then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
Seller at any time prior to the Closing (i) if Seller has breached any
representation and warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
in any material respect which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition
in _ARTICLE VI_ to the obligations of Buyer at the Closing, Buyer has
notified Seller of the breach and the breach has continued without cure for a
period of 20 days after the notice of such breach, or (ii) if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before December 31, 2017 (the " ** _End Date_**
") by reason of the failure to satisfy (unless the failure results primarily
from Buyer breaching any representation and warranty, covenant or agreement
contained in this Agreement) any condition precedent under _ARTICLE VI_
(other than (x) the condition precedent set forth in _Section 6.2_ in the
event of an Order imposed by an Antitrust Authority in connection with
antitrust approvals which Order permanently enjoins the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or (y) the condition precedent set forth in
_Section 6.4_).

 



 

(c) if Seller is not then in material breach of any provision of this
Agreement, Seller may terminate this Agreement by giving written notice to
Buyer at any time prior to the Closing (i) if Buyer has breached any
representation and warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement
in any material respect which has prevented the satisfaction of any condition
in _ARTICLE VII_ to the obligations of Seller at the Closing, Seller has
notified Buyer of the breach and the breach has continued without cure for a
period of 20 days after the notice of such breach, or (ii) if the Closing
shall not have occurred on or before the End Date by reason of the failure to
satisfy any condition precedent under _ARTICLE VII_ (unless the failure
results primarily from Sellers breaching any representation and warranty,
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement); _provided, however,_ if
Closing has not occurred due, in whole or part, for failure of Buyer to comply
with the condition to closing set forth in _Section 7.3_ or the requirements
of _Section 5.7_ and all other conditions to Closing have been satisfied or
waived (other than those only capable of being satisfied or waived at
Closing), the End Date shall be extended to April 1, 2018, or such later date
as the Parties may mutually agree, if, in the reasonable judgment of Buyer and
Seller the condition to Closing set forth in _Sections 6.4_ and _7.3_ can be
satisfied, and Buyer can comply with the requirements of _Section 5.7,_ by
such date (such date, the " ** _Outside Date_** "); and

 



 

(d) by Buyer or Seller in the event that:

 



 

(i) there shall be any Law that makes consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited; or

 



      
 

 



 

(ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued an Order restraining or
enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Order
shall have become final and non-appealable.

 



 

10.2 _Effect on Obligations_.

 



 

(a) Except as set forth in this _Section 10.2(a)_ and in _Section 10.2(b)_
and _Section 10.2(c)_ below, the termination of this Agreement pursuant to
this _ARTICLE X_ shall terminate all rights and obligations of the Parties
hereunder and no Party shall have any liability to the other Party hereunder,
except that _ARTICLE XII_, _ARTICLE XIII_, the Confidentiality Agreement,
the last sentence of _Section 4.3_ and this _Section 10.2_ (and any related
definitions contained in any such Sections or Articles) shall survive such
termination, and provided that nothing herein shall relieve any Party from
liability for Fraud or any intentional breach of any covenant or agreement in
this Agreement prior to such termination.

 



 

(b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by Buyer pursuant to
clause (ii) of _Section 10.1(c)(b)_ (and subject to the provisions contained
therein with respect to the Outside Date) as a result of the failure of the
condition precedent set forth in _Section 6.4_, (ii) by Seller pursuant to
clause (ii) of _Section 10.1(c)_ (and subject to the provisions contained
therein with respect to the Outside Date) as a result of the failure of the
condition precedent set forth in _Section 7.3_, or (iii) by Buyer or Seller
pursuant to _Section 10.1(d)(ii)_ in the event of an Order imposed by an
Antitrust Authority in connection with antitrust approvals which Order
permanently enjoins the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer
shall pay to Seller a fee of $9,400,000 (the " ** _Reverse Antitrust
Termination Fee_** "), _provided, however_ , that the payment of such Reverse
Antitrust Termination Fee (x) shall be reduced by the amount of the Cash
Deposit which Seller shall be entitled to retain, and (y) shall not terminate
Buyers indemnification obligations set forth in _Section 11.2(d)_. Buyer
acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this _Section
10.2(b)_ are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, the Seller would not enter into
this Agreement. Accordingly, if Buyer fails to pay the Reverse Antitrust
Termination Fee (as reduced by the amount of the Cash Deposit) within three
Business Days, and, in order to obtain such payment, the Seller commences a
Proceeding that results in a judgment in its favor for such payment, Buyer
shall pay to the Seller its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and
expenses) in connection with such Proceeding, together with interest on the
amount of such payment from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment at the prime rate in effect on the date such payment
was required to be made, plus five percent. For the avoidance of doubt, the
right to receive the Reverse Antitrust Termination Fee (as reduced by the
amount of the Cash Deposit) in the circumstances in which it is due shall
constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller against Buyer and its
Affiliates. The Parties further acknowledge that the payment by Buyer of the
Reverse Antitrust Termination Fee is not a penalty, but constitutes liquidated
damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Seller in the
circumstances in which such fee is payable for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the Closing, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate with
precision.

 



 

(c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to
_Section 10.1(b)_, Seller shall promptly return to Buyer the Cash Deposit.

 



 

(d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Seller pursuant to
_Section 10.1(c)_, Seller shall retain the Cash Deposit.

 



      
 

 



 

 ** _ARTICLE XI_**

 



 

 ** _INDEMNIFICATION_**

 



 

11.1 _Survival_. The representations and warranties set forth in _Sections
2.2_ (Sellers Organization; Power and Authority; Qualification), _2.3_
(Capitalization), _2.4_ (Title to Membership Interests), and clause (a) of
Section _2.6_ (No Conflicts with Governing Documents) (collectively, the " **
_Fundamental Representations_** ") shall survive the Closing for a period of
12 months after the Closing Date and shall thereupon expire, together with any
right to indemnification for breach thereof, and be of no further force or
effect, except to the extent a Valid Third Party Claim Notice or Valid Other
Claim Notice (each, a " ** _Valid Claim Notice_** ") shall have been given
prior to such date in accordance with _Section 11.3_ by the party seeking
indemnification (the " ** _Indemnified Party_** ") to the party from whom
indemnification is being sought (the " ** _Indemnifying Party_** "), in which
case the representation or warranty alleged in the Valid Claim Notice to have
been breached shall survive only to the extent of the claim set forth in the
Valid Claim Notice, until such claim is finally resolved or settled in
accordance with this Agreement.

 



 

11.2 _Indemnification_.

 



 

(a) If the Closing shall occur, Seller shall indemnify Buyer and its
Affiliates and Representatives, including, after the Closing Date, the
Acquired Entities, and hold each of them harmless from and against any Damages
that may be incurred, sustained or suffered by, or imposed upon, any such
Indemnified Party as a result of or arising from the breach of any of the
Fundamental Representations, subject to the limitations and provisions of
_Section 11.2(b)_.

 



 

(b) Any recovery by any Indemnified Party for indemnification pursuant to
_Section 11.2(a)_ shall be subject to the following limitations:

 



 

(i) such claim for indemnification must be made in accordance with _Section
11.3_, so as to constitute a Valid Claim Notice;

 



 

(ii) such claim for indemnification may only be made within the time period of
survival set forth in _Section 11.1_, except with respect to any claim for
Damages to the extent arising from Fraud;

 



 

(iii) Buyer shall only be entitled to recover from Seller for Damages under
_Section 11.2(a)_ to the extent such Damages exceed the $25,000,000 policy
limit under the RandW Policy (the " ** _Excess Fundamental Damages_** "), which
Excess Fundamental Damages shall in no event exceed the Purchase Price, as the
same may be adjusted pursuant to _Section 1.3(f)(i)_ and _Section
1.3(f)(ii)_ of this Agreement, less the $25,000,000 policy limit under the RandW
Policy, and net of any amount of retention under the RandW Policy paid by Seller
under clause (iv) below (the " ** _Cap_** "); _provided_ , that the Cap shall
not apply to any claim for Damages to the extent arising or resulting from
Fraud; and

 



 

(iv) Seller shall be solely responsible for any unpaid retention remaining
under the RandW Policy as of the date of the Valid Claim Notice with respect to
any claim for Damages under _Section 11.2(a)_.

 



 

(c) Nothing contained in this _Section 11.2_ shall restrict or prohibit Buyer
from making and pursuing any claim under the RandW Policy obtained by Buyer in
connection with this Agreement; provided, that the Parties acknowledge and
agree that the recourse of Buyer for any indemnification claim pursuant to
_Section 11.12(a)_ that is validly established under this _ARTICLE XI_

 



      
 

 



 

shall be to _first_ make claims against the RandW Policy and _second_ against
Seller for any and all Excess Fundamental Damages up to the Cap, including any
unpaid retention under the RandW Policy.

 



 

(d) Buyer shall indemnify Seller and hold it harmless from and against all
Damages (including costs of any defense and any fines or penalties) that are
incurred or suffered by it as a result of, or arising from, (i) any written
request of any Antitrust Authority for Seller or Buyer to make an HSR filing
in connection with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) any Damages relating to the failure to make any such HSR
filing, (iii) any proceeding that is initiated before or after Closing by an
Antitrust Authority that questions the validity or legality of the
transactions contemplated hereby or the ownership, control, operation or use
of the assets or businesses of Seller by Buyer or any Affiliate of Buyer under
the Antitrust Laws, and (iv) any Antitrust Proceeding.

 



 

(e) For purposes of this _ARTICLE XI_, any inaccuracy in or breach of any
representation or warranty shall be determined without regard to any
materiality, Material Adverse Effect, or other similar qualification contained
in or otherwise applicable to such representation or warranty.

 



 

11.3 _Procedures for Claims_.

 



 

(a) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this _ARTICLE XI_ in respect of, arising out of, or
involving a claim made by any third party against the Indemnified Party (a "
** _Third Party Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party must notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of the Third Party Claim (a " ** _Third Party
Claim Notice_** ") promptly following receipt by such Indemnified Party of
notice of the Third Party Claim, which notification, to be a valid Third Party
Claim Notice, with the effect set forth in _Sections 11.1_ and _11.2_ (a " **
_Valid Third Party Claim Notice_** "), must specify in reasonable detail the
nature of the claims and be accompanied by a copy of the written notice (if
any) of the third party claimant to the Indemnified Party asserting the Third
Party Claim; __provided__ , that the failure to provide such notice promptly
(so long as a Valid Third Party Claim Notice is given before the expiration of
the survival period applicable to such claims) shall not affect the
obligations of the Indemnifying Party hereunder except to the extent the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. The Indemnified Party
shall promptly deliver to the Indemnifying Party copies of all other notices
and documents (including court papers) received by the Indemnified Party
relating to the Third Party Claim.

 



 

(b) The Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in or, by
giving written notice to the Indemnified Party, assume the defense against any
such Third Party Claim (including to conduct and control any Proceedings or
settlement negotiations) with counsel of its own choosing, in each case at the
Indemnifying Partys expense. The Indemnified Party shall have the right to
participate in the defense of any Third Party Claim and to employ its own
counsel (it being understood that the Indemnifying Party shall control such
defense), at its own cost and expense. Prior to the time the Indemnified Party
is notified by the Indemnifying Party as to whether the Indemnifying Party
will assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall
take all actions reasonably necessary to timely preserve the collective rights
of the Parties with respect to such Third Party Claim, including responding
timely to legal process. If the Indemnifying Party, in the reasonable opinion
of counsel to the Indemnified Party, fails to diligently prosecute the defense
of such Third Party Claim, or declines to assume the defense of a Third Party
Claim (or shall fail to notify the Indemnified Party of its election to defend
such Third Party Claim) within 30 days after the giving by the Indemnified
Party to the Indemnifying Party of a Valid Third Party Claim Notice, the
Indemnified Party shall defend against the Third Party Claim and the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable to the Indemnified Party for all reasonable
fees and expenses incurred by the Indemnified Party in the defense of the
Third Party Claim, including the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
employed by the Indemnified Party, if and to the

 



      
 

 



 

extent that the Indemnifying Party is responsible to indemnify the Indemnified
Party for such Third Party Claim under this Agreement. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified
Party shall not admit any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or
discharge, such Third Party Claim without the Indemnifying Partys prior
written consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.
Regardless of which Party assumes the defense of a Third Party Claim, the
Parties agree to cooperate in good faith and in all respects with one another
and each others Representatives (including counsel) in connection with the
investigation, negotiation, settlement, trial and/or defense of any Third
Party Claim or Proceeding (and any appeal arising therefrom). Such cooperation
shall include providing records and information that are relevant to such
Third Party Claim, and making employees and officers available on a mutually
convenient basis to provide additional information and explanation of any
material provided hereunder and to act as a witness or respond to legal
process. The Parties shall cooperate with each other in any notifications to
and information requests of any insurers.

 



 

(c) In order for an Indemnified Party to be entitled to any indemnification
provided for under this _ARTICLE XI_ in respect of a claim that does not
involve a Third Party Claim being asserted against such Indemnified Party (an
" ** _Other Claim_** "), the Indemnified Party must promptly notify the
Indemnifying Party in writing of such Other Claim (the " ** _Other Claim
Notice_** "), which notification, to be a valid Other Claim Notice, with the
effect set forth in _Sections 11.1_ and _11.2_ (a " ** _Valid Other Claim
Notice_** "), must certify that the Indemnified Party has in good faith
sustained Damages (and a good faith estimate of such Damages) with respect to
such claim, and specify in reasonable detail the nature of the claim. The
failure by any Indemnified Party to notify the Indemnifying Party promptly of
an Other Claim Notice (so long as a Valid Other Claim Notice is given before
the expiration of the survival period applicable to such claims) all not
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to such
Indemnified Party under _Section 11.2_, except to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party has been materially prejudiced by such failure. The
Indemnifying Party shall have 45 days after receipt of such notice to respond
in writing to such Other Claim. The Indemnified Party shall allow the
Indemnifying Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or
circumstance alleged to give rise to the Other Claim and to investigate
whether and to what extent any amount is payable in respect of the Other
Claim, and the Indemnified Party shall assist the Indemnifying Partys
investigation by giving such information and assistance as the Indemnifying
Party or any of its professional advisors may reasonably request. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so respond within such 45-day period, the
Indemnifying Party shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case
the Indemnified Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be
available to the Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions
of this Agreement.

 



 

11.4 _Other Provisions_.

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, except for
claims under this Agreement (i) for Fraud or intentional misconduct, (ii) with
respect to any covenant or agreement of the Parties contained in this
Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance or non-performance
after the Closing, (iii) with respect to breach of the Confidentiality
Agreement, and (iv) with respect to obligations related to the payment of the
Reverse Antitrust Termination Fee (as provided herein), the indemnification
provided in this _ARTICLE XI_ shall be the sole and exclusive post-Closing
remedy available to the Parties hereto for any claim arising under this
Agreement, the Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated hereby
or thereby (except for a claim for specific performance, injunctive and/or
other equitable relief or the performance of any covenant or agreement of the
Parties contained in this Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates
performance after the Closing) and no party shall pursue any other remedy or
have any recourse against the other Party or any of its other assets and
properties for any such claim. All amounts payable by one Party in
indemnification of the other shall be considered an adjustment to the Purchase
Price.

 



      
 

 



 

(b) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties
acknowledge and agree that the recourse of Buyer for any indemnification claim
under _Section 11.2(a)_ that is validly established shall be to make claims
against the RandW Policy and, to the extent of any Excess Fundamental Damages,
against Seller. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that, except with respect to
Excess Fundamental Damages and any unpaid retention amount under the RandW
Policy at the time of any indemnification claim under _Section 11.2(a)_ with
respect to Excess Fundamental Damages, it shall have no recourse against
Seller or any of its Affiliates or their respective assets and properties for
any claim, except as contemplated by _Section 11.4(a)(i)-(iii)_.

 



 

(c) In no event shall Seller be liable for special, exemplary, punitive,
diminution in value, loss of profits or consequential damages (including any
indirect damages or damages calculated using "multiples of earnings",
"multiples of cash flows" or similar valuation methodologies) incurred by
Buyer in connection with an Other Claim.

 



 

(d) Upon making any payment to an Indemnified Party for any indemnification
claim under this Agreement (an " ** _Indemnification Payment_** "), the
Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated, to the extent of such payment, to any
rights which the Indemnified Party or any Affiliate thereof may have against
any other Person(s) (including under any insurance policies) with respect to
the subject matter underlying such indemnification claim except for rights
arising under the RandW Policy. The Indemnified Party and its Affiliates shall
cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in the pursuit of such rights and shall
promptly remit to the Indemnifying Party any payments (up to the amount of the
Indemnification Payment) received in respect of such rights.

 



 

(e) An Indemnified Party who has a right to make a claim under any policy of
insurance with respect to an indemnified claim made by the Indemnified Party
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to make such claim on a prompt and
competent basis in the manner required by the insurance carrier. The
Indemnified Party shall cooperate fully with the insurance carrier and the
Indemnifying Party in the prosecution of the claim or claims. In the event an
Indemnified Party receives insurance proceeds with respect to Damages for
which the Indemnified Party has made an indemnification claim prior to the
date on which the Indemnifying Party is required pursuant to this _ARTICLE
XI_ to pay such indemnification claim, the indemnification claim shall be
reduced by an amount equal to such insurance proceeds received by the
Indemnified Party. If such insurance proceeds are received by the Indemnified
Party after the date on which the Indemnifying Party pays such indemnification
claim to the Indemnified Party, the Indemnified Party shall remit such
proceeds to the Indemnifying Party, in the amount necessary to reimburse in
full such Indemnifying Party, no later than five Business Days after the
receipt of such insurance proceeds.

 



 

(f) The parties are in agreement that where one and the same set of facts
qualifies under more than one provision entitling Buyer to a claim or remedy
under this Agreement, there shall be only one claim or remedy.

 



 

(g) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement to the contrary,
Seller shall not be liable to, or have any obligation to indemnify Buyer for,
any Damages (i) resulting from breach of any covenant, agreement,
representation or warranty of which Buyer or its Representatives or Affiliates
had knowledge on or prior to the Closing Date, (ii) to the extent that such
Damages result from or arise out of actions taken by Buyer or the Acquired
Entities or any of their respective Affiliates (other than Seller and its
Affiliates) from and after the Closing Date, (iii) to the extent that such
Damages result from or are increased by a failure of Buyer to mitigate damages
in accordance with _Section 11.4(h)_, and/or (iv) to the extent that such
Damages result from or are increased by the passing of or any change in, after
the date hereof, any Law or regulatory or administrative practice of any
Governmental Authority in effect on the date hereof.

 



      
 

 



 

(h) The Parties shall each use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate any
Damages associated with any claim for indemnification under this _ARTICLE XI_
after becoming aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give
rise to any Damages that are indemnifiable or recoverable hereunder.

 



 

(i) Buyer covenants and agrees that any insurance policy(ies) (including the
RandW Policy) that insure against a claim that may be covered by the
indemnification obligations under _Section 11.2(a)_ obtained or maintained by
Buyer and/or any of its Affiliates with respect to this Agreement and/or any
of the transactions contemplated hereby will expressly exclude any right of
subrogation against Seller (except in the case of fraud or intentional
misrepresentation), and Buyer shall indemnify and hold harmless Seller and its
post-Closing Affiliates from and against and in respect of any and all losses,
liabilities, damages or expenses (including reasonable legal fees) incurred by
any of them as a result of any such claim brought or maintained by any insurer
of Buyer or any of its post-Closing Affiliates against Seller and each of its
post-Closing Affiliates in contravention of this _Section 11.4(i)_.

13.5 _Non-Recourse; Release_.

 



 

(a) All claims, obligations, liabilities, or causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) that may be
based upon, in respect of, arise under, by reason of, be connected with, or
relate in any manner to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby, or the negotiation, execution, or performance of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby (including any representation or warranty
made in, in connection with, or as an inducement to, this Agreement), may be
made only pursuant to the rights and remedies of this Agreement and only
against (and such representations and warranties are those solely of) the
Persons that are expressly identified as parties in the preamble to this
Agreement and the Person that provides the Guarantee (the " ** _Contracting
Parties_** "). Without limiting the foregoing, such claims, obligations,
liabilities, or causes of action specifically include those of strict
liability and cost recovery or contribution or otherwise pursuant to
Environmental Laws. No Person who is not a Contracting Party, including any
past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee, incorporator,
member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate, agent, attorney, Representative or
assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender to, any Contracting Party, or
any past, present or future director, manager, officer, employee,

 



      
 

 



 

incorporator, member, partner, manager, stockholder, Affiliate, agent,
attorney, Representative or assignee of, and any financial advisor or lender
to, any of the foregoing (collectively, the " ** _Nonparty Affiliates_** "),
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in equity,
or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations, or
liabilities arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any
manner to this Agreement or based on, in respect of, or by reason of this
Agreement or its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (other than as
set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement), and, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, each Contracting Party hereby waives and releases all such
liabilities, claims, causes of action, and obligations against any such
Nonparty Affiliates. Without limiting the foregoing, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, except to the extent otherwise set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement, each Contracting Party disclaims any reliance upon
any Nonparty Affiliates with respect to the performance of this Agreement or
any representation or warranty made in, in connection with, or as an
inducement to this Agreement.

 



 

(b) Without limiting anything set forth in _ARTICLE XI_ or _Section
13.5(a)_, effective as of the Closing Date, Buyer (each, a " ** _Releasor_**
"), on behalf of itself, the Acquired Entities and each of their respective
officers, directors, managers, equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and
each of their respective successors and assigns, hereby releases, acquits and
forever discharges, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and covenants not
to sue Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective past, present or
future officers, managers, directors, equityholders, partners, members,
Affiliates, employees, counsel and agents (each, a " ** _Releasee_** ") of,
from and against any and all actions, causes of action, claims, demands,
damages, judgments, debts, dues and suits of every kind, nature and
description whatsoever, which such Releasor or its successors or assigns ever
had, now has or may have against any Releasee by reason of any matter, cause
or thing whatsoever arising from conduct occurring prior to the Closing Date;
__provided__ , that each Releasor and each Seller and their respective
officers, directors, equityholders, Subsidiaries and Affiliates, and each of
their respective successors and assigns retain, and do not release, their
rights and interests under the terms and conditions of (i) this Agreement to
the extent arising out of Fraud or intentional misconduct, (ii) this Agreement
with respect to any covenant or agreement of the Parties contained in this
Agreement which, by its terms, contemplates performance or non-performance
after the Closing, including without limitation the indemnification
obligations set forth in _ARTICLE XI_ hereof, and (iii) the Confidentiality
Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, each Non-Party Affiliate who is a
Releasee for purposes of this _Section 13.5(b)_ is an express third party
beneficiary of this _Section 13.5(b)_.

 



 

13.6 _Governing Law; Disputes_.

 



 

(a) This Agreement and the legal relations between the parties hereto shall be
governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
Delaware, without regard to the conflict of laws rules thereof.

 



 

(b) The Parties agree that any other dispute, claim or disagreement arising
out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the negotiation, execution, interpretation, performance
or non-performance of this Agreement, the parties shall first submit the
dispute, claim or disagreement to non-binding mediation administered by the
American Arbitration Association (the " ** _AAA_** ") in accordance with its
Commercial Mediation Procedures. The place of mediation shall be Dallas,
Texas. If the dispute, claim or disagreement is not resolved within 30 days
after the initial mediation meeting among the parties and the mediator, or if
the mediation is otherwise terminated, then either party may submit the
dispute, claim or disagreement to binding arbitration administered by the AAA
in accordance with the provisions of its Commercial Arbitration Rules (the "
** _Rules_** ") and, except as provided below, such arbitration shall be the
sole means of dispute resolution. The place of arbitration shall be Delaware.
The arbitration shall be conducted by a panel of three arbitrators selected in
accordance with the Rules, unless the parties otherwise agree to one

 



      
 

 



 

arbitrator. Any mediator or arbitrator selected under this _Section 13.6(b)_
shall be a practicing corporate attorney with significant experience in
commercial agreements and acquisitions and shall not have been employed or
engaged by or affiliated with either of the parties or their respective
Affiliates. Each party shall initially bear its own costs and expenses in
connection with any mediation or arbitration hereunder, including, without
limitation, its attorneys fees, and an equal share of the mediators or
arbitrators and administrative fees of mediation or arbitration. The decision
of the arbitrators shall be in writing but without any statement of the
reasoning therefore, and shall include a determination of responsibility for
all costs and expenses incurred by the prevailing party. Judgment upon an
arbitration award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction and
shall be final, binding and non-appealable. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 13.6(b)_ to the contrary, each party shall be entitled to seek
injunctive or other equitable relief without first submitting the matter to
mediation or arbitration in accordance with the provisions of this _Section
13.6(b)_, even if a similar or related matter has already been referred to
mediation or arbitration in accordance with the terms of this _Section
13.6(b)_. Venue for any action permitted to be brought in court under this
_Section 13.6(b)_ shall be the appropriate state and federal courts located
in Delaware.

 



 

13.7 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the Parties hereto. Neither this Agreement nor any of the
rights, interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the
Parties hereto without the prior written consent of the other Parties;
__provided__ , that upon notice (x) Buyer may assign its rights and interests
(but not its obligations) hereunder (i) to any of its Affiliates or (ii) to
any subsequent purchaser of the Acquired Entities or substantially all of the
assets of the Acquired Entities, in each case without prior written consent
and (y) Seller may assign their rights and obligations under this Agreement to
any of their Affiliates without prior written consent; __provided__ , that no
such assignment referred to in clauses (x) or (y) shall relieve Buyer or
Seller of any of their obligations hereunder. Any attempted assignment in
violation of this _Section 13.7_ shall be void.

 



 

13.8 _Publicity_. No public release or announcement concerning the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be issued by either Party without the
prior written consent of the other Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), except as may be disclosed by
the Company pursuant to law or the rules or regulations of any United States
or foreign securities exchange, in which case the Company shall give the Buyer
notice and a copy of the disclosure regarding the transaction in advance of
such issuance.

 



 

13.9 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
adverse manner to any Party. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable
manner so that the transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the
greatest extent possible.

 



 

13.10 _Specific Performance_. Each of the Parties hereto acknowledges that the
rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are
unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement by any party, irreparable damage would occur and money damages would
be inadequate and the non-breaching party may have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, except as provided in the immediately following sentence, the
Parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have the right and be
entitled to, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their
favor at law or in equity, enforce their rights and the other Partys
obligations hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by
an action or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other
equitable relief (without posting of bond or other security). Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if the Closing

 



      
 

 



 

does not occur due to an Order imposed by an Antitrust Authority in connection
with antitrust approvals which Order permanently enjoins the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, or this Agreement is terminated pursuant to
clause (ii) of _Section 10.1(b)_ as a result of the failure of the condition
precedent set forth in _Section 6.4_, clause (ii) of _Section 10.1(c)_ as a
result of the failure of the condition precedent set forth in _Section 7.3
_or _Section 10.1(d)(ii)_ in the event of an Order imposed by an Antitrust
Authority in connection with antitrust approvals which Order permanently
enjoins the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, payment of the
Reverse Antitrust Termination Fee (as reduced by the amount of the Cash
Deposit) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Seller against Buyer
and its Affiliates and under no circumstances shall the Seller or any of its
Affiliates or Representatives be permitted or entitled to receive a grant of
specific performance.

claims, demands, waivers and other communications hereunder shall be in

13.15 _Attorney-Client Privilege and Conflict Waiver_.

 



 

(a) It is acknowledged by each of the Parties that the Acquired Entities
(until the Closing) and Seller (until and after the Closing) have retained
Jackson Walker LLP (the " ** _Legal Counsel_** ") to act as their counsel in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby and that the Legal
Counsel has not acted as counsel for any other Person in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and that no other Party to this Agreement or

in the event that a dispute arises between Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) and Seller or any of its
Affiliates (including, prior to the Closing, the Acquired Entities), the Legal
Counsel may represent Seller or any such Affiliate in such dispute even though
the interests of Seller or such Affiliate may be directly adverse to Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Acquired Entities),
and even though the Legal Counsel may have represented the Acquired Entities
in a matter substantially related to such dispute or may be handling ongoing
matters for the Acquired Entities, and each of Buyer and Seller hereby waive,
on behalf of themselves and each of their Affiliates: (a) any claim they have
or may have that Legal Counsel has a conflict of interest in connection with
or is otherwise prohibited from engaging in such representation, and (b) agree
that, in the event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Buyer or
any of its Affiliates (including after the Closing, the Acquired Entities) on
the one hand, and Seller or any of its Affiliates on the other hand, Legal
Counsel may represent Seller in such dispute even though the interest of any
such party may be directly adverse to Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including after the Closing, the Acquired Entities), the Acquired Entities,
or Seller and even though the Legal Counsel may have represented Seller or the
Acquired Entities in a matter substantially related to such dispute or may be
handling ongoing matters for Seller or any of the Acquired Entities.

client confidence and all other rights to any evidentiary privilege belong to
Seller and may be controlled by Seller, and shall not pass to or be claimed by
Buyer or the Acquired Entities. The parties hereto further agree that Legal

forecasts and certain business plan information. Buyer acknowledges that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections
and other forecasts and plans, that Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties,
that Buyer is taking full responsibility for making its own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections and other forecasts and
plans so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the assumptions
underlying such estimates, projections, forecasts or plans), and that Buyer

plans).

review and analysis of the Acton Business, results of operations, prospects,
condition (financial or otherwise) and assets of Acton Holdings and the

warranty, statement, or information of any nature; and (ii) that none of
Seller, its Affiliates and its Representatives will have any liability to

express or implied representation, warranty, statement, or information of any
nature except as explicitly set forth in _ARTICLE XI_ and this _Section

the representations, warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
instrument delivered under this Agreement will survive the Closing. This
