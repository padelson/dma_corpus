(ii) The Offer shall initially be scheduled to expire at 5 p.m., Atlanta,
Georgia time, on August 18, 2011 (the "Initial Offer Expiration Date"),
provided, however, if at the Initial Offer Expiration Date, any condition to
the Offer is not satisfied or waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause
Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for up to ten (10) Business Days (in
increments of at least five (5) Business Days). Thereafter, if at any then
scheduled expiration of the Offer, any condition to the Offer is not satisfied
or waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend the
Offer on one or more occasions, in consecutive increments of up to five (5)
Business Days (or such longer period as the parties may agree) each. In
addition, (A) Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, extend
the Offer on one or more occasions for the minimum period required by any
rule, regulation, interpretation or position of the United States Securities
and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") or the staff thereof applicable to the
Offer; and (B) Merger Sub shall (and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to) extend
the Offer on one occasion upon the request of the Company for a period of time
not to exceed ten (10) Business Days if, within ten (10) Business Days before
any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal or a Change of Recommendation occurs; provided, however,
that Merger Sub shall not be required to extend the Offer beyond the Outside
Date and such extension shall be subject to the right to terminate the Offer
in accordance with Section 1.1(a)(iv).

  

  

(iii) On the terms and subject to the conditions of the Offer and this
Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, accept for
payment and pay for (subject to any applicable Tax withholding pursuant to
Section 4.2(g)) all Shares validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant
to the Offer as soon as practicable after the expiration of the Offer (as it
may be extended and re-extended in accordance with this Section 1.1(a) and in
compliance with applicable Laws) and in any event in compliance with Rule
14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act. The date of acceptance for payment of Shares
pursuant to and subject to the conditions of the Offer is referred to in this
Agreement as the "Offer Closing", and the date on which the Offer Closing
occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Closing Date".

  

  

(iv) If at any then-scheduled expiration of the Offer any condition to the
Offer shall not have been satisfied or waived and the Outside Date shall have
occurred (the "Offer Determination Date"), then Merger Sub may irrevocably and
unconditionally terminate the Offer. In addition, the Company shall have the
right, exercisable by delivering written notice to Parent and Merger Sub at
any time from and after the Offer Determination Date to cause Merger Sub to,
and upon receipt of such written notice, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer at
the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer following the receipt of such
notice from the Company (delivered no less than one (1) Business Day prior to
the then-scheduled expiration date of the Offer). The termination of the Offer
pursuant to this Section 1.1(a)(iv) is referred to in this Agreement as the
"Offer Termination", and the date on which the Offer Termination occurs is
referred to in this Agreement as the "Offer Termination Date". Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this Section 1.1(a)(iv), if this Agreement is
terminated pursuant to Article IX, then Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours
of such termination), irrevocably and unconditionally terminate the Offer and
in any event shall not acquire any Shares pursuant thereto. If the Offer is
terminated or withdrawn by Merger Sub, or this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with Article IX, Merger Sub shall promptly return, and shall cause
any depositary acting on behalf of Merger Sub to return, in accordance with
applicable Law, all tendered Shares to the registered holders thereof. The
parties acknowledge and agree that the Offer Termination shall not give rise
to a right of termination of this Agreement except to the extent expressly
provided for in Article IX and that, absent any such termination of this
Agreement, the obligations of the parties hereunder other than those related
to the Offer shall continue to remain in effect, including those obligations
with respect to the Merger.

or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for Shares
issued and outstanding prior to the Acceptance Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Offer Price shall be
equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so adjusted shall, from and
after the date of such event, be the Offer Price.

  

  

(b) On the date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall file
with the SEC a Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO with respect to the
Offer, which shall contain an offer to purchase and a related letter of
transmittal and summary advertisement and such other ancillary documents
pursuant to which the Offer will be made (such Schedule TO and the documents
included therein pursuant to which the Offer will be made, together with any
supplements or amendments thereto and such other ancillary documents, the
"Offer Documents"). The Offer Documents will contain all information that is
required to be included therein in accordance with the Exchange Act, and the
rules and regulations thereunder and any other applicable Laws. Parent and
Merger Sub shall cause the Offer Documents to comply as to form in all
material respects with the requirements of all applicable Laws, and Parent and
Merger Sub will take all steps necessary to cause the Offer Documents to be
disseminated to the Company Shareholders in accordance with this Agreement and
with all applicable Laws. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall
promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents
if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and Merger Sub shall
take all steps necessary to amend or supplement the Offer Documents and to
cause the Offer Documents as so amended or supplemented to be filed with the
SEC and to be disseminated to the Company Shareholders, in each case as and to
the extent required by all applicable Laws. The Company and its counsel shall
be given the opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents and any
supplements or amendments thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC,
and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due consideration to any such comments
proposed by the Company or its counsel. In the event that Parent or Merger Sub
receives any comments from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer
Documents, each shall use its reasonable best efforts to (i) respond promptly
to such comments and (ii) take all other actions necessary to resolve the
issues raised therein. Parent and Merger Sub shall (A) provide the Company and
its counsel in writing with any comments Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel
may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly, but in no event later than twenty-four (24) hours, after the receipt
of such comments, (B) provide the Company and its counsel with copies of all
correspondence between Parent, Merger Sub or their counsel, on the one hand,
and the SEC (or the staff of the SEC), on the other hand, (C) give the Company
and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of
Parent and Merger Sub to those comments and to provide comments on any
response, and (D) give due consideration to any such comments.

(c) Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to Merger Sub on a timely
basis the funds necessary to purchase and pay for any and all Shares that
Merger Sub becomes obligated to accept for payment and purchase pursuant to
the Offer and shall cause Merger Sub to fulfill all of Merger Sub's covenants,
agreements and obligations under the Offer and this Agreement.

  

  

Section 1.2. Company Actions.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby consents to the Offer, and on the date the initial
Offer Documents are filed with the SEC, the Company shall file with the SEC a
Tender Offer Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9 with
respect to the Offer (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any supplements or
amendments thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") and shall mail the Schedule 14D-9 to
the Company Shareholders. The Company shall include in the Schedule 14D-9 the
Fairness Opinion. Parent and Merger Sub shall as promptly as reasonably
practicable furnish to the Company all information concerning Parent and
Merger Sub that is required or reasonably requested by the Company for
inclusion in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the Schedule
14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become false or
misleading in any material respect, and, subject to the provisions of this
Agreement, the Company shall take all steps necessary to amend or supplement
the Schedule 14D-9 and to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so amended or
supplemented to be filed with the SEC and disseminated to the Company
Shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by all applicable
Laws. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly
as reasonably practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC
with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 and have the Schedule 14D-9 cleared as
promptly as reasonably practicable. Parent and Merger Sub and their counsel
shall be given the opportunity (i) to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9
prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, (ii) any supplements or amendments
thereto prior to the filing thereof with the SEC, and (iii) copies of any
correspondence between the Company and its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand. The Company shall, in
good faith, give due consideration to any such comments proposed by Parent and
Merger Sub, and the Company shall provide Parent and its counsel in writing
with any comments or other communications the Company or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Schedule 14D-9 promptly
after the receipt of such comments or other communications.

  

  

(b) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
to furnish Merger Sub promptly with mailing labels containing the names and
addresses of the record holders of the Shares as of the latest practicable
date, together with copies of all lists of shareholders, security position
listings and computer files and all other information in the Company's
possession or control regarding the beneficial owners of the Shares, and shall
furnish to Merger Sub such information and assistance (including updated lists
of shareholders, security position listings and computer files) as Parent or
Merger Sub may reasonably request in communicating the Offer to the Company
Shareholders. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and except for
such steps as are necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents and any other
documents necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, Parent and Merger Sub shall, and shall cause their agents to, treat
the information contained in any such labels, listings and files in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the Confidentiality Agreement, shall use such
information only in connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this
Agreement shall be terminated, shall, upon request, promptly deliver to the
Company or destroy all copies of such information then in their possession or
under their control or in the possession or under the control of any of their
representatives or agents.

Section 1.3. Directors.

  

  

(a) Promptly after the acceptance for payment of Shares tendered pursuant to
the Offer (the time of such acceptance being the "Acceptance Time"), the
Company will, upon Parent's request and subject to compliance with applicable
Law, take all actions necessary to cause persons designated by Merger Sub (the
"Merger Sub Designees") to become members of the Company Board of Directors
such that the total number of Merger Sub Designees, rounded up to the nearest
whole number, equals the product of (i) the total number of members of the
Company Board of Directors (after giving effect to any increase in the number
of the directors elected or appointed pursuant to this sentence) and (ii) the
percentage that the number of Shares beneficially owned by Parent or Merger
Sub at such time (including Shares so accepted for payment) bears to the total
number of Shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis. In furtherance
thereof, the Company shall, upon the request of, and as specified by, Merger
Sub, either cause an increase in the size of the Company Board of Directors or
secure the resignations of such number of the Company's incumbent directors,
or both, as is necessary to enable the Merger Sub Designees to be so elected
or appointed to the Company Board of Directors and the Company shall take all
actions necessary to cause the Merger Sub Designees to be so elected or
appointed. At such time, if requested by Merger Sub, the Company shall also
take all action necessary to cause the Merger Sub Designees to constitute at
least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) of each
committee of the Company Board of Directors as such Merger Sub Designees
constitute on the Company Board of Directors, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law and the rules of any stock exchange or trading market on which
the Shares are listed and traded. The provisions of this Section 1.3 are in
addition to and shall not limit any rights which Merger Sub, Parent or any of
their Affiliates may have as a holder or beneficial owner of Shares as a
matter of applicable Law with respect to the election of directors or
otherwise.

  

  

(b) The Company's obligations pursuant to Section 1.3(a) shall be subject to
Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act. The Company shall take all actions
necessary to cause the Merger Sub Designees to be elected or appointed,
including mailing to the Company Shareholders the information statement
required by Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1 promulgated
thereunder as part of the Schedule 14D-9, which the Company shall mail either
(i) concurrently with the mailing of Schedule 14D-9 or (ii) if not included in
Schedule 14D-9, upon Parent's request, within two (2) calendar days following
such request; provided, however, that Parent and Merger Sub shall supply to
the Company in writing prior to the filing with the SEC of the Schedule 14D-9
(and if not then, as soon as practicable thereafter), and be solely
responsible for, any information with respect to Parent and Merger Sub and
Merger Sub Designees to the extent required by such Section 14(f) and Rule
14f-1.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-6-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 1.3, the parties hereto
shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to ensure that at least
three (3) of the members of the Company Board of Directors shall, at all times
following the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, be directors of
the Company who (i) were directors of the Company on the date hereof, (ii) are
not officers of the Company and (iii) are independent directors for purposes
of continuing listing requirements of Nasdaq (the "Continuing Directors");
provided, however, that, if at any time there shall be in office less than
three (3) Continuing Directors for any reason, the Company Board of Directors
shall use reasonable best efforts to cause a person or persons meeting the
foregoing criteria and designated by the remaining Continuing Directors to be
appointed or elected to the Company Board of Directors and such person or
persons shall be deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this
Agreement, or if no Continuing Directors then shall remain, the other
directors of the Company then in office shall use reasonable best efforts to
appoint or elect to the Company Board of Directors three (3) persons meeting
the foregoing criteria, which persons shall not be directors, officers,
employees or Affiliates of Parent or Merger Sub and such persons shall be
deemed to be Continuing Directors for all purposes of this Agreement. From and
after the Acceptance Time and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the
terms hereof, any amendment or modification of this Agreement, any termination
of this Agreement by the Company, any extension of time for performance of any
of the obligations of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, any waiver of any
condition to the Company's obligations hereunder or any of the Company's
rights hereunder, any amendments to the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
the Company, any Change of Recommendation, any other action of the Company
hereunder which adversely affects or could adversely affect the Company
Shareholders (other than Parent or Merger Sub), and any action by the Company
Board of Directors may be effected only if (in addition to the approval of the
Company Board of Directors as a whole) such action is approved by a majority
of the Continuing Directors then in office. Following the Acceptance Time and
prior to the Effective Time, neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any
action to remove any Continuing Director.

  

  

Section 1.4. Top-Up Option.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option"), exercisable only upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth herein, to purchase at the Offer Price an aggregate number of Shares
(the "Top-Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of Shares that, when added to
the number of Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates at the
time of such exercise (after giving effect to the Offer Closing), shall
constitute one Share more than 90% of the outstanding Shares on a fully
diluted basis; provided, however, that the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable to the extent (i) the number of Shares issuable upon exercise of
the Top-Up Option would exceed the number of authorized but unissued Shares or
Shares held in the treasury of the Company as of immediately prior to the
issuance of the Top-Up Shares (giving effect to Shares reserved for issuance
under all outstanding stock options, restricted equity and any other rights to
acquire the Shares as if such Shares were outstanding) or (ii) any other
provision of applicable Law or judgment, injunction order or decree shall
prohibit the exercise of the Top-Up Option or delivery of the Top-Up Shares;
provided, further, that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the termination
of this Agreement in accordance with its terms. The Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable until such time as Merger Sub shall have accepted for payment the
Shares tendered pursuant to the Offer, and in no event shall the Top-Up Option
be exercisable (A) if the Minimum Tender Condition shall have been waived, (B)
more than once or (C) unless, immediately after such exercise and the issuance
of Shares pursuant thereto, and accounting for the limitations set forth
herein, Parent and Merger Sub would hold one Share more than 90% of the
outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-7-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The parties shall cooperate to ensure that the issuance of the Top-Up
Shares is accomplished consistent with all applicable legal requirements of
all Governmental Entities, including compliance with an applicable exemption
from registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"Securities Act").

  

  

(c) Subject to the limitations on exercise of the Top-Up Option set forth in
Section 1.4(a), Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
exercise, and take all action necessary to exercise, the Top-Up Option, on the
Offer Closing Date. To exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub shall send to
the Company a written notice (a "Top-Up Exercise Notice") on or immediately
prior to the Offer Closing Date specifying (i) the number of Shares that are
owned by Parent, Merger Sub and their Affiliates immediately preceding the
purchase of the Top-Up Shares (after giving effect to the Offer Closing), (ii)
the number of Top-Up Shares, and (iii) the manner in which Merger Sub intends
to pay the applicable exercise price. The Company shall, as soon as
practicable following receipt of the Top-Up Exercise Notice (and in any event
no later than the Offer Closing), deliver written notice to Merger Sub
specifying the number of Shares then outstanding on a fully-diluted basis and,
based on the information provided by Merger Sub in its notice, the number of
Top-Up Shares (the "Top-Up Notice"). If the number of Top-Up Shares specified
in the Top-Up Notice is different than the number of Top-Up Shares specified
in the Top-Up Exercise Notice, the Company and Merger Sub shall, as promptly
as practicable and in any event on the Offer Closing Date, reasonably agree on
the appropriate number of Top-Up Shares. The Top-Up Exercise Notice shall also
include an undertaking signed by Parent and Merger Sub that, on the Offer
Closing Date Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
consummate the Merger in accordance with the GBCC as contemplated by Section
7.3(c). The closing of the purchase and sale of the Top-Up Shares (the "Top-Up
Closing") shall take place at the location of the Merger Closing specified in
Section 1.6, and shall take place simultaneously with the Offer Closing. At
the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company, in the manner set forth
in Section 1.4(d), the aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up
Shares, in an aggregate principal amount equal to that specified in the Top-Up
Exercise Notice, and the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to
Merger Sub a certificate or certificates representing the Top-Up Shares or, at
Merger Sub's request or otherwise if the Company does not then have
certificated Shares, the applicable number of uncertificated Shares
represented by book entry ("Book-Entry Shares"). Such certificates or Book-
Entry Shares may include any legends that are required by applicable Law.

  

  

(d) Merger Sub may pay the Company the aggregate price required to be paid for
the Top-Up Shares either (i) entirely in cash or (ii) at Merger Sub's
election, by (A) paying in cash an amount equal to not less than the aggregate
par value of the Top-Up Shares and (B) executing and delivering to the Company
a promissory note having a principal amount equal to the balance of the
aggregate purchase price pursuant to the Top-Up Option less the amount paid in
cash pursuant to the preceding clause (A) (the "Promissory Note"). Any such
Promissory Note shall (1) be full recourse against Parent and Merger Sub, (2)
shall bear interest at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum, (3) shall
mature on the first (1st) anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of
such Promissory Note, (4) may be prepaid, in whole or in part at any time,
without premium or penalty and (5) shall have no other material terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-8-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that the Shares that Merger Sub may
acquire upon exercise of the Top-Up Option shall not be registered under the
Securities Act and shall be issued in reliance upon an exemption for
transactions not involving a public offering. Parent and Merger Sub represent
and warrant to the Company that Merger Sub is, or shall be upon any purchase
of Top-Up Shares, an "accredited investor," as defined in Rule 501 of
Regulation D under the Securities Act. Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up
Option, and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired upon exercise of the Top-Up
Option, if any, are being and shall be acquired by Merger Sub for the purpose
of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in connection with, any
distribution thereof (within the meaning of the Securities Act). The parties
agree and acknowledge that in any appraisal proceeding with respect to the
Dissenting Shares, and to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the
Surviving Corporation shall not, and no other party to this Agreement shall,
assert that the Top-Up Option, the issuance of the Top-Up Shares or the
payment by Merger Sub to the Company of any consideration for the Top-Up
Shares should be considered by the court in connection with the determination
in accordance with Article 13 of the GBCC of the fair value of the Dissenting
Shares.

  

  

(f) The Minimum Tender Condition and the number of Shares issuable pursuant to
the Top-Up Option, as applicable, shall be adjusted to the extent appropriate
so as to restore Merger Sub to its rights hereunder with respect to the Top-Up
Option in the event of any reclassification, stock split (including a reverse
stock split), stock dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, merger,
issuer tender or exchange offer, or other similar transaction with respect to
Shares occurring or having a record date on or after the date of this
Agreement and prior to the date of exercise of the Top-Up Option.

  

  

Section 1.5. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the GBCC, at the Effective
Time, Merger Sub shall be merged with and into the Company, and the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub shall thereupon cease. The Company shall be
the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes herein referred to as the
"Surviving Corporation"), and the separate corporate existence of the Company,
with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall
continue unaffected by the Merger, except as set forth in Article II. The
Merger shall have the effects specified in the GBCC.

  

  

Section 1.6. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Merger Closing") will
take place at (a) if the Offer Closing shall have not occurred at or prior to
the Merger Closing, 9:00 a.m., Atlanta, Georgia time, on the second Business
Day after satisfaction or waiver in writing if permissible under applicable
Law of the conditions set forth in Article VIII (other than those conditions
that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Merger Closing, but subject to
the satisfaction or waiver in writing of those conditions if permissible under
applicable Law), or (b) if the Offer Closing shall have occurred on or prior
to the Merger Closing, 9:00 a.m., Atlanta, Georgia time, on the date of, and
immediately following the Offer Closing (or the Top-Up Closing if the Top-Up
Option has been exercised), in either case at the offices of King and Spalding,
1180 Peachtree Street NE, Atlanta, Georgia 30309, unless another time, date or
place is agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. The date on which the
Merger Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the "Merger Closing
Date". Notwithstanding the preceding, if the Marketing Period has not ended at
the time of the satisfaction or waiver of conditions set forth in Article VIII
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the
Merger Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver in writing of those
conditions if permissible under applicable Law), then the Merger Closing shall
occur instead on the date following the satisfaction or waiver of such
conditions (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions on that
date) that is the earliest to occur of (i) any Business Day before or during
the Marketing Period as may be specified by Parent on no less than two (2)
Business Days' prior notice to the Company and (ii) the Business Day
immediately following the final Business Day of the Marketing Period, which
shall be deemed the Merger Closing Date.

EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON

  

  

CAPITAL STOCK; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES

  

  

Section 4.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any capital stock
of the Company:

  

  

(a) Each Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time,
other than (i) Shares owned by Parent, Merger Sub or any other direct or
indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent (including as a result of an
exercise of the Top-Up Option by Merger Sub), and Shares owned by the Company
or any direct or indirect wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company, and in each
case not held on behalf of third parties, and (ii) Shares (the "Dissenting
Shares") that are owned by Company Shareholders ("Dissenting Shareholders")
who have perfected and not withdrawn a demand for, or lost their appraisal
rights pursuant to Article 13 of the GBCC with respect to such Shares (each
Share described in subparts (i) and (ii), an "Excluded Share" and
collectively, "Excluded Shares") shall be converted into the right to receive
an amount in cash equal to the Offer Price (the "Per Share Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all of the Shares (other than the
Excluded Shares) shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the holder thereof, cease to be outstanding, shall be cancelled and
shall cease to exist, and shall thereafter represent only the right to receive
the Per Share Merger Consideration, without interest.

  

  

(b) Each Excluded Share referred to in Section 4.1(a)(i) or 4.1(a)(ii) shall,
by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, cease to be outstanding, be cancelled without payment of any
consideration therefor and cease to exist; provided, however, that the
Dissenting Shares shall thereafter represent the right to receive the payment
to which reference is made in Section 4.2(f).

  

  

(c) At the Effective Time, each share of common stock, no par value per share,
of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the
holder thereof, be converted into one share of common stock, no par value per
share, of the Surviving Corporation.

Section 4.2. Surrender and Payment.

  

  

(a) Prior to the Merger Closing Date, Parent shall appoint Computershare Trust
Company, N.A. as paying agent or such other paying agent with the Company's
prior approval, which shall not be unreasonably withheld (the "Paying Agent")
for the purpose of exchanging for the Per Share Merger Consideration (i)
certificates representing the Shares (the "Certificates") or (ii)
uncertificated Shares (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent shall make
available or cause to be made available to the Paying Agent amounts sufficient
in the aggregate to provide all funds necessary for the Paying Agent to make
payments of the Per Share Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 4.1(a)
(such cash being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). If a
Dissenting Shareholder effectively withdraws its demand for, or loses its,
appraisal rights pursuant to Article 13 of the GBCC with respect to any
Dissenting Shares, Parent shall make available or cause to be made available
to the Paying Agent additional funds in an amount equal to the product of (i)
the number of Dissenting Shares for which the Dissenting Shareholder has
withdrawn its demand for, or lost its, appraisal rights pursuant to Article 13
of the GBCC and (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  

  

(b) Promptly after the Effective Time (and in any event within three (3)
Business Days thereafter), the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying
Agent to mail to each holder of record of Shares (other than holders of
Excluded Shares to the extent such holders do not also hold Shares that are
not Excluded Shares) (i) a letter of transmittal in customary form approved by
counsel to the Company prior to the Acceptance Time specifying that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon delivery
of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof as provided in
Section 4.2(e)) or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Paying Agent,
such letter of transmittal to be in such form and have such other provisions
as Parent and the Company may reasonably agree, and (ii) instructions for use
in effecting the surrender of the Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof as provided in Section 4.2(e)) or the Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration. Upon (A) surrender of a
Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(e)) to the Paying Agent in accordance with the terms of such letter of
transmittal, duly executed, or (B) receipt of an "agent's message" by the
Paying Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent
may reasonably request) in the case of a book-entry transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, the holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor a cash amount in immediately
available funds (after giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (1) the number of Shares represented by
such Certificate (or affidavit of loss in lieu thereof as provided in Section
4.2(e)) or Uncertificated Shares multiplied by (2) the Per Share Merger
Consideration, and the Certificate so surrendered and the Uncertificated
Shares so transferred shall forthwith be cancelled. No interest will be paid
or accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of the Certificates or
Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Shares that
is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, a check for any cash
to be exchanged upon due surrender of the Certificate may be issued to such
transferee if the Certificate formerly representing such Shares is presented
to the Paying Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and to evidence that any applicable stock transfer Taxes
have been paid or are not applicable.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-12-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of the Company of the Shares that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any
Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation, Parent or the Paying
Agent for transfer, it shall be cancelled and exchanged for the cash amount in
immediately available funds to which the holder thereof is entitled pursuant
to this Article IV.

  

  

(d) Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds of any
investments thereof) that remains unclaimed by the Company Shareholders for
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation. Any holder of Shares (other than Excluded Shares) who has not
theretofore complied with this Article IV shall thereafter look only to the
Surviving Corporation for payment of the Per Share Merger Consideration (after
giving effect to any required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g))
upon due surrender of its Certificates (or affidavits of loss in lieu thereof)
or due transfer of its Uncertificated Shares, without any interest thereon.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Surviving Corporation, Parent, the
Paying Agent or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of
Shares for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant to
applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws.

  

  

(e) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent, the posting by such
Person of a bond in customary amount and upon such customary and reasonable
terms as may be required by Parent as indemnity against any claim that may be
made against it or the Surviving Corporation with respect to such Certificate,
the Paying Agent will issue a check in the amount (after giving effect to any
required Tax withholdings as provided in Section 4.2(g)) equal to (i) the
number of Shares represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
multiplied by (ii) the Per Share Merger Consideration.

  

  

(f) No Person who has perfected a demand for dissenters' rights pursuant to
Article 13 of the GBCC with respect to any Dissenting Shares shall be entitled
to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration with respect to such Dissenting
Shares owned by such Person unless and until such Person shall have
effectively withdrawn or lost such Person's right to payment of the "fair
value" for such shares under the GBCC with respect to such Dissenting Shares.
If any such Dissenting Shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost
such right at or following the Effective Time, each Dissenting Share held by
such Dissenting Shareholder shall thereupon be deemed to have been converted
into and to have become, as of the Effective Time, the right to receive,
without any interest thereon, the Per Share Merger Consideration. Unless and
until a Dissenting Shareholder shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such
Dissenting Shareholder's right to appraisal under the GBCC with respect to
Dissenting Shares, each Dissenting Shareholder shall be entitled to receive
only the payment provided by Article 13 of the GBCC with respect to such
Dissenting Shares. The Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any
written demands for appraisal, attempted withdrawals of such demands, and any
other instruments served pursuant to applicable Law that are received by the
Company relating to shareholders' rights of appraisal and (ii) the opportunity
to participate in and control all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demand for appraisal under the GBCC. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal, offer to settle or settle any such demands or
approve any withdrawal of any such demands. Each holder of Dissenting Shares
who becomes entitled under Article 13 of the GBCC to receive payment of the
"fair value" for such holder's shares shall receive such payment therefor from
the Surviving Corporation after giving effect to any required withholdings as
provided in Section 4.2(g) (but only after the amount thereof shall have been
finally determined pursuant to the GBCC), and such shares shall be retired and
cancelled.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-13-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(g) Each of Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold (or cause to be deducted and
withheld) from the consideration otherwise payable to a Person pursuant to
this Agreement any amounts that are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld or deducted by Parent, the Company, the Surviving
Corporation or the Paying Agent, as the case may be, such withheld or deducted
amounts (i) shall be remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, and (ii)
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of
which the applicable deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

Section 4.3. Treatment of Options and Restricted Stock; Stock Plans.

  

  

(a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement,
and in any event prior to the expiration of the Offer, the Company Board of
Directors (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Stock Plans)
shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to
provide that, at the earlier to occur of the time of the Offer Closing and the
Effective Time (such earlier time, the "Acceleration Time"):

  

  

(i) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide that
each option holder's right to exercise each option to purchase Shares (a
"Company Option") granted under the Stock Plans that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceleration Time shall become 100% vested and
exercisable immediately prior to the Acceleration Time and shall be cancelled
at the Acceleration Time and the holder thereof shall, subject to Section
4.3(c), be entitled to receive, in exchange for such cancellation, as soon as
reasonably practicable after the Acceleration Time, an amount in cash equal to
the product of (A) the total number of Shares subject to such Company Option,
multiplied by (B) the excess, if any, of (1) the Per Share Merger
Consideration over (2) the exercise price per Share under such Company Option.

  

  

(ii) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide that
each Share of restricted stock granted under the Stock Plans (the "Restricted
Stock"), that is outstanding immediately prior to the Acceleration Time, shall
become free of all restrictions and become fully vested and transferable
immediately prior to the Acceleration Time.

  

  

(iii) The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to provide
that each restricted stock unit and performance share awarded under the
Company's 2005 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the "RSUs"), that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceleration Time shall become or otherwise to be
deemed fully vested and shall be cancelled at the Acceleration Time in
exchange for the right to receive the Per Share Merger Consideration as soon
as reasonably practicable after the Acceleration Time. For the avoidance of
doubt, for purposes of applying the immediately preceding sentence to any RSU
that is a performance share, the number of RSUs treated as fully vested and
cancelled in exchange for the Per Share Merger Consideration shall be equal to
the number of Shares that the holder would have been eligible to receive had
performance criteria applicable to such RSUs been achieved at target levels
(and which number of RSUs at target levels is set forth, for the avoidance of
doubt, in Section 5.2(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter).

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-14-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Prior to the Acceleration Time, the Company shall provide Parent with
drafts of, and a reasonable opportunity to comment upon, all resolutions and
other written actions as may be required to effectuate the provisions of
Section 4.3(a) of this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 4.3(b), a
reasonable opportunity shall mean at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the adoption of the resolution or taking of the action.

  

  

(c) All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 4.3 shall be reduced by the
required withholding of Taxes, if any, and shall be paid without interest. Any
amounts payable under this Section 4.3 shall be paid by Parent, the Surviving
Corporation (or a Subsidiary thereof) or the Paying Agent to the Company,
which will effect such withholding or deduction through its normal payroll
procedures. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Company and
remitted to the applicable Governmental Entity, such withheld amount shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which the applicable deduction and withholding was made.

  

  

Section 4.4. Adjustments to Prevent Dilution. If the Company changes the
number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for Shares issued and outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a
reclassification, stock split (including a reverse stock split), stock
dividend or stock distribution, recapitalization, merger, issuer tender or
exchange offer, or other similar transaction, the Per Share Merger
Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect such change and as so
adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the Per Share Merger
Consideration.

Section 5.1. Organization, Good Standing and Qualification.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is a legal entity duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its respective
jurisdiction of organization. Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries has all
requisite corporate or similar power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted,
except where the failure to be so organized, existing or in good standing, or
have such power or authority, would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed as
a foreign corporation to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation (or other legal entity) in each jurisdiction where the conduct of
its business requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so
qualified or in good standing would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. The articles of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company and each Subsidiary of the
Company are in full force and effect. Neither the Company nor any such
Subsidiary is in violation of its articles of incorporation or bylaws. True,
correct and complete copies of the articles of incorporation and bylaws or
comparable governing documents of the Company and each such Subsidiary have
been made available to Parent.

  

  

Section 5.2. Capital Structure.

  

  

(a) As of the close of business on June 30, 2011 (the "Capitalization Date"),
the authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 120,000,000 Shares. As
of the Capitalization Date, (i) 70,453,159 Shares (other than Restricted

than pursuant to the Company Equity Awards referred to below that were
outstanding as of the Capitalization Date and in connection with the exercise
of the Top-Up Option, or (B) established a record date for, declared, set

the Stock Plans, including the holder, date of grant, number of Shares or RSUs
subject to each award, as applicable and where applicable, exercise price.
Upon any issuance of any Shares in accordance with the terms of the Stock

awards to acquire Shares under the Stock Plans, the Company does not have
outstanding any bonds, debentures, notes or other securities or obligations
the holders of which have the right to vote (or convertible into or
exercisable for securities having the right to vote) with the Company
Shareholders on any matter.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-16-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Section 5.2(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (i) each of the
Company's Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in each such
Subsidiary, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons

stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect ownership interest in any

investment by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and consisting of less
than one percent (1%) of the outstanding capital stock of such company and
less than $500,000 in total invested capital in such Company. Each of the
outstanding shares of capital stock or other securities of each of the
Company's Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and owned by the Company or by a direct or indirect wholly-owned
Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of any lien, charge, pledge,
security interest, claim or other encumbrance (each, a "Lien"). Each Company
Equity Award was made in material compliance with all applicable Laws and all
of the terms and conditions of the Stock Plan pursuant to which it was issued,
and in the case of Company Options, has an exercise price per share of Share
equal to or greater than the fair market value of a Share on the date of such
grant and has a grant date which was approved by the Company Board of
Directors or a committee thereof no later than the grant date.

  

  

(d) As of the date of this Agreement, there is no outstanding Indebtedness of
the Company or its Subsidiaries other than Indebtedness disclosed in the
balance sheet (including the notes thereto) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries as of February 28, 2011 included in the Company Reports or
incurred thereafter in the ordinary course of business, but in no event to
exceed $1,000,000.

  

  

(e) No shares of capital stock or other voting securities of any Subsidiary of
the Company have been reserved for issuance to anyone other than the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries. Except for its interest in its Subsidiaries, the
Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock interest,
equity membership interest, partnership interest, joint venture interest or
other equity interest in any person. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries is obligated to make any contribution to the capital of, make any
loan to or guarantee the Indebtedness of any person (excluding the Company's
wholly-owned Subsidiaries).

  

  

(f) Other than (A) the Company Equity Awards and the rights to acquire Shares
by the exercise of stock options and other awards under the Stock Plans, (B)
rights issued under the Rights Plan and (C) the Top-Up Option, as of the date
of this Agreement, there are no preemptive or other outstanding rights,
options, warrants, conversion rights, stock appreciation rights, stock units,
phantom rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, contracts, commitments or undertakings of any kind that
obligate the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue or sell any shares of
capital stock or other securities of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any securities or obligations convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for, or giving any Person a right to subscribe for or acquire, or receive any
payment or other consideration based on the value of any securities of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and as of the date of this Agreement, no

outstanding.

consummate the Merger) (the "Company Requisite Vote"), to consummate the
Offer, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and, assuming
this Agreement has been duly executed by Parent and Merger Sub, constitutes a
valid and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in

Company Board of Directors and, except for (i) the Company Requisite Vote (if

the Articles of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Georgia, no
other corporate proceedings on the part of the Company are necessary to
authorize the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

  

(c) The Company Board of Directors has received the opinion of its financial
advisor, Goldman, Sachs and Co. (the "Company Financial Advisor"), dated the
date of this Agreement (the "Fairness Opinion"), to the effect that, as of the

limitations set forth therein, the Offer Price to be paid to the holders of
Shares pursuant to this Agreement in the Offer and the Merger is, as of the
date of such opinion, fair, from a financial point of view, to such holders
(other than Parent and its Affiliates), a copy of which opinion will be
delivered to Parent promptly after the date of this Agreement for
informational purposes only.

  

  

(d) The Company Requisite Vote is the only vote or approval of the holders of
any class or series of capital stock of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
which is necessary to adopt this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
herein.

delay or materially impair the Company's ability to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-18-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by the Company
do not, and the consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the other

breach or violation of, or a default under, the articles of incorporation or
bylaws of the Company or the comparable governing instruments of any of its
Subsidiaries, (ii) with or without notice, lapse of time or both, a breach or
violation of, a termination (or right of termination) or a default under, the

(a) Since May 31, 2010 (the "Applicable Date"), the Company has filed all
forms, statements, certifications, reports and documents required to be filed
by it with the SEC under the Exchange Act or the Securities Act (the forms,

respective dates, or, if amended or superseded by a subsequent filing, as of
the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing prior to the date
hereof, each of the Company Reports complied in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as the case may be, and any rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder applicable to the Company Reports. As of their
respective dates, the Company Reports did not contain any untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements made therein, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, not misleading, except to the extent
that the information in such Company Report has been amended or superseded by
a later Company Report filed prior to the date hereof. To the Knowledge of the
Company, none of the Company Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review or
outstanding SEC investigation. There are no outstanding or unresolved comments
in comment letters received from the SEC or its staff. There has been no
material correspondence between the SEC and the Company since the Applicable
Date that is not available on EDGAR. None of the Company Subsidiaries is
subject to the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) or 15(d) under the
Exchange Act.

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, the Company is in compliance in all
material respects with (i) the applicable listing and corporate governance
rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Stock Market ("Nasdaq") and (ii) the
applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

  

  

(c) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures required by Rule 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act.
Such disclosure controls and procedures are, in all material respects,
designed with the objective of ensuring that information required to be
disclosed by the Company is recorded and reported on a timely basis to the
individuals responsible for the preparation of the Company's filings with the
SEC and other public disclosure documents. The Company maintains internal
control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f),
as applicable, under the Exchange Act). Such internal control over financial
reporting is, in all material respects, sufficient to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with United States
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP").

  

  

(d) Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by
reference into the Company Reports (including the related notes and schedules)
fairly presents, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position
of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries as of its date and each of
the consolidated statements of income, shareholders' equity and cash flows
included in or incorporated by reference into the Company Reports (including
any related notes and schedules) fairly presents, in all material respects,
the results of operations, retained earnings and changes in financial
position, as the case may be, of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
for the periods set forth therein (except as noted in any of the financial
statements included in the Company Reports and subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to the lack of footnotes and normal and recurring year-
end audit adjustments), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently
applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein.

  

  

(e) Except for matters reflected or reserved against in the most recent
consolidated balance sheet of the Company (or reflected in the notes to the
condensed consolidated financial statements of which such balance sheet is a
part) included in the Company Reports, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any liabilities or obligations (whether absolute, accrued,
contingent, fixed or otherwise) of any nature that would be required under
GAAP, as in effect on the date of this Agreement, to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company (including the notes thereto),
except liabilities and obligations that (i) were incurred since the date of
such balance sheet in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice, (ii) are incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (iii) would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. There are no unconsolidated Subsidiaries of the
Company or any off-balance sheet arrangements of any type (including any off-
balance sheet arrangement required to be disclosed pursuant to Item 303(a)(4)
of Regulation S-K promulgated under the Securities Act) that have not been so
described in the Company's filings with the SEC nor any obligations to enter
into any such arrangements.

Section 5.6. Disclosure Documents.

  

  

(a) Each document required to be filed by the Company with the SEC or required
to be distributed or otherwise disseminated to Company Shareholders in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Company
Disclosure Documents"), including the Schedule 14D-9, and the proxy or
information statement of the Company (the "Proxy Statement"), if any, to be
filed with the SEC in connection with the Offer and the Merger, and any
amendments or supplements thereto, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as
applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.

  

  

(b) (i) The Proxy Statement, as supplemented or amended, if applicable, at the
time such Proxy Statement or any amendment or supplement thereto is first
mailed to Company Shareholders and at the time such shareholders vote on
approval of the Merger and at the Effective Time, and (ii) the Company
Disclosure Documents (other than the Proxy Statement), at the time of the
filing of such Company Disclosure Documents or any supplement or amendment
thereto and at the time of any distribution or dissemination thereof, in each
case, will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state any material fact necessary in order to make the statements made
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading. The representations and warranties contained in this Section 5.6
will not apply to statements or omissions included in the Company Disclosure
Documents based upon information furnished to the Company by Parent or Merger
Sub specifically for use therein.

  

  

(c) The information with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
that the Company furnishes to Parent or Merger Sub in writing specifically for
use in the Schedule TO and the Offer Documents, at the time of the filing of
the Schedule TO, at the time such document is amended or supplemented or at
the time such document is first published, at the time of any publication,
distribution or dissemination of the Offer Documents and at the time of the
consummation of the Offer, will not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact necessary in order to make the
statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading.

  

  

Section 5.7. Absence of Certain Changes. From the Applicable Date through the
date of this Agreement, except as otherwise required or contemplated by this
Agreement, (a) the Company and its Subsidiaries have conducted, in all
material respects, their respective businesses in the ordinary course of such
business and in a manner substantially consistent with past practice and (b)
there have not been any facts, circumstances, events, changes, effects or
occurrences that would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.8. Litigation. There are no litigations, actions, charges, suits,
claims (or counterclaims), complaints, hearings, arbitrations, investigations,
mediations, audits, inquiries or other proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened against the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective assets, rights or properties, except,
in each case, for those that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries nor any of their respective properties or assets is or are a
party to or subject to the provisions of any judgment, order, writ,
injunction, decree, settlement, stipulation or award issued or entered into by
or with any Governmental Entity which would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect.

Section 5.9. Employee Benefits.

  

  

(a) All material benefit and compensation plans, Contracts, policies or
arrangements with respect to which the Company or a Subsidiary has any
material liability or which cover current or former employees of the Company
and its Subsidiaries (the "Employees") or current or former directors of the
Company or its Subsidiaries, including all "employee benefit plans" within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended ("ERISA"), and all material deferred compensation, severance,
retention, change-in-control, post-employment medical, stock option, stock
purchase, stock appreciation rights, stock-based, incentive, and bonus plans
and all employment or other service agreements with Employees, other than
plans, Contracts, policies or arrangements required by applicable Law
(collectively, the "Benefit Plans") are listed on Section 5.9(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter. True and complete copies of all Benefit Plans
listed on Section 5.9(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter, including any trust
instruments, insurance Contracts, or other funding instruments, and all
amendments thereto that are not publicly available have been made available to
Parent together with, to the extent applicable, (i) a written summary of the
material terms of any material unwritten plan, (ii) for each Benefit Plan
subject to ERISA, the most recent summary plan descriptions, (iii) for each
Benefit Plan required to file a Form 5500, the most recently filed Form 5500,
attached schedules and audited financial statements, if any, and (iv) for each
Benefit Plan that is intended to satisfy the requirements of Section 401(a) of
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the most recent
determination or opinion letter received from the Internal Revenue Service
("IRS").

  

  

(b) All Benefit Plans are, if applicable, in material compliance with ERISA,
the Code and all other applicable Laws. Each Benefit Plan which is subject to
ERISA (an "ERISA Plan") that is an "employee pension benefit plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA (a "Pension Plan") intended to be qualified
under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable determination letter
or may rely on a favorable opinion letter, or has pending or has time
remaining in which to file, an application for such a determination letter,
from the IRS, and the Company is not aware of any circumstances likely to
result in the loss of the qualification of such Pension Plan under Section
401(a) of the Code. Except as would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has engaged in a transaction with respect to any ERISA Plan that,
assuming the taxable period of such transaction expired as of the date hereof,
would subject the Company or any Subsidiary to a Tax or penalty imposed by
either Section 4975 of the Code or Section 502(i) of ERISA. Except as would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has incurred a Tax or penalty imposed
by Section 4980F of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA.

  

  

(c) No Benefit Plan is subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 or
Title IV of ERISA, and neither the Company nor any organization which,
together with the Company, would be treated as a "single employer" within the
meaning of Section 414(b) or (c) of the Code (an "ERISA Affiliate")
contributes or is required to contribute to, or has any material liability
with respect to any Pension Plan subject to Section 412 of the Code or Section
302 or Title IV of ERISA. No Benefit Plan is a "multiemployer plan" within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA and neither the Company nor any ERISA
Affiliate has any material liability with respect to any such a "multiemployer
plan".

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-22-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) There is no pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company threatened,
litigation, action, suit or claim (other than a routine claim for benefits)
relating to any Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any obligations for retiree or post-employment health or life
insurance benefits under any ERISA Plan or collective bargaining agreement,
except as required by applicable Law.

  

  

(e) Neither the execution of this Agreement, the adoption of this Agreement by
Company Shareholders, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby will, either alone or in combination with any other event, (i) entitle
any Employee to severance pay or any increase in severance pay upon any
termination of service after the date hereof, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting or result in any payment or funding (through a grantor
trust or otherwise) of or increase in compensation or benefits under any
Benefit Plan, (iii) result in payments under any Benefit Plan that would not
be deductible under Section 162(m) or Section 280G of the Code or (iv) would
entitle any Person to payment for any excise or additional Taxes under Section
4999 of the Code.

  

  

(f) The Company has made no promises, whether or not legally enforceable, to
increase benefits under any Benefit Plan or to make any payments under any
Benefit Plan or adopt any plan, policy, agreement or arrangement that would be
a Benefit Plan if in effect on the date hereof.

  

  

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that would prevent
the Company from amending or terminating any Benefit Plan without liability,
other than the liability to pay benefits accrued prior to the termination of
such plan or except as would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect. All contributions and premium payments which are due
and payable with respect to each Benefit Plan have been timely paid or, to the
extent (if any) not due and payable, reflected as a liability in accordance
with the Company's ordinary accounting practices and consistent with past
practice.

  

  

(h) With respect to each Benefit Plan that is maintained for the benefit of
Employees outside the United States (a "Foreign Plan"), the value of the
assets of such Foreign Plan, the liability of each applicable insurer for such
Foreign Plan and/or the book reserve established for such Foreign Plan,
together with any accrued contributions, is sufficient to procure or provide
for the benefits determined on any ongoing basis with respect to such Foreign
Plan according to the actuarial assumptions and valuations most recently used
to determine employer contributions to such Foreign Plan. To the Knowledge of
the Company, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement will not cause the Company to make additional contributions,
purchase additional insurance or increase its book reserves with respect to
any Foreign Plan in an amount that would reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No Foreign Plan is a defined benefit pension
plan.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-23-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) Since May 1, 2009, no person has been treated as an independent contractor
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries who should have been treated as an
employee pursuant to any applicable Laws, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

Section 5.10. Compliance with Laws; Licenses.

  

  

(a) Except with respect to matters that would not reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries are
not in violation of and, since the Applicable Date have not breached or
violated, any federal, state, local or foreign law, statute or ordinance, or
any rule, regulation, judgment, order, writ, decree or other court orders
(collectively, "Laws"). Except as otherwise would not reasonably be expected
to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, no investigation or review by any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened. Each of the Company
and its Subsidiaries has obtained all material permits, licenses,
certifications, approvals, registrations, consents, authorizations,
franchises, variances, exemptions and orders issued or granted by a
Governmental Entity ("Licenses") necessary to conduct its business as
presently conducted, except those the absence of which has not had, and would
not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except
with respect to matters that would not reasonably be expected to have a
Company Material Adverse Effect, the Company and its Subsidiaries are in
compliance with the terms of each License.

  

  

(b) To the Knowledge of the Company, except as would not reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries (nor any of their respective officers, directors or
employees) (i) has made or agreed to make any contribution, payment, gift or
entertainment to, or accepted or received any contributions, payments, gifts
or entertainment from, any government official, employee, political party or
agent or any candidate for any federal, state, local or foreign public office,
or any individual or entity in a position to give the Company a commercial
business advantage where either the contribution, payment or gift or the
purpose thereof was illegal under the Laws of any federal, state, local or
foreign jurisdiction, (ii) has established or maintained any unrecorded fund
or asset or made any false entries on any books or records for any purpose, or
(iii) has engaged in or otherwise participated in, assisted or facilitated any
transaction that is prohibited by any applicable embargo or related trade
restriction imposed by the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control or
any other agency of the United States government.

equity interests of any Person for aggregate consideration under such Contract
in excess of $1,000,000 individually, or $5,000,000 in the aggregate;

transactions contemplated by this Agreement; or

(xi) any Contracts containing minimum purchase conditions in excess of
$100,000 or requirements or other terms that restrict or limit the purchasing
relationships of the Company or its Subsidiaries, or any customer, licensee or
lessee thereof (the Contracts described in clauses (i) - (xi), together with

"Material Contracts").

  

  

(b) Except as prohibited by applicable Law or applicable contractual
restrictions, a copy of each Material Contract that is not publicly available
has previously been made available to Parent. Except as would not reasonably
be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (i) each Material

Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and is in full force and effect and
enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary in accordance with its
terms, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, (ii) neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries nor, to the Knowledge of the Company, any

material default on the part of the Company or any Subsidiaries under any
Material Contract, (iii) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries, and, to the

real property and interests therein owned by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (with all easements and other rights appurtenant to such
property, the "Owned Real Property") and, relative to each such Owned Real
Property interest, the Person that owns it. The Company or its Subsidiaries,
as the case may be, have good and marketable fee simple title to the Owned
Real Property, and to all of the buildings, structures and other improvements
thereon, free and clear of all Encumbrances.

  

  

(b) With respect to the real property leased or subleased to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries (the "Leased Real Property"): (i) each Lease is a
valid and binding obligation of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company
enforceable against the Company or such Subsidiary in accordance with its
terms subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception and, to the Knowledge of
the Company, the other parties thereto, (ii) none of the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries is in material breach of or material default under any Lease,
except in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) hereof, for such invalidity,
failure to be binding, unenforceability, breaches, and defaults that would not

Property free and clear of all Encumbrances on the leasehold estate, except as
would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

price", "moratorium", "control share acquisition" or other similar anti-

incorporation, bylaws or similar organizational documents is applicable to the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Shares, the Offer, the Merger, the Top-
Up Option or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The
Company and the Company Board of Directors have taken all actions necessary so
that neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation
of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer, the Merger, the
Top-Up Option or other transactions contemplated by this Agreement) will cause
(a) the grant of any new rights under the Rights Plan or (b) any rights
previously granted under the Rights Plan to become exercisable.

contrary.

Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the Offer,
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not, constitute
or result in (i) a breach or violation of, or a default under, the

Letters and subject to the terms and conditions of the Commitment Letters, the
aggregate proceeds contemplated from the Financing, together with other

Sub's obligations under this Agreement, including (A) the payment of the

the Merger and the Financing, including any repayment or refinancing of

of the date of this Agreement, (1) no event has occurred which would
constitute a breach or default (or an event which with notice or lapse of time
or both would constitute a default), in each case, on the part of Parent or
Merger Sub under the Commitment Letters or, to the knowledge of Parent, any
other party to the Commitment Letters, and (2) subject to the satisfaction of
the conditions contained in Section 8.1 and Section 8.2 hereof, Parent does
not have any reason to believe that any of the conditions to the Financing

the satisfaction of all of Parent's and Merger Sub's obligations under this
Agreement will not be available to Parent at the Effective Time. As of the
date hereof, Parent and Merger Sub are not aware of any fact or occurrence
that makes any of the representations or warranties of Parent or Merger Sub
relating to Parent and Merger Sub, in any of the Commitment Letters inaccurate
in any material respect. Parent has fully paid all commitment fees or other
fees required to be paid prior to the date of this Agreement pursuant to the
Commitment Letters.

Guarantor, enforceable against the Guarantor in accordance with its terms,

which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would constitute a
default on the part of the Guarantor under such Guaranty.

contemplated by this Agreement (including the Financing, any alternative
financing and the Payment of the aggregate Offer Price and Per Share Merger

diligence investigation of the Company by Parent and Merger Sub, Parent and
Merger Sub have received and may continue to receive from the Company certain
estimates, projections, forecasts and other forward-looking information, as
well as certain business plan information, regarding the Company and its
business and operations. Parent and Merger Sub hereby acknowledge that there
are uncertainties inherent in attempting to make such estimates, projections,
forecasts and other forward-looking statements, as well as in such business
plans, with which Parent and Merger Sub are familiar, that Parent and Merger
Sub are taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the
adequacy and accuracy of all estimates, projections, forecasts and other
forward-looking information, as well as such business plans, so furnished to
them (including the reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such
estimates, projections, forecasts, forward-looking information or business
plans), and that Parent and Merger Sub will have no claim against the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their respective shareholders,
directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, advisors, agents, representatives,
or any other Person, with respect thereto. Accordingly, Parent and Merger Sub
hereby acknowledge that none of the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, nor
any of their respective shareholders, directors, officers, employees,
Affiliates, advisors, agents, representatives, nor any other Person, has made
or is making any warranty with respect to such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans (including the
reasonableness of the assumptions underlying such estimates, projections,
forecasts, forward-looking statements or business plans).

collectively, "Representatives") shall have the right to, directly or
indirectly, (i) initiate, solicit and encourage, whether publicly or
otherwise, any Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, proposals or offers or
other efforts or attempts that may reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal) or the making of any proposals or offers that constitute

participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Persons or groups of

facilitate any such inquiries, proposals, discussions and negotiations and any
effort or attempt to make any Acquisition Proposals (or inquiries, proposals
or offers or other efforts or attempts that may reasonably be expected to lead

(b) Except as permitted by this Section 7.2 and except as may relate to any

be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal), (ii) participate in any
discussions or negotiations regarding an Acquisition Proposal, or provide any
non-public information or data to any Person relating to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, or afford to any Person access to the business, properties,
assets or personnel of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection

any Exempted Person following the No-Shop Period Start Time and prior to the
earlier of the Offer Closing and the time the Company Requisite Vote is

-43-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.2(b) or
any other provisions of this Agreement, at any time following the No-Shop
Period Start Time and prior to the earlier to occur of the Offer Closing and
the time the Company Requisite Vote is obtained, if the Company receives a
written Acquisition Proposal from any Person (including from an Exempted
Person or from any Person with which the Company previously had discussions or
negotiations prior to the No-Shop Period Start Time and ceased such
discussions and negotiations at the No-Shop Period Start Time in accordance
with Section 7.2(b)), (i) the Company and its Representatives may contact such
Person to clarify the terms and conditions thereof, (ii) the Company and its
Representatives may provide information in response to a request therefor by
such Person if the Company receives from such Person (or has received from
such Person) an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement, provided,
however, that any material non-public information provided to such Person that
has not previously been provided to Parent shall be provided to Parent and its
Representatives as promptly as reasonably practicable (and in no event later
than forty-eight (48) hours) after it is provided to such Person, and (iii)
the Company and its Representatives may engage or participate in any
discussions or negotiations with such Person with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii), if and to the extent that
prior to taking any action the Company Board of Directors determines in good
faith based on the information then available and after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel that such Acquisition Proposal
either constitutes a Superior Proposal or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Superior Proposal.

  

  

(d) Except as set forth in this Section 7.2(d), the Company Board of Directors
shall not (i) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify or publicly propose to
withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent, the Company
Recommendation with respect to the Offer or the Merger; (ii) fail to make the
Company Recommendation or fail to include such Company Recommendation in the
Proxy Statement or in the Schedule 14D-9; (iii) after the No-Shop Period Start
Time, fail to publicly reaffirm the Company Recommendation in writing as
promptly as practicable, and in any event within four (4) Business Days after
Parent requests such affirmation with respect to an Acquisition Proposal that
has been publicly announced; (iv) approve or recommend, or publicly propose to
approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal made or received after the date
hereof (any of the foregoing, a "Change of Recommendation"), or (v) cause or
permit the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement.

  

  

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, prior to
the earlier of the Offer Closing and the time the Company Requisite Vote is
obtained, the Company Board of Directors may, (x) if an event, fact,
development, circumstance or occurrence (but specifically excluding any
Acquisition Proposal) that affects the business, assets or operations of the
Company or its Subsidiaries that was not known to the Company as of the date
hereof becomes known by the Company Board of Directors after the date hereof,
effect a Change of Recommendation, or (y) if the Company receives an
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board of Directors concludes in good
faith after consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, constitutes a Superior Proposal, (A) effect a Change of
Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend such Superior Proposal or (C) cause
or permit the Company to enter into any acquisition agreement, merger
agreement or similar definitive agreement, letter of intent or agreement in
principle with respect thereto or any other agreement relating to an
Acquisition Proposal, other than an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement
(each, an "Alternative Acquisition Agreement") and terminate this Agreement or
otherwise take action pursuant to Section 9.1(c), and in the case of either
clause (x) or (y), if, and only if:

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-44-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(i) the Company Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that
failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; and

  

  

(ii) the Company shall have provided prior written notice to Parent and Merger
Sub, at least four (4) Business Days in advance, that it will (A) effect a
Change of Recommendation, (B) approve or recommend any Superior Proposal or
(C) cause the Company to enter into any Alternative Acquisition Agreement and
terminate this Agreement; provided, however, that the Company Board of
Directors shall not and shall cause the Company not to take any such action
unless: (1) the Company has given Parent notice, in writing, of (x) the basis
for the Change of Recommendation or termination and, (y) with respect to the
Superior Proposal, the identity of the party making such Superior Proposal, an
unredacted copy of the Acquisition Proposal, the relevant proposed transaction
agreements and a copy of any financing commitments (including fee letters
redacted to comply with any confidentiality provisions) relating thereto, (2)
the Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate,
in good faith with Parent and Merger Sub for such four (4) Business Day notice
period (to the extent Parent wishes to negotiate) to enable Parent to propose
in writing a binding offer to effect revisions to the terms of this Agreement,
the Commitment Letters and the Guaranty such that it would cause such Superior
Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal, (3) following the end of
such notice period, the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in
good faith any proposed revisions to this Agreement, the Commitment Letters
and the Guaranty proposed by Parent, and shall have determined that, as
applicable, (x) the Superior Proposal would continue to constitute a Superior
Proposal or (y) failure to effect a Change of Recommendation would be
inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
the Company shall have informed Parent of the basis of such determination, and
(4) in the event of any material change to the terms of such Superior
Proposal, the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an
additional notice consistent with that described above and the notice and
negotiation period shall have recommenced, except that the notice and
negotiation period shall be at least one (1) Business Day (rather than the
three (3) Business Days otherwise contemplated above); provided, further, that
the Company has complied in all material respects with its obligations under
this Section 7.2.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-45-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 7.2 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company from complying with its disclosure obligations under applicable Laws
with regard to an Acquisition Proposal (including taking and disclosing to its
shareholders any position contemplated by Rule 14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item
1012 of Regulation M-A under the Exchange Act), and notwithstanding anything
contained in this Agreement, it is understood that a mere "stop, look and
listen" disclosure in compliance with Rule 14d-9(f) of the Exchange Act shall
not violate Section 7.2(b) or constitute a Change of Recommendation.

  

  

(f) From and after the date hereof, the Company agrees that it will promptly
(and in any event within forty-eight (48) hours) notify Parent of the identity
of any party making an Acquisition Proposal and provide Parent with an
unredacted copy of the Acquisition Proposal, the relevant proposed transaction
agreements and, a copy of any financing commitments (including fee letters
redacted to comply with any confidentiality provisions) relating thereto and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably and promptly informed as to the status
of any material changes to the terms thereof.

  

  

Section 7.3. Shareholders' Meeting; Proxy Statement.

  

  

(a) As soon as practicable following the date of this Agreement, Parent and
the Company shall jointly prepare the Proxy Statement, and the Company shall
file the Proxy Statement with the SEC as promptly as practicable (and in any
event by July 18, 2011), and shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond
to the comments of the SEC as promptly as practicable. The Company shall
furnish all information concerning it and the holders of its capital stock as
Parent may reasonably request in connection with such actions, and Parent
shall furnish all information concerning it and Merger Sub as the Company may
reasonably request in connection with such actions. Each party to this
Agreement will notify the other parties and the Company Board of Directors
promptly of the receipt of the comments of the SEC, if any, and of any request
by the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or for
additional information with respect thereto, and will supply the other parties
with copies of all correspondence between such party or its Representatives,
on the one hand, and the SEC or members of its staff, on the other hand, with
respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. If (i) at any time prior to the
Shareholders' Meeting, any event should occur relating to the Company or any
of the Subsidiaries that should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, the Company shall promptly inform Parent
and (ii) if at any time prior to the Shareholders' Meeting, any event should
occur relating to Parent or Merger Sub or any of their respective associates
or Affiliates, or relating to the plans of any such persons for the Company
after the Effective Time that should be set forth in an amendment of, or a
supplement to, the Proxy Statement, Parent will promptly inform the Company,
and in the case of (i) or (ii) the Company and Parent, will, upon learning of
such event, promptly prepare, and the Company shall file with the SEC and, if
required, mail such amendment or supplement to the Company Shareholders;
provided, prior to such filing, the Company and Parent shall consult with each
other with respect to such amendment or supplement and shall incorporate the
other's comments, except with respect to any comment that would create a
misstatement of fact or an omission of a material fact. Each of Parent and
Merger Sub shall vote, or cause to be voted, in favor of the adoption of this
Agreement all Shares directly or indirectly beneficially owned by it, and to
otherwise take all reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to occur.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-46-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) If the adoption of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders is required
by applicable Law, then the Company shall (i) establish a record date not
later than five (5) Business Days after the Proxy Statement Clearance Date for
and give notice of a meeting of the Company Shareholders, for the purpose of
voting upon the adoption of this Agreement (the "Shareholders' Meeting"), and
(ii) mail to the holders of Shares as of the record date established for the
Shareholders' Meeting a Proxy Statement (the date of such mailing, the "Proxy
Date"). The Company shall duly call, convene and hold the Shareholders'
Meeting within forty (40) days following the Proxy Statement Clearance Date or
as promptly as reasonably practicable thereafter. Unless the Company Board of
Directors shall have withdrawn, modified or qualified its recommendation
thereof or otherwise effected a Change of Recommendation (but, for the
avoidance of doubt, unless this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section
9.1, any such Change of Recommendation shall not relieve the Company of its
obligation to give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its shareholders
in accordance with this Section 7.3), the Company shall solicit proxies in
favor of the adoption of this Agreement and shall ensure that all proxies
solicited in connection with the Shareholders' Meeting are solicited in
compliance with all applicable Laws. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, the Company, after consultation with Parent, may
adjourn or postpone the Shareholders' Meeting (A) as necessary to ensure that
any required supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to the
Company's shareholders within a reasonable amount of time in advance of the
Shareholders' Meeting and (B) if as of the time for which the Shareholders'
Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy Statement) there
are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by proxy) to
constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the Shareholders'
Meeting. Furthermore, the Company shall at the reasonable request of Parent,
adjourn or postpone the Shareholders Meeting (A) if as of the time for which
the Shareholders' Meeting is originally scheduled (as set forth in the Proxy
Statement) there are insufficient Shares represented (either in person or by
proxy) to constitute a quorum necessary to conduct the business of the
Shareholders' Meeting or (B) as necessary to permit additional solicitation of
proxies in favor of adoption of this Agreement. The Company shall, upon the
reasonable request of Parent, advise Parent on at least a daily basis on each
of the seven (7) Business Days prior to the scheduled date of the
Shareholders' Meeting as to the aggregate tally of affirmative proxies
received from the Company Shareholders.

  

  

(c) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the number of Shares
owned by Merger Sub, Parent and their Affiliates, in the aggregate, following
the Offer and the exercise, if any, of the Top-Up Option, is equal to at least
one Share plus ninety percent (90%) of the outstanding Shares, each of the
parties hereto shall take all necessary and appropriate actions to cause the
Merger to become effective (including the transfer of Shares owned by Parent
and Affiliates of Parent and Merger Sub to Merger Sub) as soon as practicable
on the last of (i) the expiration date of the Offer and (ii) in the event that
Merger Sub shall have exercised the Top-Up Option and purchased the Top-Up
Shares, on the day on which the Top-Up Closing occurs, without the
Shareholders' Meeting, in accordance with Section 14-2-1104 of the GBCC.

shall, and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries and Affiliates to, use
best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause
to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, the

or with any Governmental Entity or other third party with respect to the
Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and

separate of such assets or businesses of Parent, the Company or the Surviving
Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or otherwise
offering to take or offering to commit to take any action (including any
action that limits its freedom of action, ownership or control with respect
to, or its ability to retain or hold, any of the businesses, assets, product

Corporation, or their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates) to the extent
legally permissible, and if the offer is accepted, taking or committing to

of such action is conditioned upon the consummation of the Offer, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby), in each case, as may be
necessary, required or advisable in order to obtain clearance under the HSR
Act or other Antitrust Laws, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the
dissolution of or to vacate or lift, any decree, judgment, injunction or other
order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would otherwise have
the effect of restraining, preventing or delaying the consummation of the
Offer, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated hereby, or to avoid
the commencement of any action or proceeding that seeks to prohibit the Offer,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement.

the other transactions contemplated hereby under Antitrust Laws or any other
Law relating to regulatory matters or if any action or proceeding, whether
judicial or administrative, is instituted by any Governmental Entity or any
private party challenging the Offer, the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated hereby as violative of Antitrust Laws or any other
Law relating to regulatory matters, each of the parties hereto shall cooperate
with one another and use its best efforts to: (A) oppose or defend against any
action to prevent or enjoin consummation of the Offer, the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and/or (B) take such action as
necessary to overturn any action by any Government Entity or private party to

authorized Representatives reasonable access, during normal business hours
throughout the period prior to the Effective Time, to its properties, books,
Contracts and records. The foregoing shall not require the Company (a) to
provide access to or otherwise make available or furnish any books, Contracts
or records governed by a confidentiality, non-disclosure or other similar
agreement in effect as of the date hereof, (b) to provide access to or
otherwise make available or furnish any information if and to the extent that

product or other legal privilege or protection (it being agreed that, in the
case of clauses (a) and (b), that the Company shall give notice to Parent of
the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and thereafter
the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to

expected to violate such restriction or waive the applicable privilege or
protection), (c) to provide access to or otherwise make available any
information relating to the process conducted by the Company that led to the
execution of this Agreement, or (d) to provide access to or otherwise make
available or furnish any information if and to the extent that the provision

counsel violate any applicable Laws. All requests for information made
pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be directed to the executive officer or
other Person designated by the Company. All such information shall be deemed
Evaluation Material and be governed by the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, Parent and Merger
Sub shall not, and shall cause their respective Representatives not to,

Laws and the rules and policies of Nasdaq to enable the de-listing by the
Surviving Corporation of the Shares from Nasdaq and the deregistration of the

Time. Neither Parent nor the Company shall cause the Shares to be de-listed
from Nasdaq prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

Section 7.7. Publicity. Except with respect to any action taken pursuant to,
and in accordance with, Section 7.2 or Article IX, the initial press release
regarding the Offer and the Merger shall be a joint press release in a
mutually agreed form, and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult
with each other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Offer, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and prior to making any filings with any
Governmental Entity (including any national securities exchange) with respect
thereto, except as may be required by Law or by obligations pursuant to any
listing agreement with or rules of any national securities exchange or by the
request of any Government Entity, provided, however, that the party seeking to
issue or cause the publication of any press release or other announcement with
respect to the Merger or this Agreement shall not be required to provide any
such opportunity to consult to the other party in connection with any
disclosure contemplated by Section 7.2 or any disclosure of Parent or Merger

-51-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(a) For the period commencing at the Effective Time and ending on December 31,
2012, Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation and all of its
Subsidiaries to maintain base salary and target bonus opportunity under annual
and long-term bonus plans (without regard to whether long-term bonus plans are
paid in equity) and benefits (other than equity-based compensation or any
defined benefit plan) for any employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries who remains employed with the Surviving Corporation or any if its
Subsidiaries after the Effective Time that are no less favorable in the
aggregate than the compensation, target bonus opportunities and benefits under
the Benefit Plans that the Employees received or were eligible to receive
immediately prior to the Acceleration Time; provided that neither the Parent,
the Surviving Corporation nor any of their Subsidiaries shall be required to
pay bonuses with equity. Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to,
treat, and cause the applicable benefit plans in which Employees are entitled
to participate after the Acceleration Time to treat, the service of Employees
with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries attributable to any period before
the Acceleration Time as service rendered to Parent, the Surviving Corporation
or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and level of benefits, including for vacation and
severance (but not benefit accrual under any benefit plans of Parent, the
Surviving Corporation or any of their Subsidiaries in which Employees are
eligible to participate after the Acceleration Time). Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any
Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation to, waive, and cause the
applicable benefit plans in which Employees are entitled to participate after
the Acceleration Time to waive, any pre-existing conditions or limitations,
eligibility waiting periods or required physical examinations with respect to
any Employees and their eligible dependents, to the extent waived or satisfied
under a similar Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Acceleration Time, and
Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Corporation or any Subsidiary of
Parent or the Surviving Corporation to, recognize and credit, and cause the
applicable benefit plans in which Employees are entitled to participate after
the Acceleration Time to recognize and credit, any deductibles paid by
Employees or their eligible dependents under any of the Benefit Plans that are
group health plans in the plan year in which the Acceleration Time occurs
towards deductibles under the group health plans of Parent, the Surviving
Corporation or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Corporation. Nothing
in this Section 7.8(a) shall be construed to limit the ability of Parent or
the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment or other service
relationship of any such Employee at any time, or to amend or terminate any
Benefit Plan to the extent permitted by applicable Laws and/or the Benefit
Plans.

  

  

(b) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, Parent shall
cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to continue to be
obligated to perform, in accordance with their terms, the contractual rights
of Employees, existing as of the date of this Agreement and disclosed in
Section 7.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Change in Control
Arrangements"). For purposes of the Change in Control Arrangements, Parent
acknowledges that the occurrence of the Acceleration Time will constitute a
"change in control" and a "change of control" of the Company and its
Subsidiaries. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agrees
that the executive officers and directors and, as applicable, employees of the
Company shall be entitled to the applicable payments and benefits as set forth
in such Change in Control Arrangements in accordance with the terms thereof.
Parent agrees that for the fiscal year in which the Merger is consummated (i)
the performance metrics under the Company's bonus plans disclosed in Section
7.8(b)(i) of the Company Disclosure Letter (the "Bonus Plans") will be
appropriately adjusted to (A) eliminate the transaction costs and expenses
incurred by the Company in connection with the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and any costs, charges and
expenses that result from or relate to changes in the Company's capital
structure resulting from the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, and (B) take into account any capital investments or
expenditures made after the Effective Time and not contemplated by the
Company's fiscal year 2012 budget as of the date of this Agreement, (ii) the
bonuses actually payable to each eligible participant under the Bonus Plans
shall be no less than the bonus calculated pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the Bonus Plans based on actual performance, as adjusted under
subpart (i) and subject to subpart (iii) of this sentence, for the portion of
the fiscal year in which such participant was employed by the Company or its
Subsidiaries during such fiscal year, (iii) if an eligible participant is
employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at the Acceleration Time,
such participant will receive such payment under the applicable Bonus Plans
unless such participant resigns or has his or her employment terminated for
cause prior to the end of such fiscal year, and (iv) such amounts will be paid
no later than the later of (A) two and one-half (2 ½) months following the end
of such fiscal year or (B) March 15 of the year following the close of such
fiscal year. Nothing in this Section 7.8 shall be treated as the establishment
of, or an amendment to, any Benefit Plan (or an undertaking to amend any such
plan) or shall be enforceable by any person under any Benefit Plan or any
other employee benefit plan within the meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA or
otherwise, or shall confer any rights or benefits on any person other than the
signatories to this Agreement.

Section 7.9. Expenses. Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.3 and except
with respect to costs and expenses of printing and mailing the Proxy Statement
and all filing and other fees paid to the SEC in connection with the Merger,
which shall be borne by the Company, and all filing fees under the HSR Act and
filings under any other Antitrust Laws and any other filings with any
Governmental Entity, which shall be borne by Parent, all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, whether or not the Offer, the Merger or any of such
other transactions is consummated.

  

  

Section 7.10. Indemnification; Directors' and Officers' Insurance.

  

  

(a) Parent agrees and shall take all actions necessary such that all rights to
indemnification and exculpation from liabilities and advancement of expenses
for acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time now existing in favor of any individual who is now, or has been
at any time prior to the date of this Agreement, or who becomes prior to the
Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or who is or was serving at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries as a director, officer or employee of another person (the
"Indemnified Parties") as provided in the respective articles of incorporation
or bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, and any indemnification agreements with any such persons shall
survive the Offer and the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with
their terms, and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of such individuals for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time.

  

  

(b) Parent shall maintain the existing officers' and directors' liability
insurance policies maintained by the Company as of the date of this Agreement
for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time (provided that Parent
may substitute therefor policies of at least the same coverage and amounts
containing terms and conditions that are not less advantageous than such
policy); provided that after the Effective Time in no event shall Parent be
required to expend annually in the aggregate an amount in excess of 350% of
the last annual premium paid by the Company for such insurance prior to the
date hereof in respect of coverage required to be obtained pursuant hereto;
provided, however, that in lieu of the foregoing, the Company may purchase,
prior to, on or after the Effective Time, a six-year "tail" prepaid directors'
and officers' liability insurance policy in respect of acts or omissions
occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each such director and officer.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-53-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other
corporation or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation
or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any individual, corporation
or other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made
so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation
shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 7.10.

  

  

(d) The provisions of this Section 7.10 shall survive the Effective Time and
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each
Indemnified Party and his or her heirs and representatives.

  

  

Section 7.11. Financing.

  

  

(a) Each of Parent and Merger Sub shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and obtain the Financing
on the terms and conditions described in the Commitment Letters (including any
flex provisions applicable thereto), including using reasonable best efforts
to (i) maintain in effect the Commitment Letters, (ii) negotiate definitive
agreements with respect to the Debt Commitment Letter on terms and conditions
contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter (including flex provisions) and
execute and deliver to the Company a copy thereof substantially concurrently
with such execution, (iii) satisfy on a timely basis all conditions applicable
to Parent and Merger Sub in the Commitment Letters and the definitive
agreements for the Financing and comply with their obligations thereunder,
(iv) consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter
at or prior to the Merger Closing, and to instruct the lenders and the other
persons providing such Debt Financing to provide such Debt Financing upon
satisfaction of such conditions, and (v) enforce its rights under the
Commitment Letters in the event of a breach by the Financing Sources that
impedes or delays the Merger Closing. If all conditions to the lenders'
obligations under the Commitment Letters have been satisfied or, upon funding
will be satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall use their reasonable best
efforts to cause the lenders and the other Persons providing such Financing to
fund on the Merger Closing Date, the Financing required to consummate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including by
taking enforcement action, including through litigation, to cause such lenders
and the other Persons providing such Financing to fund such Financing). Parent
and Merger Sub shall have the right from time to time to amend, replace,
supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights under, the
Commitment Letters and/or substitute other debt or equity financing for all or
any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative financing
sources; provided, that any such amendment, replacement, supplement or other
modification to or waiver of any provision of the Commitment Letters that
amends the Financing and/or substitution of all or any portion of the
Financing shall not, without the prior written consent of the Company (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned), (A) reduce
the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing (unless the
Equity Financing or Debt Financing is increased by a corresponding amount on
substantially the same terms as provided in the applicable Commitment Letter),
(B) impose new or additional conditions precedent or contingencies to the
Financing as set forth in the Commitment Letters (unless such conditions
precedent or contingencies to the financing would not be (1) materially
adverse to Parent, Merger Sub or the Company and (2) reasonably expected to
prevent or impede or delay the Merger Closing), or (C) prevent or impede or
delay the Merger Closing. Parent and Merger Sub shall refrain from taking,
directly or indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result
in a failure of any of the conditions contained in the Commitment Letters or
in any definitive agreement related to the Financing. Parent shall keep the
Company reasonably informed of the status of its efforts to arrange the Debt
Financing; provided, that Parent shall be under no obligation to disclose any
information that is subject to an attorney-client or similar privilege or
protection; provided further that, Parent shall give notice to the Company of
the fact that it is withholding such information or documents and thereafter
the Company and Parent shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that would not reasonably be
expected to waive the applicable privilege or protection.

(b) If any portion of the Debt Financing becomes unavailable or Parent or
Merger Sub becomes aware of any event or circumstance that makes any portion
of the Debt Financing unavailable, in each case, in the manner or from the
sources contemplated in the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and Merger Sub
shall promptly notify the Company and Parent and Merger Sub shall use their
reasonable best efforts to arrange and obtain alternative financing from
alternative financial institutions upon terms not materially less favorable to
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company than those in the Debt Commitment Letter,
in an amount sufficient to consummate the Merger, the Offer and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable
following the occurrence of such event. Parent and Merger Sub shall deliver to
the Company true and complete copies of all agreements pursuant to which any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide Parent and Merger Sub
with any portion of the Financing substantially concurrently with the
execution thereof.

  

  

(c) Parent and Merger Sub shall give the Company prompt oral and written
notice (but in any event not later than forty-eight (48) hours after the
occurrence of any of the following) (i) of any material breach or potential
material breach threatened in writing by any party to the Commitment Letters
or of any condition which may not be satisfied, in each case, of which Parent
or Merger Sub becomes aware or any termination of the Commitment Letters, and
(ii) the receipt of any written notice or other written communication from any
Financing source with respect to any (A) actual or potential breach, default,
termination or repudiation by any party to any of the Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing of any provisions of the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing or (B)
material dispute or disagreement between or among any parties to any of the
Commitment Letters or definitive agreements related to the Financing with
respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of the Financing
to be funded at the Merger Closing, and (iii) if at any time for any reason
Parent or Merger Sub believes in good faith that it will not be able to obtain
all or any portion of the Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner
or from the sources contemplated by any of the Commitment Letters or
definitive agreements related to the Financing. As soon as reasonably
practicable, but in any event within two (2) Business Days of the date the
Company delivers to Parent or Merger Sub a written request, Parent and Merger
Sub shall provide any information reasonably requested by the Company relating
to any circumstance referred to in clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of the
immediately preceding sentence; provided that they need not provide any
information that is privileged or that is requested for purposes of
litigation.

(d) Prior to the Effective Time, the Company agrees to provide, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives to provide, at
Parent's sole expense, reasonable cooperation in connection with the
arrangement of the Debt Financing (for purposes of this Section 7.11(d),
including (i) any financing to be issued or incurred in lieu of any bridge
facilities contemplated by the Debt Financing, or pursuant to any flex
applicable to the Debt Financing and (ii) any alternative financing obtained
in connection with Section 7.11(b)) as may be reasonably requested by Parent
or Merger Sub, which shall include (A) using reasonable best efforts to cause
its officers to participate in a reasonable number of meetings, road show
presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and sessions with
rating agencies in connection with the Financing, (B) using reasonable best
efforts to assist with the preparation of customary materials for rating
agency presentations, offering and syndication documents (including
prospectuses, private placement memoranda and lender and investor
presentations), business projections and similar marketing documents required
in connection with the Financing (all such documents and materials,
collectively the "Offering Documents") and other documents required in
connection with obtaining the Debt Financing, but in each case, solely with
respect to the information relating to the Company and its Subsidiaries and
provided that any such Offering Documents shall contain disclosure and pro
forma financial statements (if any) reflecting the Surviving Corporation
and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligors, (C) issuing customary representation
letters to auditors and using reasonable best efforts to (1) obtain
accountants' comfort letters and consents to the use of accountants' audit
reports relating to the Company, (2) assist the Parent and Merger Sub in
obtaining corporate, credit and facility ratings from rating agencies for the
Debt Financing, and (3) assist the Parent and Merger Sub in obtaining other
documentation and items contemplated by the Debt Commitment Letter or any
definitive document relating to the Debt Financing as reasonably requested by
Parent or Merger Sub, and (D) using reasonable best efforts to obtain consents
of accountants for use of their reports in any materials relating to the
Financing and documentation reasonably facilitating the pledging of collateral
(including requesting payoff letters, releases, terminations, waivers,
consents, estoppels and approvals as may be required in connection therewith)
contemplated by the Debt Financing; provided that (1) such requested
cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the
Company and its Subsidiaries, (2) none of the Company or any Subsidiary shall
be required to pay any fees (including commitment or other similar fees) or
incur any other liability or expense in connection with the Financing (or any
replacement thereof) prior to the Effective Time, (3) no incurrence of
Indebtedness or other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under the Debt Financing shall be effective until the Effective Time, (4) none
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access
to or disclose information where the Company reasonably determines that such
access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or any Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; provided that, the
Company shall give notice to Parent of the fact that it is withholding such
information or documents and thereafter the Company and Parent shall use their
respective reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in
a manner that would not reasonably be expected to waive the applicable
privilege or protection, (5) none of the Company or any Subsidiary shall be
required to (x) take any action that will conflict with or violate the
Company's or such Subsidiary's organizational documents or any Laws or result
in the contravention of, or that would reasonably be expected to result in a
material violation or breach of, or default under, any material Contract to
which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or (y) issue any bank
information memoranda, high-yield offering prospectuses or memoranda required
in relation to the Debt Financing (and any such bank information memoranda,
high-yield offering prospectuses or memoranda shall contain disclosure and pro
forma financial statements (if any) reflecting the Surviving Corporation
and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligors), and (6) none of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries shall be required to enter into or approve any financing
or purchase agreement with respect to any matter relating to the Financing.
Parent shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for
all out of pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Company or its
Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation. Parent shall indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives for and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses, interest, awards, judgments and penalties suffered or
incurred by them prior to the Effective Time in connection with the Financing
or the arrangement of the Financing and any information utilized in connection
therewith (other than historical information relating to the Company or its
Subsidiaries); except in the event such termination is determined to have
arisen out of or resulted from the fraud, willful misconduct or intentional
misrepresentation of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective
Representatives, as determined by a final non-appealable judgment of a court
of competent jurisdiction. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Agreement, the Financing is and will remain the sole responsibility of
Parent and Merger Sub and none of the Company or any Subsidiaries or any of
their respective Representatives (x) shall be required to waive or amend any
terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any commitment or other fees or
reimburse any expenses prior to the Effective Time, or incur any liability or
give any indemnities or otherwise commit to take any action that is not
contingent on the Effective Time, or (y) shall have any liability or incur any
losses, damages or penalties with respect thereto.

(e) If a Commitment Letter is amended, replaced, supplemented or otherwise
modified, including as a result of obtaining alternative financing in
accordance with Section 7.11(b), or if Parent substitutes other debt or equity
financing for all or a portion of the Financing, each of Parent and the
Company shall comply with its covenants in Sections 7.11(a), 7.11(b), 7.11(c)
and 7.11(d) with respect to the Commitment Letter as so amended, replaced,
supplemented or otherwise modified and with respect to such other financing to
the same extent that Parent and the Company would have been obligated to
comply with respect to the Financing.

  

  

(f) All non-public or otherwise confidential information regarding the Company
obtained by Parent or its Representatives or any other Person pursuant to this
Section 7.11 shall be deemed Evaluation Material and shall be governed by the
provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, provided, that notwithstanding
the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, upon notice to the Company Parent
may provide such information to potential sources of capital and to rating
agencies and prospective lenders and investors during syndication of the Debt
Financing (including any alternative financing to be entered into pursuant to
Section 7.11(b)) subject to customary confidentiality arrangements with such
Persons regarding such information. Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge and
agree that the obtaining of the Financing is not a condition to the Merger
Closing.

Section 7.12. Other Actions.

  

  

(a) Takeover Statutes. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable to
the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement after the date of this Agreement, Parent, the
board of directors of Parent, the Company and the Company Board of Directors
shall each use its respective reasonable best efforts to grant such approvals
and take such actions as are reasonably necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize, to the extent
possible, the effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.

  

  

(b) Rights Agreement. The Company shall cause the Amended and Restated
Shareholder Rights Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2001 and as amended
effective April 20, 2009, and as further amended as of the date hereof (the
"Rights Plan"), by and between the Company and Computershare Trust Company,
N.A. (as successor for EquiServe Trust Company, N.A.), to terminate upon the
Effective Time. The Company has taken and will continue to take all actions
necessary so that neither the execution nor delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (including the Offer, the
Top-Up Option and the Merger) will cause any rights to be granted under the
Rights Plan or cause the rights previously granted under the Rights Plan to
become exercisable.

  

  

(c) Section 16 Matters. The Company Board of Directors shall take all such
actions as may be necessary or appropriate to cause any disposition of the
Shares or conversion of any derivative securities in respect of such Shares in
connection with the consummation of the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under
Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

  

  

(d) Rule 14d-10(d) Matters. Prior to the expiration of the Offer, the
Compensation Committee of the Company Board of Directors shall take all such
steps as may be required to cause each agreement, arrangement or understanding
entered into by the Company or its Subsidiaries on or after the date hereof
with any of its officers, directors or employees pursuant to which
consideration is paid to such officer, director or employee to be approved as
an "employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(1) under the Exchange Act and to satisfy
the requirements of the non-exclusive safe harbor set forth in Rule 14d-10(d)
under the Exchange Act.

  

  

(e) Other Actions By Parent and Merger Sub. Parent and Merger Sub shall
refrain (and shall each use their reasonable best efforts to cause their
respective Affiliates to refrain) from taking, directly or indirectly, any
action that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in the aggregate,
prevent, materially delay or materially impede the consummation of the Offer,
the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
Parent shall, promptly following execution of this Agreement, approve and
adopt this Agreement in its capacity as sole shareholder of Merger Sub and
deliver to the Company evidence of its vote or action by written consent
approving and adopting this Agreement in accordance with applicable Law and
the articles of incorporation and bylaws of Merger Sub.

CONDITIONS

  

  

Section 8.1. Conditions to Each Party's Obligation to Effect the Merger. The
respective obligation of each party to effect the Merger is subject to the
satisfaction or waiver in writing if permissible under applicable Law, at or
prior to the Effective Time, of each of the following conditions:

  

  

(a) Shareholder Approval. If required by applicable Law, the Company Requisite
Vote shall have been obtained.

  

  

(b) No Injunction. No court or other Governmental Entity of competent
jurisdiction shall have enacted, issued, promulgated, enforced or entered any
Law (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that is in effect and
restrains, enjoins or otherwise prohibits consummation of the Merger or makes
it illegal (collectively, an "Order").

  

  

(c) Antitrust Approval. The waiting period applicable to the consummation of
the Merger and, unless the Offer Termination shall have occurred, the Offer
under the HSR Act shall have expired or been terminated and any applicable
consent or approvals pursuant to German antitrust or merger control Laws shall
have been obtained.

  

  

(d) Purchase of Shares in the Offer. Solely if the Offer Closing has occurred,
Merger Sub shall have accepted for payment all Shares validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer.

  

  

  

Section 8.2. Conditions to the Obligations of Parent and Merger Sub. Solely if
the Offer Termination shall have occurred or the Offer Closing shall not have
occurred, the obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to effect the Merger are
further subject to the satisfaction or waiver in writing if permissible under
applicable Law, at or prior to the Effective Time, of the following
conditions:

  

  

(a) No Company Material Adverse Effect. Since the date of this Agreement,
there shall not have occurred any change, event or occurrence that has had or
would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect.

  

  

(b) Representations and Warranties. The representations and warranties of the
Company (i) set forth in Sections 5.2(a), 5.2(b), 5.2(d), 5.3 and 5.13 shall

and as of the Merger Closing Date, as though made on the Merger Closing Date,
and (ii) set forth in this Agreement, other than those Sections specifically
identified in clause (i) of this Section 8.2(b), shall be true and correct as
of the date of this Agreement and as of the Merger Closing Date, as though
made on the Merger Closing Date (disregarding for purposes of this Section
8.2(b)(ii) all qualifications or limitations set forth in any representations
or warranties as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" and
words of similar import set forth therein), except to the extent that any such
representation and warranty expressly speaks as of a specified date or time,
in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and correct as of
such specified date or time, provided, however, that notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the condition set forth in this clause (ii)
shall be deemed to have been satisfied even if any representations and
warranties of the Company are not so true and correct unless the failure of
such representations and warranties of the Company to be so true and correct
has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect. Solely for the purposes of clause (i) above, if one or more
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties set forth in Section
5.2(a), 5.2(b) or 5.2(d) would cause damages or diminution in value to Parent
or Merger Sub of $5 million or more, or would cause the aggregate amount
required to be paid by Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the Offer, exercise
the Top-Up Option, effectuate the Merger, consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement on the Merger Closing Date and pay all fees and
expenses in connection therewith, to increase by $5 million or more, such
inaccuracy or inaccuracies will be considered material for purposes of clause

the obligations of the Company to effect the Merger are further subject to the
satisfaction or waiver in writing if permissible under applicable Law, at or
prior to the Effective Time, of the following conditions:

Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this Agreement shall be true and correct
(A) as of the date of this Agreement and (B) as of the Merger Closing Date
(disregarding for purposes of this Section 8.3(a) all qualifications or
limitations set forth in any representations or warranties as to "materiality"
and "Parent Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar import set forth
therein) as though made on and as of such date and time (except to the extent
that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of a specified
date or time, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true and
correct as of such specified date or time), provided, however, that
notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the condition set
forth in this Section 8.3(a) shall be deemed to have been satisfied even if
any representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub are not so true

(ii) (A) any Law shall have been enacted, entered or promulgated prohibiting

obligations under this Agreement; or

  

  

(iii) the Company Shareholders shall have failed to approve this Agreement at
the Shareholders' Meeting or at any adjournment or postponement thereof.

  

  

(c) by the Company, upon written notice to Parent specifying the provision or

in a failure of a condition set forth in Section 8.3(a) or Section 8.3(b), and
(B) has not been cured within thirty (30) days following notice by the Company
of such breach; provided that the Company shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 9.1(c)(ii) if (1) the

Parent shall have failed to consummate the Merger by the time set forth in
Section 1.6.

(i) the Company Board of Directors shall have made a Change of Recommendation
or a Change of Recommendation shall have otherwise occurred; provided that
Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
Section 9.1(d)(i) if (A) the Offer Closing shall have occurred or (B) if
required by applicable Law, the Company Requisite Vote shall have been
obtained; or

  

  

(ii) there has been a material breach by the Company of any representation,
warranty, covenant or other agreement contained herein, or if a representation
or warranty of the Company shall have become untrue, which in either case, (A)
would result in (1) if the Offer Termination shall have occurred, a failure of
a condition set forth in Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c), or (2) if the Offer
Termination shall not have occurred, the failure of any condition to the Offer
set forth in clauses (b) or (d) of Exhibit A, and (B) has not been cured
within thirty (30) days following notice by Parent of such breach; provided
that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

Offer Closing shall have occurred.

  

  

Section 9.2. Effect of Termination and Abandonment. In the event of
termination of this Agreement and the abandonment of the Offer, the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby pursuant to this Article IX, this
Agreement shall become void and of no effect with no liability to any Person
on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its Representatives or
Affiliates); provided, however, that the provisions set forth in Section 7.9,
the second to last and third to last sentences of Section 7.11(d), this
Section 9.2, Section 9.3 and Article X and the Confidentiality Agreement and
the Guaranty shall survive termination of this Agreement in accordance with
their terms.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-62-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Section 9.3. Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) If, but only if, the Agreement is terminated by (A) either Parent or the
Company pursuant to Section 9.1(b)(i) or Section 9.1(b)(iii) or by Parent
pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(ii), and (B) the Company (1) receives or has
received an Acquisition Proposal from a Third Party after the date hereof,
which Acquisition Proposal is publicly disclosed either (x) at or prior to the
time of the Shareholders' Meeting or (y) prior to the termination of this
Agreement if there has been no Shareholders' Meeting, and (2) within twelve
(12) months of the termination of this Agreement, enters into a transaction in
connection with an Acquisition Proposal (regardless of whether such
Acquisition Proposal is the same one referred to in clause (1) above), then
the Company shall pay, or cause to be paid, to Parent (or such person who may
be designated by Parent) an amount equal to the Company Termination Fee not
later than the second (2nd) Business Day following the date of the
consummation of such transaction. Solely for purposes of this Section 9.3(a),
the term "Acquisition Proposal" shall have the meaning assigned to such term
in Section 10.7(a), except that all references to 20% therein shall be deemed
to be references to 50%.

  

  

(b) If:

  

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i); or

  

  

(ii) Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(d)(i),

  

  

then the Company shall pay Parent the Company Termination Fee (as defined
below) payable by wire transfer of same day funds (A) concurrently with such
termination, in the case of clause (i), and (B) within five (5) Business Days
after such termination, in the case of clause (ii). In no event shall the
Company be required to pay the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. As used herein, "Company Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount
equal to $45 million less any Parent Expenses previously paid in accordance
with Section 9.3(d), except that in the event that this Agreement is
terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(i) (1) on or after the
No-Shop Period Start Time in order to enter into a definitive agreement with
respect to an Acquisition Proposal with a Person or group of Persons that at
such time is an Exempted Person or (2) prior to the No-Shop Period Start Time,
the "Company Termination Fee" shall mean a cash amount equal to $25 million
less any Parent Expenses previously paid in accordance with Section 9.3(d).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement (including Section
10.5), each of Parent and Merger Sub acknowledges and agrees on behalf of
itself and its Affiliates that if the Company Termination Fee becomes payable
and is paid by the Company pursuant to this Section 9.3, the right to receive
the Company Termination Fee, together with reimbursement of any applicable
expenses pursuant to Section 9.3(e), shall constitute each of Parent's and
Merger Sub's and each of their Affiliates' and Representatives' sole and
exclusive remedy under this Agreement, and the receipt of the Company
Termination Fee shall be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all
losses or damages suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub, each of their
Affiliates and Representatives and any other Person in connection with this
Agreement (and the termination hereof), the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby (and the abandonment or
termination thereof) or any matter forming the basis for such termination, and
none of Parent, Merger Sub, their respective Affiliates or Representatives or
any other Person shall be entitled to bring or maintain any claim, action or
proceeding against the Company or any Affiliate arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby or thereby (or the
abandonment or termination thereof) or any matters forming the basis for such
termination. Parent shall not be entitled to specific performance under
Section 10.5(d) or Section 10.5(e) if the Company has paid in full, and Parent
or Merger Sub has accepted, the Company Termination Fee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-63-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) If:

  

  

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(ii) and
the material breach by Parent or Merger Sub is the principal factor in the
failure of the Offer or the Merger to be consummated;

  

  

(ii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iii); or

  

  

(iii) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(c)(iv),

  

  

then in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section 9.3(c),
in each case only if the condition set forth in Section 8.2(a) has been
satisfied, Parent shall pay to the Company a termination fee of $90 million,
in cash (the "Parent Termination Fee") by wire transfer of same day funds as
promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two (2) Business
Days following the date of termination of this Agreement), it being understood
that in no event shall Parent be required to pay the Parent Termination Fee on
more than one occasion. Subject to Section 10.5, the Company acknowledges and
agrees on behalf of itself, its Affiliates and the Company Shareholders, that
the Company's right to receive payment of the Parent Termination Fee in
accordance with this Section 9.3, together with reimbursement of any
applicable expenses pursuant to Section 9.3(e), shall be the sole and
exclusive remedy of the Company, its Affiliates and the Company Shareholders
against Parent, Merger Sub, Guarantor, Financing Sources or any of their
respective former, current or future general or limited partners,
shareholders, financing sources, managers, members, directors, officers or
Affiliates (collectively, the "Parent Related Parties") for any loss suffered
as a result of the failure of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
the Commitment Letters, the Guaranty, the Offer, the Top-Up Option, the Merger
or the transactions contemplated hereby to be consummated or for a breach or
failure to perform hereunder or otherwise relating to or arising out of this
Agreement, the Commitment Letters, the Guaranty, the Offer, the Top-Up Option,
the Merger or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon payment of such
amount none of the Parent Related Parties shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. The Company shall not be entitled to specific performance
under Section 10.5(d) or Section 10.5(e) if the Parent has paid in full, and
the Company has accepted, the Parent Termination Fee.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-64-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) In the event that: (i) the Company shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1(b)(iii); or (ii) Parent shall terminate this Agreement pursuant
to Section 9.1(b)(iii) or Section 9.1(d)(ii); then in any such event the
Company shall pay Parent or its designees, as promptly as possible (but in any
event within 2 Business Days) following the delivery by Parent of an invoice
therefor, all out-of-pocket fees and expenses incurred by Parent, Merger Sub
and their respective Affiliates in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing ("Parent Expenses");
provided that the Company shall not be required to pay more than an aggregate
of $10 million in Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 9.3(d). The
expenses payable pursuant to this Section 9.3(d) shall be paid by wire
transfer of same day funds within ten (10) Business Days after demand therefor
following the occurrence of the termination event giving rise to the payment
obligation described in this Section 9.3(d). The payment of the expense
reimbursement pursuant to this Section 9.3(d) shall not relieve the Company of
any subsequent obligation to pay the applicable Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 9.3(a).

  

  

(e) The parties acknowledge that the agreements contained in this Section 9.3
are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and
that, without these agreements, none of the parties would enter into this
Agreement; accordingly, if the Company or Parent fails to promptly pay any
amount it is required to pay pursuant to this Section 9.3, and, in order to
obtain such payment, the party entitled to receive such payment commences a
suit that results in a judgment against the party required to pay all or any
portion of such amount, the party required to pay such amount shall also pay
to the other party, such other party's costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with such suit, together with interest
on the amount of the fee from the date such payment was required to be made
until the date of payment, at the prime lending rate prevailing during such
period, as published in The Wall Street Journal.

MISCELLANEOUS AND GENERAL

  

  

Section 10.1. Survival. This Article X and the agreements of the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub contained in Article IV and Sections 7.8 (Employee
Matters), 7.9 (Expenses) and 7.10 (Indemnification; Directors' and Officers'
Insurance) shall survive the consummation of the Merger. This Article X and
the agreements of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub contained in Section 7.9
(Expenses), the second to last and third to last sentences of Section 7.11(d)
(Financing), Section 9.2 (Effect of Termination and Abandonment), Section 9.3
(Termination Fee), the Confidentiality Agreement and the Guaranty shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. All other representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements in this Agreement shall not survive the
consummation of the Merger or the termination of this Agreement.

  

  

Section 10.2. Modification or Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the
parties at any time before or after the Offer Closing shall have occurred or
receipt of the Company Requisite Vote; provided, however, that (a) after the
Offer Closing, there shall be no amendment that decreases the Offer Price or
the Per Share Merger Consideration, and (b) after the Company Requisite Vote
has been obtained, there shall be made no amendment that by Law requires
further approval by the Company Shareholders without such approval having been
obtained. This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties.

Section 10.3. Waiver of Rights. Subject to Section 10.2 above, any party
hereto may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the covenants,
obligations or other acts of any other party hereto or (b) to the extent
permitted by Law, waive any inaccuracy of any representations or warranties or
compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions of any other
party or with any conditions to its own obligations; provided, however, that
after the Company Requisite Vote has been obtained, no waiver shall be made
that by Law (including the relevant rules of Nasdaq) requires further approval
by the Company Shareholders without the further approval of such Company
Shareholders. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party by its duly authorized officer. The
failure of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this

matter of such dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
Section 10.6 or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law shall be valid
and sufficient service thereof.

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-66-  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, each of the parties hereto hereby agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise against the Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including any dispute arising out of or
relating in any way to the Debt Financing or the performance thereof, in any
forum other than a court of competent jurisdiction located within the Borough
of Manhattan in the City of New York, New York, whether a state or Federal
court, and that the provisions of Section 10.5(c) relating to the waiver of
jury trial shall apply to any such action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim
or third-party claim.

  

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY, AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 10.5.

  

  

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the right of the Company to obtain an
injunction, or other appropriate form of specific performance or equitable
relief, in each case, solely with respect to causing Parent and Merger Sub to
cause the Equity Financing to be funded at any time but only simultaneously
with the receipt of the Debt Financing (whether under this Agreement, the
Equity Commitment Letter or the Guaranty) shall be subject to the requirements
that:

  

  

(i) all the conditions set forth in Section 8.1 (other than Section 8.1(d), to
the extent the Offer Termination has occurred) and Section 8.2 were satisfied
(other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied by
actions taken at the Merger Closing, but subject to the prior or substantially
concurrent satisfaction or waiver of such conditions),

  

  

 

(ii) the Debt Financing has been funded or would be funded (or if such Debt
Financing has been funded into escrow such funds have been or would be
released) in accordance with the terms thereof (or, in the case alternative
Debt Financing has been obtained in accordance with Section 7.11 for all the
Debt Financing, such alternative Debt Financing has been funded or would be
funded in accordance with the terms thereof) at the Merger Closing, if the
Equity Financing is funded at the Merger Closing, and

 

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

-67-

conditions in Section 8.1 and Section 8.3 have been satisfied or that it is
willing to waive any such open conditions, (B) if specific performance is
granted and (C) if the Equity Financing and the Debt Financing were funded,
the Merger Closing would occur.

  

  

(e) Subject to Section 10.5(d), the parties agree not to assert that a remedy
of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or
inequitable for any reason, nor to assert that a remedy of monetary damages
would provide an adequate remedy. Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges
and agrees that, except as set forth in Section 10.5(d), (i) each party shall
be entitled to seek to specifically enforce the terms and provisions of this
Agreement notwithstanding the availability of any monetary remedy set forth in
Section 9.3, (ii) the provisions set forth in Section 9.3 (A) are not intended
to and do not adequately compensate for the harm that would result from a
breach of this Agreement and (B) shall not be construed to diminish or
otherwise impair in any respect any party's right to specific enforcement, and
(iii) the right of specific enforcement is an integral part of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without that right, neither
the Company nor Parent would have entered into this Agreement.

Exhibit A

  


 

  

Conditions of the Offer

  

  

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or this Agreement, Merger Sub
shall not be required to, and Parent shall not be required to cause Merger Sub
to, accept for payment or, subject to any applicable rules and regulations of
the SEC, including Rule 14e-1(c) under the Exchange Act (relating to Merger
Sub's obligation to pay for or return tendered Shares promptly after the
termination or withdrawal of the Offer), to pay for any Shares tendered
pursuant to the Offer unless, by the expiration of the Offer (as it may be
extended in accordance with Section 1.1 of this Agreement), (i) there shall
have been validly tendered and not withdrawn that number of Shares which, when
added to the Shares already owned by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, would
represent at least 84% of the outstanding Shares on a fully-diluted basis
(such number of shares, the "Minimum Tender Condition"), (ii) Parent (either
directly or through its Subsidiaries) shall have received the proceeds of the
Debt Financing (or any alternative financing) and/or the lenders party to the
Debt Commitment Letter (or a new commitment letter for any alternative
financing) shall have confirmed to Parent or Merger Sub that the Debt
Financing (or any alternative financing) will be available at the Offer
Closing in an amount sufficient to consummate the Offer Closing and the Merger
Closing on the terms and conditions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter
(or a new commitment letter for any alternative financing) ("Financing
Proceeds Condition") and (iii) each of the following conditions shall have
occurred and be continuing as of the expiration of the Offer:

  

  

(a) No temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or
other order issued by any court of competent jurisdiction or other legal
restraint or prohibition (including, any statute, rule, regulation,
injunction, order or decree proposed, enacted, enforced, promulgated, issued
or deemed applicable to, or any consent or approval withheld with respect to,
the Offer or the Merger, by any Governmental Entity) enjoining or otherwise
preventing or prohibiting the consummation of the Offer or the Merger, or
making the Merger or Offer illegal, shall be in effect;

  

  

(b) The representations and warranties of the Company (i) set forth in
Sections 5.2(a), 5.2(b), 5.2(d), 5.3 and 5.13 shall be true and correct in all
material respects, and (ii) set forth in this Agreement, other than those
Sections specifically identified in clause (i) of this paragraph (b), shall be
true and correct (disregarding for purposes of this clause (ii) all
qualifications or limitations set forth in any representations or warranties
as to "materiality" or "Company Material Adverse Effect" and words of similar
import therein) except, with respect to both clause (i) and clause (ii), to
the extent that any such representation and warranty expressly speaks as of a
specified date, in which case such representation and warranty shall be true
and correct as of such specified date, provided, however, that notwithstanding
anything contained herein to the contrary, the condition set forth in this
clause (ii) shall be deemed to have been satisfied even if any representations
and warranties of the Company are not so true and correct unless the failure
of such representations and warranties of the Company to be so true and
correct has had or would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material
Adverse Effect; provided, further, however, solely for the purposes of clause
(i) above, if one or more inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
set forth in Section 5.2(a), 5.2(b), or 5.2(d) would cause damages or
diminution in value to Parent or Merger Sub of $5 million or would cause the
aggregate amount required to be paid by Parent and/or Merger Sub to effectuate
the Merger, refinance the Company's Indebtedness, consummate the Offer and
exercise the Top-Up Option, consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement and pay all fees and expenses in connection therewith, to increase
by $5 million or more, such inaccuracy or inaccuracies will be considered
material for purposes of clause (i) of this paragraph (b);

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

Exhibit A-1  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(c) Since the date of this Agreement, there shall not have occurred any
change, event or occurrence that has had or would reasonably be expected to
have a Company Material Adverse Effect;

  

  

(d) The Company shall have performed and complied with, in all material
respects, its obligations, agreements and covenants to be performed or
complied with by it under this Agreement on or prior to the expiration of the
Offer;

  

  

(e) The Company shall have delivered to Parent a certificate signed by an
officer of the Company and certifying as to the satisfaction by the Company,
of the applicable conditions specified in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of this
Exhibit A;

  

  

(f) The applicable waiting period under the HSR Act shall have expired or been
terminated and any applicable consent or approvals pursuant to German
antitrust or merger control Laws shall have been obtained;

  

  

(g) In the event that the Top-Up Option is necessary to ensure that Parent or
Merger Sub owns at least one Share more than 90% of the outstanding Shares on
a fully diluted basis immediately after the exercise thereof, there shall be
no Law restraining Merger Sub's ability and right to (i) exercise the Top-Up
Option or (ii) issue the Shares upon exercise of the Top-Up Option, which
together with the Shares validly tendered in the Offer and not withdrawn,
shall be sufficient for Merger Sub to own at least one Share more than 90% of
the Shares on a fully diluted basis; and

  

  

(h) This Agreement shall not have been terminated in accordance with its
terms.

  

  

The foregoing conditions shall be in addition to, and not a limitation of, the
rights and obligations of Parent and Merger Sub to extend, terminate or modify
the Offer pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

  

  

The foregoing conditions (other than the Minimum Tender Condition) are for the
sole benefit of Parent and Merger Sub, and may (other than the Minimum Tender
Condition) be waived by Parent or Merger Sub in whole or in part at any time
and from time to time, subject in each case to the terms of this Agreement
(including Section 1.1(a)) and applicable Law. The failure by Parent or Merger
Sub at any time to exercise any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a
waiver of any such right and each right shall be deemed an ongoing right that
may be asserted at any time and from time to time.
