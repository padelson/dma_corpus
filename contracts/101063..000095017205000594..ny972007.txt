                            STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         THIS STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT ("Agreement") is made this 22nd day of
February, 2005, by and between Chiquita Brands International, Inc., a New
Jersey corporation ("Purchaser"), and Performance Food Group Company, a
Tennessee corporation ("Seller").

         WHEREAS, Seller owns all of the issued and outstanding shares of the
capital stock of Fresh International Corp., a Delaware corporation, Fresh
Advantage, Inc., a Virginia corporation, Redi-Cut Foods, Inc., an Illinois
corporation, and K.C. Salad Holdings, Inc., a Missouri corporation
(collectively, the "Companies"); and

         WHEREAS, Purchaser desires to acquire from Seller, and Seller desires
to sell to Purchaser, all of the issued and outstanding shares of the capital
stock of the Companies upon and subject to the terms and conditions contained
in this Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual promises, covenants and
agreements herein contained, the parties agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1.
                          PURCHASE AND SALE OF SHARES

         1.1 TRANSFER OF SHARES. Subject to all of the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Closing, Seller hereby agrees to sell, transfer and
convey to Purchaser, and Purchaser agrees to purchase and acquire from Seller,
free and clear of all Encumbrances (as defined in Section 4.3), 100 shares of
common stock, no par value, of Fresh International Corp., 1,000 shares of
common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Fresh Advantage, Inc., 1,000 shares
of Class A common stock, no par value, of Redi-Cut Foods, Inc., and 1,000
shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of K.C. Salad Holdings,
Inc., which constitute all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Companies (collectively, the "Shares").

                                   ARTICLE 2.
                                 CONSIDERATION

         2.1 PURCHASE PRICE. The purchase price (the "Purchase Price") for the
Shares shall be $855,000,000, subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 2.3, if
applicable. At the Closing (as defined below), Purchaser shall deliver the
Purchase Price to Seller by wire transfer of immediately available funds
pursuant to the wire transfer instructions provided by Seller.

         2.2 OTHER PAYMENTS.

              (a) Payment of Cash and Outstanding Checks in Excess of Deposits.
         Purchaser agrees that it will pay to Seller at Closing an amount equal
         to the estimated amount of the following balance sheet line items (i)
         cash; and (ii) "outstanding checks (issued by Seller in payment of
         obligations of the Companies

<PAGE>

         and Subsidiaries) in excess of deposits" as of the most recently
         completed four or five-week fiscal period prior to the Closing Date
         for which financial statements of the Companies and their Subsidiaries
         prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the
         Financial Statements are available (the "Estimated Payment"). The
         "Estimated Payment Adjustment Amount" (which may be a positive or
         negative number) will be equal to the amount determined by subtracting
         the actual amount of (i) cash; and (ii) "outstanding checks (issued by
         Seller in payment of obligations of the Companies and Subsidiaries) in
         excess of deposits" as of the Closing Date as set forth in the
         applicable line items in the Closing Date Financial Statements (the
         "Actual Payment Amount") from the Estimated Payment.

              (b) Working Capital Adjustment Amount. "Working Capital" as of a
         given date shall mean the amount calculated by subtracting the current
         liabilities of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (including
         "outstanding checks (issued by Seller in payment of obligations of the
         Companies and Subsidiaries) in excess of deposits," but excluding (i)
         liabilities for income taxes, (ii) capital lease obligations, (iii)
         interest payable, (iv) the current portion of long-term debt, (v)
         intercompany payables owing to Seller or its Subsidiaries and (vi) any
         Seller insurance allocation accrual), as of that date from the current
         assets of the Companies and their Subsidiaries (other than (i) cash,
         (ii) current deferred income tax assets, (iii) any other income Tax
         assets and (iv) intercompany receivables owed by Seller or its
         Subsidiaries) as of that date; provided, that, for the avoidance of
         doubt, calculations of inventory and accounts receivable shall be net
         of the applicable reserve. The "Average Working Capital" of the
         Companies and their Subsidiaries shall be equal to the average of the
         Working Capital as of the last day of each of the 12 most recently
         completed four or five-week fiscal periods prior to the Closing Date
         for which internally prepared financial statements of the Companies
         and their Subsidiaries prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
         applied with the Financial Statements are available. The "WC
         Adjustment Amount" (which may be a positive or negative number) will
         be equal to the amount determined by subtracting the Closing Date
         Working Capital (as defined below) from the Average Working Capital.
         For the avoidance of doubt, Seller shall be fully responsible for the
         payment of, and shall make payment when due on, any "outstanding
         checks in excess of deposits" as of the Closing Date to the extent
         such amount has been included in the Estimated Payment and the Actual
         Payment Amount. An example of the internally prepared financial
         statements and calculation of Working Capital as of January 1, 2005 is
         attached as Section 2.2(b) of the Disclosure Schedule.

              (c) Post-Closing Payment. The Estimated Payment Adjustment Amount
         and the WC Adjustment Amount when added together (which may be a
         positive or negative number) shall collectively be referred to as the
         "Adjustment Amount." If the Adjustment Amount is positive, the
         Adjustment Amount shall be paid by wire transfer by Seller to an
         account specified by Purchaser. If the Adjustment Amount is negative,
         the Adjustment Amount (treated as if it were a positive number) shall
         be paid by wire transfer by Purchaser to an account


                                       2
<PAGE>

         specified by Seller. All payments shall be made together with interest
         at a rate of 3% per annum, which interest shall begin accruing on the
         Closing Date and end on the date that the payment is made. Within
         three business days after the calculation of the Actual Payment Amount
         and Closing Date Working Capital becomes binding and conclusive on the
         parties pursuant to Section 2.2(d), Seller or Purchaser, as the case
         may be, shall make the wire transfer payment provided for in this
         Section 2.2(c).

              (d) Adjustment Procedure.

                     (i) Seller shall prepare financial statements (including a
              combined balance sheet as of the Closing Date and a combined
              statement of operations from January 2, 2005 through the Closing
              Date) (the "Closing Date Financial Statements") of the Companies
              and their Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date in accordance with
              GAAP consistently applied with the Financial Statements. Seller
              shall then determine (A) the Actual Payment Amount and the
              Working Capital as of the Closing Date (the "Closing Date Working
              Capital") based upon the Closing Date Financial Statements and
              (B) the Average Working Capital based on the financial statements
              of the Companies and their Subsidiaries prepared in accordance
              with GAAP consistently applied with the Financial Statements for
              each of the 12 most recently completed four or five-week fiscal
              periods prior to the Closing Date for which internally prepared
              financial statements of the Companies and their Subsidiaries
              prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently applied with the
              Financial Statements are available (the "Monthly Statements").
              Seller shall deliver the Closing Date Financial Statements, the
              Monthly Statements and its determination of the Actual Payment
              Amount, the Average Working Capital and the Closing Date Working
              Capital (which shall include a description in reasonable detail
              of the components and amounts thereof) to Purchaser within thirty
              (30) days following the Closing Date.

                     (ii) If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the
              Closing Date Financial Statements, the Monthly Statements and the
              calculation of the Actual Payment Amount, the Average Working
              Capital and the Closing Date Working Capital, Purchaser has not
              given Seller written notice of its objection as to the Actual
              Payment Amount, the Average Working Capital and/or the Closing
              Date Working Capital calculation (which notice shall state in
              reasonable detail the basis of Purchaser's objection), then the

              respectively.

                     (iii) If Purchaser duly gives Seller such notice of

              and information relating to the disputed issues as the
              Accountants may request and are available to that party or its
              agents and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the
              Accountants any material relating to the disputed issues and to
              discuss the issues with the Accountants; (ii) the determination
              by the Accountants, as set forth in a notice to be delivered to
              both Seller and Purchaser within sixty (60) days of the
              submission to the Accountants of the issues remaining in dispute,
              shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and shall
              be used in the calculation of the Actual Payment Amount, the
              Average Working Capital and/or the Closing Date Working Capital,
              as applicable; and (iii) Seller and Purchaser will each bear
              fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of the Accountants for
              such determination.

         2.3  EBITDA ADJUSTMENT.

              (a) Concurrently with the delivery to Purchaser of the Audited
         Statements, Seller shall deliver to Purchaser a preliminary statement
         ("Preliminary EBITDA Statement") of the EBITDA based on the Audited
         Statements (which shall include a description in reasonable detail of
         the components and amounts thereof).

              (b) If within ten (10) days following delivery of the Preliminary
         EBITDA Statement, Purchaser has not given Seller written notice of its
         objection as to the calculation of EBITDA (which notice shall state in
         reasonable detail the basis of Purchaser's objection), then the EBITDA
         calculated by Seller shall be binding and conclusive on the parties
         and be used in computing any adjustment of the Purchase Price pursuant
         to this Section 2.3.

              (c) If Purchaser duly gives Seller such notice of objection,
         and if Seller and Purchaser fail to resolve the issues outstanding
         with respect to the Preliminary EBITDA Statement and the calculation
         of the EBITDA within ten (10) days of Seller's receipt of
         Purchaser's objection notice, Seller and Purchaser shall submit the
         issues remaining in dispute to the Accountants for resolution in
         accordance with the terms of the Agreement and consistent with the
         definition of EBITDA set forth herein. If issues are submitted to
         the Accountants for resolution: (i) Seller and Purchaser shall
         furnish or cause to be furnished to the Accountants such work papers
         and other documents and information relating to the disputed issues
         as the Accountants may request and are available to that party or
         its agents and shall be afforded the opportunity to present to the
         Accountants any material relating to


                                       4
<PAGE>

         the disputed issues and to discuss the issues with the Accountants;
         (ii) the determination by the Accountants, as set forth in a notice to
         be delivered to both Seller and Purchaser within ten (10) days of the
         submission to the Accountants of the issues remaining in dispute,
         shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties and shall be
         used in the calculation of any adjustment of the Purchase Price
         pursuant to this Section 2.3; and (iii) Seller and Purchaser will each
         bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees and costs of the Accountants for
         such determination.

              (d) In the event the amount of EBITDA set forth in Section 2.3(d)
         of the Disclosure Schedule (which shall include a description in
         reasonable detail of the components and amounts thereof, including the
         amount of any corporate allocation charge and any insurance allocation
         charge) exceeds by more than $4,000,000 the amount of EBITDA based on
         the Audited Statements as finally determined pursuant to this Section
         2.3, the Purchase Price shall be reduced by an amount equal to the
         product of (i) the difference between the amount of EBITDA set forth
         in Section 2.3(d) of the Disclosure Schedule and the amount of EBITDA
         based on the Audited Statements as finally determined pursuant to this
         Section 2.3 and (ii) 8.65. For the avoidance of doubt, an example of
         the calculation of EBITDA for the year ended January 1, 2005 is set
         forth in Section 2.3(d) of the Disclosure Schedule.

         4.5 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

              (a) Seller has made available to Purchaser true and complete
         copies of (i) the audited combined balance sheets as of January 3,

         unaudited combined balance sheet as of January 1, 2005 and related
         unaudited combined statements of earnings and statement of cash flows
         for the Companies and their Subsidiaries for the year ended January 1,
         2005 (collectively, the "Financial Statements"). The January 1, 2005
         balance sheet is referred to herein as the "Reference Balance Sheet."

              (b) The Financial Statements (i) have been prepared based on the
         books and records of the Companies and their Subsidiaries in
         accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles

         sufficient in all material respects to provide reasonable assurance

         recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in
         conformity with GAAP, (ii) that receipts and expenditures of the

         Subsidiaries subject to an informal inquiry by the Securities and
         Exchange Commission and under investigation by Seller's Audit
         Committee do not involve or affect the financial

         good faith calculation of excess raw product costs, fruit start-up
         costs, excess insurance allocation costs, executive severance costs

              Effect, or has given notice of breach or default to any other
              party thereunder; and

                     (ii) each Material Contract is valid and binding on each
              of the relevant Companies and their relevant Subsidiaries and, to
              the knowledge of Seller, each respective counterparty thereto,
              and each Material Contract is in full force and effect and is
              enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to general
              principles of equity and except as the enforceability thereof may

              or other similar laws of general application relating to
              creditors' rights. No third party to any Material Contract has

         4.9 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

              (a) Section 4.9 of the Disclosure Schedule sets forth a true and
         complete list of all (i) intellectual property registrations and
         applications, Internet domain names and material unregistered
         intellectual property owned by the Companies or any Subsidiary and (ii)
         material intellectual property licensed by the Companies or any
         Subsidiary (whether as licensee or licensor) (excluding "clickwrap" or
         "shrinkwrap" agreements, agreements contained in or pertaining to
         "off-the-shelf" software, and the terms of use or service for any
         website, to the extent each is commercially available to consumers on
         nondiscriminatory pricing terms). There are no pending actions against
         any of the Companies or any Subsidiary of which the Companies or any
         Subsidiary have been given written notice that assert that the
         Companies or any Subsidiary violate or infringe or unlawfully use the
         intellectual property rights of others or challenging the Companies' or
         any Subsidiary's ownership or use of, or the validity, enforceability
         or registrability of any intellectual property. To the knowledge of
         Seller, neither any of the Companies nor any Subsidiary violates,
         infringes upon or unlawfully uses any intellectual property owned by
         another Person. Neither any of the Companies nor any Subsidiary has
         received any written notice alleging any violation, infringement upon
         or unlawful use of any intellectual property rights of others or
         challenging the Companies' or any Subsidiary's ownership or use of, or


                                     13
<PAGE>

         the validity, enforceability or registrability of any intellectual
         property that remains unresolved on the date hereof. Except as set
         forth in Section 4.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, neither the
         Companies nor any Subsidiary has brought or threatened any Action
         against another Person involving intellectual property, and to the
         knowledge of Seller, there is no basis for any Action regarding the
         foregoing.

              (b) Except as set forth in Section 4.9(b) of the Disclosure
         Schedule, the Companies or a Subsidiary solely and exclusively owns
         all intellectual property owned by the Companies or a Subsidiary
         ("Companies Owned Intellectual Property") and has the valid and
         enforceable right to use all other material intellectual property used
         or held for use by the Companies or any Subsidiary ("Companies Used
         Intellectual Property"), free and clear of all material Encumbrances.

              (c) The Companies Owned Intellectual Property and, to the
         knowledge of Seller, any Companies Used Intellectual Property, (i) has
         been duly maintained, (ii) is subsisting, in full force and effect and
         (iii) has not been cancelled, expired or abandoned.

         4.10 LITIGATION, CLAIMS AND PROCEEDINGS. Except as set forth in
Section 4.10 of the Disclosure Schedule, there are no Actions that have been
brought by or against any Governmental Authority or any other Person pending
or, to the knowledge of Seller, threatened against or by the Companies, any
Subsidiary of the Companies, the Business, any Assets, or any of their Owned
Real Property or Leased Real Property, which, if adversely determined, would
result in liabilities in excess of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000) or
material injunctive or equitable relief, or would have a Seller Material
Adverse Effect. There are no existing Governmental Orders naming the Companies
or any Subsidiary as an affected party. Seller makes no representation in this
Section 4.10 as to any matter the subject matter of which is specifically
covered by Sections 4.9, 4.11, 4.13 or 4.14 of this Agreement.

         4.11 ENVIRONMENTAL AND SAFETY AND HEALTH MATTERS. Except as disclosed
in Section 4.11 of the Disclosure Schedule:

              (a) The Companies and their Subsidiaries have obtained all
         material Permits that are required under any Environmental Law for
         the operation of their businesses as currently being conducted. To
         Seller's knowledge, all such Permits are valid and in full force
         and effect, and will survive the Closing without material
         modification. "Environmental Law" means any applicable Law
         relating to (i) the protection, investigation or restoration of
         the environment or natural resources, (ii) the protection of human
         health and safety as it pertains to exposure to Hazardous
         Substances, or (iii) the handling, use, presence, disposal,
         treatment, storage, release or threatened release of any Hazardous
         Substance, and includes, without limitation, the Comprehensive
         Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Federal
         Water Pollution Control Act, the Clean Air Act, the Resource
         Conservation and Recovery Act, the Occupational Safety and Health


                                       14
<PAGE>

         Act, the Hazardous Materials Transportation Act, the Safe Drinking
         Water Act, the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide & Rodenticide Act, the
         National Environmental Policy Act, the Emergency Planning & Community
         Right-to Know Act, and any similar or analogous state statutes.
         "Hazardous Substance" means any substance that is (i) listed,
         classified or regulated pursuant to any Environmental Law, (ii) any
         petroleum product or by-product, (iii) any asbestos-containing material
         and (iv) any other substance which is the subject of regulatory action
         by any Governmental Authority pursuant to any Environmental Law or
         which may result in liability pursuant to any Environmental Law.

              (b) The Companies and their Subsidiaries are in material
         compliance with all material Permits required under all Environmental
         Laws that are used in the operation of their businesses as currently
         being conducted. The Companies and their Subsidiaries have
         historically been in compliance with all Permits required under all
         Environmental Laws, except where the failures to comply would not have
         a Seller Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of Seller, no
         circumstances exist which could cause any material Permit to be
         revoked, modified or rendered non-renewable upon payment of the permit
         fee.

              (c) The Companies, their Subsidiaries and their Real Property are
         in material compliance with all Environmental Laws. The Companies,
         their Subsidiaries and the Real Property have historically been in
         material compliance with all Environmental Laws, except where the
         failure to comply would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
         Seller Material Adverse Effect. To Seller's knowledge, no Hazardous
         Substance is located on any of the Real Property, except in material
         compliance with all Environmental Laws. To Seller's knowledge, no
         facts or circumstances exist which would reasonably be expected to
         involve any of the Companies or any Subsidiary in any environmental
         litigation, or impose upon the Purchaser or the Companies or their
         Subsidiaries any environmental liability which would have a Seller
         Material Adverse Effect.

              (d) To Seller's knowledge, neither any of the Companies nor any
         Subsidiary, nor, any other Person, has had a material disposal or
         release of any Hazardous Substances on, under, in, from, adjacent to
         or about the Real Property.

              (e) None of the Companies nor any Subsidiary has disposed or
         arranged for the disposal of Hazardous Substances on any third party
         property that has subjected or, to the knowledge of Seller, may
         subject the Companies or their Subsidiaries to material liability
         under any Environmental Law.

              (f) To Seller's knowledge, there has been no discharge or
         release at any property formerly owned, used, leased or occupied
         by the Companies or any Subsidiary which has subjected or is
         expected to subject the Companies or their Subsidiaries to
         material liability under any Environmental Law.

              (g) None of the Companies nor their Subsidiaries have
         received any written notice, demand, letter, claim or request
         for information alleging violation


                                    15
<PAGE>

         of or liability under any Environmental Law and neither the
         Companies nor their Subsidiaries are party to any written
         proceedings, actions, orders, decrees or injunctions alleging
         material liability under any Environmental Law.

              (h) None of the Companies or their Subsidiaries have entered
         into any agreement that may require them to pay to, reimburse,
         guarantee, pledge, defend, indemnify or hold harmless any person
         from or against any liabilities or costs arising in connection
         with or relating to Environmental Laws.

              (i) Seller has delivered or made available to Purchaser
         copies of all environmental assessments, audits, studies and other
         environmental reports in its possession relating to the Companies,
         their Subsidiaries and the Real Property.

              (j) Except for such expenditures that have been included in the
         projected budgets for the Companies or its Subsidiaries, which have
         been provided to Purchaser, to Seller's knowledge, none of the
         Companies nor their Subsidiaries is required to make any capital or
         other expenditures to comply with applicable Environmental Law
         exceeding $500,000.

         4.12 COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. Except as disclosed in Section 4.12 of the
Disclosure Schedule, to the knowledge of Seller, the Companies and the
Subsidiaries have conducted and are currently conducting their business in
accordance with all Laws and Governmental Orders applicable to the Companies or
any Subsidiary or any of the Assets, the Real Property or their business,
except where the violation of such Laws or Governmental Orders would not have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. Neither the Companies nor any Subsidiary has
received any outstanding or uncured written notice alleging any default or
violation of any Law or Governmental Order nor to Seller's knowledge is there
any reasonable basis for any such allegation, which, if true, would have a
Seller Material Adverse Effect. The Companies and the Subsidiaries have each
Permit required by Law for the operation of the Business, except where the
failure to have any such Permit would not have a Seller Material Adverse
Effect. Each Permit is valid, binding and in full force and effect and none of
the Companies or Subsidiaries is in default thereunder (or would be with the
giving of notice or lapse of time or both) except for such defaults as would
not have a Seller Material Adverse Effect. Seller makes no representation in
this Section 4.12 as to any matter the subject matter of which is specifically
covered by Section 4.9, 4.11, 4.13 or 4.14 of this Agreement.

         withdrawal from the Midwest Pension Plan. The aggregate withdrawal
         liability of the Companies, Subsidiaries and ERISA Affiliates,
         computed as if a complete withdrawal by the Companies, Subsidiaries
         and ERISA Affiliates had occurred under the Midwest Pension Plan on

              (g) Each Company Plan that is intended to be qualified within the
         meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code has received a determination
         letter from the Internal Revenue Service that it is so qualified, and
         no fact or event has occurred since the date of such determination
         letter that could adversely affect the qualified status of any such
         Company Plan.

              (h) As of the date hereof, Seller has not received any
         notification or other direct indication from any employee listed in

         law), as a transferee or successor, by contract or otherwise.

              (i) Each Affiliated Group has filed all Tax Returns that it was
         required to file for each taxable period during which any of the

         Commission;

              (h) neither the Companies nor the Subsidiaries shall pay
         liabilities or collect receivables other than in the ordinary course
         of business based on the normal terms thereof and consistent with past
         practice;

              (i) neither the Companies nor the Subsidiaries shall fail to
         maintain their books and records in their usual manner consistent with
         prior practice;

              (j) neither the Companies nor the Subsidiaries shall fail to
         maintain and manage inventories consistent in all material respects
         with past practice or fail to use reasonable efforts to maintain the
         Real Property or tangible personal property used or held for use in
         the Business in good repair and condition, subject to reasonable wear
         and tear;

              (k) neither the Companies nor the Subsidiaries shall fail to use
         reasonable efforts to retain key employees and consultants and to
         preserve the goodwill of customers, suppliers and other business

              (l) the Companies shall not enter into, or permit any of their
         Subsidiaries to enter into, any commitments or agreements to do any of
         the foregoing.

         6.2  CONSENTS.

              (a) Each of Seller and Purchaser shall, in no event later than
         seven (7) business days following the date hereof, file with the
         United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC") and the United
         States Department of Justice (the "DOJ") the notification and report
         form pursuant to the HSR Act, required for the transactions
         contemplated hereby. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall, as promptly
         as practicable, comply with any request for additional information and


                                    26
<PAGE>

         documents pursuant to the HSR Act. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall
         inform the other promptly of any communication made by or on behalf of
         such party to (including permitting the other party to review such
         communication in advance), or received from, the FTC or the DOJ and
         shall furnish to the other such information and assistance as the
         other may reasonably request in connection with its preparation of any
         filing, submission or other act that is necessary or advisable under
         the HSR Act. Seller and Purchaser shall keep each other timely
         apprised of the status of any communications with, and any inquiries
         or requests for additional information from, the FTC or the DOJ, and
         shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Neither party
         shall agree to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
         Authority in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry
         unless it consults with the other party in advance, and to the extent
         permitted by such Governmental Authority, gives the other party the
         opportunity to attend and participate thereat. Purchaser agrees to
         take as promptly as reasonably practicable any and all steps necessary
         to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust or
         competition law that may be asserted by any U.S. federal, state or
         local antitrust or competition authority so as to enable the parties
         to expeditiously close the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement, including committing to or effecting, by consent decree,
         hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture or
         disposition of such of its assets or businesses, or of the business to
         be acquired by it pursuant to this Agreement, as is required to be
         divested in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution
         of, any decree, order, judgment, injunction, temporary restraining
         order or other order in any suit or proceeding, that would otherwise
         have the effect of delaying or preventing the consummation of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In addition, without
         limiting the generality of the foregoing regarding Governmental
         Authorities, Purchaser agrees to take promptly any and all steps
         necessary to attempt to vacate or lift any order or other restraint
         relating to antitrust matters that would have the effect of making the
         transaction contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise
         prohibiting its consummation.

              (b) The parties hereto shall cooperate with one another in
         determining whether any action by or in respect of, or filing with,
         any Governmental Authority (excluding the actions and filings
         described in clause (a) above) is required or reasonably appropriate,
         or any action, consent, approval or waiver from any party to any
         Material Contract is required or reasonably appropriate, in connection
         with the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and
         the Confidentiality Agreement (as defined in Section 6.4), in taking
         such actions or making any such filings, the parties hereto shall
         furnish information required in connection therewith and timely seek
         to obtain any such actions, consents, approvals or waivers.

         6.3 PUBLICITY. Subject to their respective legal obligations
(including requirements of stock exchanges, national stock markets and other
similar regulatory bodies), Seller and Purchaser shall consult with each
other, and use reasonable best efforts to agree upon the text of any press
release, before issuing any such press release or


                                    27
<PAGE>

otherwise making public statements with respect to the transactions
contemplated hereby and in making any filings with any federal or state
governmental or regulatory agency or with any national securities exchange
or national stock market with respect thereto. Seller and Purchaser shall
mutually agree on the timing and content of providing notification of the
transactions contemplated hereby to customers and key suppliers.

         6.4 ACCESS TO RECORDS AND PROPERTIES.

              (a) From the date hereof until the Closing Date or earlier
         termination of this Agreement, Seller will, and will cause the
         Companies and their Subsidiaries to:

                     (i) provide Purchaser and its officers, counsel and other
              representatives with reasonable access during normal business
              hours to the facilities of the Companies and Subsidiaries, their
              principal personnel and representatives, and such books and
              records pertaining to the Companies and Subsidiaries as Purchaser
              may reasonably request, including access to all auditor work
              papers and opinions with respect to the Financial Statements and
              access to conduct non-intrusive Phase I environmental
              investigations of the Real Property, provided that (i) Purchaser
              agrees that such access will give due regard to minimizing
              interference with the operations, activities and employees of the
              Companies and their Subsidiaries, (ii) such access and disclosure
              would not violate the terms of any agreement to which the
              Companies or any Subsidiary is bound (provided that, promptly
              following the date hereof, Seller shall disclose the existence of
              any such agreement and the nature and scope of the applicable
              restrictions thereunder to Purchaser and provided further that
              Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
              any consents necessary to provide such access or disclosure under
              such agreements) or any applicable Law, and (iii) all
              arrangements for access shall be made solely through Seller; and

                     (ii) furnish to Purchaser or its representatives (A)
              within 20 days of the close of each fiscal month, monthly
              combined financial statements (including a combined balance sheet
              and a combined statement of operations) of the Companies and the
              Subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with GAAP consistently
              applied with the Financial Statements and in accordance with past
              practice, (B) within 40 days of the close of each fiscal quarter,
              quarterly combined financial statements (including a combined
              balance sheet and a combined statement of operations) of the
              Companies and the Subsidiaries, prepared in accordance with GAAP
              consistently applied with the Financial Statements and in
              accordance with Regulation S-X under the Securities Exchange Act
              of 1934, as amended, and (C) such additional financial and
              operating data and other information relating to the Companies
              and each of their Subsidiaries as may be reasonably requested, to
              the extent access to and disclosure of such additional financial
              and operating data would not violate the terms of any


                                     28
<PAGE>

              agreement to which the Companies or any Subsidiary is bound
              (provided that, promptly following the date hereof, Seller shall
              disclose the existence of any such agreement and the nature and
              scope of the applicable restrictions thereunder (to the extent
              permissible under such agreement) to Purchaser and provided
              further that Seller shall use its commercially reasonable efforts
              to obtain any consents necessary to provide such access or
              disclosure under such agreements) or any applicable Law.

              Without limiting the foregoing, as promptly as practicable
              following the date hereof, Seller shall furnish to Purchaser
              copies of any Material Contracts not previously made available to
              Purchaser; provided that, in the case of Material Contracts that
              by their terms do not permit Seller to provide copies to
              Purchaser, Seller shall disclose the existence of any such
              agreement and the nature and scope of the applicable restrictions
              thereunder (to the extent permissible under such agreement) to
              Purchaser and shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
              obtain any consents necessary to provide Purchaser with a copy of
              such Material Contract.

              Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that all information so
              received from the other party hereto shall be deemed received
              pursuant to the Confidentiality Agreement dated October 5, 2004
              between the parties (the "Confidentiality Agreement") and that
              each shall, and shall cause its affiliates and each of its and
              their representatives to, comply with the provisions of the
              Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such information, and
              the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement are hereby
              incorporated herein by reference with the same effect as if fully
              set forth in this Agreement; provided, however, that Purchaser
              may disclose confidential information relating to the Company,
              the Subsidiaries or the Business in connection with Purchaser's
              communications with investors and analysts with the prior consent
              of Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
              delayed).

              (b) Seller shall prepare, and deliver to Purchaser as promptly as
         practicable, the audited combined balance sheet as of January 1, 2005
         and related combined statements of earnings, cash flows and Seller's
         net investment for the Companies and their Subsidiaries for the year
         ended January 1, 2005, together with footnotes and a report thereon of
         KPMG LLP, or any other independent certified public accountants of
         recognized national standing (the "Audited Statements"). The Audited
         Financial Statements shall be prepared in accordance with GAAP
         consistently applied with the Financial Statements and in accordance
         with Regulation S-X of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
         amended. Seller shall make available to Purchaser the work papers of
         Seller's accountants relating to the Audited Statements.

              (c) The Companies and their Subsidiaries currently maintain
         their backup data center at Seller's facility in Richmond, Virginia,
         and the Seller currently maintains its backup data center with
         respect to the balance of its


                                      29
<PAGE>

         business at the Companies' facility in Grand Prairie, Texas. Seller
         shall provide Purchaser with access to its Richmond, Virginia facility
         and equipment, and Purchaser shall provide Seller with access to its
         Grand Prairie, Texas facility and equipment, for a period of one (1)
         year following the Closing solely to permit the other party to
         maintain the backup data and move the backup data of such party to its
         own facility and equipment.

         6.5 FURTHER ACTION. Each of Seller and Purchaser shall, subject to
the fulfillment at or before the Effective Time of each of the conditions of
performance set forth herein or the waiver thereof, use its reasonable best
efforts to perform such further acts and execute such documents as may be
reasonably required to effect the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of
Seller and Purchaser will comply in all material respects with all applicable
laws and with all applicable rules and regulations of any Governmental
Authority in connection with its execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Seller and
Purchaser agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain in a timely
manner all necessary waivers, consents, approvals and opinions and to effect
all necessary registrations and filings, and to use its reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all other actions and to do, or cause
to be done, all other things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and
make effective as promptly as practicable the transactions contemplated
hereby. This Section 6.5 shall in no way limit Purchaser's obligations set
forth in the last two sentences of Section 6.2(a). In the event that any or
all of the borrowings or amounts provided pursuant to the Commitment Letter
are unavailable for any reason in the amount specified therein, Purchaser
shall use its reasonable efforts to obtain replacement financing from
alternative sources, provided, however, that if Purchaser is unable to obtain
financing from alternative sources within a reasonable period of time after
Purchaser is notified that the financing under the Commitment Letter is not
available, then financing may be arranged by Seller or Seller's advisor with
third party institutions (including Seller's advisors). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, Purchaser shall be under no obligation to enter into any
replacement financing if the terms and conditions of such replacement
financing are materially less favorable to Purchaser than the terms and
conditions of the Commitment Letter. Without limiting the foregoing, in
connection with Purchaser's efforts to obtain high-yield bond financing and
any other financings undertaken by Purchaser or its affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby, Seller shall cause members of
management of the Seller, the Companies or the Subsidiaries, and shall request
their respective accountants and other experts, in each case to the extent
practicable, to (a) aid in the preparation of written offering materials used
to complete such financings, to the extent information contained therein
relates to the Business, the Companies or the Subsidiaries, (b) provide
Purchaser and its representatives with financial information and data
(including projections) and other information and data reasonably requested in
connection with due diligence relating to such financings and, in the case of
its accountants, assist in the preparation of auditors reports, comfort
letters and other documentation prepared in connection therewith and (c)
participate in presentations, road shows, due diligence sessions, drafting
sessions and other meetings customarily involved in financing efforts;
provided, that the foregoing activities would not unreasonably interfere with
the performance of such Person's duties in connection with the Business; and
provided that the foregoing shall be at the sole cost


                                     30
<PAGE>

and expense of the Purchaser. Seller shall, and shall cause each of the
applicable Companies and Subsidiaries to, use its reasonable commercial
efforts to obtain, at Purchaser's expense, opinions of its local counsel
(which may be in-house counsel) addressing the matters reasonably requested
by, and addressed to, Purchaser's lenders and placement agents and, in an
offering under Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the
initial purchasers. Purchaser shall promptly upon request reimburse Seller
for any costs or expenses incurred by Seller which are to be borne by
Purchaser pursuant to this Section 6.5.

         6.6 EXPENSES. Whether or not the transactions contemplated hereby are
consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby shall be paid by the party hereto
incurring such expenses except as expressly provided herein; provided that any
such fees and expenses of the Company or the Subsidiaries shall be borne by
Seller. Without limiting the foregoing, Seller shall not pay or cause to be
paid any such costs and expenses, including the Goldman Fee, the Merrill Lynch
Fee and legal fees and expenses, from funds of any Company or Subsidiary.
Purchaser and Seller shall each pay 50% of any fees required to be paid under
the HSR Act.

         6.7 NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS. Each party shall give prompt
notice to the other of the following:

              (a) the occurrence or nonoccurrence of any event whose occurrence
         or nonoccurrence is reasonably expected to cause any of the conditions
         precedent to the other party's obligations set forth in Article 7 not
         to be satisfied; and

              (b) the status of matters relating to completion of the
         transactions contemplated hereby, including promptly furnishing the
         other with copies of notices or other communications received by any
         party or any of its respective Subsidiaries from any Governmental
         Authority or other third party with respect to this Agreement or the
         transactions contemplated hereby.

         Subject to Section 6.12 hereof, any such notification shall not be
given effect for purposes of the representations, warranties and covenants
contained herein.

         6.8 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS.

              (a) From and after the Effective Time, Purchaser will cause the
         Companies and their Subsidiaries to continue and perform, in
         accordance with their terms, all employment agreements listed in Items
         1-6 of Section 4.13 of the Disclosure Schedule between the Companies
         and their Subsidiaries and any officer, director or employee of the
         Companies or any of their Subsidiaries and all obligations of the
         Companies under the Plans. Nothing in this Section 6.8 shall be
         interpreted to prohibit Purchaser, the Companies or any of their
         Subsidiaries, from and after the Effective Time, from establishing new
         plans or amending or terminating any Plan sponsored by any of the
         Companies or a Subsidiary in accordance with the terms thereof.


                                      31
<PAGE>

              (b) Purchaser shall cause the Companies and their Subsidiaries to
         continue to employ, immediately following the Effective Time, each
         individual employed by any of the Companies or any Subsidiary on the
         Closing Date (other than any person who is subject to a collective
         bargaining agreement or employment agreement), including employees
         absent from work due to short-term or long-term disability, sick
         leave, military leave or other employer-approved absences of short
         duration ("Companies Covered Employees"); provided, however, that
         nothing in this Agreement is intended to limit Purchaser's right to
         terminate, or cause to be terminated, or otherwise deal with, any
         Companies Covered Employee after the Effective Time. Purchaser shall,
         for a period of one year after the Effective Time, cause to be
         provided to each Companies Covered Employee who continues to be
         employed during that time a base salary not less than his or her base
         salary in effect immediately prior to the date hereof and an annual
         cash bonus opportunity substantially comparable to that provided to
         him or her immediately prior to the date hereof, and cause to be
         provided to Companies Covered Employees employee benefits, including,
         but not limited to, welfare, retirement and savings benefits
         substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to those provided to
         Companies Covered Employees immediately prior to the Effective Time
         (excluding for these purposes any equity-based plan or arrangement).
         For purposes of determining eligibility and vesting (but not for
         benefits accrual) under any Purchaser benefit plan in which a
         Companies Covered Employee participates after the Effective Time, such
         employee shall be credited with his or her years of service with the
         Companies or their Subsidiaries, to the extent such credit was given
         under any corresponding Plan (as defined in Section 4.13(a)). To the
         extent that any Purchaser benefit plan in which a Companies Covered
         Employee participates after the Effective Time provides medical,
         dental or vision benefits, Purchaser shall cause all pre-existing
         condition exclusions and actively at work requirements of such plan to
         be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents except
         to the extent such employee and his or her covered dependents were
         subject to such exclusions and requirements under the corresponding
         Plan, and Purchaser shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such
         employee on or before the Effective Time to be taken into account
         under such Purchaser benefit plan for purposes of satisfying all
         deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements
         applicable to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the
         applicable plan year. Purchaser shall not provide any specific
         incentive or inducement to any Companies Covered Employees to choose
         to be covered under the health care continuation provisions of the
         Plans, including, without limitation, the payment of all or a portion
         of a Companies Covered Employee's COBRA premium.

              (c) The parties hereto agree that the consummation of the
         transaction contemplated in this Agreement (i) shall constitute a
         "corporate sale" within the meaning of Article VI of Seller's Senior
         Management Severance Plan and (ii) shall not constitute a "Change in
         Control" within the meaning of any "Agreement for Key Executive"
         entered into by Seller.


                                      32
<PAGE>

              (d) Purchaser covenants that it will, or will cause the Companies
         and their Subsidiaries to, employ those managers set forth on Section
         6.8(c) of the Disclosure Schedule for a period of no less than nine
         months from the Closing Date; provided, however, Purchaser shall be
         entitled to terminate such managers for Cause during such period;
         provided, further, however, that Purchaser may also terminate such
         managers at any time without Cause, provided that Purchaser shall make
         a severance payment no less than the amount of salary to which such
         manager is otherwise entitled to receive for the period beginning on
         the date of termination and ending on the first anniversary of the
         Closing. If the employment of any of these managers is terminated for
         any reason other than with Cause following the nine-month period and
         prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date, Purchaser agrees
         to provide such terminated employee at least 90 days' prior notice of
         such termination. "Cause" shall mean (1) any act of employee which is
         demonstrably injurious to his or her employer that constitutes
         dishonesty, willful misconduct, gross insubordination, breach of
         fiduciary duty, or breach of the duty of loyalty; (2) gross negligence
         in the performance of the employee's duties that continues for 10 days
         following written notice thereof from the employer, (3) willful
         violation of any law, governmental rule or regulation (other than
         traffic violations or similar minor offenses), or court order that is
         demonstrably injurious to the employer; (4) the death of employee; (5)
         employee's inability to perform the essential functions of his or her
         job due to physical or mental disability causing employee to be absent
         from his or her duties on a full-time basis for ninety consecutive
         days, the determination of such mental or physical disability to be
         made by a licensed physician satisfactory to employee and employer; or
         (6) material breach by employee of the written policies of the
         Companies and the Subsidiaries determined on a reasonable basis.

              (e) As of the Closing Date, Purchaser shall cause to be
         maintained for the benefit of Companies Covered Employees (and to the
         extent required by, and in accordance with, any applicable collective
         bargaining agreement, other employees of the Companies and their
         Subsidiaries) a defined contribution plan intended to be qualified
         under Section 401(a) of the Code ("Purchaser's 401(k) Plan"). Upon the
         Closing, or as soon as practicable thereafter, Seller shall direct the
         trustee of Seller's tax-qualified 401(k) plan to transfer to the
         trustee of Purchaser's 401(k) Plan the aggregate individual account
         balances of the above-described employees (whether or not vested) who
         are then employed by Purchaser, the Companies or the Subsidiaries, or
         any of their affiliates.

              (f) Seller will, and will cause the Companies and their
         Subsidiaries to, (i) provide Purchaser and its officers, counsel
         and other representatives with reasonable access to the Key
         Employees for the purposes of negotiating employment arrangements
         with such employees and (ii) reasonably cooperate with Purchaser to
         facilitate and assist with such negotiations. Seller shall not take
         any action or fail to take any action, directly or indirectly,
         which would enable any of the Key Employees to terminate their
         employment for "Good Reason" (as defined in the Employment
         Agreements set forth in Section 4.8(a)(x) of the Disclosure
         Schedule). Seller shall promptly advise Purchaser of any written


                                      33
<PAGE>

         notification from any Key Employee of his or her resignation from the
         Companies or the Subsidiaries.

         6.9 NON-COMPETITION, NON-SOLICITATION AND NON-DISCLOSURE.

              (a) For a period of five (5) years from the Closing Date, except
         as permitted in this Section 6.9, neither Seller nor any of its
         affiliates shall directly or indirectly (i) process, produce or
         manufacture (in each case, whether directly or indirectly or through
         co-packers and whether independently or with co-packers) value-added
         produce items, including packaged salads, salad kits, specialty
         salads, fresh-cut vegetables and fresh-cut fruit for sale through any
         outlets, including grocery stores, supercenters or other outlets in
         the retail distribution channel and quick-service restaurant and other
         food service outlets, (ii) sell or provide equipment, processes or
         material for freshness extending atmosphere systems or (iii) own any
         interest in any business or Person engaged in any of the foregoing
         activities under clauses (i) or (ii) above. The restrictions set forth
         in this Section 6.9 shall not be construed to prohibit or restrict:
         (A) any minority equity investment by Seller or any of its affiliates
         in any person or entity in which Seller or its affiliates do not have
         the right to designate a controlling number of members of the board of
         directors (or similar governing body) of such entity, or in which
         Seller or its affiliates collectively hold not more than 10% of the
         outstanding voting securities; (B) the sale of produce items purchased
         by Seller from third parties on an arm's-length basis (including
         produce which has been processed) exclusively for resale (and not
         subject to further processing) to its foodservice customers; (C) any
         business activity that would otherwise violate this Section 6.9 that
         is carried on by an entity or business that is acquired by Seller or
         otherwise becomes an affiliate thereof, but only if, at the time of
         such acquisition, the revenues derived from such business by such
         entity or business constitute less than 10% of the gross revenues of
         such person or business; or (D) Seller's engaging in its foodservice
         distribution business as currently conducted. For a period of three
         (3) years from the Closing Date, neither Seller nor any of its
         affiliates will, without the prior written consent of Purchaser,
         solicit any Person listed in Section 6.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule
         to terminate such Person's customer relationship with the Companies or
         the Subsidiaries or enter into a relationship or arrangement with a
         different company or business engaged in the produce processing
         business with respect to any value-added produce item currently
         supplied, or contemplated to be supplied (as set forth in Section
         6.9(a) of the Disclosure Schedule), by the Companies or the
         Subsidiaries.

              (b) Except as set forth in Section 6.9(b) of the Disclosure
         Schedule, for a period of two (2) years from the Closing Date,
         neither Seller nor any of its affiliates will, without the prior
         written consent of Purchaser, employ any officer or managerial
         employee of the Companies or their Subsidiaries, unless such person
         has ceased to be an officer or managerial employee for at least six
         (6) months; provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
         prohibit any general solicitations of employment not directed to
         employees of the Companies or their Subsidiaries (including the
         placing of an advertisement or solicitation through an


                                     34
<PAGE>

         employment agency or executive search firm (provided that such
         employment agency or executive search firm is not directed,
         encouraged or advised by Seller or its affiliates to approach such
         officer or managerial employee) or prevent Seller or its affiliates
         from hiring any such person or any person who contacts Seller on
         his or her own initiative.

              (c) Seller agrees to treat any information in its possession
         concerning the Companies and their Subsidiaries (whether prepared by
         the Seller, its advisors or otherwise) based on, containing or
         otherwise reflecting such information, including any notes, memoranda,
         analyses, compilations, studies or other documents (herein
         collectively referred to as the "Confidential Material") in accordance
         with the provisions of this clause (c) and to take or abstain from
         taking certain other actions herein set forth. The term "Confidential
         Material" does not include information which (i) is or becomes
         generally available to the public other than as a result of a
         disclosure by Seller or its directors, officers, employees, agents,
         advisors, affiliates or representatives (including, without
         limitation, accountants, investment bankers and attorneys (such
         persons being collectively called "Representatives") in violation of
         this Agreement or (ii) becomes available to Seller on a
         non-confidential basis from a source other than Purchaser or its
         advisors, provided that such source is not, to Seller's knowledge
         after reasonable inquiry, bound by a confidentiality agreement with or
         other obligation of secrecy to Purchaser or another party. Seller
         hereby agrees that, except for such disclosures thereof as may be
         required by Law, the Confidential Material will be kept confidential
         by Seller and its Representatives and not disclosed to any other
         person and that it will not use any Confidential Material to benefit
         or further its own business activities; provided, however, that any
         disclosure of such information may be made to which Purchaser
         consents, in advance, in writing. Seller shall, as and when requested
         by Purchaser and at Purchaser's expense, use commercially reasonable
         efforts to enforce any confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement
         entered into with bidders and their representatives in connection with
         the auction process with respect to the Shares, including enforcing
         Purchaser's demands for the return or destruction of any material
         covered by such agreements in accordance with the terms thereof.

         6.10 INTERCOMPANY INDEBTEDNESS. Immediately prior to the Closing,
Seller shall contribute to the Companies as a capital contribution in respect
of the Shares, all indebtedness and other payables owed by the Companies or
their Subsidiaries to Seller that has not been repaid by the Companies or their
Subsidiaries prior to the Closing, if any (the amount of which totaled
$368,164,000 as of the date of the Reference Balance Sheet) and shall cause the
Companies to cancel, distribute or forgive all receivables owed by the Seller
or its affiliates to the Company or the Subsidiaries (the amount of which
totaled $618,000 as of the date of the Reference Balance Sheet). In addition,
immediately prior to the Closing, K.C. Salad Holdings, Inc. and its
Subsidiaries shall, at the election of Seller, either cancel that certain
Revolving Credit Note dated October 15, 2004 by and between K.C. Salad
Holdings, Inc. and its Subsidiaries and the Seller and forgive any amounts owed
by Seller thereunder as of the Closing, or distribute that note to Seller.
Immediately prior to the Closing, Seller shall cause the termination or


                                     35
<PAGE>

cancellation of any intercompany agreements or arrangements between Seller or
any affiliate thereof, on the one hand, and the Companies or any of the
Subsidiaries, on the other hand.

         6.11 DEBT AND GUARANTEES. At the Closing, except for trade payables,
Seller shall, solely out of Seller's funds, pay, or irrevocably deposit for the
purpose of defeasing or paying, all outstanding indebtedness of the Companies
and the Subsidiaries (excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, the Clayton County
Arrangements), including the indebtedness listed on Section 6.11 of the
Disclosure Schedule, together with any associated interest, prepayment amounts
or other penalties, provided that Seller shall not be required to give notice
of repayment until Closing, and Seller shall concurrently obtain full and
unconditional releases of any Encumbrances associated therewith. At the
election of Purchaser not less than five (5) business days prior to the
Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable efforts to cause any and all of the
Clayton County Arrangements to be terminated and of no further force and effect
as of the Closing. Section 6.11 of the Disclosure Schedule also sets forth all
guarantees, financial accommodations and security arrangements by Seller in
favor of the Companies and Subsidiaries with respect to obligations of the
Companies or Subsidiaries, excluding the foregoing indebtedness to be satisfied
by Seller (collectively, "Guarantees"). Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably
cooperate, to cause Purchaser or one of its affiliates to be substituted for
Seller and all of its affiliates other than the Companies and the Subsidiaries
as of the Closing, without recourse to Seller or any such affiliates, with
respect to all such Guarantees. In the event that Purchaser and Seller are
unable to obtain the release of any Guarantee, Purchaser shall indemnify and
hold harmless Seller from any and all obligations or liabilities incurred by
Seller with respect to such Guarantee.

         6.12 SUPPLEMENTS TO DISCLOSURE SCHEDULE. If Seller becomes aware of,
or there occurs after the date of this Agreement, any fact or condition that
constitutes a breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
Article 4 above that is qualified by materiality or a material breach of any
representation or warranty made by Seller in Article 4 above that is not so
qualified, or if any fact or condition, either currently existing or hereafter
occurring, requires any change in the Disclosure Schedule delivered to
Purchaser at the time of execution of this Agreement, Seller will deliver to
Purchaser at or before the Closing a supplement to the Disclosure Schedule
specifying any needed change. Any such supplement to the Disclosure Schedule
shall not be given effect for purposes of the representations and warranties
contained herein; provided, however, that if the disclosures made in such
supplement would give rise to the Purchaser's right not to close under Section
7.2(a) hereof (as so notified by Seller) and Purchaser nonetheless proceeds
with the Closing, such supplement to the Disclosure Schedule shall be given
effect for purposes of determining whether there has been a breach of a
representation and warranty for purposes of the indemnification provisions
under Section 9.2 hereof.

         6.13 NON-SOLICITATION. Prior to the Closing Date, Seller agrees (i)
that it shall not, and shall direct its directors, officers, employees,
advisors, accountants and attorneys not to, initiate, solicit or encourage,
directly or indirectly, any inquiries or the making or implementation of any
proposal or offer with respect to a merger, acquisition,


                                     36
<PAGE>

consolidation or similar transaction involving any of the Companies, the
Subsidiaries, the Business or any significant portion of the assets or any
equity securities of any of the Companies or the Subsidiaries (any such
proposal or offer being an "Acquisition Proposal") or engage in any
negotiations concerning, or provide any confidential information or data to, or
have any discussions with, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal, or
otherwise facilitate any effort to attempt to make or implement an Acquisition
Proposal, (ii) that it will immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
existing activities, discussions or negotiations with any parties other than
Purchaser conducted heretofore with respect to any of the foregoing and (iii)
that it will notify Purchaser immediately if any such inquiries or proposals
are received by, any such information is requested from, or any such
negotiations or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, it.

         6.14 OBLIGATIONS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN INSURANCE CLAIMS. Except as
expressly set forth in this Section 6.14 or elsewhere in this Agreement
(including the indemnity provisions of Section 9.2), from and after the
Closing, Purchaser shall assume and pay when due all liabilities, including any
claims handling expense, arising out of, or related to, events, acts or
occurrences prior to the Closing which give rise to a claim against the
Companies or the Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to the Business
("Pre-Closing Claims"), regardless of when the claim is brought, but only to
the extent such claims would be required to be paid by Seller, including any
Pre-Closing Claims funded by Performance Insurance Company Ltd. ("PICL"), or
PICL under any workers compensation, general liability, automobile liability or
health insurance policy issued in favor of the Companies or the Subsidiaries,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any policies issued by PICL to the
Companies or the Subsidiaries. All insurance policies issued by PICL in favor
of the Companies or the Subsidiaries shall be terminated as of Closing and
neither Seller nor PICL shall have any obligation to pay any claims which would
otherwise be payable thereunder; provided, that Seller shall reasonably
cooperate with Purchaser and keep Purchaser reasonably informed of all material
events with respect to Pre-Closing Claims thereunder and not settle or
compromise any such Pre-Closing Claims without the prior written consent of
Purchaser. The accrued liabilities of the Companies and the Subsidiaries with
respect thereto was $12,800,000 as of the Reference Balance Sheet.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall have no liability for any
Pre-Closing Claim to the extent that coverage is provided under an insurance
policy written by a third party not affiliated with Seller which covers
Pre-Closing Claims. Prior to the Closing and, at the request of Purchaser,
following the Closing, Seller shall cause any Pre-Closing Claims to be made on
behalf of the Companies or the Subsidiaries that are covered within the terms
and conditions of any such policies, whether or not collectable and whether or
not subject to deductibles, co-insurance or retrospectively-rated premium
adjustments, and Purchaser and Seller shall reasonably cooperate and keep the
other party reasonably informed of all material events with respect to such
Pre-Closing Claims. Seller shall not cancel, release or otherwise terminate any
of Seller's policies with third-party insurance carriers with respect to
Pre-Closing Claims without the prior written consent of Purchaser; provided
that Seller shall not be required to make any additional payments after the
Closing in order to keep such policies in place; provided, further, that Seller
shall provide Purchaser with notice of any notice that Seller receives that any
such additional payments may be required. Seller shall promptly pay to


                                      37
<PAGE>

Purchaser any insurance proceeds received by Seller or its affiliates under
policies with third-party insurance carriers in respect of such Pre-Closing
Claims. From and after the Closing, Seller shall cause each of the Companies
and the Subsidiaries to be a named insured, and have all the rights of a named
insured, under Seller's policies with third-party insurance carriers with
respect to Pre-Closing Claims.

         6.15 OBLIGATION WITH RESPECT TO FRESH ADVANTAGE. Prior to the Closing,
Seller shall take all action necessary or reasonably requested by Purchaser, at
Seller's expense, to cause all of its and its affiliates' right, title and
interest in and to the Fresh Advantage trademark and name (and all goodwill
associated therewith) to be assigned to the Companies, free and clear of any
Encumbrances, and shall make all necessary filings in connection therewith. At
Closing, the Companies shall grant Seller and its affiliates the right to use
the Fresh Advantage mark for a period of two (2) years following the Closing at
no cost to Seller or its affiliates on terms reasonably satisfactory to Seller
and Purchaser. During such two-year period, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall
license or sublicense such mark to any third party. This trademark license
shall be on an "as is" basis, without representations or warranties, or
recourse by Seller of any kind against Purchaser.

                               CLOSING CONDITIONS

         7.1 CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF SELLER AND PURCHASER TO CONSUMMATE
THE TRANSACTION. The respective obligation of each of Seller and Purchaser to
consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall be subject to the
satisfaction of each of the following conditions:

              (a) Legality. No order, decree or injunction shall have been
         entered or issued by any Governmental Authority which is in effect and
         has the effect of making the transactions contemplated hereby illegal
         or otherwise prohibiting consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereby. Each of Seller and Purchaser agrees that, in the event that
         any such order, decree or injunction shall be entered or issued, it
         shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause any such order, decree
         or injunction to be lifted or vacated. The immediately preceding
         sentence shall in no way limit or expand Purchaser's obligations under
         Section 6.2(a).

              (b) HSR Act. The waiting period (or extension thereof) under the
         HSR Act applicable to the transactions contemplated hereby shall have
         expired or been terminated.

         7.2 ADDITIONAL CONDITIONS TO OBLIGATIONS OF PURCHASER. The obligations
of Purchaser to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall also be
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the following conditions:

              (a) Representations and Warranties. (i) The representations
         and warranties of Seller contained in this Agreement that are

         warranties of Seller contained in Sections 4.4(a) and (b) hereof shall
         be true and correct on and as of the Closing Date (except to the
         extent such representations and warranties shall have been expressly
         made as of an earlier date, in which case such representations and
         warranties shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date)
         with the same force and effect as if made on and as of the Closing
         Date and (ii) the representations and warranties of Seller contained
         in this Agreement that are not qualified as to materiality or Seller
         Material Adverse Effect or contained in Sections 4.4(a) and (b) hereof

         extent such representations and warranties shall have been expressly
         made as of an earlier date, in which case such representations and
         warranties shall have been true and correct as of such earlier date)
         with the same force and effect as if made on and as of the Closing
         Date, except to the extent that any failures of such representations
         and warranties in this clause (ii) to be so true and correct,
         individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to
         have resulted in a Seller Material Adverse Effect.

              (b) Agreements and Covenants. Seller shall have performed or
         complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants
         required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on

         instruments set forth in Section 3.2(b).

              (e) Audited Financial Statements. Purchaser shall have received

         opinion), and the Audited Statements (including the notes thereto)
         shall not reflect or disclose any information that is adverse, in any
         material respect, to the Business, the Companies or their
         Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, that was not reflected or disclosed in
         the Financial Statements (including the notes thereto) previously
         provided to Purchaser.

              (f) Financing. The financing institutions party to the Commitment
         Letter (or any agreements relating to alternative sources of financing
         that may be entered into by Purchaser under Section 6.5) shall have
         funded the portion of the Purchase Price in the amount specified in
         the Commitment Letter; provided that the foregoing shall not be a
         condition under this Agreement in the event that (i) a breach by
         Purchaser of its obligations under the Commitment Letter (or any
         agreements relating to alternative sources of financing that may be
         entered into by Purchaser under Section 6.5) has caused the funding
         thereunder not to occur, or (ii) all conditions precedent to the
         closing and extension of credit of the amount specified in the
         Commitment Letter have been satisfied other than the conditions

<PAGE>

         contained in clause (vi) and clause (viii) (other than, in the case of
         clause (viii), a default, or failure of the representations and
         warranties to be true, under any of the loan documentation for the
         Senior Credit Facilities (as defined in the Commitment Letter) which
         relates to the Companies or the Subsidiaries) of Annex II of the
         Commitment Letter.

              (g) Material Adverse Change. There shall have been no Seller
         Material Adverse Effect after the date hereof that has not been cured
         by the Closing Date.

Seller to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby shall also be subject
to the satisfaction or waiver of each of the following conditions:

              (a) Representations and Warranties. The representations and
         warranties of Purchaser contained in this Agreement that are qualified
         by materiality or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect shall be true and
         correct on and as of the Closing Date (except to the extent such
         representations and warranties shall have been expressly made as of an
         earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall
         have been true and correct as of such earlier date) with the same
         force and effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date, and (ii)
         the representations and warranties of Purchaser contained in this
         Agreement that are not qualified as to materiality or Purchaser
         Material Adverse Effect shall be true and correct on and as of the
         Closing Date (except to the extent such representations and warranties
         shall have been expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case
         such representations and warranties shall have been true and correct
         as of such earlier date) with the same force and effect as if made on
         and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent that any failures of
         such representations and warranties in this clause (ii) to be so true
         and correct, individually or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be
         expected to have resulted in a Purchaser Material Adverse Effect.

              (b) Agreements and Covenants. Purchaser shall have performed or
         complied in all material respects with all agreements and covenants
         required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by it on

         set forth in Section 3.2(a).

         Seller, rendered by an independent valuation firm, at Seller's
         expense, setting forth their conclusion that,


                                      40
<PAGE>

         after giving effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
         and the incurrence of any financings in connection therewith, the
         Purchaser, Companies and Subsidiaries taken as a whole, are not
         insolvent and will not be rendered insolvent by the indebtedness
         incurred in connection therewith, and will not be left with
         unreasonably small capital with which to engage in their business and
         will not have incurred debts beyond their ability to pay such debts as
         they mature.

                              CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

         8.1 RESPONSIBILITY FOR FILING TAX RETURNS.

              (a) Seller shall include the income of the Companies and the
         Subsidiaries on Seller's consolidated federal income Tax Returns (and
         any state consolidated, unitary or combined Tax Returns) for all
         periods through the end of the Closing Date and pay any income Taxes
         attributable to such income. The Companies and the Subsidiaries shall
         furnish Tax information to Seller for inclusion in Seller's federal
         consolidated income Tax Return (or such state Tax Return described in
         the preceding sentence) for the period that includes the Closing Date
         in accordance with the Companies' and the Subsidiaries past custom and
         practice. The income of the Companies and the Subsidiaries shall be
         apportioned to the period up to the Closing Date and the period after
         the Closing Date by closing the books of the Companies and the
         Subsidiaries as of the Closing Date. Seller shall prepare or cause to
         be prepared and file or cause to be filed all other Tax Returns for
         the Companies and their Subsidiaries for all periods ending on or
         prior to the Closing Date that are due after the Closing Date.

              (b) Purchaser shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
         cause to be filed all other Tax Returns for the Companies and the
         Subsidiaries that are due after the Closing Date (other than Tax
         Returns with respect to periods for which a consolidated, unitary or
         combined Tax Return of Seller will include the operations of the
         Companies). Purchaser shall permit Seller to review and comment on
         each such Tax Return described in the preceding sentence prior to
         filing and shall make such revisions to such Tax Returns as are
         reasonably requested by Seller but only to the extent that such Tax
         Returns relate to Taxes for which Seller has an obligation to
         indemnify or has indemnified Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.4.

         8.2 COOPERATION ON TAX MATTERS.

              (a) Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate fully, as and to the
         extent reasonably requested by the other party, in connection with the
         filing of Tax Returns pursuant to this Article 8 and any audit,
         litigation or other proceeding with respect to Taxes. Such cooperation
         shall include the retention and (upon the other party's request) the
         provision of records and information which are reasonably relevant to
         any such Tax Return preparation, audit, litigation or other proceeding
         and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
         provide additional information and explanation of any material provided


                                     41
<PAGE>

         hereunder. Seller agrees (A) to retain all books and records with
         respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Companies and their
         Subsidiaries relating to any taxable period beginning before the
         Closing Date until the expiration of the statute of limitations (and,
         to the extent notified by Purchaser, any extensions thereof) of the
         respective taxable periods, and to abide by all record retention
         agreements entered into with any Taxing Authority, and (B) to give
         Purchaser reasonable written notice prior to transferring, destroying
         or discarding any such books and records and, if Purchaser so
         requests, Seller shall allow Purchaser to take possession of such
         books and records.

              (b) Purchaser and Seller further agree, upon request, to use
         commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or other
         document from any Governmental Authority or any other Person as may be
         necessary to mitigate, reduce or eliminate any Tax that could be
         imposed (including, but not limited to, with respect to the
         transactions contemplated hereby).

         8.3 TAX SHARING AGREEMENTS. All Tax sharing agreements or similar
agreements with respect to or involving the Companies and their Subsidiaries
shall be terminated as of the Closing Date and, after the Closing Date, the
Companies and their Subsidiaries shall not be bound thereby or have any
liability thereunder.

         8.4 TAX INDEMNIFICATIONS.

              (a) Seller shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
         Purchaser harmless against:

                     (i) all Taxes of the Companies and the Subsidiaries
              payable for any taxable year or taxable period ending on or
              before the Closing Date, including, but not limited to, any Taxes
              with respect to the deemed sale of assets resulting from the
              Section 338(h)(10) elections pursuant to Section 8.6 of this
              Agreement; provided, however, that no indemnity shall be provided
              under this Agreement for Taxes resulting from any transaction
              undertaken by the Purchaser, any Company or Subsidiary on the
              Closing Date, but after the Closing, occurring outside of the
              ordinary course of business;

                     (ii) all Taxes imposed on any member of any Affiliated
              Group with which any Company or Subsidiary files or filed a Tax
              Return on a consolidated, combined or unitary basis for a taxable
              year (of a Company or any Subsidiary) beginning before the
              Closing Date and for which any Company or Subsidiary is liable as
              a result of filing or being included in such a Tax Return on a
              consolidated, combined or unitary basis; and

                     (iii) with respect to any taxable year or taxable period
              beginning before the Closing Date and ending after the Closing
              Date (a "Straddle Period"), the portion of the Taxes of the
              Companies and the Subsidiaries attributable to the portion of
              such taxable year or taxable period ending on


                                      42
<PAGE>

              the Closing Date; provided, however, that no indemnity shall be
              provided under this Agreement for any Taxes resulting from any
              transaction undertaken by the Purchaser, any Company or
              Subsidiary on the Closing Date, but after the Closing, occurring
              outside of the ordinary course of business.

              (b) Purchaser shall be liable for, and shall indemnify and hold
         Seller harmless against, (i) any and all Taxes imposed on any Company
         or Subsidiary for any taxable year or portion thereof beginning on or
         after the Closing Date, including the portion commencing on the
         Closing Date of any Straddle Period, and (ii) any additional Tax owed
         by Seller (including Tax owed by Seller due to this indemnification
         payment) resulting from any transaction engaged in by any Company or
         any Subsidiary not in the ordinary course of business occurring on the
         Closing Date after Purchaser's purchase of the Companies' stock.

              (c) Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
         assessment, or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which Seller
         is liable under this Agreement, Purchaser shall upon receipt of such
         assertion, promptly inform Seller in writing and Seller shall have the
         sole right to control any resulting proceedings and to determine
         whether and when to settle any such claim, assessment or dispute to
         the extent such proceedings or determinations affect the amount of
         Taxes for which Seller may be liable under this Agreement. Whenever
         any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an assessment or otherwise
         disputes the amount of Taxes for which Purchaser is liable under this
         Agreement, Purchaser shall have the right to control any resulting
         proceedings and to determine whether and when to settle any such
         claim, assessment or dispute, except to the extent such proceedings
         affect the amount of Taxes for which Seller is liable under this
         Agreement. Whenever any Taxing Authority asserts a claim, makes an
         assessment or otherwise disputes the amount of Taxes for which both
         Seller and Purchaser may be liable, (i) each party may participate in
         any resulting proceedings, and (ii) that portion of the proceedings
         shall be controlled by that party which would bear the burden of the
         greater portion of the sum of the adjustment and any corresponding
         adjustments that may reasonably be anticipated for other taxable
         periods. The party not controlling such proceedings may, with the
         written consent of the other party and at its sole expense, assume
         control of such proceeding.

              (d) The obligations of the parties set forth in this Section 8.4
         shall be unconditional and absolute. Except as expressly provided in
         Article 9, the rights and obligations of the parties with respect to
         indemnification for any and all matters relating to Taxes shall be
         governed by this Section 8.4.

         8.5 CERTAIN NON-INCOME TAXES. All transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other similar Taxes and fees (including any penalties
and interest), but not including income taxes incurred in connection with
this Agreement (including any such Tax imposed indirectly as a result of the
sale of the Shares), shall be borne by Purchaser. Purchaser will, at its own
expense, file all necessary Tax Returns and other


                                      43
<PAGE>

documentation with respect to all such transfer, documentary, sales, use,
stamp, registration and other Taxes and fees.

         8.6 SECTION 338(H)(10) ELECTION. Purchaser and Seller agree to join in
making elections under section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding or
similar provision of state and local Law) with respect to Redi-Cut Foods, Inc.,
an Illinois corporation, and K.C. Salad Holdings, Inc., a Missouri corporation,
and, if Seller so timely requests, with respect to Fresh Advantage, Inc., a
Virginia corporation (any of such companies with respect to which an election
is to be made, a "338(h)(10) Entity"), and shall cooperate in the preparation
and filing of IRS Form 8023 and any other Tax forms or filings necessary to
effect such elections. Prior to Closing, Seller and Purchaser shall agree upon
an allocation of a portion of the Purchase Price to each of the 338(h)(10)
Entities, and if Seller and Purchaser are unable to agree on such allocation
they shall submit the matter to the Accountants for a determination, which
shall be final and binding on both Seller and Purchaser.

                                  ARTICLE 9.
                           ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION

         9.1 SURVIVAL. The representations and warranties of the parties
contained in Articles 4 and 5 hereof shall survive the Closing; provided, that,
subject to the last sentence of this Section 9.1, such representations and
warranties shall terminate on the date that is one (1) year after the Closing
Date, except that (i) the representations and warranties contained in Sections
4.2 (Authority) and 4.4(a), (b) and (c) (Capitalization) shall survive
indefinitely following the Closing, (ii) the representations and warranties
contained in Section 4.11 (Environmental and Safety and Health Matters) shall
survive for five (5) years following the Closing and (iii) the representations
and warranties contained in Section 4.14 (Taxes) shall survive the Closing
until the statute of limitations for the applicable representation and warranty
ends. All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms
contemplate actions or impose obligations following the Closing shall survive
the Closing and remain in full force and effect in accordance with their terms.
All covenants and agreements contained herein which by their terms contemplate
full performance at or prior to Closing shall terminate upon Closing, except
that claims for indemnification in respect of any breach thereof shall survive
until the first anniversary of the Closing. The period of time a representation
or warranty or covenant or agreement survives the Closing pursuant to this
Section 9.1 shall be the "Survival Period" with respect to such representation
or warranty or covenant or agreement. In the event notice of any claim for
indemnification under this Article 9 shall have been given within the
applicable Survival Period and such claim has not been finally resolved by the
expiration of such Survival Period, the representations or warranties or
covenants or agreements that are the subject of such claim shall survive, but
only to the extent of and in the amount of the claim as made prior to the
expiration of the Survival Period, until such claim is finally resolved.

         9.2 ADDITIONAL INDEMNIFICATION. Subject to the terms, conditions and
limitations set forth in this Article 9, from and after the Closing Date:


                                     44
<PAGE>

              (a) Seller shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Purchaser
         and its Affiliates and each of their respective officers, directors,
         members, partners, managers and employees (collectively, the
         "Purchaser Indemnified Parties") from and against any costs or
         expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses),
         judgments, fines, claims, damages (including consequential damages in
         the form of lost profits) and assessments (collectively, "Losses")
         that are imposed on or incurred by Purchaser Indemnified Parties which
         result from (i) any breach of any representation or warranty made by
         Seller in Section 4.1, 4.3, 4.4(d) or (e), 4.5. 4.6, 4.7, 4.8 through
         4.10 and 4.12 through 4.23 (disregarding for purposes of measuring
         damages under this Section 9.2(a) any qualification by materiality or
         Seller Material Adverse Effect) on the Closing Date (except to the
         extent such representations and warranties shall have been expressly
         made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such earlier date),
         (ii) any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in
         Section 4.2 or 4.4(a), (b) or (c) hereof (disregarding for purposes of
         measuring damages under this Section 9.2(a) any qualification by
         materiality or Seller Material Adverse Effect) on the Closing Date
         (except to the extent such representations and warranties shall have
         been expressly made as of an earlier date, in which case as of such
         earlier date), (iii) the failure of Seller to perform any covenant or
         agreement of Seller set forth in this Agreement, and (iv) (A) any
         Environmental Claim arising out of or relating to actions, conditions,
         occurrences, incidents, events or omissions involving the Companies,
         the Subsidiaries or the Real Property on or prior to the Closing Date,
         (B) any violation of or noncompliance with applicable Environmental
         Law by the Companies or any of their Subsidiaries prior to the Closing
         Date, including the continuation of such violation or noncompliance
         within three (3) months after the Closing Date, whether or not a third
         party claim has arisen in connection with such violation or
         noncompliance, (C) any Cleanup required by Environmental Law at the
         Real Property, as a result of a release or discharge of Hazardous
         Substances at such Real Property prior to the Closing Date, and (D)
         any breach of any representation or warranty made by Seller in Section
         4.11 on the Closing Date (except to the extent such representations
         and warranties shall have been expressly made as of an earlier date,
         in which case as of such earlier date). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
         Seller shall not indemnify the Purchaser Indemnified Parties under
         this Section 9.2(a) with respect to matters relating to Taxes to the
         extent indemnification is available with respect to such matters under
         Section 8.4(a).

              (b) Purchaser shall defend, indemnify and hold harmless Seller
         and its Affiliates and each of their respective directors, officers,
         equityholders, partners and employees (collectively, the "Seller
         Indemnified Parties") from and against any Losses that are imposed on
         or incurred by Seller Indemnified Parties which result from (i) any
         breach of any representation or warranty made by Purchaser in Article
         5 hereof (disregarding for purposes of this Section 9.2(b) any
         qualification by materiality or Purchaser Material Adverse Effect) on
         the date hereof or on and as of the Closing Date with the same force
         and effect as if made on and as of the Closing Date, (ii) the failure
         to perform any covenant or agreement of Purchaser set forth in this
         Agreement and (iii) any Environmental Claim relating to the


                                     45
<PAGE>

         Company or its Subsidiaries other than those matters that are subject
         to the indemnification provided by Seller pursuant to Section
         9.2(a)(iv). Notwithstanding the foregoing, Purchaser shall not
         indemnify the Seller Indemnified Parties under this Section 9.2(b)
         with respect to matters relating to Taxes to the extent
         indemnification is available with respect to such matters under
         Section 8.4(b).

         9.3 INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURES. The following procedures shall govern
claims for indemnification under this Article 9:

              (a) In order for a party (the "Indemnified Party") to be entitled
         to any indemnification provided for under this Article 9 in respect of
         a claim made against the Indemnified Party by any Person who is not a
         party to this Agreement (a "Third-Party Claim"), such Indemnified
         Party must notify the indemnifying party hereunder (the "Indemnifying
         Party") in writing of the Third-Party Claim promptly following receipt
         by such Indemnified Party of notice of the Third-Party Claim;
         provided, however, that failure to give such notification shall not
         affect the indemnification provided hereunder except to the extent the
         Indemnifying Party shall have been actually prejudiced as a result of
         such failure. Thereafter, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
         Indemnifying Party, promptly following the Indemnified Party's receipt
         thereof, copies of all notices and documents (including court papers)
         received by the Indemnified Party relating to the Third-Party Claim,
         other than those notices and documents separately addressed to the
         Indemnifying Party.

              (b) If a Third-Party Claim is made against an Indemnified Party,
         the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to participate in the defense
         thereof and if it so chooses, to assume the defense thereof with
         counsel selected by the Indemnifying Party; provided, however, that if
         the defendants in any such Third-Party Claim include both the
         Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party
         shall have reasonably concluded that there exists any actual conflict
         of interest between the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party,
         the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to direct the defense
         of such action on behalf of such Indemnified Party and such
         Indemnified Party shall have the right to retain, at the Indemnifying
         Party's expense, one separate counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
         Indemnifying Party to defend such action on behalf of such Indemnified
         Party. Subject to the immediately preceding proviso, should the
         Indemnifying Party so elect to assume the defense of a Third-Party
         Claim, (i) the Indemnifying Party shall not be liable to the
         Indemnified Party for any legal expenses incurred by the Indemnified
         Party in connection with the defense thereof and (ii) the Indemnified
         Party shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and
         to employ counsel, in each case at its own expense, separate from the
         counsel employed by the Indemnifying Party, it being understood that
         the Indemnifying Party shall control such defense. The Indemnifying
         Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
         employed by the Indemnified Party for any period during which the
         Indemnifying Party has not assumed such defense.


                                      46
<PAGE>

              (c) If the Indemnifying Party chooses to defend or prosecute a
         Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Parties shall cooperate in the
         defense or prosecution thereof. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the
         defense of a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall not admit
         any liability with respect to, or settle, compromise or discharge,
         such Third-Party Claim without the Indemnifying Party's prior written
         consent. If the Indemnifying Party assumes the defense of a
         Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall agree to any
         settlement, compromise or discharge of a Third-Party Claim that the
         Indemnifying Party may recommend and that (i) by its terms obligates
         the Indemnifying Party to pay the full amount of the liability in
         connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) does not require any
         payment or other action by, or limitation on, the Indemnified Party
         which is materially adverse to the continuing business interests of
         the Indemnified Party and (iii) releases the Indemnified Party in
         connection with such Third-Party Claim.

              (d) In the event any Indemnified Party should have a claim
         against any Indemnifying Party under this Article 9 that does not
         involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnified Party shall deliver
         notice of such claim to the Indemnifying Party promptly following the
         Indemnified Party becoming aware of the same. The failure by any
         Indemnified Party so to notify the Indemnifying Party shall not
         relieve the Indemnifying Party from any liability that it may have to
         such Indemnified Party under this Article 9, except to the extent that
         the Indemnifying Party has been actually prejudiced by such failure.

              (e) With respect to any indemnified matter subject to Section
         9.2(a)(iv) that relates to a Cleanup of Hazardous Substances
         discharged at any Real Property, Purchaser and its affiliates agree
         that, to the extent allowed by applicable Environmental Law and the
         relevant Governmental Authority (if a Governmental Authority is
         involved in the matter), Purchaser or said affiliate shall agree to
         accept a deed restriction that would: (i) allow it to continue to use
         the Real Property for the same purposes as such property is being used
         as of the date of this Agreement; (ii) not impose limitations on the
         use of the Real Property related to its productive capacity or output;
         (iii) not cause more than de minimis interference with Purchaser's or
         its affiliates' operation of the Real Property; and (iv) not impose
         any operations and maintenance costs on the Purchaser (other than
         costs that would be less than $2,000) per year). If with respect to a
         particular matter, Purchaser or its affiliate does not agree to such a
         restriction, Seller will only be responsible (except as limited by
         other terms in this Agreement) for the Losses that would have been
         incurred had Purchaser or its affiliates accepted such restriction.

         9.4 INDEMNIFICATION LIMITATIONS. In no event shall Seller be
liable for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) and 9.2(a)(ii),
unless and until the aggregate of all Losses with respect to Section
9.2(a)(i) and 9.2(a)(ii) that are imposed on or incurred by the Purchaser
Indemnified Parties thereunder exceeds $5,000,000 (the "Threshold Amount"),
in which case the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to
indemnification for all Losses in excess of the Threshold Amount.


                                      47
<PAGE>

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Seller shall not be required to make
payments for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(i) and 9.2(a)(iv) in an
aggregate amount in excess of $85,000,000. In no event shall Seller be liable
for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(iv) unless and until the
aggregate of all Losses with respect thereto that are imposed on or incurred by
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties thereunder exceeds $2,000,000, in which case
the Purchaser Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to indemnification for all
such Losses that are in excess of $2,000,000. Purchaser shall not be required
to make payments for indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(b)(i) in an
aggregate amount in excess of $85,000,000. In calculating amounts payable to an
Indemnified Party, the amount of the indemnified Losses shall not be
duplicative of any other Loss for which an indemnification claim has been made,
and shall be computed net of (i) payments recovered by the Indemnified Party
under any insurance policy with respect to such Losses, (ii) any prior or
subsequent recovery by the Indemnified Party from any Person (other than an
Indemnifying Party) with respect to such Losses and (iii) any Tax benefit that
may be available to the Indemnified Party arising from the incurrence or
payment of any such Loss. In the event the Closing occurs, the indemnification
provisions of Section 8.4 and this Article 9 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Seller (and the other Seller Indemnified Parties) and Purchaser (and
the other Purchaser Indemnified Parties) and each other party to this Agreement
for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made in
this Agreement (other than for specific performance or injunctive relief) and
each party to this Agreement hereby waives all statutory, common Law and other
claims with respect to this Agreement, other than claims for indemnification
with respect to this Agreement pursuant to (and in accordance with the terms
of) Section 8.4 and this Article 9 and other than claims for specific
performance or injunctive relief; provided, however, that nothing contained in
this Agreement shall limit any party's remedies for fraud or intentional
misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event
shall Seller or Purchaser be liable for any special or punitive damages,
consequential damages (other than lost profits) or damages measured on the
basis of a multiple of earnings or similar financial measure, and Purchaser
shall not be entitled to recover or seek any remedy under this Agreement (i)
with respect to any claim or liability to any employee employed by any of the
Companies or any of their Subsidiaries arising as a result of the termination
of such employee's employment after the Closing Date (except to the extent
arising out of a breach of any representation or warranty of Seller hereunder
relating to severance or other payments or obligations in connection with such
termination) or (ii) to the extent that such amount is included in the Working
Capital Adjustment Amount.

the Effective Time as follows;

              (a) by mutual written consent of each of Seller and Purchaser;

<PAGE>

         however, that in the event the FTC or DOJ issues a "second request" in
         connection with any review of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement under the HSR Act, such date shall be extended to September
         30, 2005; provided further, however, that the right to terminate this
         Agreement under this Section 10.1(b) shall not be available to any
         party whose failure to fulfill any obligation under this Agreement has
         been the cause of, or resulted in, the failure of the Effective Time
         to occur on or before the Termination Date;

              (c) by either Seller or Purchaser, if a Governmental Authority
         shall have issued an order, decree or injunction having the effect of
         making the transactions contemplated hereby illegal or permanently
         prohibiting the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
         and such order, decree or injunction shall have become final and
         nonappealable (but only if such party shall have used its best efforts
         to cause such order, decree or injunction to be lifted or vacated and
         shall have otherwise complied with its obligations under this
         Agreement, including Purchaser's obligations under Section 6.2(a));

              (d) by either Seller or Purchaser, if (x) there shall have been a
         material breach by the other of any of its representations,
         warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, which
         breach would result in the failure to satisfy one or more of the
         conditions set forth in Section 7.2 (in the case of a breach by
         Seller) or Section 7.3 (in the case of a breach by Purchaser), and
         such breach shall be incapable of being cured or, if capable of being
         cured, shall not have been cured within 30 days after written notice
         thereof shall have been received by the party alleged to be in breach.

         10.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION AND ABANDONMENT. In the event of
termination of this Agreement pursuant to this Article 10, this Agreement
(other than as set forth in Sections 6.4(c) and 6.6) shall become void and of
no effect with no liability on the part of any party hereto (or of any of its
Representatives); provided, however, no such termination shall relieve any
party hereto from any liability for damages (including fees and out-of-pocket
expenses) resulting from any knowing or intentional breach of this Agreement by
such party or any liability for fees and out-of-pocket expenses incurred as a
result of any breach of this Agreement by such party.

                                  ARTICLE 11.
