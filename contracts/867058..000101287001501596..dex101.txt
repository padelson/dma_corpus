                                  The Merger

     Section 2.01 . The Merger. (a) At the Effective Time, Merger Subsidiary
shall be merged (the "Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with
California Law, whereupon the separate existence of Merger Subsidiary shall

                                       6
<PAGE>

cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation (the "Surviving
Corporation").

     (b)  As soon as practicable after satisfaction or, to the extent permitted
hereunder, waiver of all conditions to the Merger, the Company and Merger
Subsidiary will file an agreement of merger with the Secretary of State of the
State of California and make all other filings or recordings required by
California Law in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall become effective
at such time (the "Effective Time") as the agreement of merger is accepted by
the Secretary of State of the State of California or at such later time as is
specified in the agreement of merger. Immediately prior to the filing of the
agreement of merger, a closing (the "Closing") will be held at the offices of
Davis Polk & Wardwell, 1600 El Camino Real, Menlo Park, California 94025 (or
such other place as the parties may agree). It is the parties' intention that
the Closing occur immediately following the execution of this Agreement on May
21, 2001, or as soon as practicable thereafter.

     (c)  From and after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall
possess all the rights, powers, privileges and franchises and be subject to all
of the obligations, liabilities, restrictions and disabilities of the Company
and Merger Subsidiary, all as provided under California Law.

     Section 2.02.  Conversion of Shares.  At the Effective Time:

     (a)  except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.04, each
Share outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Holdback in
cash without interest;

     (b)  except as otherwise provided in Section 2.02(c) or Section 2.04, each
share of Preferred Stock shall receive, in addition to the Merger Consideration
less the Escrow Holdback, the right to receive $0.25 in cash without interest
(the "Liquidation Consideration");

     (c)  each Share held by the Company as treasury stock or owned by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
canceled, and no payment shall be made with respect thereto; and

     (d)  each share of common stock of Merger Subsidiary outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one
share of common stock of the Surviving Corporation with the same rights, powers
and privileges as the shares so converted and shall constitute the only
outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

     Section 2.03. Surrender and Payment. (a) Parent will act as exchange agent
(the "Exchange Agent") for the purpose of exchanging certificates representing
Shares (the "Certificates") for the Merger Consideration (less the

                                       7
<PAGE>

Escrow Holdback) and the Liquidation Consideration. Immediately following the
Closing, Parent will make available the Merger Consideration (less the Escrow
Holdback) and Liquidation Consideration to be paid in respect of the Shares. On
the Closing Date or promptly thereafter, Shareholders will surrender the
Certificates to the Exchange Agent for cancellation together with a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates to the Exchange Agent) for use in such exchange.

     (b)  Each holder of Shares that have been converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Holdback (and the Liquidation
Consideration, if applicable) will be entitled to receive, upon surrender to the
Exchange Agent of a Certificate, together with a properly completed letter of
transmittal, the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Holdback (and the
Liquidation Consideration, if applicable) payable for each Share represented by
such Certificate. All such funds shall be paid to the holders of Shares by wire
transfer to accounts specified in their respective letters of transmittal or,
upon the request of any such holder, by check. Until so surrendered, each such
Certificate shall represent after less the Effective Time for all purposes only
the right to receive such Merger Consideration the Escrow Holdback (and the
Liquidation Consideration, if applicable).

     (c)  If any portion of the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Holdback or
Liquidation Consideration is to be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall be a condition to
such payment that the Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other taxes required as
a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered holder of such
Certificate or establish to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax
has been paid or is not payable.

     (d)  After the Effective Time, there shall be no further registration of
transfers of Shares. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to
the Surviving Corporation, they shall be canceled and exchanged for the Merger
Consideration less the Escrow Holdback (and the Liquidation Consideration, if
applicable) provided for, and in accordance with the procedures set forth, in
this Article 2.

     (e)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration (less the Escrow Holdback) or
Liquidation Consideration made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to
Section 2.03(a) (and any interest or other income earned thereon) that remains
unclaimed by the holders of Shares twenty (20) Business Days after the Effective
Time shall be returned to Parent, upon demand, and any such holder who has not
exchanged Shares for the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Holdback (and the
Liquidation Consideration, if applicable) in accordance with this Section 2.03
prior to that time shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment

                                       8
<PAGE>

of the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Holdback (and the Liquidation
Consideration, if applicable) in respect of such Shares without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent shall not be liable to any holder
of Shares for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar laws. Immediately prior to such time when
amounts remaining unclaimed by holders of Shares would otherwise escheat to or
become property of any governmental authority, such unclaimed amounts shall
become, to the extent permitted by applicable law, the property of Parent free
and clear of any claims or interest of any Persons previously entitled thereto.

     (f)  Any portion of the Merger Consideration or Liquidation Consideration
made available to the Exchange Agent pursuant to Section 2.03(a) to pay for
Shares for which appraisal rights have been perfected shall be returned to
Parent, upon demand.

     Section 2.04. Dissenting Shares. Notwithstanding Section 2.02, Shares
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by a holder who has
not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in writing and who has
demanded appraisal for such Shares in accordance with California Law shall not
be converted into a right to receive the Merger Consideration or Liquidation
Consideration, but the holder thereof shall only be entitled to such rights as
are provided by California Law, unless such holder fails to perfect, withdraws
or otherwise loses its right to appraisal. If, after the Effective Time, such
holder fails to perfect, withdraws or loses its right to appraisal, such Shares
shall be treated as if they had been converted as of the Effective Time into a
right to receive the Merger Consideration less the Escrow Holdback (and the
Liquidation Consideration, if applicable). The Company shall give Parent prompt
notice of any demands received by the Company for appraisal of Shares, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands. Except with the prior written consent of Parent,
the Company shall not make any payment with respect to, or settle or offer to
settle, any such demands.

     Section 2.05. Stock Options. (a) Except as provided in Section 2.05(c), all
options (the "Company Stock Options") outstanding, whether or not exercisable
and whether or not vested, at the Effective Time under the Company's 1997 Stock
Plan (the "Company Stock Option Plan"), shall, at the Effective Time and by
virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,
be assumed by Parent. Each Company Stock Option so assumed by Parent under this
Agreement shall continue to have, and be subject to, substantially similar terms
and conditions to those set forth in the Company Stock Option Plan or as
provided in the respective option agreement immediately prior to the Effective
Time, except that (i) each Company Stock Option will be exercisable for that
number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of the number
of shares of Company Common Stock that were issuable upon exercise of such
Company Stock Option immediately prior to the Effective

                                       9
<PAGE>

Time multiplied by the Option Exchange Ratio, rounded down to the nearest whole
number of shares of Parent Common Stock; and (ii) the per share exercise price
for the shares of Parent Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such assumed
Company Stock Option will be equal to the quotient determined by dividing the
exercise price per share of Company Capital Stock at which such Company Option
was exercisable immediately prior to the Effective Time by the Option Exchange
Ratio, rounded up to the nearest whole cent. It is the intention of the parties
hereto that the Company Stock Options assumed by Parent following the Closing
pursuant to this Section 2.05 will, to the extent permitted by applicable law,
qualify as incentive stock options as defined in Section 422 of the Code, to the
extent any such Company Stock Options qualified as incentive stock options
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

     (b)  As soon as practicable after the Effective Time and in no event later
than 30 days after the Effective Time, Parent shall deliver to each holder of an
outstanding Company Stock Option an appropriate notice setting forth such
holder's rights pursuant thereto. Parent shall take all corporate action
necessary to reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares of Parent Common
Stock for delivery upon exercise of assumed Company Stock Options pursuant to
the terms set forth in this Section 2.05. As soon as reasonably practicable
after the Effective Time and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after
the Effective Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock subject to Company Stock
Options will be covered by an effective registration statement on Form S-8 (or
any successor form) or another appropriate form, and Parent shall use its
reasonable efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement
or registration statements for so long as Substitute Options remain outstanding.

     (c)  Five (5) Business Days after the Effective Time, with respect to any
or all of a holder's Company Stock Options which were vested and exercisable at
the Effective Time, and upon receipt of written notice to such effect and
receipt of the exercise price, such Company Stock Options shall be converted
into the right to receive the Merger Consideration. All holders of Company Stock
Options which were vested and exercisable at the Effective Time, who provide
such notice will be deemed to have consented to the appointment of the
Shareholders' Representative and to the Shareholders' Representative Agreement.
Absent such written notice, such Company Stock Options shall be treated as
provided in Section 2.05(a).

     Section 2.06.  Adjustments. If, during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, any change in the outstanding Shares shall
occur, including by reason of any reclassification, recapitalization, stock
split or combination, exchange or readjustment of Shares, or stock dividend
thereon with a record date during such period, the Merger Consideration, the
Escrow Holdback, the Liquidation Consideration and any other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement shall be appropriately adjusted.

                                       10
<PAGE>

     Section 2.07.  Withholding Rights.  Each of the Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable to any Person pursuant to this Article 2 such amounts as it is required
to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under any
provision of federal, state, local or foreign tax law.  If the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, as the case may be, so withholds amounts, such amounts
shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holder of the Shares in respect of which the Surviving Corporation or Parent, as
the case may be, made such deduction and withholding.

     Section 2.08.  Escrow.  Prior to or simultaneously with the Closing, the
Shareholder Representative and Parent shall enter into an escrow agreement (the
"Escrow Agreement") with an escrow agent selected by Parent and reasonably
acceptable to the Shareholder Representative (the "Escrow Agent") substantially
in the form of Exhibit C hereto.  Pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement,
at the Closing Parent shall deposit the Escrow Amount into an escrow account,
which account is to be managed by the Escrow Agent (the "Escrow Account").
Distributions of any money from the Escrow Account shall be governed by the
terms and conditions of the Escrow Agreement (any money in the Escrow Account
being referred to as the "Escrow Fund").  The parties acknowledge and agree that
(i) any amount distributed by the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Account  to the
Shareholders pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement shall be treated, for
U.S. federal income tax purposes, as additional consideration paid to the
Shareholders for their Shares pursuant to the Merger as and when such amount is
distributed, and (ii) a portion of each such distribution shall be treated as a
payment of interest in accordance with Section 483 of the Code.

     Section 2.09.  Lost Certificates.  If any Certificate shall have been lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such
reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct, as indemnity against
any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the
Exchange Agent will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, the Merger Consideration (less the Escrow Holdback) and the
Liquidation Consideration, if applicable, to be paid in respect of the Shares
represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this Article 2.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                           The Surviving Corporation

     Section 3.01.  Articles of Incorporation.  The articles of incorporation of
Merger Subsidiary in effect at the Effective Time shall be the articles of

applicable law, provided that, at the Effective Time, Section 1 of the articles
of

                                       11

Effective Time shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until amended in

until successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified in accordance with
applicable law, (i) the directors of Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time
shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation and (ii) the officers of
Merger Subsidiary at the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving
Corporation.

a complete and accurate list of every jurisdiction in which the Company is
qualified to do business.  The Company is duly qualified to do business as a
foreign corporation and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where such

benefit to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is entitled under any
provision of any agreement or other instrument binding upon the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries or any license, franchise, permit, certificate, approval or
other similar authorization affecting, or relating in any way to, the assets or
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (iv) result in the creation or
imposition of any Lien on any asset of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

     Section 4.05.  Capitalization.  (a) The authorized capital stock of the

<PAGE>

aggregate of 1,377,800 Shares (of which options to purchase an aggregate of
250,564 Shares were vested and exercisable).  All outstanding shares of capital
stock of the Company have been, and all shares that may be issued pursuant to
the 1997 Stock Plan will be, when issued in accordance with the respective terms
thereof, duly authorized and validly issued, and are fully paid and
nonassessable.  Schedule 4.05 contains a complete and accurate list of every
holder of Company Common Stock, every holder of Preferred Stock and every holder
of employee stock options, including number of shares for which the options are
exercisable, grant date, vesting schedule, and exercise price.

     (b)  There are no outstanding (i) shares of capital stock or voting
securities of the Company, (ii) securities of the Company convertible into or

obligation of the Company to issue, any capital stock, voting securities or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for capital stock or voting
securities of the Company (the items in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) being
referred to collectively as the "Company Securities"). There are no outstanding
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to repurchase, redeem or
otherwise acquire any of the Company Securities. The holders of Company Stock
Options and Preferred Stock have been or will be given, or shall have properly
waived, any required notice of the Merger prior thereto.

     (c)  None of the Shares is owned by any Subsidiary of the Company. None of
the Shares were issued in violation of the 1993 Act, California Law or other
state securities laws or regulations or any preemptive rights.

     (d)  No officer or director (excluding William Adkins, Peter Welter and
Carol Wood) of the Company holds any Exercisable Options (which for purposes
only of this Section 4.05(d) shall not include Company Stock Options which have
been exercised subject only to the condition that the Closing shall occur).

     Section 4.06.   Subsidiaries.  (a)  Each Subsidiary of the Company is a
corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the
laws of its jurisdiction of incorporation, has all corporate powers and all
governmental licenses, authorizations, permits, consents and approvals required
to carry on its business as now conducted.  Each such Subsidiary is duly
qualified to do business as a foreign corporation and is in good standing in
each jurisdiction where such qualification is necessary, except for those
jurisdictions where failure to be so qualified would not have, individually or
the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect on the Company and such Subsidiary,
taken as a whole.  Schedule 4.06 contains a complete and accurate list for each
Subsidiary, listing jurisdiction of incorporation and every other jurisdiction
in which such subsidiary is qualified to do business.  No Subsidiary is in
violation of any of the provisions of its articles or certificates of
incorporation or bylaws.  Schedule 4.06 sets forth for each Subsidiary its name,

<PAGE>

     (b)  All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of, or other voting
securities or ownership interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company is owned by
the Company, directly or indirectly, free and clear of any Lien and free of any
other limitation or restriction (including any restriction on the right to vote,

necessary for a fair presentation of the consolidated financial position and
results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the dates

     (g)  There has been no amendment to, written interpretation or announcement

the Company and its Subsidiaries currently are permitted to use for income and
franchise Tax purposes, and regarding changes in such accounting methods that

income or franchise Tax purposes as Parent determines to be appropriate and (ii)

Parent determines to be necessary for the Company and its Subsidiaries to
satisfy fully their liability for such Taxes with respect to their income as

taxes or fees for which both one or more shareholders of the Company, and either
the Company or Parent, are liable shall be borne 50% by Parent and 50% by such
shareholders and such shareholders shall file all necessary related Tax Returns
and documentation (it being understood that Shareholders will pay such Transfer
Tax to the applicable Tax Authority in the first instance and Parent shall
promptly reimburse such shareholder upon receipt of evidence satisfactory to it

     Section 7.02.  Benefits; Prior Service.  From and after the Effective Time,
the Company's employees shall be provided with employee benefits that are
substantially similar to those provided to employees of Parent who are similarly

service with the Company.  Parent shall waive any and all pre-existing condition
limitations, eligibility waiting periods and evidence of insurability
requirements under any group health plans to be waived with respect to such

provision under the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws as in effect
on the date hereof. The articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation will contain provisions with respect to exculpation and
indemnification that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as
those contained in the Company's articles of incorporation and bylaws as in
effect on the date hereof, which provisions will not be amended, repealed or
otherwise modified for a period of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any
manner that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any Indemnified
Party or of individuals who, immediately prior to the Effective Time, were
employees or agents of Company, unless such modification is required by law.

respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other
person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers a material amount of its
properties and assets to any person in a single transaction or a series of
transactions, then, and in each such case, Parent will either guarantee or
otherwise remain liable for the indemnification obligations referred to in this
Section 7.03 or will make or cause to be made proper provision so that the
successors and assigns of Company or the Surviving Corporation, as the case may
be, assume the indemnification obligations described herein for the benefit of
the Indemnified Parties.

     (c)  The provisions of this Section 7.03 shall survive consummation of the
Merger and are (i) intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable

                                       39

by, each of the Indemnified Parties and (ii) in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any
such Indemnified Party may have by contract or otherwise.

Effective Time. Neither the period of survival nor the liability of a party
hereto with respect to such party's representations and warranties shall be
reduced by any investigation made at any time by or on behalf of another party

the applicable representations and warranties by a party hereto to another party

limitation, Taxes due under applicable law but not yet paid by reason of a
breach of Section 4.14), losses, damages, claims, costs and expenses, interest,
awards, judgments and penalties (including, without limitation, reasonable

incurred in connection with investigating, defending against or settling any
such claims) actually suffered or incurred by them (including, without
limitation, in connection with any action brought or otherwise initiated by any
of them arising out of or resulting from the breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant (without giving effect to any qualification as to
materiality contained therein in determining the amount of any loss)
(hereinafter, a "Loss"), made by the Company in this Agreement. The aggregate
amount of Losses for which the Parent Indemnified Parties may receive
indemnification pursuant to this Agreement shall not exceed the amount of the
Escrow Fund.

     (c)  Any Parent Indemnified Party seeking indemnification from another
party hereto (the "Indemnifying Party") under this Section 11.02 shall give the
Escrow Agent and the Shareholder Representative, notice of any matter which such
Parent Indemnified Party has determined has given rise to a right of
indemnification under this Agreement, prior to the expiration of the applicable
representations and warranties as set forth in this Section 11.02, stating the
amount of the Loss, if known, and method of computation thereof, and containing
a reference to the specific provisions of this Agreement in respect of which
such right of indemnification is claimed or arises. All fees, expenses and
Losses of the Parent Indemnified Party or the Indemnifying Party in connection
with any matter

                                       46
<PAGE>

for which indemnity may be sought shall be reimbursed from the Escrow Account in
accordance with the Escrow Agreement, it being understood that the Shareholder
Representative shall be the only person authorized to approve the incurrence of
any reimbursable fees and expenses on behalf of shareholders.

     (d)  If, in the event that (a) the Shareholder Representative shall not
have objected to the amount claimed by the Parent Indemnified Party for
indemnification from the Escrow Fund with respect to any Loss in accordance with
the procedures set forth herein and in the Escrow Agreement or (b) the
Shareholder Representative shall have delivered notice of its disagreement as to
the amount of any indemnification requested by the Parent Indemnified Party from
the Escrow Fund and either (i) the Shareholder Representative and the Parent
Indemnified Party shall have, subsequent to the giving of such notice, mutually
agreed that the Parent Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification from the
Escrow Fund for a specified amount and shall have so jointly notified the Escrow
Agent or (ii) a final judgment shall have been rendered by the court having
jurisdiction over the matters relating to such claim by the Parent Indemnified
Party for indemnification from the Escrow Fund, and the Escrow Agent shall have
received, in the case of clause (i) above, joint written instructions from the
Shareholder Representative and the Parent Indemnified Party or, in the case of
clause (ii) above, a copy of the final judgment of the court and written
instructions from the Parent Indemnified Party, the Escrow Agent shall deliver
to the Parent Indemnified Party funds from the Escrow Fund in respect of any
amount determined to be owed to the Parent Indemnified Party under this Section
11.02 in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

     (e)  In all matters relating to this Section 11.02, the Shareholder
Representative shall be the only party entitled to assert the rights of the
Individual Shareholders, and the Shareholder Representative shall perform all of
the obligations of the Individual Shareholders hereunder. Parent shall be
entitled to rely on all statements, representations and decisions of the
Shareholder Representative.

     (f)  Notwithstanding anything else in this Agreement, the Indemnified
Parties shall not be entitled to recover under this Section 11.02 with respect
to any breach of representations, warranties or covenants, unless the aggregate
amount of Losses arising out of all such breaches of representations, warranties
and covenants exceeds $500,000, at which time the Indemnified Parties shall be
entitled to recover all Losses in excess of $500,000.

     (g)  The indemnification provided by this Section 11.02 shall be the sole
and exclusive post-Closing remedy available to Parent and Merger Subsidiary for
any claim related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
except with respect to claims arising out of fraud, or the willful breach of
covenants by a party hereto.

     Section 11.03.  Defense Of Claims. In connection with any claim giving rise
to indemnity hereunder resulting from or arising out of any claim or legal
proceeding by a third party, Parent shall give the Shareholder Representative
prompt notice of such claim and the Indemnifying Party at its sole cost and
expense (the sole source of satisfaction of which shall be the Escrow Account
pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement) and with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Parent Indemnified Party may, upon written notice to the
Parent Indemnified Party, assume the defense of any such claim or legal
proceeding if (1) the Escrow Account is comprised of sufficient financial
resources to defend against such third-party claim and fulfill the Indemnifying
Party's highest reasonably likely Losses with respect to such claim or legal
proceeding, (2) the third-party claim does not seek an injunction or other
equitable relief against or adversely affecting a Parent Indemnified Party, (3)
the Indemnifying Party acknowledges in writing its obligation to indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Party against any Losses that may result from the third-party
claim (subject to the sufficiency of the funds in the Escrow Account), and (4)
the Indemnifying Party agrees in writing not to settle such claim or proceeding
without the prior written consent of the Parent Indemnified Party, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Parent Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of any such action,
with its counsel at its own expense; provided, however, that if there are one or
more legal defenses available to the Parent Indemnified Party that conflict with
those available to the Indemnifying Party, or the Indemnifying Party fails to
take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the claim after receiving
notice from the Parent Indemnified Party that it believes that the Indemnifying
Party has failed to do so, the Parent Indemnified Party may assume the defense
of such claim; and provided, further, that the Parent Indemnified Party may not
settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party,
which consent may not be unreasonably withheld. If the Parent Indemnified Party
assumes the defense of the claim, the Parent Indemnified Party shall be
reimbursed out of the Escrow Account pursuant to the terms of the Escrow
Agreement on a monthly basis for reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
retained by the Parent Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party shall be
entitled to participate in (but not control) the defense of such claim, with its
counsel at its own expense. If the Indemnifying Party thereafter seeks to
question the manner in which the Parent Indemnified Party defended such third
party claim or the amount or nature of any such settlement, the Indemnifying
Party shall have the burden to prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
the Parent Indemnified Party did not defend or settle such third-party claim in
a reasonable, prudent manner. The parties agree to render, without compensation,
to each other such assistance as they may reasonably require of each other and
to cooperate in good faith with each other, including providing such documents
and records as may be pertinent and the time and attention of such personnel as
may reasonably be necessary, in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense
of any action , suit or proceeding, whether or not subject to indemnification
hereunder.

     WHEREAS, Mercury, Aqua Merger Company, a California corporation, and a

written consent of the shareholders of the Company, (i) in favor of the adoption
of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (ii) against any merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, recapitalization or other business combination
involving the Company (other than the Merger) or any other action or agreement
that would result in a breach of any covenant, representation or warranty or any
other obligation or agreement of the Company under the Merger Agreement or which
would result in any of the conditions to the Company's obligations under the
Merger Agreement not being fulfilled.

     Section 1.03.  Grant Of Proxy; Further Assurances. (a) Each Shareholder, by
this Agreement, with respect to the Shares set out in Exhibit B hereto and any
Shares hereafter acquired by such Shareholder, does hereby irrevocably

substitution, as his, her or its true and lawful attorney and proxy, for and in
his, her or its name, place and stead, to vote each of such Shares as such
Shareholder's proxy, at every annual, special or adjourned meeting of the
shareholders of the Company (including the right to sign his, her or its name

Company that may be permitted or required by applicable law) (i) in favor of the
adoption of the Merger Agreement and approval of the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement, and (ii) against any merger,
consolidation, sale of assets, recapitalization or other business combination
involving the Company (other than the Merger) or any other action or agreement

Merger Agreement not being fulfilled. Each Shareholder acknowledges receipt and
review of a copy of the Merger Agreement.

further documents and instruments as may reasonably be required to vest in

                                   ARTICLE 2

         Representations And Warranties; Covenants Of The Shareholders

     Each of the Shareholders hereby severally represents and warrants and
covenants to Mercury as follows:

     Section 2.01.  Organization; Authorization. (a) Such Shareholder has all
legal capacity to execute and deliver this Agreement and to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby. This Agreement has been duly executed and
delivered by or on behalf of each Shareholder and, assuming its due
authorization, execution and delivery by Mercury, constitutes a legal, valid and
binding obligation of each Shareholder, enforceable against each Shareholder in
accordance with its terms.

     Section 2.02.  No Conflict; Required Filings And Consents. (a) The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Shareholder does not, and the
performance of this Agreement by such Shareholder will not, (i) conflict with or
violate any law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree applicable to such
Shareholder or by which it or any of such Shareholder's properties is bound or
affected, or (ii) result in any breach of or constitute a default (or an event
that with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default) under, or give
to another party any rights of termination, amendment, acceleration or
cancellation of, or result in the creation of a lien or encumbrance on any of
the property or assets of such Shareholder, including, without limitation, the
Shares, pursuant to, any note, bond, mortgage, indenture, contract, agreement,
lease, license, permit, franchise or other instrument or obligation to which
such Shareholder is a party or by which such Shareholder or any of such
Shareholder's properties is bound or affected. There is no beneficiary or holder
of a voting trust certificate or other interest of any trust of which such
Shareholder is a trustee whose consent is required for the execution and
delivery of this Agreement or the consummation by such Shareholder of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     (b)  The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Shareholder does
not, and the performance of this Agreement by such Shareholder will not, require
any consent, approval, authorization or permit of, or filing with or
notification to, any governmental or regulatory authority, domestic or foreign,
except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act") and (ii) where the failure to obtain
such consents, approvals, authorizations or permits, or to make such filings or
notifications, would not prevent or materially delay the performance by such
Shareholder of such Shareholder's obligations under this Agreement. Such
Shareholder does not have any understanding in effect with respect to the voting
or transfer of any Shares.

     Section 2.03.  Litigation. There is no private or governmental action,
suit, proceeding, claim, arbitration or investigation pending before any agency,
court or tribunal, foreign or domestic, or, to the knowledge of such Shareholder
or any of such Shareholder's affiliates, threatened against such Shareholder or
any of such Shareholder's affiliates or any of their respective properties or
any of their respective officers or directors, in the case of a corporate entity
(in their capacities as such) that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to materially delay or impair such Shareholder's ability
to consummate the transactions

                                       3
<PAGE>

contemplated by this Agreement. There is no judgment, decree or order against

of such Shareholder or any of such Shareholder's affiliates, any of their
respective directors or officers, in the case of a corporate entity (in their
capacities as such), or any of their respective partners (in the case of a
partnership) that would prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or that would reasonably be
expected to have a material adverse effect on such Shareholder's ability to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

     Section 2.04.  Title To Shares. Each Shareholder is the record or
beneficial owner of its Shares free and clear of all encumbrances, proxy or
voting restriction that would prevent such Shareholder from satisfying its
obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Such Shares are all the securities of
the Company owned of record or beneficially by such Shareholder on the date of
this Agreement.

     Section 2.05.  Absence Of Claims. Each Shareholder has no knowledge of any
causes of action or other claims that could have been or in the future might be
asserted by the Shareholder against the Company or any of its predecessors,
successors, assigns, directors, employees, agents or representatives arising out
of facts or circumstances occurring at any time on or prior to the date hereof
and in any way relating to any duty or obligation of the Company or any
Shareholder, except for claims arising from (i) obligations under written
agreements (which have been provided to Mercury prior to the execution of this
Agreement) between such Shareholder and the Company and (ii) obligations to pay
any fees to such Shareholder in such Shareholder's capacity as a director,
officer, employee or consultant to the Company

     Section 2.06.  Shareholder Representative. (a) Each Shareholder hereby
appoints William C. Nieto (such Person and any successor or successors being the
"Shareholders' Representative"), and the Shareholders' Representative hereby
accepts such appointment, as such Shareholder's attorney-in-fact and
representative to act on behalf of such Shareholder and to take any and all
actions required or permitted to be taken by such Shareholder or the
Shareholders' Representative under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, (i) to do any and all things
and to execute any and all documents or other papers, in such Shareholder's
name, place and stead, in any way that each such Shareholder could do if
personally present, in connection with this Agreement, the Merger Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii)
to amend, cancel or extend, or waive the terms of, this Agreement, the Merger
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any ancillary agreement, (iii) to act on
behalf of such Shareholder with respect to any claims (including the settlement
thereof) made by Mercury for indemnification pursuant to Section 11.02 of the
Merger Agreement and with respect to any actions to be taken by the
Shareholders' Representative pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, and
(iv) to exercise such rights, powers and authority as are incidental to the
foregoing. In the event that the Shareholders' Representative becomes unable or
unwilling to continue in his capacity as Shareholders' Representative under this
Agreement, the holders of a majority of the shares held by the holders of the
Company Common Stock and the Company Preferred Stock outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall promptly appoint a successor Shareholders'

                                       4
<PAGE>

Representative, who shall be reasonably acceptable to Mercury.  The Shareholders
hereby consent to the taking by the Shareholders' Representative of any and all
actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be taken by him
under this Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Escrow Agreement.

     (b)  The Shareholders shall be bound by all actions taken by the
Shareholders' Representative in his capacity as such. Mercury shall be entitled
to rely, as being binding upon each Shareholder, upon any document or other
paper believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been signed or sent
by the Shareholders' Representative, and Mercury shall not be liable to any of
the Shareholders for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it in such
reliance. All reasonable fees and expenses of the Shareholders' Representative
shall be paid by the Shareholders. Mercury shall in no event incur any liability
for (i) any such fees or expenses or (ii) any losses, damages or expenses
arising from or related to, directly or indirectly, any action (or failure to
act) by the Shareholders' Representative.

     Section 2.07.  Confidentiality.  Each Shareholders agrees to, and (if
applicable) shall use its reasonable efforts to cause its agents,
representatives, affiliates (other than in the case of a limited partnership,
the limited partners thereof), employees, officers and directors:

     (a)  to treat and hold as confidential (and not disclose or provide access
to any person other than Mercury and its agents, representatives, affiliates,
employees, officers and directors) all information relating to trade secrets,
patent and trademark applications, product development, price, customer and
supplier lists, pricing and marketing plans, policies and strategies, details of
client and consultant contracts, operations methods, product development
techniques, business acquisition plans, new personnel acquisition plans and all
other confidential information with respect to the Company, Mercury, any
affiliates of Mercury or their businesses;

     (b)  in the event that such Shareholder or any such agent, representative,
affiliate, employee, officer or director becomes legally compelled to disclose
any such information, provide Mercury with prompt written notice of such
requirement so that Mercury or the Company may seek a protective order or other
remedy or waive compliance with this Section 2.07; and

     (c)  in the event that such protective order or other remedy is not
obtained, or Mercury waives compliance with this Section 2.07, furnish only that
portion of such confidential information which is legally required to be
provided and exercise its best efforts to obtain assurances that confidential
treatment will be accorded such information;

provided, however, that this sentence shall not apply to any information that,
(i) at the time of disclosure, is available publicly and was not disclosed in
breach of this Agreement by such Shareholder or such Shareholder's agents,
representatives, affiliates, employees, officers or directors, (ii) must be
disclosed under applicable laws of regulations or judicial or administrative
proceedings (subject to clauses (b) and (c) above), or (iii) shall be disclosed
to such Shareholder's legal advisors who need to know such information in
connection with advising such Shareholder as to his legal rights and
obligations.  Each Shareholder agrees and acknowledges that remedies at law for
any breach of its obligations under this Section 2.07 are

                                       5

inadequate and that in addition thereto Mercury shall be entitled to seek
equitable relief, including injunction and specific performance, in the event of
any such breach.

                                ESCROW AGREEMENT


     ESCROW AGREEMENT, dated as of May 21, 2001 (this "Agreement"), among
Mercury Interactive Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), William
Nieto, solely in his capacity as shareholders' representative (the
"Shareholders' Representative"), and US Bank Trust National Association, as
escrow agent (the "Escrow Agent").

     WHEREAS, Parent, Aqua Merger Company, a California corporation ("Merger
Sub"), and Freshwater Software, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"),
have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May 21, 2001,
(the "Merger Agreement"; terms defined in the Merger Agreement and not otherwise
defined herein being used herein as therein defined), pursuant to which Merger
Sub will merge with and into the Company and the Company will become a wholly
owned subsidiary of Parent;

     WHEREAS, the shareholders of the Company (individually, a "Shareholder",
collectively, the "Shareholders") have appointed the Shareholders'
Representative to act on behalf of such Shareholders for purposes of this
Agreement;

     WHEREAS, it is contemplated under the Merger Agreement that Parent will
deposit or cause to be deposited into escrow at Closing seven million three
hundred and fifty thousand dollars ($7,350,000) (the "Escrow Amount"), to be
held and disbursed by the Escrow Agent in accordance with this Agreement;

     WHEREAS, a copy of the Merger Agreement has been delivered to the Escrow
Agent, and the Escrow Agent is willing to act as the Escrow Agent hereunder; and

     WHEREAS, the Escrow Agent will hold the Escrow Amount in Account Number
94427040 at San Francisco, California, (the "Escrow Account");

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual Agreements
contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Appointment and Agreement of Escrow Agent. Parent and the
          -----------------------------------------
Shareholders' Representative hereby appoint the Escrow Agent to serve as, and
the Escrow Agent hereby agrees to act as, escrow agent upon the terms and
conditions of this Agreement.
<PAGE>

     2.   Establishment of the Escrow Funds.
          ---------------------------------

     (a)  Pursuant to Section 2.08 of the Merger Agreement, Parent shall deliver
to the Escrow Agent on the date hereof the Escrow Amount either by wire transfer
or certified check. The Escrow Agent shall hold the Escrow Amount and all
interest and other amounts earned thereon (the "Escrow Fund") in escrow pursuant
to this Agreement.

     (b)  The Parent confirms to the Escrow Agent that the funds comprising the
Escrow Amount are free and clear of all encumbrances, except as may be created
by this Agreement and the Merger Agreement.

     3.   Purpose of the Escrow Funds. The Escrow Amount will be deposited with
          ---------------------------
the Escrow Agent and held by the Escrow Agent to secure the indemnification
obligations provided for in Article 11 of the Merger Agreement.

     4.   Shareholder Percentage Interest in Escrow. Attached hereto as Schedule
          -----------------------------------------
A is a schedule listing each Shareholder and such Shareholder's interest in the
Escrow Fund (expressed as a percentage, based upon the Shareholder's equity in
the Company at the Effective Time).

     5.   Taxes. (a) Parent shall be responsible for and shall pay and discharge
          -----
all taxes, assessments and governmental charges imposed on or with respect to
the Escrow Fund and the income and gain thereon.

     (b)  The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any
funds or other assets otherwise payable out of the Escrow Fund to any
Shareholder pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as the Escrow Agent is
required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under
any provision of Federal, state, or local or foreign tax law.  If the Escrow
Agent so withholds amounts, such amounts shall be treated for the purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the Shareholder in respect of which the
Escrow Agent made such deductions and withholding.  Each Shareholder shall
promptly provide to the Escrow Agent such tax forms as the Escrow Agent
reasonably requests in connection with its obligations under the Internal
Revenue Code and the Treasury Regulations thereunder in respect of withholding,
backup withholding and information reporting.

     (c)  The parties acknowledge and agree that (i) any amount distributed by
the Escrow Agent from the Escrow Account  to the Shareholders pursuant to the
terms of the Escrow Agreement shall be treated, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, as additional consideration paid to the Shareholders for their Shares
pursuant to the Merger as and when such amount is distributed, and (ii) a
portion of each such distribution shall be treated as a payment of interest in
accordance with Section 483 of the Internal Revenue Code.

                                       2

     6.   Payments from the Escrow Fund.

     (a)  If, at any time on or prior to the first anniversary of the Effective
Time (the "Expiration Date"), a Parent Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim
against the Escrow Fund, the Parent Indemnified Party shall deliver to the
Escrow Agent a certificate of such Parent Indemnified Party, executed by an
authorized officer of such Parent Indemnified Party (a "Parent Indemnified
Party's Certificate"), which Parent Indemnified Party's Certificate shall:

          (i)   state that such Parent Indemnified Party has paid or incurred a
     Loss for which Parent is entitled to recovery under Section 11.02(b) of the
     Merger Agreement (an "Indemnification Item");

          (ii)  state the aggregate amount of such Indemnification Item and the
     amount of money necessary to satisfy the Loss specified in the
     Indemnification Item; and

          (iii) specify in reasonable detail the nature and amount of each
     individual Indemnification Item.

When delivering said Parent Indemnified Party's Certificate to the Escrow Agent,
the Parent Indemnified Party shall simultaneously deliver a copy of such Parent
Indemnified Party's Certificate to the Shareholders' Representative.

     (b)  If the Shareholders' Representative shall object to any amount claimed
in connection with any Indemnification Item specified in any Parent Indemnified
Party's Certificate, the Shareholders' Representative shall, within 20 Business
Days after delivery by the Escrow Agent to the Shareholders' Representative of
such Parent Indemnified Party's Certificate, deliver to the Escrow Agent a
certificate, executed by the Shareholders' Representative (a "Shareholders'
Certificate"),

          (i)   specifying each such amount to which the Shareholders'
     Representative objects; and

         (ii)   specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis for each
     such objection.

When delivering said Shareholders' Certificate to the Escrow Agent, the
Shareholders' Representative shall simultaneously deliver a copy of such
Shareholders' Certificate to the Parent Indemnified Party. If the Escrow Agent
shall not have received a Shareholders' Certificate objecting to the amount
claimed with respect to an Indemnification Item within 20 Business Days of
delivery to the Shareholders' Representative of a Parent Indemnified Party's
Certificate specifying such Indemnification Item, the Shareholders'
Representative shall be deemed to have acknowledged the correctness of the

                                       3
<PAGE>

amount claimed on such Parent Indemnified Party's Certificate with respect to
such Indemnification Item, and the Escrow Agent shall thereafter transfer funds
by wire transfer to Parent as soon as administratively permissible out of the
Escrow Fund in an amount equal to the amount claimed in the Parent Indemnified
Party's Certificate with respect to such Indemnification Item.

     (c)  If the Escrow Agent receives, within 20 Business Days after delivery
to the Shareholders' Representative of a Parent Indemnified Party's Certificate,
a Shareholders' Certificate objecting to the amount claimed with respect to any
Indemnification Item specified in such Parent Indemnified Party's Certificate,
the amount so objected to shall be held by the Escrow Agent and shall not be
released from the Escrow Fund, except in accordance with either:

          (i)   written instructions executed by Parent and the Shareholders'
     Representative, or

          (ii)  written instructions from the Parent Indemnified Party and the
     final nonappealable judgment of a court having jurisdiction over the
     matters relating to the claim by the Parent Indemnified Party for
     indemnification from the Shareholders,

after which time the Escrow Agent shall transfer funds as soon as
administratively practicable out of the Escrow Fund, equal to the amount set
forth in the written instructions or in such judgment, as the case may be.

     (d)  Notwithstanding the limitations set forth in this Agreement, following
the Expiration Date, the Parent Indemnified Party shall be entitled to assert
claims against the Escrow Fund under this Section 6 in respect of all Losses
that were included in determining the Reserved Amount (as defined below).

     (e)  For purposes of this Agreement, the "Reserved Amount" shall be equal
to the aggregate of the amounts claimed and unpaid in all Parent Indemnified
Party's Certificates delivered to the Escrow Agent prior to the Expiration Date,
to the extent such claims shall not have been resolved on or prior to the
Expiration Date.

          (i)   If, on the Expiration Date, the Reserved Amount is less than the
     remaining Escrow Fund, one day after the Expiration Date, the Escrow Agent
     shall (A) retain in the Escrow Fund such amount equal to the Reserved
     Amount and then (B) transfer to each Shareholder by wire transfer in
     immediately available funds in accordance with the written wire transfer
     instructions provided by the Shareholders' Representative the amount in
     cash, if any, then remaining in the Escrow Fund attributable to such

provided, however, that Parent may assign this Agreement to an Affiliate of
Parent, any Person who purchases all or substantially all of the assets of
Parent, or any successor corporation to Parent by reason of a merger or other
combination without the consent of the other parties; provided further, however,
that Parent may also assign this Agreement to any person who purchases Parent's
entire interest in the Company or all or substantially all of the assets of the
Company and the Business.  This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure solely
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their permitted assigns.

     10.  Escrow Agent. (a) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement
          ------------
or by joint written instructions from Parent and the Shareholders'
Representative, the Escrow Agent shall not transfer or otherwise dispose of in
any manner all or any portion of the Escrow Funds, except pursuant to an order
of a court of competent jurisdiction.

     (b)  The duties and obligations of the Escrow Agent shall be determined
solely by this Agreement, and the Escrow Agent shall not be liable except for
the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in
this Agreement.

     (c)  In the performance of its duties hereunder, the Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely upon any document, instrument or signature believed by it in
good faith to be genuine and signed by any party hereto or an authorized officer
or agent thereof, and shall not be required to investigate the truth or accuracy
of any statement contained in any such document or instrument. The Escrow Agent
may assume that any person purporting to give any notice in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement has been duly authorized to do so.

     (d)  The Escrow Agent shall not be liable for any error of judgment, or any
action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken, hereunder except in the case of

and protection for any action taken or suffered by it hereunder in good faith
and in accordance with the opinion of such counsel.

     (e)  The Escrow Agent shall have no duty as to the collection or protection

fee in the amount specified in Schedule A to this Agreement and shall be
reimbursed upon request for all expenses, disbursements and advances, including

this Agreement. All such fees and expenses shall be paid by Parent.

     (g)  Parent and the Shareholders shall reimburse and indemnify the Escrow
agent for, and hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense,
including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred without
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent

Shareholders on the other.

prior written notice of resignation to Parent and the Shareholders'
Representative.  Parent and the Shareholders' Representative may at any time
jointly remove the Escrow Agent by giving ten business days' written notice
signed by each of them to the Escrow Agent. If the Escrow Agent shall resign or
be removed, a successor Escrow Agent, which shall be a bank or trust company
having its principal executive offices in California or New York and assets in
excess of $500 million, and which shall be reasonably acceptable to the
Shareholders' Representative, shall be appointed by Parent by written instrument
executed by Parent and the Shareholders' Representative and delivered to the
Escrow Agent and to such successor Escrow Agent and, thereupon, the resignation
or removal of the predecessor Escrow Agent shall become effective and such
successor Escrow Agent, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall

successor Escrow Agent, execute and deliver to such successor Escrow Agent all
the right, title and interest hereunder in and to the Escrow Funds of such
predecessor Escrow Agent and all other rights hereunder of such predecessor
Escrow Agent.  If no successor Escrow Agent shall have been appointed within 20
business days of a notice of resignation by the Escrow Agent, the Escrow Agent's
sole responsibility shall thereafter be to hold the Escrow Funds until the
earlier of its receipt of designation of a successor Escrow Agent, a joint
written instruction by Parent and the Shareholders' Representative and
termination of this Agreement in accordance with its terms.

     11.  Termination. This Agreement shall terminate on the later of: (a) the
          -----------
date on which there are no funds or other property remaining in the Escrow
Account and (b) ten business days following the date on which all claims made in

                     SHAREHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE AGREEMENT


     This SHAREHOLDERS' REPRESENTATIVE AGREEMENT, dated as of May 21, 2001 (this
"Agreement"), is by and between Freshwater Software, Inc., a California
corporation ("Freshwater") on behalf of the Shareholders (as defined below), and
William C. Nieto, solely in his capacity as shareholders' representative (the
"Shareholders' Representative").

     WHEREAS, Mercury Interactive Corporation ("Parent"), a Delaware
corporation, Aqua Merger Company, a California corporation ("Merger Sub"), and
Freshwater have entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of May
21, 2001, (the "Merger Agreement"; terms defined in the Merger Agreement and not
otherwise defined herein being used herein as therein defined), pursuant to
which Merger Sub will merge with and into Freshwater and Freshwater will become
a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent;

     WHEREAS, Parent, Shareholders' Representative and U.S. Bank Trust National
Association, as escrow agent ("Escrow Agent"), have entered into an Escrow
Agreement, dated as of May 21, 2001, pursuant to which certain funds paid by
Parent to the shareholders of Freshwater and, pursuant to Section 2.05(c)
certain holders of vested and exercisable options of Freshwater who elect to
convert their options into cash (individually, a "Shareholder", collectively,
the "Shareholders") under the Merger Agreement will be held and disbursed by
Escrow Agent;

     WHEREAS, the parties desire to set forth the scope of the Shareholders'
Representative's duties and the terms and conditions pursuant to which the
Shareholders' Representative will act;

     NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual Agreements
contained herein and in the Merger Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, the parties hereby agree as follows:

     1.   Appointment and Authority of Shareholders' Representative. Effective
          ---------------------------------------------------------
upon the vote of the Shareholders approving the Merger Agreement, and without
any further act of any Shareholder, the Shareholders' Representative shall be
appointed as the Shareholders' attorney-in-fact and representative to act on
behalf of such Shareholder and to take any and all actions required or permitted
to be taken by such Shareholder or the Shareholders' Representative under this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, including, without
limitation, (i) to do any and all things and to execute any and all documents or
other papers, in such Shareholder's name, place and stead, in any way that each
such Shareholder could do if personally present, in connection with this
Agreement, the Merger Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, (ii) to amend, cancel or extend, or waive the
terms of, this Agreement, the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any
ancillary agreement, (iii) to act on behalf of such Shareholder with respect to
any claims (including the settlement thereof) made by Parent for indemnification
pursuant to Section 11.02 of the Merger Agreement and with respect to any

Shareholders' Representative Retainer) payable by Freshwater for the
Shareholders' Representative's reasonable fees and expenses (the "Charges"). In
the event the Shareholders' Representative Retainer is insufficient to satisfy
the Charges, then each Shareholder will be obligated to pay a percentage of the
Charges in excess of the advance payment proportionate to that Shareholder's
percentage interest in the Escrow Fund.  If a Shareholder properly objects to a
Charge submitted for payment by the Shareholder Representative within twenty
(20) business days of having received notice of said Charge, the dispute shall
be decided by binding arbitration in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association, San Francisco Regional Office.

statement or other document believed by him to be genuine and to have been
signed by the proper person (and shall have no responsibility to determine the
authenticity thereof), nor for any other action or inaction, except his own
willful misconduct or bad faith.  In all questions arising under the Merger
Agreement or the Escrow Agreement, the Shareholders' Representative may rely on
the advice of counsel, and the Shareholders' Representative will not be liable
to anyone for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by the
Shareholders' Representative based on such advice.  Except as expressly provided
herein, the Shareholders' Representative will not be required to take any action
involving any expense unless the payment of such expense is made or provided for
in a manner satisfactory to him.

     4.   Indemnification of Shareholders Representative. The Shareholders on
          ----------------------------------------------
whose behalf the funds were contributed to the Escrow Fund shall severally
indemnify the Shareholders' Representative and hold the Shareholders'
Representative harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without
gross negligence or bad faith on the part of the Shareholders' Representative
and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the
Shareholders' Representative's duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees
and expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Shareholders' Representative.

     5.   Termination of Service of the Shareholders' Representative.

Shareholders to Parent and the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will be effective

consent appointing such new representative signed by holders of a majority of
the Shareholders to Parent and the Escrow Agent. Such appointment will be

9.02(c) of the Merger Agreement.  All capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the
Merger Agreement.

     For purposes of rendering the opinion expressed herein, we have reviewed

     9.   the Bylaws of the Company.

     In addition, we have examined such corporate records, documents,

of all signatures (other than those of the Company) and the authenticity of all

such entity of all requisite action and the due execution and delivery of such
documents by each such entity.

     As used in this opinion, the expression "to our knowledge" with reference
to matters of fact means that, after an examination of documents provided to us
by the Company, and after inquiries of officers of the Company, but without any
further independent factual investigation, we find no reason to believe that the
opinions expressed herein are factually incorrect.  Further, the expression "to
our knowledge" with reference to matters of fact refers to the current actual
knowledge of the attorneys of this firm who have worked on matters for the
Company related to or in connection with the Merger Agreement and the
transactions contemplated thereby.  Except to the extent expressly set forth
herein or as we otherwise believe to be necessary to our opinion, we have not
undertaken any independent investigation to determine the existence or absence
of any fact, and no inference as to our knowledge of the existence or absence of
any fact should be drawn from our representation of the Company or the rendering
of the opinion set forth below.

     For purposes of this opinion, we are assuming that the Purchaser has all
requisite power and authority, and has taken any and all necessary corporate
action, to execute and deliver the Merger Agreement, and we are assuming that
the representations and warranties made by the Purchaser in the Merger Agreement
and pursuant thereto are true and correct.  We are also assuming that the
representations and warranties made by the Company in the Merger Agreement and
pursuant thereto are true and correct as to matters of fact.

     The opinions hereinafter expressed are subject to the following
qualifications and exceptions:

     (i)  The effect of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement,
moratorium or other similar laws relating to or affecting the rights of
creditors generally, including, without limitation, laws relating to fraudulent
transfers or conveyances, preferences and equitable subordination;

     (ii)   We render no opinion as to the effect or availability of rules of
law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
remedies (regardless of whether any such remedy is considered in a proceeding at
law or in equity);

     (iii)  We express no opinion as to the enforceability of any provisions
which relate to indemnification, contribution, non-competition and/or
arbitration;

     (iv)   We render no opinion as to the enforceability of any voting
agreements contained in the Merger Agreement or the Documents;

     (v)    We render no opinion as to the effect of any statute, rule,
regulation or other law enacted, or any court or regulatory decision rendered,
after the date of this opinion, or the conduct of the parties or any other
person following the date hereof and assume no obligation to advise you or any
other person of any change, whether factual or legal, or whether or not
material, that may arise or be brought to our attention after the date hereof;

     (vi)   This opinion is subject to the effect of statutes and principles of
law and equity providing that certain covenants and provisions of agreements are
unenforceable where enforcement of such covenants or provisions under the
circumstances would violate the enforcing party's implied covenant of good faith
and fair dealing;

     (vii)  This opinion is subject to the effect of statutes and principles of
law and equity that provide that a court may refuse to enforce, or may limit the
application of, a contract or any clause thereof that the court finds to be
unconscionable or contrary to public policy;

     (viii) In rendering the opinion set forth in paragraph 1 below as to the
qualification and good standing of the Company in the states of California and
Colorado and the Subsidiary (as defined below) in the state of Delaware, we have
relied exclusively on certificates of the California Secretary of State, the
California Franchise Tax Board, the Colorado Secretary of State and the Delaware
Secretary of State;

     (ix)   In connection with the opinion expressed in paragraph 3 below, we
have examined the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company and the
Company's minute books. The Company has represented to us, and we have assumed,
that these records are true, correct and complete and constitute all documents
with respect to the issuance of shares of the Company's capital stock. We have
relied on the Company's representations to us as to the nature of the
consideration received for such shares and that the shares are fully paid and
nonassessable. The factual information provided in paragraph 5 as to outstanding
capital stock, stock options, warrants and other outstanding rights is based
solely on factual representations of the Company;

     (x)    With respect to our opinion in Paragraph 6 regarding pending or
threatened action, suit, investigation or proceeding before any court or
arbitrator or before any governmental body, agency or official, domestic,
foreign or supranational body we have relied solely upon an inquiry of attorneys
within our firm who have performed services for the Company and written

representations made to us by officers of the Company. We have not made any
examination of public records (including, without limitation, the plaintiff or
defendant indices of any state or federal courts).

     (xi)    This opinion is subject to the effect of statutes and principles of
law and equity providing that provisions of an agreement expressly or by
implication waiving broadly or vaguely stated rights, unknown future rights or
rights or defenses to obligations granted by law are unenforceable when such
waivers are against public policy or prohibited by law;

     (xii)   We render no opinion with respect to the compliance or non-
compliance with applicable federal, state or foreign securities laws, rules and
regulations;

     (xiii)  Limitations imposed by general principles of equity upon the
availability of equitable remedies or the enforcement of provisions of the
Documents; and the effect of judicial decisions that have held that certain
provisions are unenforceable where their enforcement would violate the implied
covenant of good faith and fair dealing, or would be commercially unreasonable,
or where their breach is not material.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that, other
than as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule or in the officer's
certificate of the Company delivered to the Purchaser pursuant to Section
9.02(a) of the Merger Agreement:

     1.   The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing and
in good standing under the laws of the State of California and has all corporate
power to carry on its business as now conducted. Freshwater Software
International, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Subsidiary"), is a corporation
duly incorporated, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware. The Company is duly qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation and is in good standing in the State of Colorado.

     2.   The execution and delivery of the Merger Agreement and Escrow
Agreement by the Company have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
action on the part of the Company, including, without limitation, approval by
the requisite holders of the Company's capital stock. The Merger Agreement and
Escrow Agreement have been duly executed and delivered by the Company and
constitute legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
against the Company in accordance with their terms.

     3.   The authorized and outstanding capitalization of the Company is as set
forth in Section 4.05 of the Merger Agreement. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company have been duly authorized, validly issued and are
fully paid and non-assessable and, to our knowledge, were not issued in
violation of any preemptive rights. All outstanding shares of the Subsidiary are
owned by the Company. To our knowledge, except as set forth above and in Section
4.05 of the Merger Agreement, there are outstanding (i) no shares of capital
stock or other voting securities of the Company or the Subsidiary, (ii) no
securities of the Company or the Subsidiary convertible into or exchangeable for
shares of capital stock or voting securities of the Company or the Subsidiary,
and (iii) no options, warrants or other rights to acquire from the

Company, or other obligation the Company or the Subsidiary to issue, any capital
stock, voting securities or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
capital stock or voting securities of the Company or the Subsidiary. To our
knowledge, there are no outstanding obligations of the Company or the Subsidiary
to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any Company securities.

     4.   Assuming all consents, approvals, authorizations and other actions
described in Section 4.02 of the Merger Agreement have been obtained, and all
filings and notifications listed in Schedule 4.02 of the Disclosure Schedule
have been made, and except as may result from any facts or circumstances
relating solely to the Purchaser, the execution, delivery or performance of the
Merger Agreement by the Company do not and will not (a) violate or conflict with
any provision of the Articles of Incorporation or By-laws of the Company, (b)
conflict with or violate any law, rule, regulation, order, writ, judgment,
injunction, decree, determination or award applicable to the Company, except as
would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

     5.   The execution, delivery and performance of the Merger Agreement and
the Escrow Agreement by the Company does not require any action on the part of
the Company by or in respect of, or filing with, any governmental body, agency,
official or authority, domestic, foreign or supranational, other than the filing
of an agreement of merger with respect to the Merger with the Secretary of State
of the State of California and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business.

     6.   To our knowledge, there is no action, suit, investigation or
proceeding pending against or, to our knowledge, threatened against or
affecting, the Company or the Subsidiary that is material or that in any manner
challenges or seeks to prevent, enjoin, alter or materially delay the Merger or
any of the other transactions contemplated hereby before any court or arbitrator
or before any governmental body, agency or official, domestic, foreign or
supranational body.

     We render no opinion as to matters governed by laws of any jurisdiction
other than the laws of the State of California and the federal laws of the
United States of America, as in effect on the date hereof.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

     Reference is made to the Agreement and Plan of Merger among Freshwater
Software, Inc., a California corporation (the "Company"), Mercury Interactive
Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), and Aqua Merger Company, a
California corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"),
dated as of May 21, 2001 (the "Agreement").  The Agreement provides for the
acquisition of the Company by Parent (the "Merger") pursuant to a statutory
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company on the terms and conditions set
forth in the Agreement.  This opinion is rendered to you pursuant to Section
9.03(c) of the Agreement, and all capitalized terms used herein and not
otherwise defined shall have the meanings defined for them in the Agreement.

     We have acted as counsel for Parent in connection with the negotiation of
the Agreement and the effectuation of the Merger.  As such counsel, we have made
such legal and factual examinations and inquiries as we have deemed advisable or
necessary for the purposes of rendering this opinion.  In addition, we have
examined originals or copies of documents, corporate records and other writings
that we consider relevant for the purposes of this opinion.  In such
examination, we have assumed the genuineness of all signatures on original
documents, the conformity to original documents of all copies submitted to us
and the due execution and delivery of all documents by any party other than
Parent or Merger Sub where due execution and delivery are a prerequisite to the
effectiveness thereof.

     The opinions hereinafter expressed are subject to the following
qualifications:

            (a)  We express no opinion as to the effect or availability of rules
     of law governing specific performance, injunctive relief or other equitable
     remedies (regardless of whether any such remedy is considered in a
     proceeding at law or in equity);

            (b)  We express no opinion as to the effect of applicable
     bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, arrangement, moratorium or other
     similar federal or state laws affecting the rights of creditors generally;

            (c)  We express no opinion as to compliance with applicable anti-
     fraud provisions of federal or state securities laws; and

            (d)  We are members of the Bar of the State of California and we
     express no opinion as to any matter relating to laws of any jurisdiction
     other than the laws of the United States of America, the laws of the State
     of California and the Delaware General Corporation Law.

     Based upon and subject to the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

       1.  Parent is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good
standing under the laws of the State of Delaware.  Merger Sub is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of California.

       2.  Each of Parent and Merger Sub has the requisite corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver the Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to
perform its respective obligations thereunder and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby.  The execution and delivery of the Agreement and the
Escrow Agreement by each of Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by each
of Parent and Merger Sub of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of each of
Parent and Merger Sub, and no other corporate proceedings on the part of either
Parent and Merger Sub are necessary to authorize the Agreement or to consummate
the transactions contemplated by the Agreement.

       3.  The Agreement and the Escrow Agreement constitute valid and binding
agreements of each of Parent and Merger Sub and are enforceable against Parent
and Merger Sub in accordance with their terms.

     4.  The execution and delivery of the Agreement by each of Parent and
Merger Sub and the consummation by each of Parent and Merger Sub of the
transactions contemplated thereby do not and will not contravene, conflict with
or result in any violation or breach of any provision of the certificate of
incorporation or bylaws of Parent or the articles of incorporation or bylaws of
Merger Sub.

     This opinion is solely for your benefit in connection with the consummation
of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement, and is not to be relied upon
by you for any other purpose or any other person without our express prior
written consent.

                                   Very truly yours,

                                   /s/ Davis Polk & Wardwell
