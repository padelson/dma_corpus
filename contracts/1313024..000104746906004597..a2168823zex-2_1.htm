of the parties acknowledge that it has been represented by independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this
Agreement. Each party and its counsel cooperated in the drafting and preparation of this Agreement and the documents referred to herein, and any and all drafts relating thereto shall be deemed the
work product of the parties and may not be construed against any party by reason of its preparation. Accordingly, it is the intent of the parties hereto that any rule of law or any legal decision that
would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that drafted it be of no application and is hereby expressly waived. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion
of such information in the Disclosure Schedules, that such information is required to be listed in the Disclosure Schedules or that such items are material to the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary,
as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Disclosure Schedules are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a
part of this Agreement. The Disclosure Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.1</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> and </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>Section&nbsp;3.2</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> merely
for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a particular
representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such
representations or warranties is apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Disclosure Schedules with respect to such other
representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules is not intended and shall not
be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether any
obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms "material,"
"materially" and "materiality" as used in this Agreement with a lower case "m" shall have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the meanings ascribed to the defined term
"</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Material Adverse Effect</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>." </FONT></P>

Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of
this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the language contained
therein. The words "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>this Agreement</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>," "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>herein</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>," "</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>hereby</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>,"
