 (c) Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving Company to, honor any indemnification agreements in existence immediately prior to the Effective Time and as set forth on _Company Disclosure Schedule 3.1(n)_ between the Company and any of its managers, officers or employees. 

   

 (d) For a period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Company to, maintain directors\' and officers\' liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance covering the DandO Indemnified Persons who are currently covered by the Company\'s existing directors\' and officers\' liability insurance or fiduciary liability insurance policies on terms no less advantageous to such DandO Indemnified Persons than such existing insurance, but only to the extent related to actions or omissions occurring or existing at or prior to the Effective Time; provided, however, that Parent may satisfy its obligations under this _Section 4.1(d)_ by substituting its policies or the policies of its Affiliates or by purchasing a tail for six (6) years after the Effective Time for the policies currently maintained by the Company so long as the coverage is on terms no less advantageous to such DandO Indemnified Persons than the coverage currently maintained by the Company. 

  

  

 4.2 _ _ _Employee Benefit Matters._ 

  

  

 (a) Effective as of the Closing, Parent shall either cause the Surviving Company to continue to provide the same health plan coverage to Retained Employees that existed up to the Effective Time or provide, or cause an Affiliate of Parent to provide, the Retained Employees and their eligible spouses and dependents coverage under a group health plan maintained by Parent or an Affiliate of Parent (the "Parent Group Health Plan") and shall cause each Parent Group Health Plan to (i) waive any exclusions, restrictions or limitations with respect to pre-existing conditions or waiting periods thereunder to the extent that the same were waived or satisfied by the Retained Employees on the Closing Date under an analogous Company group health plan and (ii) credit any health expenses paid by a Retained Employee or his covered dependents during the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions under such Parent Group Health Plan.

 (c) Not later than three Business Days prior to the date of this Agreement, Parent provided the Company with the list of Retained Employees. 

   

 (d) _Company Disclosure Schedule 4.2(d)_ lists those employees (the "Transition Employees") who shall be Retained Employees, notwithstanding Parent\'s general discretion (as described in the definition of "Retained Employees" in _Section 1.1_ of this Agreement) to choose which employees of Company or its Subsidiaries shall be retained from and after the Closing. Except as otherwise

in any of such entities\' employ for a period of 90 days from the Closing

shall be paid to a Transition Employee pursuant to mutual agreement of Member
Representative and the Surviving Company, Parent or its Affiliates, as
applicable); _provided,_  however, that the Member Representative will not be
required to reimburse Parent for any employer portion of applicable payroll

and liabilities associated with the employment of or payment of bonuses to
such Transition Employees. From and after the Effective Time, Surviving
Company, Parent or its Affiliates, as applicable, shall bear the cost of, and
assume all liability associated with, employee benefits provided by the
Surviving Company, Parent and/or its Affiliates to the Retained Employees
(including, without limitation, the Transition Employees), as well as the
employer portion of applicable payroll taxes, workers compensation insurance
premiums and all other costs, expenses, and liabilities associated with the
employment of or payment of bonuses to such Retained Employees. All salary,
wages and bonuses for Retained Employees other than Transition Employees shall
be borne by the Surviving Company, Parent or its Affiliates from and after
the Effective Time.

Representative may reasonably request for the preparation of any Tax Return of
Members, the Company or its Subsidiaries or the substantiation of any position
or claim thereon. The parties shall cooperate with each other in the handling

arising out of the audit, including, but not limited to, litigation
proceedings). Parent shall cause the Surviving Company to make available to
the Member Representative any records that the Member Representative may

 4.4 _ _ _Governmental Permits._ At Closing or promptly thereafter, the Parent and Surviving Company shall (i) transfer the name of any registered agent of the Company on any governmental or state agency permit, bond, filing or other regulatory document, to an employee or representative of the Parent or Surviving Company and shall deliver to Member Representative or his designee documentation effectuating such change or transfer and (ii) shall deliver to Member Representative documentation effectuating the transfer to Parent or Surviving Company to the maximum extent permitted by such governmental agencies, of any bonds covering any Company or Subsidiary operated properties required under any laws, rules or regulations of any federal, state or local governmental agencies having jurisdiction over the assets of the Company or its Subsidiary.

 (a) Each of the parties acknowledge that it has been represented by independent counsel of its choice throughout all negotiations that have preceded the execution of this Agreement.

Accordingly, it is the intent of the parties hereto that any rule of law or any legal decision that would require interpretation of any ambiguities in this Agreement against any party that drafted it be of no application and is hereby expressly waived. 

  

 (b) The inclusion of any information in the Disclosure Schedules shall not be deemed an admission or acknowledgment, in and of itself and solely by virtue of the inclusion of such information in the Disclosure Schedules, that such information is required to be listed in the Disclosure Schedules or that such items are material to the Company, Parent or Merger Subsidiary, as the case may be. The headings, if any, of the individual sections of each of the Disclosure Schedules are inserted for convenience only and shall not be deemed to constitute a part thereof or a part of this Agreement. The Disclosure Schedules are arranged in sections corresponding to those contained in _Section 3.1_ and _Section 3.2_ merely for convenience, and the disclosure of an item in one section of the Disclosure Schedules as an exception to a particular representation or warranty shall be deemed adequately disclosed as an exception with respect to all other representations or warranties to the extent that the relevance of such item to such representations or warranties is apparent on the face of such item, notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of the Disclosure Schedules with respect to such other representations or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto. 

  

 (c) The specification of any dollar amount in the representations and warranties or otherwise in this Agreement or in the Disclosure Schedules is not intended and shall not be deemed to be an admission or acknowledgment of the materiality of such amounts or items, nor shall the same be used in any dispute or controversy between the parties to determine whether any obligation, item or matter (whether or not described herein or included in any schedule) is or is not material for purposes of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, the terms "material," "materially" and "materiality" as used in this Agreement with a lower case "m" shall have their respective customary and ordinary meanings, without regard to the meanings ascribed to the defined term "Material Adverse Effect." 

  

 (d) All references in this Agreement to Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions refer to the corresponding Exhibits, Schedules, Articles, Sections, subsections and other subdivisions of this Agreement unless expressly provided otherwise. Titles appearing at the beginning of any Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions of this Agreement are for convenience only, do not constitute any part of such Articles, Sections, subsections or other subdivisions, and shall be disregarded in construing the language contained therein. The words " _this Agreement_ ," " _herein_ ," " _hereby_ ," " _hereunder_ " and " _hereof_ " and words of similar import, refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular subdivision unless expressly so limited. The words " _this Section_ ," " _this subsection_ " and words of similar import, refer only to the Sections or subsections hereof in which such words occur. The word " _including_ " (in its various forms) means " _including, without limitation_." Pronouns in masculine, feminine or neuter genders shall be construed to state and include any other gender and words, terms and titles (including terms defined herein) in the singular form shall be construed to include the plural and 

  

      

  
  

vice versa, unless the context otherwise expressly requires. Unless the
context otherwise requires, all defined terms contained herein shall include
the singular and plural and the conjunctive and disjunctive forms of such
defined terms. Unless the context otherwise requires, all references to a
specific time shall refer to Houston, Texas time.

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary, the parties hereto covenant and agree that no amount shall be (or is intended to be) included, in whole or in part (either as an increase or a reduction), more than once in the calculation of (including any component of) Closing Per Unit Merger Consideration, Closing Date Merger Consideration or any other calculated amount pursuant to this Agreement if the effect of such additional inclusion (either as an increase or a reduction) would be to cause such amount to be over or under counted for purposes of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The parties hereto further covenant and agree that if any provision of this Agreement requires an amount or calculation to be "determined in accordance with this Agreement and GAAP" (or words of similar import), then to the extent that the terms of this Agreement conflict with, or are inconsistent with, GAAP in connection with such determination, the terms of this Agreement shall control. 

  

  

 9.14 _ _ _Joint Liability._ Each representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent or Merger Subsidiary in this Agreement shall be deemed a joint representation, warranty, covenant and agreement made by Parent and Merger Subsidiary jointly and all liability and obligations relating thereto shall be deemed a joint liability and obligation of Parent and Merger Subsidiary. 

   

 9.15 _ _ _Governing Law._ THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE, WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CONFLICTS OF LAW PROVISIONS. 

  

 9.16 _ _ _Waiver Of Jury Trial._ TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW THAT CANNOT BE WAIVED, EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES AND COVENANTS THAT IT WILL NOT ASSERT (WHETHER AS PLAINTIFF, DEFENDANT OR OTHERWISE) ANY RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY FORUM IN RESPECT OF ANY ISSUE, CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING IN WHOLE OR IN PART UNDER, RELATED TO, BASED ON, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS AGREEMENT OR THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF, WHETHER NOW EXISTING OR HEREAFTER ARISING AND WHETHER SOUNDING IN TORT OR CONTRACT OR OTHERWISE. ANY PARTY HERETO MAY FILE AN ORIGINAL COUNTERPART OR A COPY OF THIS _SECTION 9.16_ WITH ANY COURT AS WRITTEN EVIDENCE OF THE CONSENT OF EACH SUCH PARTY TO THE WAIVER OF ITS RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. 

  

 9.17 _ _ _Consent to Jurisdiction; Venue; Enforcement_. 

  

  

 (a) The parties hereto submit to the personal jurisdiction of the courts of the State of Texas and the Federal courts of the United States in Harris County, and any appellate court from any such state or Federal court, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agree that all claims with respect to any such claim may be heard and determined in such Texas court or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. The parties hereto agree that a final judgment in any such claim shall be conclusive and may be enforced in any other jurisdiction by suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this Agreement shall affect any right that any party may otherwise have to bring any claim relating to this Agreement or any related matter against any other party or its assets or properties in the courts of any jurisdiction. 

   

 (b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any related matter in any Texas state or Federal court located in Harris County and the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such claim in any such court. 

  

      

  9.18 _ _ _Remedies._ No provision of this Agreement shall
be construed to foreclose or otherwise limit any rights or remedies that may
otherwise be available to any party hereto in the event of fraud in connection
with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

  

 9.19 _ _ _Consequential Damages._ Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no party hereto shall be entitled to recover from another party or its Affiliates, any indirect, punitive or exemplary damages of any kind arising under or in connection with this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, except to the extent any such party suffers such damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorney\'s fees incurred in connection with defending of such damages) due to claims by an unaffiliated third party, which damages (including costs of defense and reasonable attorney\'s fees incurred in connection with defending against such damages) shall not be excluded by this provision as to recovery hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence, each party on its own behalf and on behalf of its Affiliates waives any right to recover punitive and exemplary damages arising in connection with or with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.
