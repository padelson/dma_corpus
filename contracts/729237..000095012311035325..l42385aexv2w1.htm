Payment, as applicable, together with a detailed description of the basis for
any such disagreement. All such line items that are not disputed shall be
final, binding and non-appealable for all purposes hereunder. If an Earn-
Out Objections Statement is not delivered to Parent within fifteen (15) days
after delivery of the Earn-Out Statement, the Earn-Out Statement shall be
final and binding on and non-appealable by, the Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that such fifteen (15) day period shall be tolled for any period
during which Parent, Partnership, EOP or EOC shall fail to make available to
Sellers Representatives all books, records, documents and work papers
requested by Sellers Representatives pursuant to  _Section 3.4.3(b)_, which
are required to be made available to Sellers Representative under  _Section
3.4.3(b)_ (except where providing reasonable access to books, records

Objections Statement is delivered to Parent within fifteen (15) days after
delivery of the Earn-Out Statement (or such later date as a result of any
tolling of such fifteen (15)-day period), then Sellers Representatives and
Parent shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any such objections, but if
they do not reach a final resolution within fifteen (15) days after the
delivery of the Earn-Out Objections Statement (such period, the " _Earn-Out
Review Period_ "), then Sellers Representatives and Parent shall submit any
outstanding disputes to the Independent Accounting Firm for final, binding
and non-appealable resolution.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | Sellers Representatives and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent Accounting Firm to

the Independent Accounting Firm, Sellers Representatives and Parent shall
each submit in writing to the Independent Accounting Firm and to the other
Party simultaneously its calculations of the unresolved disputed items in the
Earn-Out Objections Statement together with such work papers, calculations
and other materials that such Party has determined supports such Partys
calculation (the " _Initial Materials_ "). Each of Sellers Representatives
and Parent shall thereafter be entitled to submit a rebuttal to the
other Partys submission (together with the Initial Materials, the "
_Determination Materials_ "), which rebuttals shall be delivered to the
Independent Accounting Firm and to the other Party simultaneously within five
(5) days following the delivery of the Parties initial submissions to the
Independent Accounting Firm and to each other. The Independent Accounting Firm
may request additional information from  
         

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | Sellers Representatives and Parent. The
Independent Accounting Firm shall base its determination of the disputed
amounts solely on the Determination Materials and any other information
requested by the Independent Accounting Firm. The Independent Accounting Firm
shall only consider those line items and amounts in the Earn-Out Statement to
which Sellers Representatives have timely objected pursuant to this _Section
3.4.4_ and which Parent and Sellers Representatives have been unable to
resolve. In resolving each disputed item, the Independent Accounting Firm
shall not assign a value to any disputed item greater than the greatest value
or less than the smallest value for such item assigned to it by Parent or
Sellers Representative, as the case may be. The resolution of the dispute by
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be final, binding and non-appealable on
and by the Parties. If the Independent Accounting Firm resolves all
disputes presented to it entirely in the manner proposed by Parent or
Sellers Representative, as the case may be, the fees and expenses of the
Independent Accounting Firm relating to the resolution of such dispute shall
be paid by the other Party. In all other events, the fees and expenses of
the Independent Accounting Firm shall be shared based on the difference
between Sellers Representatives position, on the one hand, and Parents
position, on the other hand, initially presented to the Independent
Accounting Firm (based on the aggregate of all differences taken as a whole)
and the final resolution as determined by the Independent Accounting Firm in
proportion to the total difference between Sellers Representatives and
Parents initial positions.

Calculations Delivery Date_ "), Parent shall, at its expense, prepare and
deliver to Sellers Representatives a statement setting forth, in reasonable
detail, Parents calculation of the Closing Date Net Working Capital (the "

---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | On or prior to the delivery (or deemed delivery in
accordance with _Section 3.5.1(c))_ of the statement setting forth the
Proposed Closing Date Net Working Capital, Sellers Representatives shall be
entitled to, and Parent shall, at its expense, provide or provide reasonable
access (in a manner not unreasonably disruptive to the Business) to EOP and

entitled to make reasonable inquiries and information requests of Parent,
Partnership, EOP and EOC regarding the statement setting forth the Proposed
Closing Date Net Working Capital and the calculations set forth therein.  
      
    | (c)  |   | In the event that Parent shall fail to deliver the
statement setting forth the Proposed Closing Date Net Working Capital by the
CD Calculations Delivery Date, then Sellers Representatives shall be
entitled to provide notice of such failure to Parent (a " _NWC Statement
Delivery Notification_ "). If, within, fifteen (15) days following the
delivery of a NWC Statement Delivery Notification by Sellers Representatives
to Parent, Parent does not deliver the statement setting forth the Proposed
Closing Date Net Working Capital to Sellers Representatives, then such
statement shall be deemed to have been delivered by Parent setting forth a
Proposed Closing Date Net Working Capital equal to positive $250,000.  
      
    | (d)  |   | If Sellers Representatives dispute the correctness of
the Proposed Closing Date Net Working Capital, then, within fifteen (15) days
after receipt of the statement setting forth the Proposed Closing Date Net
Working Capital, Sellers Representatives jointly shall deliver to Parent a
single written statement (a " _WC Objection Notice_ ") setting forth their
objections thereto in reasonable detail and the basis therefor; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | such fifteen (15)-day period shall be tolled for
any period during which Parent, Partnership, EOP or EOC shall fail to make
available to Sellers Representatives all books, records, documents and work
papers requested by Sellers Representative pursuant to  _Section 3.5.1(b)_,
which are required to be made available to Sellers Representatives under
_Section 3.5.1(b)_ (except where providing reasonable access to books,
records documents and work papers pursuant to _Section 3.5.1(b)_ cannot
be done in a manner that is not unreasonably disruptive to the Business). The
WC Objection Notice shall (i) set forth Sellers Representatives calculations
of the Net Working Capital of the Acquired Companies as of the Closing, (ii)
specify those individual line items in the Proposed Closing Date Net Working
Capital with which Sellers Representatives disagree, and (iii) be

disagreement. All such line items that are not disputed shall be final,
binding and non-appealable for all purposes hereunder. If a WC Objection
Notice is not delivered to Parent within the fifteen (15)-day period after
the delivery of the statement setting forth the Proposed Closing Date Net
Working Capital, then the statement setting forth the Proposed Closing Date
Net Working Capital shall be final, binding and non-appealable on and by the
Parties and the Proposed Closing Date Net Working Capital shall become the
Final Closing Date Net Working Capital; _provided_ , _however_ , that such
fifteen (15)-day period shall be tolled for any period during which Parent,
Partnership, EOP or EOC shall fail to make available to Sellers
Representatives all books, records, documents and work papers requested
by Sellers Representative pursuant to _Section 3.5.1(b)_, which are
required to be made available to Sellers Representatives under _Section
3.5.1(b)_ (except where providing reasonable access to books, records
documents and work papers pursuant to  _Section 3.5.1(b)_ cannot be done in
a manner that is not unreasonably disruptive to the Business). If a WC
Objection Notice is delivered to Parent within fifteen (15) days after
delivery of the statement setting forth the Proposed Closing Date Net Working
Capital (or such later date as a result of any tolling of such fifteen
(15)-day period), then Sellers Representatives and Parent shall negotiate in
good faith to resolve any such objections, but if they do not reach a final
resolution within fifteen (15) days after the delivery of the WC Objection
Notice (the " _WC Objections Period_ "), then Sellers Representatives and
Parent shall submit any outstanding disputes to the Independent Accounting
Firm for final, binding and non-appealable resolution in accordance with
the same procedures outlined in _Section 3.4.4(b)_ with respect to the
resolution of disputes relating to a Earn-Out Objections Statement.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (e)  |   | The final, binding and non-appealable Closing Date Net
Working Capital as determined in accordance with this _Section 3.5.1_, shall

addressed by the Methods of Calculating WC, GAAP.

 3.5.2 No later than five (5) days after the WC Final Resolution Date: 

   

       | (a)  |   | If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is
less than the Target Net Working Capital, then (1) each EOP Former Member
shall pay to Parent an amount equal to (A) the difference between the Final
Closing Date Net Working Capital and the Target Net Working Capital (the "
_NWC Deficit_ "), _multiplied_ by (B) 0.75, _multiplied_ by (C) such EOP
Former Members applicable EOP Membership Interest Percentage, and (2) each
EOC Beneficial Owner shall pay to Parent an amount equal to (x) the NWC
Deficit, _multiplied_ by (y) 0.25,  _multiplied_ by (z) such EOC Beneficial
Owners applicable Banyan Membership Interest Percentage.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | If the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital is
greater than the Target Net Working Capital, (1) Parent shall pay to each EOP
Former Member an amount equal to (A) the difference between the Final Closing
Date Net Working Capital and the Target Net Working Capital (the " _NWC
Surplus_ "), _multiplied_ by (B) 0.75, _multiplied_ by (C) such EOP Former
Members applicable EOP Membership Interest Percentage, and (2) Parent shall
pay to each EOC Beneficial Owner an amount equal to (x) the NWC Surplus,
_multiplied_ by (y) 0.25,  _multiplied_ by (z) such EOC Beneficial Owners
applicable Banyan Membership Interest Percentage.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Any payments pursuant to this _Section 3.5.2_, if
applicable, shall be deemed adjustments to the EOP Per Unit Consideration and
the EOC Per Unit Consideration.  
   

  

 3.6 _Cash Payments_. All cash amounts payable pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated by the applicable Party to receive such cash amount, which account or accounts shall be designated no later than three (3) days prior to the Closing Date.

Companies or as directed by EOP, EOC, Partnership or Parent) and deliver
promptly to Parent or destroy, at the request and option of Parent, all

Law, (iv) to provide services to any Purchaser Parties or any of their
respective Affiliates, pursuant to any employment relationship or otherwise,
or (v) in connection with asserting any rights or remedies or performing any
obligations under this Agreement or any Related Agreement. Notwithstanding

information that is or becomes publicly available other than as a result of a
disclosure by a Member in violation of this _Section 4.3_. 

   

 4.4 _Waiver and Release_. 

  

 4.4.1 Effective as of the Closing, each Member (other than EOP in its capacity as a member of EOC) and EOC Beneficial Owner, on behalf of itself and its officers, employees, managers, equityholders, parents, affiliates, heirs, executors, administrators, agents, successors and assigns (collectively, the " _Releasing Parties_ "), irrevocably and unconditionally waives and releases any and all rights with respect to, and releases, forever acquits and discharges each of the Acquired Companies, and their respective present and future equityholders, directors, officers, employees, agents and other Representatives, in their capacities as such, and their respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns (the " _Released Parties_ ") with respect to, each and all claims, demands, charges, complaints, obligations, causes of action, suits, liabilities, indebtedness, sums of money, covenants, agreements, instruments, contracts (written or oral, express or implied), controversies, promises, fees, expenses (including attorneys fees, costs and expenses), damages and judgments, at law or 

      ##### 

  

    

in equity, in contract or tort, in the United States, state, foreign or other
judicial, administrative, arbitration or other proceedings, of any nature
whatsoever, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, previously, now or
hereafter arising, in each case which arise out of, are based upon or are
connected with facts or events occurring or in existence on or prior to
the Closing Date (the " _Released Claims_ "). Each such Member or EOC
Beneficial Owner hereby agrees that following the Closing, (x) if any payment
is required to be made by such Member or EOC Beneficial Owner or (y) Member
or EOC Beneficial Owner has any liability pursuant to _Article 12_ , or
otherwise in respect of Losses suffered or incurred by any Person, to the
extent such Member or EOC Beneficial Owner has an indemnity obligation
according to _Article 12_, whether such obligation is related to judgments,
damages, penalties, fines, costs, amounts paid in settlement, losses,
expenses or otherwise, such Member or EOC Beneficial Owner (directly or
through any Affiliate) shall have no rights against the Acquired Companies or
any other Released Party, whether by reason of subrogation, contribution,
indemnification, reimbursement or otherwise, in respect of any such payments
or liabilities, and shall not take any action against the Acquired Companies,
Parent, Partnership or any of their respective Subsidiaries or any other
Released Party with respect thereto other than the rights under _Article
12_; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the foregoing release
apply with respect to any obligations of any Released Party set forth in this
Agreement (including the indemnification obligations set forth in _Article
12_ and the obligations with respect to any EOP Earn-Out Payment, any EOC
Earn-Out Payment, any EOP Termination Event Payment and/or any EOC
Termination Event Payment, as applicable, in accordance with _Section 3.4_),
any of the Related Agreements or any of the Other Transaction Agreements and
the transactions contemplated thereby, subject to the limitations and
conditions provided in this Agreement; and _provided further_ that in no
event shall the foregoing release apply with respect to any obligations,
agreements or other arrangement between any Member or EOC Beneficial Owner
and any other Member or EOC Beneficial with respect to matters that do not
involve Parent, Partnership or the Acquired Companies. Each Member and EOC
Beneficial Owner represents and warrants that such Member or EOC Beneficial
Owner has not assigned or otherwise transferred any right or interest in or
to any of the Released Claims. EACH MEMBER AND EOC BENEFICIAL OWNER
FURTHER ACKNOWLEDGES THAT SUCH MEMBER OR EOC BENEFICIAL OWNER IS AWARE THAT
STATUTES EXIST THAT RENDER NULL AND VOID RELEASES AND DISCHARGES OF ANY
CLAIMS, RIGHTS, DEMANDS, LIABILITIES, ACTIONS OR CAUSES OF ACTIONS THAT ARE
UNKNOWN TO THE RELEASING OR DISCHARGING PARTY AT THE TIME OF EXECUTION OF
THE RELEASE AND DISCHARGE. EACH MEMBER AND EOC BENEFICIAL OWNER HEREBY
EXPRESSLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVES, SURRENDERS AND AGREES TO FOREGO ANY
PROTECTION TO WHICH SUCH MEMBER OR EOC BENEFICIAL OWNER WOULD OTHERWISE BE
ENTITLED BY VIRTUE OF THE EXISTENCE OF ANY SUCH STATUTE IN ANY JURISDICTION. 

   

 4.5 _Restricted Securities_. Each Member and EOC Beneficial Owner understands that the OP Units to be issued in connection with the Contributions have not been, and will not be, registered under the Securities Act, by reason of a specific exemption from the registration provisions of the Securities Act, which depends upon, among other things, the _bona fide_ nature of the investment intent and the accuracy of each Members and EOC Beneficial Owners representations as expressed in this Agreement. Each Member and EOC Beneficial Owner understands that the OP Units are "restricted securities" under applicable U.S. federal and state securities Laws and that, pursuant to these Laws, such Member or EOC Beneficial Owner must 

   ##### 

  

 

hold the OP Units, as applicable, indefinitely unless they are registered with
the SEC and qualified by state authorities, or an exemption from such
registration and qualification requirements is available. Each Member and EOC
Beneficial Owner acknowledges that Parent has no obligation to register or
qualify the OP Units for resale, except as set forth in the
Registration Rights Agreement. Each Member and EOC Beneficial Owner further
acknowledges that if an exemption from registration or qualification is
available, it may be conditioned on various requirements, including, but not
limited to, the time and manner of sale, the holding period for the OP
Units, and on requirements relating to Parent, which are outside of such

    | (b)  |   | Except for Taxes reflected in the calculation of the

       | (c)  |   | For purposes of this Agreement, whenever it is
necessary to allocate liability for Taxes for a Straddle Period or to
allocate items of income, receipts, gain, deduction, loss, or credit of an
Acquired Company, such allocation shall be made to, on the one hand, the

extraordinary event, action, or transaction or other event outside the
Ordinary Course of Business, regardless of when effective, by Purchasing
Party or any of their respective Affiliates (including, after the Closing
Date, an Acquired Company) occurring after the Closing Date, shall,
for purposes of _Section 11.3_, be treated as being solely attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period beginning and ending after the Closing
Date. The amount of other Taxes of the Acquired Companies for a Straddle
Period shall be allocated to the Pre-Closing Straddle Period and the
remainder of the Straddle Period _pro rata_ , based on the number of days of
the Pre-Closing Straddle Period, on the one hand, and the number of days
remaining in the Straddle Period, on the other hand; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that any increase in any such Tax resulting from any extraordinary event,
action, or transaction or other event outside the Ordinary Course of

Party shall, and no Party shall cause the Acquired Companies to, amend,
refile, revoke or otherwise modify any Tax Return or Tax election of, in
respect of, or on behalf of an Acquired Company with respect to any Pre-
Closing Period or Straddle Period without the prior written consent of Parent
or Sellers Representatives, as the case may be, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | No Purchasing Party nor any of its Affiliates
(including, as of and after the Closing Date, any of the Acquired Companies)
shall, without prior written consent of Sellers Representatives, (1) take

respective Affiliates) reasonably should know (without the necessity of
any extraordinary research or other similar investigation) would result in an
increased liability for Taxes (including a reduction or limitation on the use
of a refund or other Tax benefit) or reduction of any Tax asset of an
Acquired Company or any of its Subsidiaries (or Seller or any of its
Affiliates) attributable to a Pre-Closing Period or Pre-Closing Straddle
Period, or would otherwise increase the liability for Taxes of any Seller
pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise; or (2) make or change any Tax
election affecting a Pre-Closing Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period, or
would

Seller pursuant to this Agreement or otherwise.

 11.3.3 _Tax Contests; Cooperation_. 

  

       | (a)  |   | _Contest Rights_. In the event that a notice of a
Tax Dispute, or any intent to initiate a Tax Dispute, is received that
relates to any Pre-Effective Date Period or Straddle Period or which, if
successful, would either result in a Loss or Liability in respect of
Taxes which indemnity properly may be sought against any Member or any EOC
Beneficial Owner pursuant to this Agreement, Parent shall (i) notify Sellers
Representatives of such claim or demand within the earlier of twenty (20)
days of receipt thereof or such time that would allow the Members to timely
respond to such Tax Dispute (but in any event no earlier than such notice
could be reasonably provided by Parent) and (ii) give Sellers
Representatives such information with respect thereto as Sellers
Representatives may reasonably request;  _provided, however_ , that for the
sake of clarity, any failure by Parent to provide such notice shall not
relieve a Member or any EOC Beneficial Owner of any liability under
this Agreement unless and to the extent that a Member or an EOC Beneficial
Owner has been materially and adversely been prejudiced thereby. Members or
an EOC Beneficial Owner may, at their own expense, participate in and, upon
reasonable prior notice to Parent by Sellers Representatives, assume the
defense of any such Tax Dispute so long as (a) Sellers Representatives
furnish Parent with an opinion of tax counsel selected by
Sellers Representatives (and reasonably satisfactory to Parent (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned)) (the "
_Approved Counsel_ "), at the Members or an EOC Beneficial Owner expense, to
the effect that no less than "substantial authority" exists with respect to
the defense for such Tax Dispute, (b) Members or an EOC Beneficial Owner
continue to be represented in the Tax Dispute by Approved Counsel
(or substitute Approved Counsel) and (c) Members and the EOC Beneficial
Owners agree to indemnify Parent and the applicable Acquired Company (or its
successor) in a manner reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Acquired
Company (or its successor) and to pay to Parent or the Acquired Company (or
its successor) on demand all liabilities and expenses which may reasonably be
entailed in such defense (excluding any liabilities and expenses of the
Parent and the applicable Acquired Company (or its successor) attributable to
Parent exercising its right provided for in the next sentence to participate
in such defense). If Sellers Representatives assumes such defense and
continue to satisfy the conditions in the preceding sentence, Sellers
Representatives shall have the sole discretion as to the conduct of such
defense and Parent shall have the right to participate (but not
the obligation to participate or any obligation if it does not participate)
in the defense thereof and to employ separate counsel at its own expense;
_provided, however,_ that Sellers Representatives shall (1) keep Parent
promptly and fully informed of the conduct of any such Tax  
---|---|---|--- 
       

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | Dispute, (2) provide promptly to Parent any
documents, correspondence, or other materials relating to any such Tax
Dispute, and (3) take into account any reasonable suggestions of Parent
relating to the conduct (including prosecution, compromise, or settlement) of
such Tax Dispute. Whether or not the Members or the EOC Beneficial Owners
choose to defend any claim, all of the Parties shall cooperate in the defense
or prosecution thereof in accordance with _Section 11.3.3(b)_ ; _provided
further_ that neither Sellers Representatives nor any Member or EOC
Beneficial Owner may settle any such Tax Dispute without the prior written
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned).  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | _Cooperation_. The Members, EOC Beneficial Owners,
Sellers Representatives, and the Purchaser Parties shall provide all
reasonable cooperation in connection with the filing of Tax Returns of the
Acquired Companies and any Tax Disputes involving the
Acquired Companies. Such cooperation shall include the reasonable furnishing
or making available during normal business hours of personnel, powers of
attorney, and the retention and (upon a Partys request) the provision of
records and information that are reasonably relevant to the preparation of
any such Tax Return or to any such Tax Dispute. Each of Members, Sellers
Representatives and the Purchaser Parties shall (i) retain all books and
records that are in his, her or its, as the case may be, possession with
respect to Tax matters pertinent to the Acquired Companies relating to any
Pre-Closing Periods or Straddle Period until the expiration of the applicable
statute of limitations (and, to the extent notified by Parent or Sellers
Representatives, any extension thereof) of the applicable taxable
periods, and abide by all record retention agreements entered into with any
taxing authority, and (ii) give the other Parties reasonable written notice
before transferring, destroying or discarding any such books and records and,
if the other Party so requests and to the extent consistent with Law,
Sellers Representatives or Parent, as the case may be, shall allow the other
party to take possession of such books and records.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Parent and Sellers Representatives shall, upon
request, use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any certificate or
other document from any Person as may be necessary to mitigate, reduce or
eliminate, in a manner consistent with applicable Law, any Tax that could be
imposed (including with respect to the Contributions) on any Purchasing Party
(or any of their respective Affiliates), on the one hand, or Sellers
Representatives, any Member or the EOC Beneficial Owners (or any of their
respective Affiliates), on the other hand; _provided, however_ , that for the
sake of clarity, no Purchasing Party (or any of their respective Affiliates),
on the one hand, and none of Sellers Representatives, any Member or EOC
Beneficial Owner (or any of their respective Affiliates), on the other hand,
shall be required, as a result of this subparagraph (c), to bear any
expense  
       

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | or otherwise take any action (or be required to
fail to take any action) that it reasonably determines would adversely affect
its interests.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (d)  |   | _Subsequent Recovery_. Without limitation of _Section
11.3.6_, if any amounts shall have been paid to Parent, the applicable
Acquired Company (or its successor), or their respective Affiliates, pursuant
to this _Section 11.3_ or _Article 12_ (in the latter case, with respect to
Taxes or a Tax Dispute), and any such amount shall be subsequently be
recovered in whole or in part by Parent, the Acquired Company (or its
successor), or any of their respective Affiliates by reason of agreement with
the Internal Revenue Service, the United States or other appropriate taxing
authority, or any court decision (including a decision of the United States
Tax Court or other comparable court or forum) which is not appealed, then
Parent or the applicable Acquired Company (or its successor), as the case may
be, shall promptly (i) notify Sellers Representatives and (ii) pay such
recovered amounts to the Sellers Representatives.  
      
    | (e)  |   | _Consultation_. If the Parties disagree as to the
amount of Taxes (or Tax-related Losses) for which they are liable under this
Agreement, Parent and Sellers Representatives shall consult with each other
in good faith to resolve such dispute following the receipt of written notice
from the other to begin such consultation (the " _Tax Consultation Notice_
"). If any such point of disagreement cannot be resolved within thirty (30)
days following the date of receipt of the Tax Consultation Notice, Parent and
Sellers Representatives shall jointly select a nationally recognized
independent public accounting or law firm to act as an arbitrator to resolve
those points of disagreement. Any such resolution shall be conclusive and
binding on the Parties and their respective Affiliates. The fees of such
accounting or law firm shall be borne equally between the Purchasing
Parties, on the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand. The Parties shall
provide (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to provide) to such firm
all reasonable and reasonably necessary cooperation.  
   

  

 11.3.4 _Transfer Taxes_. All sales, transfer (including, without limitation, real estate transfer Tax), recording, deed, stamp, registration, documentary, conveyancing, franchise, property, notarial, grantor or grantee Taxes (but not including any income, franchise, or similar Taxes) in connection with the effectuation of the Contributions, whether imposed on the Purchaser Parties, the Acquired Companies, any Member or any EOC Beneficial Owner, shall be borne and paid for fifty percent (50%) by Parent and fifty percent (50%) by the Members and EOC Beneficial Owners. The Parties shall cooperate to comply with all Tax Return requirements for such Taxes contemplated by this _Section 11.3.4_ (which shall be prepared and filed (or caused to be filed) by Parent to the extent permissible under applicable Law). The Parties shall cooperate to take such reasonable actions as may be necessary to minimize the amount of any such Taxes in a manner consistent with Law.

 11.3.5 _Tax Treatment of the Contributions and Related Transactions_. 

  

       | (a)  |   | The Parties intend that the Contributions be
treated, for federal income tax purposes, as (i) (A) a taxable sale of each
Members EOP Units and Banyans EOP Units to the extent required by the
Treasury Regulations under Code Section 707 relating to "disguised sales"
that a Member or an EOC Beneficial Owner (as successor to Banyan) receives
cash in connection with the Contributions, including, without limitation,
cash provided as part of the Earn-Out Payments, and (B) otherwise as a tax-
free contribution by each Member of its EOP Units and to Banyan of its EOC
Units to Partnership under Section 721 of the Code and (ii) a distribution by
Banyan to the EOC Beneficial Owners of the EOC Consideration under Section
731 of the Code.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The Parties (i) will report the EOP Contribution and
the EOC Contribution in a manner consistent with this _Section 11.3.5_ for
U.S. federal income and all other relevant Tax purposes and (ii) will not
take any action or position inconsistent with such treatment.  
      
    | (c)  |   | Provided the requirement of _Section 8.3.4_ hereof has
been satisfied or to the extent otherwise required by Law, Partnership shall
execute and cause EOP to timely file an election under section 1362(e)(3) of
the Code to apply the "closing-of-the books" method with respect to the
allocation of income of EOP for the 2011 taxable year and shall take no
action or position inconsistent with that election.  
   

  

 11.3.6 _Tax Refunds_. If, following the Closing, a refund of Taxes is recognized by or credited to the account of an Acquired Company or any of its Subsidiaries in respect of any Pre-Closing Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period (determined pursuant to the principles set forth in _Section 11.3.1(c))_, and except to the extent that (i) such refund is attributable to a tax item relating either to a taxable period other than a Pre-Closing Period or Pre-Closing Straddle Period, or (ii) a credit for such refund has been reflected in the Final Closing Date Net Working Capital, the Purchasing Parties will pay (or cause to be paid) the amount of such refund to Sellers Representatives, who shall then disburse such amount to the appropriate Members or EOC Beneficial Owners. 

  

 11.3.7 _Relationship of this Section 11.3 to Article 12_. Any conditions or limitations on indemnification set forth in _Article 12_ (except as provided for in _Section 12.4.2_ with respect to the Tax Threshold Amount or in _Section 12.4.4_ with respect to pro rata indemnification limits) with respect to monetary amount of claims or liability shall not apply to any claim or liability to which this _Section 11.3_ applies or to any breach of any obligation under this _Section 11.3_. In the event of any inconsistency between provisions of  _Article 12_ and this _Section 11.3_, this _Section 11.3_ shall control. The Members shall have no liability under this Agreement for any Taxes of the Acquired Companies except as otherwise expressly provided in this _Section 11.3_. 

   ##### 

  

  

 11.3.8 _Survival_. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the covenants and obligations set forth in this _Section 11.3_ shall survive until, and any claim for indemnification with respect thereto must be made prior to, the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to the underlying Tax claim (including any valid extensions). 

  

 11.4 _Further Assurances_. From and after the Closing, Members and Parent will execute and deliver, and will cause their respective Affiliates to execute and deliver, such further instruments of conveyance and transfer and take such other actions as might reasonably be requested to carry out the purposes and intent of this Agreement and the Related Agreements. 

  

 11.5 _No Use of Corporate Name_. Subject to the following sentence, except as required by applicable Law, otherwise required pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement or consented to in writing by Parent, Members agree that following the Closing Date, they shall not, nor shall they permit any of their Affiliates to, make any use of the wordmarks "Eola" or any variation thereof (the " _Marks_ "), including, but not limited to, use in corporate names, brand names, domain names, and marketing materials; _provided that_ Members and their Affiliates shall be permitted to use the Marks following the Closing Date (i) as a historical reference to the Business, and (ii) in connection with the name and operations of entities affiliated with Members that were in existence prior to the date of this Agreement and that used the wordmark "Eola" in connection therewith.

   ##### 

  

 

Affiliates shall directly or indirectly (i) engage or participate in, or seek

property management services for the Managed Properties, (ii) provide, or
seek to provide, consulting services with respect to the property management
of the Managed Properties, or (iii) own any equity interest in any entity
that provides, or seeks to provide, property management services for the
Managed Properties. 

   

 11.8.2 Each of the Members and EOC Beneficial Owners acknowledge and agree that the scope and the length of the non-compete period in _Section 11.8.1_ is reasonable and narrowly drawn to impose no greater restraint than is necessary to protect the goodwill of the Business and to protect the Purchaser Parties legitimate interest in the enjoyment of the Business. Each of the Purchaser Parties, Members and EOC Beneficial Owners intends that the covenants of this _Section 11.8.2_ and _Section 11.8.1_ shall be deemed to be a series of separate covenants. 

  

 11.8.3 Except as permitted by _Section 11.8.5_ below, each of the Members and EOC Beneficial Owners agree that no Member, EOC Beneficial Owner or any of their respective Affiliates shall, whether directly or indirectly, during the Restricted Period do any of the following: (i) solicit the employment of or hire any current employee of any of the Acquired Companies (other than James R. Heistand) who remains employed by the Acquired Companies, Parent or Partnership or their Affiliates at Closing (excluding such employees following any termination of employment with the Purchaser Parties) without the prior written consent of Parent, _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing herein shall prohibit Members, EOC Beneficial Owners or any of their respective Affiliates from making general solicitation advertisements that are not targeted at such employees or hiring any such employees who were previously terminated or had previously resigned such employment; or (ii) call on or solicit any supplier or vendor that was providing products or services to the Business on the Closing Date in order to influence or induce or attempt to influence or induce such Person to decrease or cease doing business with any Acquired Company; or (iii) make any statement or do any act willfully and intentionally to cause existing property owners who conduct business with any of the Acquired Companies to make use of the property management services of any competing property management company with respect to any of the properties being managed by the Acquired Companies. 

  

 (a) If Members, EOC Beneficial Owners or any of their respective Affiliates breach or threaten to commit a breach of any of the restrictive covenants set forth in _Section_ _11.8.3_ , then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Purchaser Parties sole right and remedy, in addition to recovery of reasonable attorney fees and expenses in connection therewith, shall be to have the restrictive covenants in this _Section 11.8.3_ specifically enforced against Members, EOC Beneficial Owners and/or their respective Affiliates, including temporary restraining orders and injunctions by any court of competent jurisdiction and without the requirement to post any bond or make any other undertaking with respect thereto, it being agreed by Members and EOC Beneficial Owners that any breach or threatened breach by Members, EOC Beneficial Owners or any of their respective Affiliates of this _Section 11.8.3_ would cause irreparable injury to Purchaser Parties and that money damages would not provide an adequate remedy to Purchaser Parties. 

   ##### 

  

  

 (b) If Members, EOC Beneficial Owners or any of their respective Affiliates breach any of the restrictive covenants set forth in _Section 11.8.1_, then Purchaser Parties shall have the right to seek the remedies set forth in _Section 11.8.8_, which remedies, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of Purchaser Parties with respect to any breach of _Section 11.8.1_ by Members or EOC Beneficial Owners. 

  

 11.8.4 If, during the enforcement of any or all of the covenants and provisions set forth in this _Section 11.8_, any court of competent jurisdiction enters a final judgment that declares that the duration, scope, or area restrictions stated herein are unreasonable under circumstances then existing, are invalid, or are otherwise unenforceable, then the Parties agree that the maximum enforceable duration, scope, or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be substituted for the stated duration, scope, or area, and that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability shall have the power to revise the scope, duration, or area of the term or provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that comes the closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as so modified to cover the maximum duration, scope, or area permitted by Law. 

  

 11.8.5 Notwithstanding the terms of this _Section 11.8_, each of the Members, EOC Beneficial Owners and their respective Affiliates shall be directly or indirectly (i) entitled to own equity interests in Partnership and Parent, subject to the applicable terms of the Other Transaction Agreements, and (ii) permitted to engage in all activities necessary to carry out such Persons duties and obligations as a director, or as directed by senior management or the Board of Parent, as an employee or other Representative of Parent, Partnership or any of their respective subsidiaries. In addition, notwithstanding the terms of this _Section 11.8_, the Parties acknowledge and agree that Members, EOC Beneficial Owners and their Affiliates hold equity and other economic interests in the Managed Properties and such Persons shall be entitled to carry out all fiduciary and other contractual obligations in connection therewith. None of the activities set forth in this _Section 11.8.5_ shall violate or breach the other restrictions set forth in this _Section 11.8_. 

  

 11.8.6 Members and EOC Beneficial Owners shall be responsible for any breach of this  _Section 11.8_ by any of their respective Affiliates. 

  

 11.8.7 Each of the Parties considers the provisions of this _Section 11.8_ to be fair and reasonable in order to protect their respective legitimate business interests. 

  

 11.8.8 _Management Agreement Terminations_. The Parties agree that if at any time during the sixty (60) month period following the Closing (the " _Protected Period_ "), any Member or EOC Beneficial Owner willfully and intentionally takes any action that results in the termination of any of the Management Agreements with respect to the Managed Properties (other than a termination due to (A) a bona fide sale of a Managed Property to a third party, (B) a foreclosure or other transfer of a Managed Property to a lender in satisfaction of indebtedness, or (C) any action willfully and intentionally taken, or the willful and intentional omission to take any action, by Purchaser Parties, EOP, EOC, or any of their respective Affiliates that causes or 

   ##### 

  

 

results in the termination of such Management Agreement, excluding (i) any
termination by the Purchaser Parties, EOC, EOP or their respective Affiliates
following a default by a counterparty, (ii) any failure to renew any
Management Agreement upon expiration on economic terms or length of term less
favorable to the Acquired Company than those contained in the agreement as of
the date hereof or (iii) any failure to amend any Management Agreements to
provide for economic terms or length of terms less favorable to the Acquired
Company than those contained in the agreement as of the date hereof) (a "
_Qualified Termination_ "), then Members and EOC Beneficial Owners shall pay
to the applicable Acquired Company an amount equal to the product of (x) the
number of whole months remaining in the Protected Period following the
effective date of the Qualified Termination and (y) the amount set forth
under the heading "Monthly Net Fee Income" on _Schedule 11.8.8_ that
corresponds to the applicable Management Agreement (" _Make Whole Payment_
"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject to the consummation of the
Closing, any termination of the Peachtree Management Agreements due to a sale
to a third Person, which sale is consummated between the date hereof and July
6, 2012 shall be deemed a Qualified Termination and obligate Members and EOC
Beneficial Owners to pay Parent the applicable Make Whole Payments with
respect to the Managed Properties included in such sale in accordance with
the terms of this _Section 11.8.8_. Each Member or EOC Beneficial Owner
shall only be responsible for his or her pro rata share of any Make Whole
Payment due to Parent (based on each EOP Former Members applicable EOC
Membership Interest Percentage multiplied by 75% and each EOC Beneficial
Owners applicable Banyan Membership Interest Percentage, multiplied by 25%,
as applicable) pursuant to this _Section 11.8.8_. All Make Whole Payments
shall be due within thirty (30) days following the delivery of written notice
of the occurrence of a Qualified Termination following such Qualified
Termination by Parent to Sellers Representatives. 

   

 11.8.9 _Management Agreement Reimbursements_. The Parties agree that if, at any time during the Protected Period for so long as the applicable Management Agreement remains in effect (the " _Reimbursements Period_ "), EOP or EOC, or their respective Affiliates, are required to reduce any salary or administrative cost reimbursements below the budgeted amounts that have been approved by the owners of the applicable Managed Property pursuant to such Management Agreement due to a written demand by the managing member of the owner of such Managed Property (or an owner or other Person with authority to terminate such Management Agreement on behalf of such owner) (a " _Qualified Loss_ "), then, with respect to such Qualified Loss, Members and EOC Beneficial Owners shall pay to the applicable Acquired Company an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of whole months during the Reimbursements Period where EOP or EOC, or their respective Affiliates, experiences such Qualified Loss by (y) the difference between (A) the applicable approved budgeted amounts of salary or administrative cost reimbursements approved by the owners of such Managed Property pursuant to such Management Agreement and (B) the as adjusted amounts of salary or administrative cost reimbursements invoiced by EOP or EOC, or their respective Affiliates, as a result of such written demand (the " _Reimbursements Payment_ "). Each Member or EOC Beneficial Owner shall only be responsible for his or her pro rata share of any Reimbursements Payment due to Parent (based on each EOP Former Members applicable EOC Membership Interest Percentage multiplied by 75% and each EOC Beneficial Owners applicable Banyan Membership Interest Percentage, multiplied by 25%, as applicable) pursuant to this _Section 11.8.9_. All Reimbursements Payments with respect to any portion of a Reimbursements Period that has occurred shall be due within thirty (30) days following the delivery of written notice of such

 12.4.5 the amount of any Losses recoverable by the Parent Indemnitee shall be reduced by (i) the insurance proceeds actually received by such Parent Indemnitee with respect to such Loss, and (ii) an amount equal to any Tax benefit actually realized with respect to such Loss;

 12.7 _Procedures Relating to Indemnification_. 

  

 12.7.1 _Third-Party Claims_. In the event a third-party claim or demand (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") is made against a Party (the " _Indemnitee_ ") entitled to indemnification under this Agreement, such Indemnitee must give prompt notice (a " _Third-Party Claim Notice_ ") of the Third-Party Claim (i) to Parent, if indemnity is sought from Parent, (ii) to Sellers Representatives, if indemnity is sought from Members, or (iii) to the Member from whom indemnity is sought for Losses resulting from breaches of the representations and warranties contained in _Article 4_ (the Party to whom notice hereunder is given, in any case, the " _Indemnitor s Representative_," and the Party against whom the indemnification claim is asserted, the " _Indemnitor_ "). Such Third-Party Claim Notice shall be given no later than thirty (30) days following the receipt of any such Third-Party Claim or demand by the Indemnitee. The failure to provide a Third-Party Claim Notice in accordance with this _Section 12.7.1_, or any delay in providing such notice, shall not relieve the Indemnitor of any liability it may have to the Indemnitee, except to the extent that (x) any such failure or delay in giving any Third-Party Claim Notice causes the amounts paid or to be paid by the Indemnitor to be greater than they otherwise would have been or otherwise results in prejudice to the Indemnitor, or (y) such Third-Party Claim Notice is not delivered to the Indemnitors Representative prior to the expiration of the applicable Survival Period in accordance with _Section 12.3_. Each Third-Party Claim Notice shall state the amount or good faith estimated amount of Losses with respect to such claim, the 

   ##### 

  

 

method of computation thereof, the specific basis for such claim (if such
information is available or discernable at the time such notice is prepared)
and copies of all notices and documents (including court papers received by
the Indemnitee) relating to the Third-Party Claim. 

   

       | (a)  |   | If a Third-Party Claim is made against an
Indemnitee, the Indemnitors Representative shall have fifteen (15) days
after receipt of a Third-Party Claim Notice to elect to undertake, contest,
control and defend (through counsel reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee), at the Indemnitors cost and expense, the legal proceedings
relating to such Third-Party Claim and the defense and settlement thereof, so
long as (i) the applicable Third-Party Claim involves only money damages,
does not involve a class action, allegations of criminal activities, or
violations of the Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act,
arises from a qui tam or similar whistle blower claim, does not seek an
injunction or other equitable relief against the Indemnitee, and is not
brought by a Governmental Authority; (ii) the Indemnitor diligently defends
such Third-Party Claim (but the Indemnitees right to assume or control the
defense in such instance shall only continue for so long as the Indemnitor
fails to diligently defend such Third-Party Claim); and (iii) the Indemnitee
has not been advised by counsel that a conflict exists if the same counsel
were to represent the Indemnitee and the Indemnitor in connection with
conducting the defense of the Third Party Claim. After written notice by the
Indemnitors Representative of its election to assume the defense and control
of the Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall not be liable to
the Indemnitee for any legal fees or expenses subsequently incurred by such
Indemnitee in connection therewith, _provided that_ (x) until such time as
the Indemnitors Representative assumes the defense and control of a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to defend such Third-Party
Claim, subject to the limitations set forth in this _Section 12.7_, in such
manner as it may deem appropriate, and (y) if the Indemnitors Representative
assumes the defense and control of a Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnitee
shall have the right to participate in the defense thereof and to employ
counsel, at its own expense, separate from the counsel employed by the
Indemnitor, it being understood that the Indemnitors Representative shall
control such defense.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | The Party conducting the defense of any Third-Party
Claim shall at all times act as if all Losses relating to the Third-Party
Claim were for its own account and shall act in good faith and with
reasonable prudence to minimize Losses therefrom. The Indemnitee shall, and
shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully
with the Indemnitors Representative in connection with any Third-Party
Claim.  
      
    | (c)  |   | The Indemnitors Representative shall be authorized to
consent to a settlement of, or the entry of a judgment arising from, any
Third-Party Claim, and the Indemnitee shall consent to a settlement of, or
the entry of any judgment arising from, such Third-Party Claim, if (i) such
settlement  
   

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | obligates the Indemnitor to pay the full amount of
the liability in connection with such Third-Party Claim, (ii) such settlement
does not require any payment or other action by, or limitation on the
Business (including injunctive or any other equitable relief or restrictions
or obligations) on, the Indemnitee, (iii) such settlement does not
require any admission or acknowledgement of liability or fault of the
Indemnitee, and (iv) such settlement contains as a condition thereto, a
complete release of the Indemnitee. In no event shall the Indemnitee admit
any liability with respect to such Third-Party Claim or settle,
compromise, pay or discharge such Third-Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnitors Representative.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 12.7.2 _Other Claims_. In the event any Indemnitee should have a claim against any Indemnitor under this _Article 12_ that does not involve a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall deliver notice of such claim to the Indemnitors Representative promptly following the discovery of any indemnifiable Loss or of facts or circumstances reasonably likely to result in any such indemnifiable Loss, but in any event not later than the last day of the applicable Survival Period in accordance with _Section 12.3_. Each notice with respect to a claim (other than a Third-Party Claim) shall state the amount or good faith estimated amount of Losses with respect to such claim, the method of computation thereof, the specific basis for such claim, the representations, warranties or covenants alleged to have been breached (if such information is available or discernable at the time such notice is prepared) and copies of all notices and documents supporting the basis or bases for such claim. Within thirty (30) days following receipt of any such notice, the Indemnitors Representative shall notify the Indemnitee as to whether the Indemnitor accepts liability for any such Loss. If the Indemnitors Representative disputes the Indemnitors liability with respect to such claim, as provided above, the Indemnitors Representative and the Indemnitee shall attempt to resolve such dispute in good faith. And, if not resolved through the good faith negotiations within thirty (30) days after the delivery of the objection notice referenced in the immediately preceding sentence (or such longer period as the Parties may mutually agree), either Party may commence Proceedings to resolve such dispute. 

  

 12.7.3 _Additional Procedures_. 

  

       | (a)  |   | If an Indemnitor makes any payment on a claim,
including any Third-Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall be subrogated, to the
extent of such payment, to all rights and remedies of the Indemnitee to any
insurance benefits or other claims or benefits of the Indemnitee with respect
to such claim.  
---|---|---|--- 
      
    | (b)  |   | To the extent permitted by applicable Law, any payment
under this _Section 12.7_ shall be treated as an adjustment to the purchase
price hereunder for Tax purposes.  
      
    | (c)  |   | As a condition to any claim, including any Third-Party
Claim, made by any Indemnitee, the Indemnitor agrees to take commercially
reasonable steps under the circumstances to mitigate any Losses of the
Indemnitee  
    

  ##### 

  

   

       |   |   | upon and after becoming aware of any event or
condition which would reasonably be expected to give rise to any Losses that
are indemnifiable hereunder.  
---|---|---|--- 
   

  

 12.8 _No Double Recovery_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no Party shall be entitled to indemnification or reimbursement under any provision of this Agreement for any amount to the extent that such Party or any of its Affiliates has been indemnified or reimbursed for such amount under any other provision of this Agreement or any Related Agreement.

and agree that the same have or has been mutually negotiated, prepared and
drafted, and that if at any time the Parties desire or are required to
interpret or construe any such term or condition or any agreement or
