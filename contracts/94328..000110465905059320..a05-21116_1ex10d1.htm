## 2.5 PRORATIONS OF CERTAIN PROPERTY TAXES

  

## 

  

Any general real or personal property Tax assessed against or pertaining to
the Assets for the Tax period that includes the Closing Date shall be
prorated between Buyer and Sellers as of the Closing Date in accordance with
this Section 2.5. To determine Sellers liability for any real and personal
property Taxes for the period ending as of the Closing Date (the "Pre-Closing
Property Taxes"), the total amount of such Taxes allocable to Sellers shall
be the product of (i) such Tax for the entirety of the Tax period including
the Closing Date, multiplied by (ii) a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days in such Tax period prior to the Closing Date, and the
denominator of which is the total number of days in the Tax period, and the
balance of such Taxes shall be allocable to Buyer. For purposes of
the Initial Balance Sheet, the Estimated Closing Balance Sheet and, if
necessary, the Closing Balance Sheet, an estimate of the Pre-Closing Property
Taxes shall be based on the immediately preceding Tax period assessment. When
the actual amount of real or personal property Taxes estimated under this
Section 2.5 is known, Buyer shall promptly advise Sellers of the
proportionate share of actual real or personal property Taxes which
constitute Pre-Closing Property Taxes and furnish Sellers with reasonably

  



  

17   

      
  

  



  

supporting documents evidencing the actual amount of such Taxes. If the
estimate of Pre-Closing Property Taxes made pursuant to this Section 2.5 was
less than the actual Pre-Closing Property Taxes and such deficiency is not
taken into account in the Adjustment Amount, Sellers shall pay in cash to
Buyer such deficiency within thirty (30) days of receipt of such notice and
reasonably supporting documents, and if such estimate was more than the
actual Pre-Closing Property Taxes and such increase is not taken into account
in the Adjustment Amount, Buyer shall, at the time such notice is given
(which shall be no later than thirty (30) days from Buyers receipt of
documentation evidencing the actual amount of real and personal property
Taxes for the Tax period including the Closing Date), refund such excess in
cash to Sellers. Any disputes related to the allocation of real and personal
property Taxes under this Section 2.5 shall be resolved by the Independent
Accountants, in accordance with the procedure prescribed for disputes
relating to the calculation of Closing Net Asset Value under Section 2.11.

  



  

## 2.6 SALES AND TRANSFER TAXES; RECORDING FEES

  

## 

  

### (a) All sales and use, motor vehicle sales and use, transfer and
documentary Taxes, if any, payable in connection with the sale, conveyances,
assignments, transfers and deliveries to be made to Buyer hereunder shall be
borne fifty percent (50%) by Buyer and fifty percent (50%) by Sellers, unless
such Taxes are imposed as a result of a partys failure to provide the
documentation described in Section 2.6(b) or Section 2.6(c), in which case
such Taxes shall be borne one hundred percent (100%) by the party failing to
provide the appropriate documentation at Closing. Buyer and Sellers shall
each promptly pay any such Taxes directly to the Governmental Body assessing
them and shall join in the execution of any necessary Tax Returns. In the
event that either Buyer or any Seller is audited in connection with such
Taxes, the party being audited will notify the other parties of such audit
and will not object to the other parties appearance in the audit.

  

### 

  

### (b) Sellers represent and warrant to Buyer that the exchange of the
Assets and the Business to the extent located in Texas qualifies for the
occasional sale exemption provided under Section 151.304(a) and (b)(2) of the
Texas Tax Code and 34 Texas Administrative Code Section 3.316(d), and Sellers
shall deliver to Buyer at the Closing an Affidavit of Occasional Sale in the
form promulgated by the Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts (the "Affidavit
of Occasional Sale") for purposes of establishing such exemption.  Upon the
receipt of, and in reliance on, such Affidavit of Occasional Sale, Buyer
shall deliver to Sellers a valid Texas exemption certificate corresponding to
the Texas occasional sale exemption at Closing.

  

### 

  

### (c) Sellers have disclosed in Section 3.5(a) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter the United States locations of any Assets located outside of Texas. In
reliance of such disclosure, Buyer shall deliver to Sellers all state or
local resale or exemption certificates required to claim valid exemptions, if
any, from sale and use, motor vehicle sales and use, transfer or documentary
Taxes otherwise payable in connection with the sale, conveyances,
assignments, transfers and deliveries of the Assets to the Buyer. Subject to
Section 2.6(a), applicable sales Taxes shall be collected and due at Closing
if valid exemption certificates are not provided by the appropriate party.

  



  

18   

     
   

  



  

## 2.7 ALLOCATION

  

## 

  

Buyer and Sellers shall agree upon the allocation of the Purchase Price among
the Assets in accordance with Section 1060 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations promulgated thereunder (as well as any similar provision of
state, local or foreign law, as appropriate), and a draft of IRS Form 8594
shall be delivered at Closing (the "Allocation Schedule"). The Allocation
Schedule shall be binding upon Buyer and Sellers. Buyer and Sellers
and their Affiliates agree to amend the Allocation Schedule as necessary to
reflect the Adjustment Amount, and a final Allocation Schedule (the "Final
Allocation Schedule") shall be prepared by Buyer and Sellers on a basis
consistent with the Allocation Schedule within thirty (30) days following the
final determination of the Adjustment Amount under Section 2.11.  Buyer and
Sellers and their Affiliates shall report, act, and file all Tax Returns
(including, but not limited to, IRS Form 8594) in all respects and for all
purposes consistent with the Final Allocation Schedule. Buyer and Sellers
shall each timely and properly prepare, execute, file and deliver all such
documents, forms, and other information as either Buyer or Sellers may
reasonably request in preparing the Allocation Schedule or the Final
Allocation Schedule. Neither Buyer nor Sellers shall take any position
(whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that is inconsistent with the
Final Allocation Schedule unless required to do so by any applicable Legal
Requirement.

  



  

## 2.8 CLOSING

purchase and sale provided for in this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take
place as promptly as practical following the satisfaction or waiver (subject
to applicable Legal Requirement) of all conditions (other than those

shall be paid by wire transfer of immediately available funds by Buyer to an
account specified by Sellers. Within five (5) business days after the
calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value becomes binding and conclusive on
the parties pursuant to Section 2.11, Sellers or Buyer, as the case may be,
shall make the wire transfer payment provided for in this Section 2.10. For
the purposes of this Section 2.10, the "Estimated Closing Net Asset Value"
will equal the amount of the Estimated Closing Net Asset Value that was paid
at Closing.

  



  

21   

     
   

  



  

## 2.11 ADJUSTMENT PROCEDURE

  

## 

  

### (a) Buyer shall prepare a Closing Balance Sheet ("Closing Balance Sheet")
of the Business as of the Closing Date applying the Agreed Accounting
Principles. Buyer shall then determine the Net Asset Value as of the
Effective Time (the "Closing Net Asset Value") based upon the Closing Balance
Sheet. Buyer shall deliver the Closing Balance Sheet and its determination of
the Closing Net Asset Value to Sellers within forty-five (45) days following
the Closing Date. The Closing Balance Sheet (i) will not account for or
reflect in any manner any assets that do not constitute Assets and (ii) will
account for and reflect all Assumed Liabilities that are required to be
accounted for or reflected on such Closing Balance Sheet applying the Agreed
Accounting Principles.  Sellers and their independent auditors and other
Representatives shall have the right to review and verify the Closing Balance
Sheet and determination of the Closing Net Asset Value when received and
Buyer shall provide Sellers with access to all (i) work papers and written
procedures used to prepare the Closing Balance Sheet and the determination of
Closing Net Asset Value and (ii) books and Records and personnel to the
extent necessary to enable Sellers and their independent auditors and other
Representatives to conduct a full review of the Closing Balance Sheet and for
them to fully evaluate Buyers calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value. By
way of clarification and amplification with respect to Buyers preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet (and to ensure that it is prepared on the same
basis and applying the Agreed Accounting Principles as was done by Sellers in
preparing the Initial Balance Sheet), special mention is made of, and Buyer
(A) understands and accepts as binding with respect to its preparation of
the Closing Balance Sheet the Sellers judgments as to valuation and
reserve matters pertaining to such accounts in the Initial Balance Sheet, (B)
accepts and agrees with Sellers application of the Agreed Accounting
Principles including the valuations of current assets in respect thereof, and
(C) will not contest or otherwise propose any change to the reserves
established in connection with any Asset and valuation thereof in the Initial
Balance Sheet except to the extent that any further reserves as to such Asset
and valuation thereof are clearly required by application of the Agreed
Accounting Principles as a result of the passage of time or changes in
conditions, facts or circumstances since the date of the Initial Balance
Sheet.

  

### 

  

### (b) If within thirty (30) days following delivery of the Closing Balance
Sheet and the Closing Net Asset Value calculation Sellers have not given
Buyer written notice of their objection as to the Closing Net Asset Value
calculation (which notice shall state the basis of Sellers objection), then
the Closing Net Asset Value calculated by Buyer shall be binding and
conclusive on the parties and be used in computing the Adjustment Amount.

  

### 

  

### (c) If Sellers duly give Buyer such notice of objection, and if Sellers
and Buyer fail to resolve the issues outstanding with respect to the Closing
Balance Sheet and the calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value within
thirty (30) days of Buyers receipt of Sellers objection notice, Sellers and
Buyer shall submit the issues remaining in dispute to the Independent
Accountants, for resolution applying the Agreed Accounting Principles.
If issues are submitted to the Independent Accountants for resolution, (i)
Sellers and Buyer shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Independent
Accountants such work papers and other documents and information relating to
the disputed issues as the Independent Accountants may request and are
available to that party or its agents and shall be afforded the opportunity
to present to the

  



  

22   

     
   

  



  

### Independent Accountants any material relating to the disputed issues and
to discuss the issues with the Independent Accountants; (ii) the
determination by the Independent Accountants, as set forth in a reasonably
detailed notice to be delivered to both Parent and Buyer within forty-five
(45) days of the submission to the Independent Accountants of the issues
remaining in dispute, shall be final, binding and conclusive on the parties
and shall be used in the calculation of the Closing Net Asset Value; and
(iii) Sellers and Buyer will each bear fifty percent (50%) of the fees and
costs of the Independent Accountants for such determination. In connection
with the retention of the Independent Accountants, Sellers and Buyer agree
that they will enter into a customary engagement agreement
therewith, including appropriate provision for joint and several indemnity of
such Independent Accountants as to their services and conclusions.

taking full responsibility for making their own evaluation of the adequacy
and accuracy of all projections, forecasts, plans and other forward-looking
information so furnished to it (including the reasonableness of the
assumptions underlying such projections, forecasts, plans and other forward-
looking information).  In entering into or, in the case of Buyer Entity,

(Indemnification; Remedies) and 12 (Confidentiality) will survive, _provided_

# 10. Additional Covenants

  

# 

  

## 10.1 EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

  

## 

  

### (a) As of the Closing Date, Sellers shall terminate the employment of all
of the Affected Employees (other than those who are on short-term
disability leave). As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Buyer shall offer employment, effective as of the Effective Time, to all
persons who are or will be Affected Employees on the day immediately
preceding the Closing Date (other than those on short-term disability leave).
Each Affected Employee who accepts any such offer of employment shall be
referred to in this Agreement as a "Transferred Employee."  The offer of
employment, including wages, salaries and benefits, shall be, in the
aggregate, substantially comparable, but excluding for this
purpose Transaction Bonuses, with the terms and conditions under which the
Transferred Employees were employed immediately before the Closing Date. Any
Affected Employee who is on short-term disability leave as of the Closing
Date shall remain employed by Sellers through the Affected Employees short-
term disability leave; _provided_ , _however_ , that if he or she recovers
from his or her disability within the period of his or her short-term
disability leave or the six-month period following the Closing Date
(whichever is shorter), Buyer shall at that time make an offer of

  



  

47   

     
   

  



  

employment to him or her on the same employment terms and conditions as are
applicable to similarly situated Transferred Employees, subject to
the proviso above.

  

### 

  

### (b) Sellers shall be responsible for the payment of all wages and other
remuneration accruing to any Affected Employee prior to the time any such
Affected Employee became a Transferred Employee, except to the extent the
liability therefor is reflected as a liability on the Closing Balance Sheet.

  

### 

  

### (c) Sellers shall be liable for all claims made by Affected Employees and
their beneficiaries under and all other liabilities of the Seller Benefit
Plans.

  

### 

  

### (d) Coverage for Transferred Employees under all "employee welfare
benefit plans," as defined in Section 3(1) of ERISA, maintained by Sellers
shall cease as of the Effective Time. Sellers shall be solely responsible
for any continuation coverage required by COBRA for those Affected Employees
of Sellers who are not Transferred Employees. Buyer shall waive all pre-
existing conditions, limitations or exclusions and waiting periods for the
Transferred Employees under all employee welfare benefit plans and fringe
benefit programs of Buyer, including vacation, bonus and other incentive
programs maintained by Buyer.

  

### 

  

### (e) Sellers shall retain all assets in the pension and retirement funds
of Sellers, and shall distribute pension and retirement benefits that the
Transferred Employees shall become entitled to receive from Sellers in
accordance with the applicable plan document and the Transferred Employees
elections, as applicable; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that effective as of the
Effective Time, to the extent required by Legal Requirement, Sellers shall
amend the Stewart and Stevenson Services, Inc. Defined Benefit Pension Plan and
any other Seller Benefit Plan that is a "pension plan," as defined in Section
3(2) of ERISA, to provide that each Transferred Employees benefit that has
accrued as of the Closing Date is fully vested and nonforfeitable as of the
Closing Date.

  

### 

  

### (f) Effective as of the Closing Date (or as to employees on short-term
disability leave on the Closing Date, as of the date of employment by Buyer),
Buyer shall take such actions as are necessary to grant past service credit
for all the Transferred Employees for purposes of determining vesting,
eligibility and benefit accruals under all Buyers employee benefit programs
in which Transferred Employees are eligible to participate, including
employee retirement plans, severance, vacation, bonus, incentive compensation
and employee welfare benefit plans of Buyer equal to that which such
Transferred Employees were credited with by Sellers as of the Closing Date
for service with Sellers and their current and former ERISA Affiliates, but
excluding benefit accruals for Buyers defined benefit pension and post-
retirement medical benefit plans.

  

### 

  

### (g) With respect to events following the Closing, Buyer shall be
responsible for sending timely and appropriate notices to all Transferred
Employees required under all applicable Legal Requirements relating to plant
or facility closings or otherwise regulating the termination of employees. To
the extent that any liability is incurred under any such Legal Requirements
based on Buyers failure to comply with Section 10.1(a) or Buyers actions
after

  



  

48   

     
   

  



  

the Closing, Buyer will be solely and exclusively responsible for
all obligations and liabilities incurred under such Legal Requirements
relating to the Contemplated Transactions.

  

### 

  

### (h) Sellers shall make available to Buyer records which provide
information regarding employees names, Social Security numbers, dates of
hire by Sellers, date of birth, number of hours worked each calendar year,
attendance and salary histories for all Transferred Employees.  Sellers
shall not provide records to the extent prohibited by any applicable Legal
Requirement, including the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability
Act of 1996.

  

### 

  

## 10.2 NONSOLICITATION

  

## 

  

### (a) Until the date three (3) years after the Closing Date, no Seller
shall (and each Seller shall cause its Affiliates not to), without the prior
written consent of Buyer, directly or indirectly, knowingly hire, retain or
attempt to hire or retain any employee or contract employee of Buyer or
interfere with the relationship or prospective employment relationship
between Buyer and any Affected Employee, or any of Buyers employees or
contract employees; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such Seller shall not be
prohibited from hiring, retaining or attempting to hire or retain any person
who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement.

  

### 

  

### (b) Until the date three (3) years after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
not (and Buyer shall cause its Affiliates not to), without the prior written
consent of Sellers, directly or indirectly, knowingly hire, retain or attempt
to hire or retain any employee or contract employee of any Seller or
interfere with the relationship between any Seller and any of its employees
or contract employees;  _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer shall not be
prohibited from hiring, retaining or attempting to hire or retain any person
who responds to a general solicitation or advertisement.

  

### 

  

## 10.3 CUSTOMER AND OTHER BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS

  

## 

  

For a period of ninety (90) days after the Closing, each Seller will
cooperate with Buyer on a commercially reasonable basis at Buyers sole cost
in its efforts to continue and maintain for the benefit of Buyer those
business relationships of such Seller existing prior to the Closing and
relating to the Business after the Closing, including relationships
with lessors, employees, regulatory authorities, licensors, customers,
suppliers and others.

  



  

## 10.4 RETENTION OF AND ACCESS TO RECORDS

  

## 

  

### (a) For the greater of five years from the Closing Date and any period as
may be required by any statute, regulation or Governmental Body or any then
pending litigation, Buyer shall maintain in the same manner that it currently
maintains its business records and files the business records and files of
Sellers that are transferred to Buyer in connection herewith, and in
anticipation of, or preparation for, existing or future Proceeding or any Tax
audit in which Sellers or any of its Affiliates is involved and which is
related to the Business or the Assets, permit Sellers and their
Representatives reasonable access to such records and files during regular
business hours and upon reasonable notice at Buyers principal places of
business or at any location where the records are stored; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that (i) any access shall be had or done in a manner so as not to
interfere with the normal conduct of the Business and (ii) Buyer

  



  

49   

     
   

  



  

shall not be required to provide access to any confidential record
or records, the disclosure of which would violate any governmental statute
or regulation or applicable confidentiality agreement with any Person. Buyer
shall notify Parent in writing at least ten days prior to any destruction of
such transferred records and files prior to the end of the period referenced
in the preceding sentence, and at Parents option, deliver such records and
files to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (b) Upon reasonable request therefor by Buyer, Sellers shall deliver to
Buyer copies of any original Business Records not delivered to Buyer at the
Closing as promptly as reasonably possible at Sellers sole cost and expense.
Further, for a period of five (5) years from the Closing, Sellers (i) shall
maintain, and shall cause their Affiliates to maintain, at Sellers sole cost
and expense, those Business Records not delivered to Buyer at the Closing and
(b) shall not (and shall cause each of its Affiliates not to) destroy any
such Business Records without first notifying Buyer in writing at least 30
days in advance of such destruction and giving Buyer the opportunity to take
possession of such Business Records.

  

### 

  

## 10.5 FURTHER ASSURANCES

  

## 

  

The parties shall cooperate reasonably with each other and with their
respective Representatives in connection with any steps required to be taken
as part of their respective obligations under this Agreement, and shall (a)
furnish upon request to each other such further information; (b) execute and
deliver to each other such other documents; and (c) do such other acts and
things, all as the other party may reasonably request for the purpose of
carrying out the intent of this Agreement and the Contemplated Transactions.

  



  

## 10.6 PROVISIONS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASSETS

  

## 

  

### (a) To the extent that a Seller Contract or Governmental Authorization is
not capable of being sold, assigned, transferred, subcontracted or conveyed
without the approval, consent or waiver of the issuer thereof or the other
party thereto, or any Third Party (including a Governmental Body), and such
approval, consent or waiver has not been obtained prior to the Closing, or if
such sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance or attempted sale, assignment,
transfer or conveyance would constitute a breach thereof or a violation of
any Legal Requirement, neither this Agreement nor any other Transaction
Agreement shall constitute a sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance
thereof, or an attempted sale, assignment, transfer or conveyance thereof.

  

### 

  

### (b) Anything in this Agreement to the contrary notwithstanding, a Seller
is not obligated to sell, assign, transfer or convey to Buyer any of its
rights or obligations in or to any of the Seller Contracts or Governmental
Authorizations without first obtaining all necessary approvals, consents or
waivers; _provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing shall not limit Sellers
liability for a breach of Section 3.14 or Section 5.1. Buyer and
Sellers shall cooperate with each other to obtain all approvals, consents or
waivers necessary to convey to Buyer each such Seller Contract or
Governmental Authorization, as soon as practicable; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that neither such Seller nor Buyer shall be obligated to offer or pay
any consideration or concession therefor to the Third Party from whom
such approval, consent or waiver is requested.  Other than the Consents set
forth on Exhibit 7.2, the failure by any Seller to obtain any such approval,
consent

  



  

50   

     
   

  



  

or waiver necessary to convey any Seller Contract or
Governmental Authorization to Buyer shall not affect the obligations of the
parties to close hereunder; provided that such Seller uses commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the economic benefit of each Seller Contract to
be furnished to Buyer.

  

### 

  

### (c) To the extent any of the approvals, consents or waivers necessary to
convey any Seller Contract or Governmental Authorization to Buyer have not
been obtained by any Seller as of the Closing or to the extent any Seller
Contract or Governmental Authorization cannot be transferred to Buyer by the
Closing, then Buyer and such Seller shall enter into a Subcontract with
respect to any such Seller Contract, and such Seller shall, during the
remaining term of such Seller Contract or Governmental Authorization, use
commercially reasonable efforts, to (i) at the request of Buyer, cooperate
with Buyer to obtain the consent of any such Third Party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither such Seller nor Buyer shall be obligated to offer or
pay any consideration to any Person, (ii) at the request of Buyer, cooperate
with Buyer in any reasonable and lawful arrangements designed to provide the
benefits of such Seller Contract or Governmental Authorization to Buyer,
(iii) as it pertains to Seller Contracts, enforce, at the request of Buyer
and at the expense and for the account of Buyer, any rights of such Seller
arising from such Seller Contract against the issuer thereof or the other
party or parties thereto (including the rights to elect to terminate any such
Seller Contract in accordance with the terms thereof upon the request
of Buyer); and (iv) as it pertains to Governmental Authorization, at the
request and expense of Buyer, apply for any necessary renewals or
extensions thereof. To the extent that any Seller enters into lawful
arrangements satisfactory to Buyer in its sole discretion designed to provide
the benefits of any such Seller Contract or Governmental Authorization to
Buyer as set forth in clauses (i) through (iv) above, such Seller Contract or
Governmental Authorization shall be deemed to have been conveyed to Buyer for
the purposes of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

## 10.7 SUPPORT

  

## 

  

### (a) From and after the Closing, in the event and for so long as any
Seller actively is contesting or defending against any action, suit,
proceeding, hearing, investigation, charge, complaint, claim, or demand in
connection with (i) any transaction contemplated under this Agreement or (ii)
any fact, situation, circumstances, status, condition, activity, practice,
plan, occurrence, event, incident, action, failure to act, or transaction
relating to the Business (including during such period prior to Closing),
Buyer will cooperate reasonably with Sellers and Sellers counsel in the
contest or defense, make available their personnel, and provide such
testimony and access to their books and records as shall be reasonably
requested in connection with the contest or defense, all at the reasonable
out-of-pocket expense of Sellers (unless Sellers are entitled to
indemnification therefor hereunder). This Section 10.7 is not intended to
alter applicable discovery procedures in connection with any litigation
between or among the parties hereto.

  

### 

  

### (b) From and after Closing, Buyer will cooperate reasonably with Sellers
and Sellers counsel, make available their personnel, assist in preparing and
making filings, and provide such access to their books and records as shall
be reasonably requested in connection with the closing, termination, de-
registration or other activities associated with Sellers closing of

  



  

51   

     
   

  



  

the foreign branches or offices of the Business that are registered
or otherwise held in the name of or on behalf of any Seller or its
Affiliates.

  

### 

  

## 10.8 BUYER ACKNOWLEDGMENT

  

## 

  

Buyer acknowledges and understands that, except to the extent expressly set
forth in the Transition Services Agreement and the Supply Agreement, benefits
that the Business realizes as a result of arrangements that Parent and its
Subsidiaries have with third parties will not be available to Buyer after the
Closing Date.

## 11.4 LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT  SELLERS

  

## 

  

From and after the Closing, Sellers shall have no liability (for

until the total of all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds [***] in
the aggregate and then only for the amount by which

  



  

53   

     
   

  



  

such Damages exceed [***]; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Sellers aggregate liability (for indemnification or otherwise) with respect
to claims under Section 11.2(a) exceed [***]. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary herein, the limitations set forth in this Section 11.4 will not
apply if the Closing does not occur or to a breach of any representation or
warranty set forth in Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.7, 3.11(a) or 3.22.

  



  

## 11.5 LIMITATIONS ON AMOUNT  BUYER

  

## 

  

From and after Closing, Buyer shall have no liability (for indemnification or
otherwise) with respect to claims under Section 11.3(a) until the total of
all Damages with respect to such matters exceeds [***] in the aggregate and
then only for the amount by which such Damages exceed [***]; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that in no event shall Buyers aggregate liability

## 11.6 TIME LIMITATIONS

  

## 

  

The several representations and warranties of the parties to this Agreement
shall survive the Closing Date for a period of eighteen (18) months from the

and warranties as the "Survival Period"), and shall be effective with respect
to any inaccuracy therein or breach thereof (and a claim for indemnification
under Article 11 hereof may be made thereon) if a written notice asserting
the claim and specifying the factual basis of the claim in reasonable detail
to the extent then known by the notifying party shall have been given within
the Survival Period with respect to such matter. Any claim for indemnification
made during the Survival Period shall be valid and the representations and
warranties relating thereto shall remain in effect for purposes of such
indemnification notwithstanding such claim may not be resolved within the
Survival Period. The agreements and covenants set forth herein shall survive
without limitation.

  



  

## 11.7 PROCEDURE

  

## 

  

All claims for indemnification under this Article 11 shall be asserted and
resolved as follows:

  



  

### (a) A Person entitled to indemnification under Section 11.2 or 11.3 (an
"Indemnitee"), promptly after it becomes aware of facts giving rise to a
right of indemnification under this Agreement, shall give written notice
thereof to the Person obligated to indemnify under such section (an
"Indemnitor"), stating the amount of the Damages, if known, and method of
computation thereof, all with reasonable particularity, and stating with
particularity the nature

  



  

54   

     
   

  



  

of the matter and basis of the claim for indemnity under this Agreement. For
purposes of this Section 11.7(a), receipt by a party of written notice of any
demand, assertion, claim, action or proceeding (judicial, administrative or
otherwise) by or from any Person other than a party to this Agreement that
gives rise to Damages on behalf of the party shall constitute the awareness
of facts giving rise to a right of indemnification by it under this Agreement
and shall require prompt notice of the receipt of such matter as provided in
the first sentence of this Section 11.7(a). Failure to provide the
notice shall not affect the right of the Indemnitee to indemnification except
to the extent the Indemnitor is materially prejudiced by the Indemnitees
failure to give such notice.

  

### 

  

### (b) If an Indemnitee should have Damages against any Indemnitor hereunder
that does not involve a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall provide the
Indemnitor a written notice with respect to the Damages.  If the Indemnitor
does not notify the Indemnitee within 30 calendar days from its receipt of
the written notice of Damages that the Indemnitor disputes the Damages, the
Damages specified by the Indemnitee in the claim notice shall be deemed a
liability of the Indemnitor hereunder. If the Indemnitor has timely disputed
the Damages as provided above, such dispute shall be resolved subject to
the provisions of this Agreement.

  

### 

  

### (c) If an Indemnitee shall have a Third Party Claim asserted against it,
the Indemnitee shall provide the Indemnitor written notice of the Damages
relating to the Third Party Claim (a "Third Party Claim Notice"). Within 15
Business Days following receipt by an Indemnitor of a Third Party Claim
Notice (the "Election Period"), the Indemnitor shall advise the Indemnitee in
writing (i) whether the Indemnitor disputes its potential liability to the
Indemnitee under this Article 11 with respect to the Third Party Claim and
(ii) whether the Indemnitor elects, at its sole cost and expense, to defend
the Indemnitee against such Third Party Claim.

  

### 

  

### (d) If the Indemnitor notifies the Indemnitee within the Election Period
of its election to assume the defense of the Third Party Claim in accordance
with Section 11.7(c) above, the Indemnitor shall have the obligation to
defend, at its sole cost and expense, the Third Party Claim by all
appropriate proceedings, which proceedings shall be prosecuted diligently by
the Indemnitor to a final conclusion or settled at the discretion of the
Indemnitor in accordance with this Section 11.7(d); provided, that the
Indemnitor shall not settle or compromise any such Third Party Claim without
the prior consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld conditioned or delayed) unless (i) the terms of such compromise or
settlement require no more than the payment of money (i.e. such settlement or
compromise shall not require the admission of wrongdoing by the Indemnitee,
impose any obligations upon the Indemnitee or deprive the Indemnitee of any
rights), (ii) the full amount of such monetary settlement or compromise will
be paid by the Indemnitor, and (iii) the Indemnitee receives as part of such
settlement or compromise a legal, binding and enforceable unconditional
satisfaction and/or release from any and all further actions or liabilities
relating to the subject matter of the Third Party Claim. The Indemnitor shall
have full control of such defense and proceedings, including, subject to
the preceding sentence, any compromise or settlement thereof. The Indemnitee
is hereby authorized to file, during the Election Period, any motion, answer
or other pleadings that the Indemnitee shall, in good faith, deem necessary
or appropriate to protect its interest or those of the Indemnitor and not
prejudicial to the Indemnitor (it being understood and agreed that if the
Indemnitee takes any such action that is prejudicial and conclusively causes
a

  



  

55   

     
   

  



  

final adjudication adverse to the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor shall
be relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to the Third Party
Claim to the extent so adjudicated). If requested by the Indemnitor, the
Indemnitee agrees, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, to
cooperate with the Indemnitor and its counsel in contesting any Third Party
Claims, including by making of any related counterclaim against the Person
asserting the Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any Person.
The Indemnitee shall have the right to participate in, but not control, any
defense or settlement of any Third Party Claim controlled by the Indemnitor
pursuant to this Section 11.7(d), and shall bear its own costs and expenses
with respect to any such participation.

  

### 

  

### (e) If an Indemnitor fails to notify an Indemnitee within the Election
Period that the Indemnitor elects to defend the Indemnitee pursuant to
Section 11.7(c) or if the Indemnitor fails to diligently defend or settle the
Third Party Claim or to prosecute any appropriate counterclaim against the
Person making the Third Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any
Person, or if the Indemnitee reasonably objects to such election on the
grounds that counsel for such Indemnitee cannot represent both the Indemnitor
and the Indemnitee because such representation would be reasonably likely to
result in a conflict of interest, then the Indemnitee shall have the right
but not the obligation to defend, at the sole cost and expense of the
Indemnitor (but only if the Indemnitee actually is entitled to
indemnification hereunder), the Third Party Claim by such proceedings deemed
reasonably appropriate by the Indemnitee and its counsel. The Indemnitee
shall have full control of such defense and proceedings, including any
compromise or settlement of the Third Party Claim; provided, that the
Indemnitee shall not enter into any compromise or settlement of such Third
Party Claim without the Indemnitors consent, which shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. If requested by the Indemnitee, the Indemnitor shall, at
the sole cost and expense of the Indemnitor, cooperate with the Indemnitee
and its counsel in contesting any Third Party Claim that the Indemnitee is
contesting, or, if appropriate and related to the Third Party Claim in
question, in making any counterclaim against the Person asserting the Third
Party Claim or any cross-complaint against any Person. Notwithstanding the
foregoing in this Section 11.7(e), if the Indemnitor has delivered a written
notice to the Indemnitee to the effect that the Indemnitor disputes its
potential liability to the Indemnitee under this Article 11 and if such
dispute is resolved in favor of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitor shall not be
required to bear the costs and expenses of the Indemnitees defense pursuant
to this Article 11 or of the Indemnitors participation therein at the
Indemnitees request, and the Indemnitee shall reimburse the Indemnitor in
full for all reasonable costs and expenses of the Indemnitor in connection
with the Third Party Claim, excluding, however, any litigation with respect
to its indemnity obligation hereunder. The Indemnitor shall have the right
to participate in, but not control, any defense or settlement controlled by
the Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 11.7(e), and the Indemnitor
shall bear its own costs and expenses with respect to any such participation.

Indemnitor has not contested its indemnity obligations hereunder and has not
elected to assume the defense of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnitor shall
reimburse (promptly after the receipt of each invoice therefor) the
Indemnitee for the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred by the Indemnitee in contesting the Third Party Claim.

  

### 

  

## 11.9 NO SET-OFF

  

## 

  

Neither Buyer nor any Seller shall have any right to setoff any Damages

payments made hereunder for such Damages.

  



  

## 11.11 NO DUPLICATION

  

## 

  

Any Liability for indemnification hereunder shall be determined without
duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts giving rise to such
Liability constituting a breach of more than one representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement.

  



  

## 11.12 REMEDIES

  

## 

  

### (a) The parties agree that, except as provided in Section 13.5, the sole
and exclusive remedy of any party hereto or their respective Affiliates with
respect to this Agreement and in any other agreement delivered by any Seller
or Buyer in connection with the Contemplated Transactions (collectively, the
"Transaction Agreements") or any other claims relating to the Business, the
events giving rise to this Agreement and the other Transaction Agreements and
the Contemplated Transactions shall be limited to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this Article 11; _provided_ that this limitation
shall not apply in the event of fraud; and _provided_ further that if an
Indemnitor shall breach or threaten to commit a breach of any of its
restrictive covenants set forth in this Agreement or any other Transaction
Agreement (the "Restrictive Covenants"), any Indemnitee shall have the right
in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights and remedies available
to such Indemnitee, under law or in equity, to have the Restrictive Covenants
specifically enforced by any court, including the right to seek entry against
such Indemnitor, any of its Affiliates and any shareholder, officer,
director, employee of each of the foregoing of restraining orders and
injunctions (preliminary, mandatory, temporary and permanent) against
violations, threatened or actual, and whether or not then continuing, of the
Restrictive Covenants, it being acknowledged and agreed that money damages
will not provide such Indemnitee an adequate remedy.

### (b) The parties hereto intend that, even though indemnification and other
obligations appear in various sections and articles of this Agreement, the

apply to all indemnity and other obligations of the parties under this
Agreement, except to the extent expressly excluded in this Article 11.

SPECULATIVE OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT ANY SUCH PARTY
SUFFERS SUCH DAMAGES TO AN UNAFFILIATED THIRD PARTY IN CONNECTION WITH A
THIRD PARTY CLAIM, IN WHICH EVENT SUCH DAMAGES SHALL BE RECOVERABLE.

## 12.1 DEFINITION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

  

## 

  

### (a) As used in this Article 12, the term "Confidential Information"
includes any and all of the following information of any Seller or Buyer that
has been or may hereafter be disclosed in any form, whether in writing,
orally, electronically or otherwise, or otherwise made available by
observation, inspection or otherwise by either party (Buyer on the one hand
or Sellers on the other hand) or its Representatives (collectively, a
"Disclosing Party") to the other party or its Representatives (collectively,
a "Receiving Party"):

  

### 

  

#### (i) all information that is a trade secret under applicable trade secret
or other law;

  

#### 

  

#### (ii) all information concerning product specifications, data, know-how,

considered Confidential Information of that Disclosing Party for purposes of
this Article 12 to the extent included within the definition. In the case of
trade secrets, each Disclosing Party, hereby waives any requirement that the
other party submit proof of the economic value of any trade secret or post a
bond or other security.

  

### 

  

## 12.2 RESTRICTED USE OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

  

## 

  

### (a) Each Receiving Party acknowledges the confidential and proprietary

that such Confidential Information (i) shall be kept confidential by the
Receiving Party; (ii) shall not be used for any reason or purpose other than
to evaluate and consummate the Contemplated Transactions; and (iii) without
limiting the foregoing, shall not be disclosed by the Receiving Party to any

of evaluating the Contemplated Transactions and are informed by Buyer or
Sellers, as the case may be, of the obligations of this Article 12 with
respect to such information. Each of Buyer and Sellers shall (A) enforce the
terms of this Article 12 as to its respective Representatives; (B) take such

the Assets or the Assumed Liabilities. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, Sellers may use any Confidential Information of Sellers before the
Closing in the ordinary course of the Business consistent with past practices
in connection with the transactions permitted by Section 6.2.

  

### 

  

### (c) From and after the Closing, the provisions of Section 12.2(a) above
shall not apply to or restrict in any manner Buyers use of any Confidential
Information of Sellers relating solely to any of the Assets or the Assumed
Liabilities.

  



  

59   

     
   

  



  

## 12.3 EXCEPTIONS

  

## 

  

Sections 12.2(a) and (b) do not apply to that part of the Confidential
Information of a Disclosing Party that a Receiving Party demonstrates (a)
was, is or becomes generally available to the public other than as a result
of a breach of this Article 12 or the Confidentiality Agreement by the
Receiving Party or its Representatives; (b) was or is developed by the
Receiving Party independently of and without reference to any Confidential
Information of the Disclosing Party; or (c) was, is or becomes available to
the Receiving Party on a nonconfidential basis from a Third Party not bound
by a confidentiality agreement or any legal, fiduciary or other obligation
restricting disclosure. Sellers shall not disclose any
Confidential Information of Sellers relating to any of the Assets or the
Assumed Liabilities in reliance on the exceptions in clauses (b) or (c)
above.

  



  

## 12.4 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

  

## 

  

If a Receiving Party becomes compelled in any Proceeding or is requested by a
Governmental Body having regulatory jurisdiction over the Contemplated
Transactions to make any disclosure that is prohibited or otherwise
constrained by this Article 12, that Receiving Party shall provide the
Disclosing Party with prompt notice of such compulsion or request so that it
may seek an appropriate protective order or other appropriate remedy or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Article 12. In the absence of a
protective order or other remedy, the Receiving Party may disclose that
portion (and only that portion) of the Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party that, based upon advice of the Receiving Partys counsel,
the Receiving Party is legally compelled to disclose or that has
been requested by such Governmental Body, _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Receiving Party shall use reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance
that confidential treatment will be accorded by any Person to whom any
Confidential Information is so disclosed. The provisions of this Section 12.4
do not apply to any Proceedings between the parties to this Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Article 12 or elsewhere in
this Agreement, any Seller may disclose any Confidential Information to the
extent it reasonably believes such disclosure is required to comply with the
requirements of any applicable Legal Requirement, including the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange.

  



  

## 12.5 RETURN OR DESTRUCTION OF CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION

  

## 

  

If this Agreement is terminated, each Receiving Party shall (a) destroy all
Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party prepared or generated by the
Receiving Party without retaining a copy of any such material; (b) promptly
deliver to the Disclosing Party all other Confidential Information of the
Disclosing Party, together with all copies thereof, in the possession,
custody or control of the Receiving Party or, alternatively, with the written
consent of a Seller Contact or a Buyer Contact (whichever represents the
Disclosing Party) destroy all such Confidential Information; and (c) certify
all such destruction in writing to the Disclosing Party, _provided_ , 
_however_ , that the Receiving Party may retain a list that contains general
descriptions of the information it has returned or destroyed to facilitate
the resolution of any controversies after the Disclosing Partys Confidential
Information is returned.

  



  

60   

     
   

  



  

## 12.6 ATTORNEY-CLIENT PRIVILEGE

  

## 

  

The Disclosing Party is not waiving, and will not be deemed to have waived or
diminished, any of its attorney work product protections, attorney-client
privileges or similar protections and privileges as a result of disclosing
its Confidential Information (including Confidential Information related to
pending or threatened litigation) to the Receiving Party, regardless of
whether the Disclosing Party has asserted, or is or may be entitled
to assert, such privileges and protections. The parties (a) share a common
legal and commercial interest in all of the Disclosing Partys
Confidential Information that is subject to such privileges and protections;
(b) are or may become joint defendants in Proceedings to which the Disclosing
Partys Confidential Information covered by such protections and privileges
relates; (c) intend that such privileges and protections remain intact should
either party become subject to any actual or threatened Proceeding to which
the Disclosing Partys Confidential Information covered by such protections
and privileges relates; and (d) intend that after the Closing the Receiving
Party shall have the right to assert such protections and privileges. No
Receiving Party shall admit, claim or contend, in Proceedings involving
either party or otherwise, that any Disclosing Party waived any of its
attorney work-product protections, attorney-client privileges or similar
protections and privileges with respect to any information, documents or
other material not disclosed to a Receiving Party due to the Disclosing Party
disclosing its Confidential Information (including Confidential Information
related to pending or threatened litigation) to the Receiving Party.

## 13.4 DISPUTE RESOLUTION

  



  

In the event of any dispute or controversy (except for any dispute or
controversy arising out of (i) the allocation of related and personal
property Taxes that is to be resolved in accordance with Section 2.5 or (ii)
the calculation of Closing Net Asset Value that is to be resolved
in accordance with Section 2.11) arising out of or relating to this
Agreement, or any matter relating hereto or the Contemplated Transactions
(the "Dispute"), the parties shall first try

  



  

62   

     
   

  



  

to resolve the dispute by mutual agreement. If the parties are unable to
resolve the Dispute by entering into a written settlement agreement within 30
days following a partys delivery of a written notice of a Dispute, setting
forth in reasonable detail the circumstances and basis for the Dispute
("Notice of Dispute"), the Dispute shall be determined by binding arbitration
in accordance with the rules for commercial arbitration of the American
Arbitration Association then in effect (subject to any contrary provision in
this Agreement). Judgment upon the award shall be final and may be entered
in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The place of arbitration shall be
Houston, Texas. The arbitrators shall determine the arbitrability of any and
all Disputes arising out of or related to this Agreement, including the
existence, validity, and scope of this agreement to arbitrate. The
arbitrator(s) shall be qualified by education, experience, or training to
decide the matters in the Dispute. The arbitrator(s) shall apply any
statutes of limitations applicable under Texas law to the claims and defenses
asserted in the Dispute Delivery of the Notice of Dispute shall toll the
running of any applicable statutes of limitations. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, in the event that a Dispute requires emergency relief before the
matter may be resolved pursuant to the arbitration provisions provided
herein, the provisions of this Section 13.4 shall not prohibit an action for
injunctive or other forms of ancillary relief or a writ of mandamus filed in
connection with such Dispute; _provided_ , _ however_ , the arbitration
provisions provided herein shall still govern the resolution of the Dispute.

  



  

All negotiations and any arbitration relating to a Dispute, including any
Notice of Dispute, settlement, arbitral award, decision, or order, documents
exchanged or produced, and any briefs or other documents prepared for the
arbitration, are confidential and may not be disclosed by any party, their
employees, officers, directors, counsel, consultants, and expert witnesses,
except to the extent necessary to enforce any settlement agreement or
arbitration award, to enforce rights of a party, as required by law
or regulation, or for a bona fide business purpose, such as disclosure
to accountants, shareholders, or third-party purchasers; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that breach of this confidentiality provision shall not void any
settlement or award.

  



  

## 13.5 ENFORCEMENT OF AGREEMENT

  

## 

  

### (a) Each Seller acknowledges and agrees that Buyer would be irreparably
damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement are not performed in
accordance with their specific terms and that any breach of this Agreement by
such Seller could not be adequately compensated in all cases by monetary
damages alone. Accordingly, in addition to any other right or remedy to which
Buyer may be entitled, at law or in equity, it shall be entitled to enforce
any provision of this Agreement by a decree of specific performance and to
temporary, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief to prevent breaches or
threatened breaches of any of the provisions of this Agreement, without
posting any bond or other undertaking.

  

###

or other undertaking.

  

### 

  

## 13.6 WAIVER; REMEDIES CUMULATIVE

  

## 

  

The rights and remedies of the parties to this Agreement are cumulative and
not alternative. Neither any failure nor any delay by any party in exercising
any right, power or privilege under this Agreement or any of the documents
referred to in this Agreement will operate as a waiver of such right, power
or privilege, and no single or partial exercise of any such right, power or
privilege will preclude any other or further exercise of such right, power or
privilege or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. To the
maximum extent permitted by applicable law, (a) no claim or right arising out
of this Agreement or any of the documents referred to in this Agreement can
be discharged by one party, in whole or in part, by a waiver or renunciation
of the claim or right unless in writing signed by the other party; (b) no
waiver that may be given by a party will be applicable except in the specific
instance for which it is given; and (c) no notice to or demand on one party
will be deemed to be a waiver of any obligation of that party or of the right
of the party giving such notice or demand to take further action
without notice or demand as provided in this Agreement or the documents
referred to in this Agreement.

  



  

## 13.7 ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND MODIFICATION

of intent, exclusivity agreement and any confidentiality agreement between

documents delivered pursuant to this Agreement) a complete and exclusive
statement of the terms of the agreement between the parties with respect to
its subject matter. None of this Agreement, the Seller Disclosure Letter or

modified except by a written agreement executed by the party to be charged
with the amendment.

under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other parties;
_provided_ , _however_ that Buyer may assign its rights or delegate its
obligations hereunder to any Person that is directly or indirectly controlled
by him, and upon the later of any such Assignment or the payment of the

obligations under this Agreement.  Subject to the preceding sentence, this

benefit of the successors and permitted assigns of the parties. Except such
rights as shall inure to a successor or permitted assignee pursuant to this
Section 13.8, nothing expressed or referred to in this Agreement will
be construed to give any Person other than the parties to this Agreement any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or with respect to this
Agreement or any provision of this Agreement, including, with respect to any

for any specified period or of any nature or kind whatsoever.
