pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) thereof, but that such exemption does not exempt
the issuance of securities upon the delivery of Newmont Shares covered by such
securities; therefore, the underlying Newmont Shares issuable in respect of
the Replacement RSUs, if any, cannot be issued in the U.S. or to a person in
the U.S. in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided by Section
3(a)(10) and the Replacement RSUs may only be issued pursuant to an effective
registration statement or a then available exemption from the registration
requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state securities laws,
if any.

 



 

 **2.12** **Arrangement and Effective Date**

 



 

The Arrangement shall become effective on the date upon which Goldcorp and
Newmont agree in writing as the Effective Date or, in the absence of such
agreement, five Business Days

 



     

 

 



 

following the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to completion of the
Arrangement set out in Article 6 (excluding any conditions that, by their
terms, cannot be satisfied until the Effective Date, but subject to the
satisfaction or, where not prohibited, waiver of those conditions as of the
Effective Date by the applicable Party or Parties for whose benefit such
conditions exist) and the Arrangement (and the Articles of Arrangement) shall
be effective at the Effective Time on the Effective Date and will have all of
the effects provided by applicable Law. The closing of the Arrangement will
take place at the offices of Goodmans LLP on the Effective Date in Toronto,
Ontario at the Effective Time, or at such other time and place as may be
agreed to by the Parties.

 



 

 **2.13** **Payment of Consideration**

 



 

Newmont will, following receipt by Goldcorp of the Final Order and prior to
the Effective Time, deposit in escrow with the Depositary (the terms and
conditions of such escrow to be satisfactory to the Parties, acting
reasonably) sufficient funds and Newmont Shares to satisfy the aggregate
Consideration payable to Goldcorp Shareholders pursuant to the Plan of
Arrangement.

 



 

 **2.14** **Announcement and Shareholder Communications**

 



 

The Parties agree to issue a joint press release with respect to this
Agreement as soon as practicable after its due execution. Newmont and Goldcorp
agree to cooperate in the preparation of presentations, if any, to Newmont
Stockholders and Goldcorp Securityholders regarding the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. Each Party shall: (a) not issue any press
release or otherwise make public statements with respect to this Agreement or
the Arrangement without the consent of the other Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed; and (b) not make any
filing with any Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement or the
Arrangement without the consent of the other Party, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. Each Party shall enable the
other Party to review and comment on all such press releases prior to the
release thereof and shall enable the other Party to review and comment on such
filings prior to the filing thereof (other than with respect to confidential
information contained in such filing); provided, however, that the foregoing
shall be subject to each Partys overriding obligation to make any disclosure
or filing in accordance with applicable Laws, including U.S. Securities Laws,
and if such disclosure or filing is required and the other Party has not
reviewed or commented on the disclosure or filing, the Party making such
disclosure or filing shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give prior
oral or written notice to the other Party, and if such prior notice is not
possible, to give such notice immediately following the making of such
disclosure or filing. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not
prevent either Party from making internal announcements to employees and
having discussions with shareholders and financial analysts and other
stakeholders so long as the content of such statements and announcements are
consistent with and limited in all material respects to the content contained
in the most recent press releases, public disclosures or public statements
made by the Parties. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the provisions of this
Section 2.14 related to the approval or contents of filings with Governmental
Entities will not apply with respect to filings in connection with the
Regulatory Approvals, the Goldcorp Circular, the Newmont Proxy Statement, the
Interim Order or the Final Order which are governed by other sections of this
Agreement. The restrictions set forth in this Section 2.14 shall not apply to
any release or public

 



     

 

 



 

statement in connection with any dispute regarding this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

 **2.15** **Withholding Taxes**

 



 

Newmont, Goldcorp, any of their affiliates and the Depositary, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or direct any other Person to deduct
and withhold on their behalf, from any amounts otherwise payable, issuable or
otherwise deliverable to any Goldcorp Shareholders (including in their
capacity as former Goldcorp Equity Award Holders), Goldcorp Equity Award
Holders and any other Person under the Plan of Arrangement such amounts as are
required or reasonably believed to be required to be deducted and withheld
from such amounts under any provision of any Law in respect of Taxes. To the
extent any such amounts are so deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be
treated for all purposes under this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made. To the extent that the amount so required to be deducted
or withheld from any amounts payable, issuable or otherwise deliverable to a
Person under the Plan of Arrangement exceeds the amount of cash otherwise
payable to such Person, Newmont, Goldcorp, any of their affiliates and the
Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise dispose, or direct any
other Person to sell or otherwise dispose, of such portion of the non-cash
consideration or non-cash amounts payable, issuable or otherwise deliverable
hereunder to such Person as is necessary to provide sufficient funds to
Newmont, Goldcorp, any of their affiliates and the Depositary, as the case may
be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or withholding requirement and
Newmont, Goldcorp, any of their affiliates and the Depositary, as applicable,
shall notify the relevant Person of such sale or other disposition and remit
to such Person any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale or other
disposition (after deduction for (x) the amounts required to satisfy the
required withholding under the Plan of Arrangement in respect of such Person,
(y) reasonable commissions payable to the broker and (z) other reasonable
costs and expenses).

 



 

 **2.16** **Adjustment of Consideration**

 



 

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, between
the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, the issued and outstanding
Newmont Shares shall have been changed into a different number of shares by
reason of any split or consolidation of the issued and outstanding Newmont
Shares, then the Consideration to be paid per Goldcorp Share shall be
appropriately adjusted to provide to Goldcorp Shareholders the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement and the Arrangement prior to such
action and as so adjusted shall, from and after the date of such event, be the
Consideration to be paid per Goldcorp Share.

 



 

(b) If on or after the date hereof, Goldcorp declares, sets aside or pays any
dividend or other distribution to the Goldcorp Shareholders of record as of a
time prior to the Effective Time, except for Goldcorps current regular
quarterly dividend paid to Goldcorp shareholders in the ordinary course
consistent with past practice, Newmont shall make such adjustments to the
Consideration as it determines acting in good faith to be necessary to restore
the original agreement of the parties

 



     

 

 



 

in the circumstances. For greater certainty, if Goldcorp takes any of the
actions referred to above, the aggregate Consideration to be paid by Newmont
shall be decreased by an equivalent amount.

 



 

 **2.17** **Name Change and Governance and Transitional Matters**

 



 

Newmont covenants with Goldcorp that it will take all actions necessary to
ensure that, as of the Effective Time:

 



 

(a) two-thirds of the members of the Newmont Board shall be existing members
of the Newmont Board and one-third of the members of the Newmont Board shall
be existing members of the Goldcorp Board;

 



 

(b) the Deputy Chair of the Newmont Board shall be Ian Telfer; and

 



 

(c) the name of Newmont will be changed to "Newmont Goldcorp Corporation".

including, for the avoidance of doubt, the taking of any action or the
entering into of any transaction, including any merger, acquisition, joint

or other legal, regulatory or other Proceedings against itself or any of its
Subsidiaries challenging or affecting this Agreement or the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) appeal, overturn or have lifted or
rescinded any

 



     

 

 



 

injunction or restraining order or other order, including Orders, relating to
itself or any of its Subsidiaries which may materially adversely affect the
ability of the Parties to consummate the Arrangement; and (iii) appeal or
overturn or otherwise have lifted or rendered non-applicable in respect of the
Arrangement, any Law that makes consummation of the Arrangement illegal or
otherwise prohibits or enjoins Goldcorp or Newmont from consummating the
Arrangement; and

 **5.6** **Covenants Relating to Goldcorp Employment Matters**

 



 

(a) The Parties and the Goldcorp Board (and any relevant committee thereof)
will take such actions (including all actions permitted under the Goldcorp
Equity Incentive Plans) as are necessary such that, from and after the
Effective Time:

 



 

(i) each Goldcorp Phantom RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall remain outstanding on its existing terms, and
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any applicable grant letter,
employment agreement or other document governing, or any resolution or
determination of the Goldcorp Board (or any committee thereof) in respect of,
the Goldcorp Phantom RSU Plan or any Goldcorp Phantom RSUs, pursuant to the
definition of "Share Value" contained in the Goldcorp Phantom RSU Plan, the
Committee (as defined therein) shall irrevocably determine that the "Share
Value" (as defined in the Goldcorp Phantom RSU Plan) shall mean the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the trading price of a Newmont Share on the NYSE
at the close of business on the date of expiry of the Restricted Period (as
defined in the Goldcorp Phantom RSU Plan), by (B) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio.

 



 

(ii) each Goldcorp PSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall remain outstanding on its existing terms, and notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in any applicable PSU Agreement (as defined in the
Goldcorp PSU Plan), employment agreement or other document governing, or any
resolution or determination of the Goldcorp Board (or any committee thereof)
in respect of, the Goldcorp PSU Plan or any Goldcorp PSUs:

 



 

(A) the Multiplier (as defined in the Goldcorp PSU Plan) for each Goldcorp PSU
shall be deemed to be 100 percent; and

 



 

(B) pursuant to the definition of "Fair Market Value" contained in the
Goldcorp PSU Plan, the Board (as defined therein) shall irrevocably determine
that "Fair Market Value" (as defined in the Goldcorp PSU Plan) shall mean, on
a particular day, the product

 



     

 

 



 

obtained by multiplying (A) the volume weighted average price of the Newmont
Shares on the NYSE for the 30 trading day period prior to and including the
particular day, by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(iii) pursuant to, and subject to the terms of, the Plan of Arrangement, each
Goldcorp RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
be exchanged (which exchange the Parties intend shall occur, and shall be
deemed to have occurred, in accordance with subsection 7(1.4) of the Tax Act)
for a Newmont RSU that has the same vesting conditions as the Goldcorp RSU for
which it was exchanged and that entitles the holder thereof to receive, upon
vesting thereof and in accordance with the terms of the Newmont Incentive
Plan, a number of Newmont Shares equal to the product obtained by multiplying
(A) the applicable number of Goldcorp Shares covered by such Goldcorp RSU
immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Equity Award Exchange
Ratio; provided that any fraction of a Newmont Share that such holder would be
entitled to receive (after aggregating all Newmont Shares issuable to such
holder in respect of all such holders Newmont RSUs that vest on a particular
date date) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole number. The award
agreement in respect of each such Newmont RSU will, and will be deemed to,
provide that the Committee (as defined in the Newmont Incentive Plan) shall
not have the discretion to pay cash in settlement of any such Newmont RSU
(notwithstanding the terms of the Newmont Incentive Plan) and that such any
such Newmont RSU will only be settled in Newmont Shares (subject to the terms
and conditions of the Newmont RSU and the Newmont Incentive Plan).

 



 

(iv) pursuant to the Plan of Arrangement, each Goldcorp Option that is
outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (whether vested or
unvested) shall be assigned and transferred by the holder thereof to Goldcorp
in exchange for the consideration set forth in the Plan of Arrangement.

 



 

(v) As soon as practicable following the date hereof, the Company shall take
all actions with respect to the Goldcorp ESPP that are necessary to provide
that: (i) with respect to any offering period in effect as of the date hereof
(the " **Current ESPP Offering Period** "), no employee who is not a
participant in the Goldcorp ESPP as of the date hereof may become a
participant in the Goldcorp ESPP and no participant may increase the
percentage amount of his or her payroll deduction election from that in effect
on the date hereof such for Current ESPP Offering Period; (ii) subject to the
Arrangement becoming effective, the Goldcorp ESPP shall terminate effective
immediately prior to the Effective Time; (iii) if the Current ESPP Offering
Period terminates prior to the Effective Time, then the Goldcorp ESPP shall be
suspended and no new offering period shall be

 



     

 

 



 

commenced under the Goldcorp ESPP prior to the termination of this Agreement;
and (iv) if any Current ESPP Offering Period is still in effect at the
Effective Time, then the last day of such Current ESPP Offering Period shall
be accelerated to a date before the Closing Date and the final purchases of
Goldcorp Shares thereunder shall be made on that day.

 



 

(b) The Parties acknowledge that the Arrangement will result in a "change in
control" (or a term of similar import) for purposes of Goldcorps executives,
Goldcorp Benefit Plans, and employees employment agreements. After the
Effective Time, Newmont covenants and agrees to cause Goldcorp and any
successor to Goldcorp, to honour and comply in all material respects with the
terms of all existing employment, indemnification, change in control, change
of control, severance, termination or other compensation arrangements and
employment and severance obligations of Goldcorp or any of its Subsidiaries
that were entered into prior to the date of this Agreement in the ordinary
course of business (or, if not in the ordinary course of business, have been
disclosed to Newmont).

(a) Newmont and Goldcorp shall and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries,
as applicable, to:

 



 

(i) within ten Business Days after the date of this Agreement or such other

written undertakings to the Minister or his designees;

 



 

(iv) file, as promptly as practicable after the date of this Agreement, any
other filings or notifications under any other applicable Antitrust Laws that

documents, data and other things requested by any Governmental Entity or that
are necessary or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable following any such
request.

 



 

(b) All filing fees (including any Taxes thereon) in respect of any filing
made to any Governmental Entity in respect of any Regulatory Approvals shall
be shared by the Parties equally.

 



 

(c) With respect to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, each of Newmont and
Goldcorp shall cooperate with one another and shall provide such assistance as
any other Party may reasonably request in connection with obtaining the
Regulatory Approvals. In particular:

 



 

(i) no Party shall extend or consent to any extension of any applicable
waiting or review period or enter into any agreement with a Governmental
Entity to not consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
except upon the prior written consent of the other Party;

 



 

(ii) the Parties shall exchange drafts of all submissions, material
correspondence, filings, presentations, applications, plans, consent
agreements and other material documents made or submitted to or filed with any
Governmental Entity in respect of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, will consider in good faith any suggestions made by the other Party
and its counsel and will provide the other Party and its counsel with final
copies of all such material submissions, correspondence, filings,
presentations, applications, plans, consent agreements and other material
documents, and all pre-existing business records or other documents, submitted

contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that (x) this obligation

to the Investment Canada Act Approval, and (y) information indicated by either
Party to be competitively sensitive, in either case, which information shall
be provided on an external counsel-only basis;

 



 

(iii) each Party will keep the other Party and their respective counsel fully
apprised of all substantive written (including email) and oral

 



      

 

 



 

communications and all meetings with any Governmental Entity and their staff
in respect of the Regulatory Approvals, and will not participate in such
material communications or meetings without giving the other Party and their
respective counsel the opportunity to participate therein; provided, however,
that (x) this obligation shall not extend to communications and meetings or
portions of communications and meetings related to the Investment Canada Act
Approval, and (y) where competitively sensitive information may be discussed
or communicated, in either case the other Partys external legal counsel shall
be provided with any such communications or information on an external
counsel-only basis and shall have the right to participate in any such
meetings on an external counsel-only basis.

 



 

(iv) Goldcorp shall make available its Representatives, on the reasonable
request of Newmont and its counsel, to assist Newmont in obtaining the
Regulatory Approvals, including by (i) making introduction and arranging
meetings with key stakeholders and leaders of Governmental Authorities and
participating in those meetings, (ii) providing strategic input, including on
any materials prepared for obtaining the Regulatory Approvals, and (iii)
responding promptly to requests for support, documents, information, comments
or input where reasonably requested by Newmont in connection with the
Regulatory Approvals;

 



 

(d) the Parties shall not enter into any transaction, investment, agreement,
arrangement or joint venture or take any other action, the effect of which
would reasonably be expected to make obtaining the Regulatory Approvals
materially more difficult or challenging, or reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of the Regulatory Approvals;

 



 

(e) the Parties shall use (and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to
use) their respective reasonable best efforts to take or cause to be taken all
actions necessary or advisable on their respective parts to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable after
the date of this Agreement. To the extent that the Minister or his designees
propose any amendments or require enhancements to such proposed undertakings
contemplated in Section 5.7(a)(iii), Newmont shall propose, negotiate and
enter into reasonable undertakings necessary to obtain the Investment Canada
Act Approval. However, nothing in this Agreement shall require Newmont or its
Subsidiaries to (i) propose, negotiate, effect or agree to, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, transfer, divestiture, license or
other disposition of any assets or businesses of Newmont or Goldcorp or their
respective Subsidiaries or otherwise take any action that prohibits or limits
Newmonts freedom of action with respect to, or Newmonts ability to own,
retain, control, operate or exercise full rights of ownership with respect to
any of the businesses or assets of Newmont, Goldcorp or their respective
Subsidiaries, except as provided in this paragraph with respect to the
obtaining of the

 



     

 

 



 

Investment Canada Act Approval or (ii) notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in Section 5.5(c), defend any judicial or administrative action or
similar proceeding instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any Person
under any Law or seeking to have any stay, restraining order, injunction or
similar order entered by any Governmental Entity vacated, lifted, reversed, or
overturned.

 



 

(f) Subject to the other provisions of this Section 5.7, Newmont shall, acting
reasonably, determine and direct all matters and efforts related to the
obtaining of the Regulatory Approvals. Newmont shall consider the views and
input of Goldcorp in good faith.

 



 

 **5.8** **Certain Goldcorp Covenants Regarding Non-Solicitation**

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5.8, Goldcorp shall
not, and Goldcorp shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
other Representatives, not to:

 



 

(i) solicit, assist, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate
(including by way of furnishing confidential information or entering into any
form of agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than a confidentiality
agreement pursuant to Section 5.8(e)) any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to a
Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) enter into, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Newmont and its
Subsidiaries or affiliates) in respect of any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to a
Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal, it being acknowledged and agreed that, provided
Goldcorp is then in compliance with its obligations under this Section 5.8,
Goldcorp may (x) advise any Person of the restrictions of this Agreement, (y)
advise a Person who has submitted a written Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal of
the conclusion (without further communication) that its Goldcorp Acquisition
Proposal does not constitute a Goldcorp Superior Proposal or (z) communicate
with any person solely for the purposes of clarifying the terms of any
inquiry, proposal or offer made by such person;

 



 

(iii) accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking relating to any Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 5.8(e));

 



 

(iv) (1) (i) fail to make, or withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Newmont or fail to publicly reaffirm (without qualification) the
Goldcorp Board Recommendation, or its recommendation of the Arrangement within
five Business Days (and in any case prior to the

 



     

 

 



 

Goldcorp Meeting) after having been requested in writing by Newmont to do so
(acting reasonably), or (ii) accept, approve, endorse or recommend a Goldcorp
Acquisition Proposal (or publicly propose to do so), or (iii) take no position
or a neutral position with respect to a Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal for more
than five Business Days after the public announcement of such Goldcorp
Acquisition Proposal; or (2) resolve or propose to take any of the foregoing
actions ((1) or (2) each a " **Goldcorp Change in Recommendation** "); or

 



 

(v) make any public announcement or take any other action inconsistent with
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability of the Goldcorp
Board of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Goldcorp shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,
immediately cease any existing solicitation, discussions, negotiations or
other activities commenced prior to the date of this Agreement with any Person
(other than Newmont and its Subsidiaries or affiliates) conducted by Goldcorp
or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives with respect to any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
constitute or lead to, a Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection
therewith, Goldcorp will discontinue access to and disclosure of its and its
Subsidiaries confidential information (and not allow access to or disclosure
of any such confidential information, or any data room, virtual or otherwise)
and shall as soon as possible request, and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to exercise all rights it has (or cause its Subsidiaries to exercise
any rights that they have) to require the return or destruction of all
confidential information regarding Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries previously
provided in connection therewith to any Person other than Newmont to the
extent such information has not already been returned or destroyed and use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such obligations are fulfilled.

 



 

(c) Goldcorp represents and warrants as of the date of this Agreement that
neither Goldcorp nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any standstill,
confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or
restriction to which Goldcorp or any of its Subsidiaries is a Party, except to
permit submissions of expressions of interest prior to the date of this
Agreement. Goldcorp covenants and agrees that (i) it shall enforce each
standstill, confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar
agreement or restriction to which Goldcorp or any of its Subsidiaries is a
party, and (ii) neither Goldcorp nor any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective Representatives has (within the last 12 months) or will, without
the prior written consent of Newmont (which may be withheld or delayed in
Newmonts sole and absolute discretion), release any Person from, or waive,
amend, suspend or otherwise modify such Persons obligations respecting
Goldcorp, or any of its Subsidiaries, under any standstill, confidentiality,
non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or restriction to
which Goldcorp or any of its Subsidiaries is a party; provided, however, that
the Parties acknowledge and agree that the automatic termination or

 



     

 

 



 

release of any such standstill, confidentiality, non-disclosure, business
purpose, use or similar agreement or restriction in accordance with its terms
shall not be a breach of this Section 5.8(c).

 



 

(d) Goldcorp shall as soon as practicable, and in any event, within 24 hours,
notify Newmont (orally at first and then in writing, in each case within 24
hours) if it receives or otherwise becomes aware of any inquiry, proposal or
offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute or lead
to a Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal, of such Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, proposal or offer, including the identity of the Person making such
Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material
terms and conditions thereof and copies of all material or substantive
documents received in respect of, from or on behalf of any such Person.
Goldcorp shall keep Newmont promptly and fully informed of the material
developments and discussions and negotiations with respect to such Goldcorp
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, including any material
changes, modifications or other amendments thereto.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time
following the date of this Agreement, and prior to the Goldcorp Shareholder
Approval having been obtained, Goldcorp receives a request for material non-
public information or to enter into discussions, from a Person that proposes
to Goldcorp an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.8 (and which has not been
withdrawn) and the Goldcorp Board determines, in good faith after consultation
with its outside financial and legal advisors, that such Goldcorp Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a Goldcorp
Superior Proposal (disregarding, for the purposes of such determination, any
due diligence or access condition to which such Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal
is subject), then, and only in such case, Goldcorp may (x) enter into,
participate in, facilitate and maintain discussions or negotiations with, and
otherwise cooperate with or assist, the Person making such Goldcorp
Acquisition Proposal, and (y) provide the Person making such Goldcorp
Acquisition Proposal with, or access to, confidential information regarding
Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries, but only to the extent that Newmont had
previously been, or is concurrently, provided with, or access to, the same
information, if, and only if:

 



 

(i) Goldcorp has entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement on
terms no less favourable in aggregate to Goldcorp than the Confidentiality
Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) Goldcorp has been, and continues to be, in material compliance with this
Section 5.8.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Goldcorp shall not
make a Goldcorp Change in Recommendation unless all of the following are
satisfied:

 



     

 

 



 

(i) the Goldcorp Board has determined that the Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal
constitutes a Goldcorp Superior Proposal;

 



 

(ii) the Goldcorp Shareholder Approval has not been obtained;

 



 

(iii) Goldcorp has been, and continues to be, in material compliance with this
Section 5.8;

 



 

(iv) Goldcorp has promptly provided Newmont with a notice in writing that
there is a Goldcorp Superior Proposal, together with all documentation related
to and detailing the Goldcorp Superior Proposal, including a copy of any
proposed agreement relating to such Goldcorp Superior Proposal;

 



 

(v) five Business Days (the " **Newmont Response Period** ") shall have
elapsed from the date Newmont received the notice and documentation referred
to in Section 5.8(f)(iv) from Goldcorp;

 



 

(vi) if Newmont has proposed to amend the terms of the Arrangement in
accordance with Section 5.8, the Goldcorp Board shall have determined, in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors, that
the Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal remains a Goldcorp Superior Proposal
compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement by Newmont,
if applicable.

 



 

(g) For greater certainty, notwithstanding any Goldcorp Change in
Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
its terms, Goldcorp shall cause the Goldcorp Meeting to occur and the
Arrangement Resolution to be put to the Goldcorp Shareholders thereat for
consideration in accordance with this Agreement, and Goldcorp shall not,
except as required by applicable Law, submit to a vote of its shareholders any
Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal other than the Arrangement Resolution prior to
the termination of this Agreement.

 



 

(h) Goldcorp acknowledges and agrees that, during the Newmont Response Period
or such longer period as Goldcorp may approve for such purpose, Newmont shall
have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of
this Agreement, including an increase in, or modification of, the
Consideration. The Goldcorp Board will review any such proposal to determine
in good faith whether Newmonts proposal to amend the Agreement would result
in the Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal ceasing to be a Goldcorp Superior
Proposal. If the Goldcorp Board determines that the Goldcorp Acquisition
Proposal is not a Goldcorp Superior Proposal as compared to the proposed
amendments to the terms of the Agreement, it will promptly advise Newmont and
enter into an amended agreement with Newmont reflecting such proposed
amendments. If the Goldcorp Board continues to believe in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal remains a Goldcorp Superior Proposal and
therefore rejects Newmont offer to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement,
if any, Goldcorp may, subject to

 



     

 

 



 

compliance with the other provisions hereof, make a Goldcorp Change of
Recommendation. Each successive modification of any Goldcorp Acquisition
Proposal shall constitute a new Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal for the purposes
of this Section 5.8 and Newmont shall be afforded a new Newmont Response
Period in respect of each such Goldcorp Acquisition Proposal from the date on
which Newmont received the notice and documentation referred to in Section
5.8(f)(iv) in respect of such new Goldcorp Superior Proposal from Goldcorp.

 



 

(i) In circumstances where Goldcorp provides Newmont with notice of a Goldcorp
Superior Proposal and all documentation contemplated by Section 5.8(f)(iv) on
a date that is less than seven Business Days prior to the Goldcorp Meeting,
Goldcorp may, or if and as requested by Newmont, Goldcorp shall, either
proceed with or postpone the Goldcorp Meeting to a date that is not more than
seven Business Days after the scheduled date of such Goldcorp Meeting, as
directed by Newmont, provided, however, that the Goldcorp Meeting shall not be
adjourned or postponed to a date later than the seventh Business Day prior to
the Outside Date.

 



 

(j) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Goldcorp shall advise
its Subsidiaries and its Representatives of the prohibitions set out in this
Section 5.8 and any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.8 by Goldcorp, its Subsidiaries or Representatives is deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.8 by Goldcorp.

 



 

 **5.9** **Certain Newmont Covenants Regarding Non-Solicitation**

 



 

(a) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Section 5.9, Newmont shall
not, and Newmont shall cause its Subsidiaries and their respective directors,
officers, employees, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
other Representatives, not to:

 



 

(i) solicit, assist, initiate, knowingly encourage or otherwise facilitate
(including by way of furnishing confidential information or entering into any
form of agreement, arrangement or understanding (other than a confidentiality
agreement pursuant to Section 5.9(e)) any inquiry, proposal or offer that
constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute or lead to a Newmont
Acquisition Proposal;

 



 

(ii) enter into, engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any
discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than Goldcorp and its
Subsidiaries or affiliates) in respect of any inquiry, proposal or offer that

Acquisition Proposal, it being acknowledged and agreed that, provided Goldcorp
is then in compliance with its obligations under this Section 5.8, Newmont may
(x) advise any Person of the restrictions of this Agreement, (y) advise a
Person who has submitted a written Newmont Acquisition Proposal of the
conclusion (without further communication) that its

 



     

 

 



 

Newmont Acquisition Proposal does not constitute a Goldcorp Superior Proposal
or (z) communicate with any person solely for the purposes of clarifying the
terms of any inquiry, proposal or offer made by such person;

 



 

(iii) accept or enter into, or publicly propose to accept or enter into, any
letter of intent, agreement in principle, agreement, arrangement or
undertaking relating to any Newmont Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement pursuant to Section 5.8(e));

 



 

(iv) (1) (i) fail to make, or withdraw, amend, modify or qualify, in a manner
adverse to Goldcorp or fail to publicly reaffirm (without qualification) the
Newmont Board Recommendation within five Business Days (and in any case prior
to the Newmont Meeting) after having been requested in writing by Goldcorp to
do so (acting reasonably), or (ii) accept, approve, endorse or recommend a
Newmont Acquisition Proposal (or publicly propose to do so), or (iii) take no
position or a neutral position with respect to a Newmont Acquisition Proposal
for more than five Business Days after the public announcement of such Newmont
Acquisition Proposal; or (2) resolve or propose to take any of the foregoing
actions ((1) or (2) each a " **Newmont Change in Recommendation** "); or

 



 

(v) make any public announcement or take any other action inconsistent with
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability of the Newmont
Board of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



 

(b) Newmont shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and Representatives to,
immediately cease any existing solicitation, discussions, negotiations or
other activities commenced prior to the date of this Agreement with any Person
(other than Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries or affiliates) conducted by Newmont
or any of its Subsidiaries or Representatives with respect to any inquiry,
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to
constitute or lead to, a Newmont Acquisition Proposal, and, in connection
therewith, Newmont will discontinue access to and disclosure of its and its
Subsidiaries confidential information (and not allow access to or disclosure
of any such confidential information, or any data room, virtual or otherwise)
and shall as soon as possible request, and use its commercially reasonable
efforts to exercise all rights it has (or cause its Subsidiaries to exercise
any rights that they have) to require the return or destruction of all
confidential information regarding Newmont and its Subsidiaries previously
provided in connection therewith to any Person other than Goldcorp to the
extent such information has not already been returned or destroyed and use
commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that such obligations are fulfilled.

 



 

(c) Newmont represents and warrants as of the date of this Agreement that
neither Newmont nor any of its Subsidiaries has waived any standstill,
confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or
restriction to which Newmont or any of its Subsidiaries is a Party, except to
permit submissions of

 



     

 

 



 

expressions of interest prior to the date of this Agreement. Newmont covenants
and agrees that (i) it shall enforce each standstill, confidentiality, non-
disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or restriction to which
Newmont or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, and (ii) neither Newmont nor
any of its Subsidiaries nor any of their respective Representatives has
(within the last 12 months) or will, without the prior written consent of
Goldcorp (which may be withheld or delayed in Goldcorps sole and absolute
discretion), release any Person from, or waive, amend, suspend or otherwise
modify such Persons obligations respecting Newmont, or any of its
Subsidiaries, under any standstill, confidentiality, non-disclosure, business
purpose, use or similar agreement or restriction to which Newmont or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party; provided, however, that the Parties acknowledge
and agree that the automatic termination or release of any such standstill,
confidentiality, non-disclosure, business purpose, use or similar agreement or
restriction in accordance with its terms shall not be a breach of this Section
5.8(c).

 



 

(d) Newmont shall as soon as practicable, and in any event, within 24 hours,
notify Goldcorp (orally at first and then in writing, in each case within 24
hours) if it receives or otherwise becomes aware of any inquiry, proposal or
offer that constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute or lead
to a Newmont Acquisition Proposal, of such Newmont Acquisition Proposal,
inquiry, proposal or offer, including the identity of the Person making such
Newmont Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer and the material
terms and conditions thereof and copies of all material or substantive
documents received in respect of, from or on behalf of any such Person.
Newmont shall keep Goldcorp promptly and fully informed of the material
developments and discussions and negotiations with respect to such Newmont
Acquisition Proposal, inquiry, proposal or offer, including any material
changes, modifications or other amendments thereto.

 



 

(e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if at any time
following the date of this Agreement, and prior to the Newmont Stockholder
Approval having been obtained, Newmont receives a request for material non-
public information or to enter into discussions, from a Person that proposes
to Newmont an unsolicited _bona fide_ written Newmont Acquisition Proposal
that did not result from a breach of this Section 5.9 (and which has not been
withdrawn) and the Newmont Board determines, in good faith after consultation
with its outside financial and legal advisors, that such Newmont Acquisition
Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to constitute a Newmont
Superior Proposal (disregarding, for the purposes of such determination, any
due diligence or access condition to which such Newmont Acquisition Proposal
is subject), then, and only in such case, Newmont may (x) enter into,
participate in, facilitate and maintain discussions or negotiations with, and
otherwise cooperate with or assist the Person making such Newmont Acquisition
Proposal, and (y) provide the Person making such Newmont Acquisition Proposal
with, or access to, confidential information regarding Newmont and its
Subsidiaries, but only to the extent that Goldcorp had

 



     

 

 



 

previously been, or is concurrently, provided with, or access to, the same
information, if, and only if:

 



 

(i) Newmont has entered into a confidentiality and standstill agreement on
terms no less favourable in aggregate to Newmont than the Confidentiality
Agreement; and

 



 

(ii) Newmont has been, and continues to be, in material compliance with this
Section 5.9.

 



 

(f) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, Newmont shall not
make a Newmont Change in Recommendation unless all of the following are
satisfied:

 



 

(i) the Newmont Board has determined that the Acquisition Proposal constitutes
a Superior Proposal;

 



 

(ii) the Newmont Stockholder Approval has not been obtained;

 



 

(iii) Newmont has been, and continues to be, in material compliance with this
Section 5.9;

 



 

(iv) Newmont has promptly provided Goldcorp with a notice in writing that
there is a Newmont Superior Proposal, together with all documentation related
to and detailing the Newmont Superior Proposal, including a copy of any
proposed agreement relating to such Newmont Superior Proposal;

 



 

(v) five Business Days (the " **Goldcorp Response Period** ") shall have
elapsed from the date Goldcorp received the notice and documentation referred
to in Section 5.9(f)(iv) from Newmont; and

 



 

(vi) if Goldcorp has proposed to amend the terms of the Arrangement in
accordance with Section 5.9(h), the Newmont Board shall have determined, in
good faith, after consultation with its outside financial and legal advisors,
that the Newmont Acquisition Proposal remains a Newmont Superior Proposal
compared to the proposed amendment to the terms of the Arrangement by
Goldcorp, if applicable.

 



 

(g) For greater certainty, notwithstanding any Newmont Change in
Recommendation, unless this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with
its terms, Newmont shall cause the Newmont Meeting to occur and the Newmont
Resolutions to be put to the Newmont Stockholders thereat for consideration in
accordance with this Agreement, and Newmont shall not, except as required by
applicable Law, submit to a vote of its shareholders any Newmont Acquisition
Proposal other than the Newmont Resolutions prior to the termination of this
Agreement.

 



     

 

 



 

(h) Newmont acknowledges and agrees that, during the Goldcorp Response Period
or such longer period as Newmont may approve for such purpose, Goldcorp shall
have the opportunity, but not the obligation, to propose to amend the terms of
this Agreement, including a modification of the Consideration. The Newmont
Board will review any such proposal to determine in good faith whether
Goldcorps proposal to amend the Agreement would result in the Newmont
Acquisition Proposal ceasing to be a Newmont Superior Proposal. If the Newmont
Board determines that the Newmont Acquisition Proposal is not a Newmont
Superior Proposal as compared to the proposed amendments to the terms of the
Agreement, it will promptly advise Goldcorp and enter into an amended
agreement with Goldcorp reflecting such proposed amendments. If the Newmont
Board continues to believe in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Newmont Acquisition
Proposal remains a Newmont Superior Proposal and therefore rejects Goldcorp
offer to amend this Agreement and the Arrangement, if any, Newmont may,
subject to compliance with the other provisions hereof, make a Newmont Change
in Recommendation. Each successive modification of any Newmont Acquisition
Proposal shall constitute a new Newmont Acquisition Proposal for the purposes
of this Section 5.9 and Newmont shall be afforded a new Goldcorp Response
Period in respect of each such Newmont Acquisition Proposal from the date on
which Goldcorp received the notice and documentation referred to in Section
5.9(f)(iv) in respect of such new Newmont Superior Proposal from Newmont.

 



 

(i) In circumstances where Newmont provides Goldcorp with notice of a Newmont
Superior Proposal and all documentation contemplated by Section 5.9(f)(iv) on
a date that is less than seven Business Days prior to the Newmont Meeting,
Newmont may, or if and as requested by Goldcorp, Newmont shall, either proceed
with or postpone the Newmont Meeting to a date that is not more than seven
Business Days after the scheduled date of such Newmont Meeting, as directed by
Goldcorp, provided, however, that the Newmont Meeting shall not be adjourned
or postponed to a date later than the seventh Business Day prior to the
Outside Date.

 



 

(j) Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Newmont shall advise its
Subsidiaries and its Representatives of the prohibitions set out in this
Section 5.9 and any violation of the restrictions set forth in this Section
5.9 by Newmont, its Subsidiaries or Representatives is deemed to be a breach
of this Section 5.9 by Newmont.

 



 

 **5.10** **Access to Information; Confidentiality**

 



 

(a) From the date hereof until the earlier of the Effective Time and the
termination of this Agreement pursuant to its terms, subject to compliance
with applicable Laws, each of Newmont and Goldcorp shall, and shall cause its
Representatives to, afford to the other and its representatives such access as
the other Party may reasonably require at all reasonable times, to its
officers, employees, agents,

 



      

 

 



 

properties, books, records and contracts, and shall furnish the other Party
with all data and information as it may reasonably request; _provided_ that
the Party furnishing data or information (the " **Furnishing Party** ") shall
not be required to (or to cause any of the Furnishing Partys Subsidiaries to)
afford such access or furnish such information to the extent that the
Furnishing Party believes, in its reasonable good faith judgment, that doing
so would (A) result in the loss of attorney-client, work product or other
privilege, (B) result in the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties
or violate any obligations of the Furnishing Party or any of the Furnishing
Partys Subsidiaries with respect to confidentiality to any third party, or
otherwise breach, contravene or violate any such effective Contract to which
the Furnishing Party or any Subsidiary of the Furnishing Party is a party or
(C) breach, contravene or violate any applicable Law; _provided_ that the
Furnishing Party shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause such
information to be provided in a manner that would not violate the foregoing,
and provided that nothing in this section shall limit the obligations
contained in Section 5.7.

 



 

(b) Newmont and Goldcorp acknowledge and agree that information furnished
pursuant to this Section 5.10 shall be subject to the terms and conditions of
the Confidentiality Agreement. Any such investigation by a Party and its
representatives shall not mitigate, diminish or affect the representations and
warranties of the other Party contained in this Agreement or any document or
certificate given pursuant hereto.

 



 

 **5.11** **Insurance and Indemnification**

 



 

(a) Prior to the Effective Time, Goldcorp shall purchase customary "tail"
policies of directors and officers liability insurance from a reputable and
financially sound insurance carrier and containing terms and conditions no
less favourable in the aggregate to the protection provided by the policies
maintained by Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries which are in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Date and providing protection in respect of claims
arising from facts or events which occurred on or prior to the Effective Time
and Goldcorp will and will cause its Subsidiaries to, maintain such "tail"
policies in effect without any reduction in scope or coverage for six years
from the Effective Time; provided, that Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries shall
not be required to pay any amounts in respect of such coverage prior to the
Effective Time and provided further that the cost of such policies shall not
exceed 250% of Goldcorps current annual aggregate premium for policies
currently maintained by Goldcorp or its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(b) Goldcorp will, and will cause its Subsidiaries to, honour all rights to
indemnification or exculpation now existing in favour of present and former
employees, officers and directors of Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries under Law
and under the articles or other constating documents of Goldcorp and/or its
Subsidiaries or under any agreement or contract of any indemnified person with
Goldcorp or with any of its Subsidiaries, and acknowledges that such rights
shall survive the completion of the Plan of Arrangement, and, to the extent
within the

 



     

 

 



 

control of Goldcorp, Goldcorp shall ensure that the same shall not be amended,
repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would adversely affect any
right thereunder of any such indemnified person and shall continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms for a period of not less than
six years from the Effective Date.

 



 

(c) From and following the Effective Time, Newmont will cause Goldcorp to
comply with its obligations under Section 5.11(a) and Section 5.11(b).

 



 

(d) If Newmont, Goldcorp or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person
and is not a continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such
consolidation or merger, or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, Newmont shall ensure that any such
successor or assign (including, as applicable, any acquirer of substantially
all of the properties and assets of the Company or its subsidiaries) assumes
all of the obligations set forth in this Section 5.11.

 



 

(e) The provisions of this Section 5.11 are intended for the benefit of, and
shall be enforceable by, each insured or indemnified Person, his or her heirs
and his or her legal representatives and, for such purpose, Goldcorp hereby
confirms that it is acting as trustee on their behalf, and agrees to enforce
the provisions of this Section 5.11 on their behalf. Furthermore, this Section
5.11 shall survive the termination of this Agreement as a result of the
occurrence of the Effective Date for a period of six years.

 



 

 **5.12** **Pre-Acquisition Reorganization**

 



 

(a) Subject to Section 5.12(b), Goldcorp agrees that, upon request of Newmont,
Goldcorp shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (i) perform such
reorganizations of its corporate structure, capital structure, business,
operations and assets or such other transactions as Newmont may request prior
to the Effective Date, acting reasonably (each a " **Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization** "), and the Plan of Arrangement, if required, shall be
modified accordingly, and (ii) cooperate with Newmont and its advisors to
determine the nature of the Pre-Acquisition Reorganizations that might be
undertaken and the manner in which they would most effectively be undertaken.

 



 

(b) Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries will not be obligated to participate in any
Pre-Acquisition Reorganization under Section 5.12(a) unless such Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization in the opinion of Goldcorp, acting reasonably:

 



 

(i) cannot reasonably be expected to result in any Taxes being imposed on, or
any adverse Tax consequences to the Goldcorp Shareholders incrementally
greater than the Taxes to such party in connection with the consummation of
the Arrangement in the absence of any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization;

 



     

 

 



 

(ii) is not prejudicial to Goldcorp or its securityholders in any material
respect;

 



 

(iii) does not require Goldcorp to obtain the approval of securityholders of
Goldcorp or proceed absent any required consent of any third party (including
any Regulatory Approval);

 



 

(iv) does not unreasonably interfere with Goldcorps material operations prior
to the Effective Time;

 



 

(v) does not require Goldcorp or its Subsidiaries to contravene any Contract,
Regulatory Approval or applicable Laws, or its organization documents;

 



 

(vi) can be completed immediately prior to the Effective Date; and

 



 

(vii) does not impair the ability of Goldcorp to consummate, and will not
prevent or materially delay the consummation of, the Arrangement, and would
not reasonably be expected to prevent any Person from making a Goldcorp
Superior Proposal.

 



 

(c) Newmont must provide written notice to Goldcorp of any proposed Pre-
Acquisition Reorganization in reasonable written detail at least ten Business
Days prior to the Effective Date. Upon receipt of such notice, Goldcorp and
Newmont shall work cooperatively and use their best efforts to prepare prior
to the Effective Time all documentation necessary and do such other acts and
things as are necessary to give effect to such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization,
including any amendment to this Agreement or the Plan of Arrangement and shall
seek to have any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization made effective as of the
last moment of the Business Day ending immediately prior to the Effective Date
(but after Newmont has waived or confirmed that all of the conditions set out
in Section 6.1 and Section 6.2 have been satisfied).

 



 

(d) Unless the Arrangement is not completed due to a breach by Goldcorp of the
terms and conditions of this Agreement or in circumstances that would give
rise to the payment by Goldcorp of a Goldcorp Termination Fee, Newmont agrees
that it will be responsible for all reasonable costs and expenses associated
with any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization, including professional fees and
expenses and Taxes, to be carried out at its request and shall indemnify and
save harmless Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages,
Taxes, claims, costs, expenses, interest awards, judgments and penalties
suffered or incurred by any of them in connection with or as a result of any
such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization (including in respect of any unwinding,
reversal, modification or termination of a Pre-Acquisition Reorganization) and
that any Pre-Acquisition Reorganization will not be considered in determining
whether a representation or warranty of Goldcorp under this Agreement has been
breached (including where any such Pre-Acquisition Reorganization requires the
consent of any third party under a

 



     

 

 



 

Contract). If the Arrangement is not completed (other than due to a breach by
Goldcorp of the terms and conditions of this Agreement or in circumstances
that would give rise to the Payment by Goldcorp of a Goldcorp Termination
Fee), Newmont shall reimburse Goldcorp forthwith for all reasonable fees and
expenses (including any professional fees and expenses and Taxes) incurred by
Goldcorp in considering or effecting all or any part of the Pre-Acquisition
Reorganization.

 



 

 **5.13** **Financing Cooperation**

 



 

(a) Goldcorp agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide, and to
cause each of its Subsidiaries and each of their respective Representatives to
provide, such cooperation as may be reasonably requested by Newmont in
connection with the borrowing or an issuance of debt by Newmont and/or any
liability management transaction (including, without limitation, any exchange
offers, consent solicitations or tender offers) with respect to debt existing
on the date hereof of Goldcorp or its Subsidiaries (collectively, a " **Debt
Financing** "), including, without limitation to, upon reasonable notice: (i)
provide assistance with any discussions of and/or furnish, as applicable, such
business, financial statements, pro forma financials, projections, management
discussion and analysis and other customary financial data and information
(including diligence materials) reasonably required in connection with any
Debt Financing, (ii) direct their respective independent accountants to
provide customary and reasonable assistance in connection with any Debt
Financing, including in connection with providing customary comfort letters
and consents, (iii) obtain customary payoff letters, releases of liens and
other instruments of termination or discharge reasonably requested by Newmont
in connection with the repayment of debt of Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries
(provided that the effectiveness of any such arrangements shall be contingent
on the completion of the Arrangement) and (iv) authorize and facilitate
discussions, meetings and other engagement by Newmont, its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates with the current lenders, noteholders or other providers of
existing indebtedness to Goldcorp or any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose
of obtaining Debt Financing, including by necessary or appropriate waivers of
the Confidentiality Agreement to permit such activities. Newmont shall
reimburse Goldcorp for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs or expenses incurred
by Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries in connection with cooperation provided for
in this Section 5.13 to the extent the information requested was not otherwise
prepared or available in the ordinary course of business.

 



 

(b) Prior to the Effective Date, none of Goldcorp, its Subsidiaries or its or
their respective Representatives shall be required to take any action that:
(i) would contravene any applicable Law or any agreement that relates to
borrowed money to which Goldcorp or any of its subsidiaries are a party: (ii)
would reasonably be expected to impair or prevent the satisfaction of any
condition in Article 6 hereof; or (iii) would subject such Person to actual or
potential liability, to bear any cost or expense or to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or make any other payment or incur any other liability or
provide or agree to provide any indemnity

 



     

 

 



 

in connection with any Debt Financing or their performance of their respective
obligations under this Section 5.13 or any information utilized in connection
therewith (except, in the case of this paragraph (iii) in respect of Goldcorp
and its Subsidiaries, to the extent such liability, cost, expense or indemnity
is conditional upon the occurrence of the Effective Time). Newmont shall
indemnify and hold harmless Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries and their respective
Representatives from and against any and all costs suffered or incurred by
them in connection with any Debt Financing and the performance of their
respective obligations under this Section 5.13 and any information utilized in
connection therewith (other than arising from information provided by Goldcorp
or its Subsidiaries specifically for use in the Financing pursuant to Section
5.13). Goldcorp hereby consents to the use of the logos of Goldcorp or its
Subsidiaries in connection with any Debt Financing; provided, that such logos
are used solely in a manner that is not intended to or reasonably likely to
harm or disparage Goldcorp or any of its Subsidiaries or the reputation or
goodwill of Goldcorp or any of its Subsidiaries.

 



 

(c) Newmont acknowledges and agrees that the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement is not conditioned upon the consummation of, or
the receipt by Newmont of the proceeds of, the Debt Financing.

agreement to be complied with or satisfied by either Party prior to or at the
Effective Date.

 



 

 **6.6** **Frustration of Conditions**

 



 

Neither Newmont nor Goldcorp may rely on the failure of any condition set
forth in Section 6.1, Section 6.2 or Section 6.3, as applicable, to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such Partys breach in any material
respect of any provision of this Agreement or failure in any material respect
to use the standard of efforts required from such Party to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 7.3 are payments of liquidated damages which are a genuine pre-
estimate of the damages which the other Party entitled to such damages will
suffer or incur as a result of the event giving rise to such payment and the
resultant termination of this Agreement and are not penalties. Each Party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to raise as a defence that any such
liquidated damages are excessive or punitive. For greater certainty, each
Party agrees that, upon any termination of this Agreement under circumstances
where Goldcorp or Newmont is entitled to a Termination Fee and such
Termination Fee is paid in full, Goldcorp or Newmont, as the case may be,
shall be precluded from any other remedy against the other Party at Law or in
equity or otherwise (including, without limitation, an order for specific
performance), and shall not seek to obtain any recovery, judgment, or damages
of any kind, including consequential, indirect, or punitive damages, against
the other Party or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
directors, officers, employees, partners, managers, members, shareholders or
affiliates or their respective representatives in connection with this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that the foregoing
limitation shall not apply in the event of fraud or wilful breach of this
Agreement by a Party.

 

 **7.4** **Amendment**

 



 

Subject to the provisions of the Interim Order, the Plan of Arrangement and
applicable Laws, this Agreement and the Plan of Arrangement may, at any time
and from time to time before or after the holding of the Goldcorp Meeting but
not later than the Effective Time, be amended by mutual written agreement of
the Parties, without further notice to or authorization on the part of
Goldcorp Shareholders, and any such amendment may without limitation:

 



 

(a) change the time for performance of any of the obligations or acts of the
Parties;

 



 

(b) waive any inaccuracies or modify any representation or warranty contained
herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto;

 



 

(c) waive compliance with or modify any of the covenants herein contained and
waive or modify performance of any of the obligations of the Parties; and/or

 



 

(d) waive compliance with or modify any mutual conditions precedent herein
contained.

 



 

 **7.5** **Waiver**

 



 

Any Party may: (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or acts of the other Party; (b) waive compliance, except as
provided herein, with any of the other Partys agreements or the fulfilment of
any conditions to its own obligations contained herein; or (c) waive
inaccuracies in any of the other Partys representations or warranties
contained herein or in any document delivered by the other Party; provided,
however, that any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party and, unless otherwise
provided in the written waiver, will be limited to the specific breach or

 



     

 

 



 

condition waived. A Partys failure or delay in exercising any right under
this Agreement will not operate as a waiver of that right. A single or partial
exercise of any right will not preclude a Party from any other or further
exercise of that right or the exercise of any other right.

 **8.3** **Injunctive Relief**

 



 

Subject to Section 7.3(f), the Parties agree that irreparable harm would occur

with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Accordingly, the Parties
agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach of this Agreement
by a Party, the non-breaching Party will be entitled, without the requirement
of posting a bond or other security, to equitable relief, including injunctive
relief and specific performance, and the Parties shall not object to the
granting of injunctive or other equitable relief on the basis that there
exists an adequate remedy at law. Subject to Section 7.3(f), such remedies

this Agreement is not intended to and shall not confer upon any Person other
than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder. This Agreement shall be

to Newmont under this Agreement, or any other document delivered in connection
with the transactions contemplated hereby on behalf of Goldcorp.

 



 

 **8.7** **Severability**

 



 

If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law or public policy, that
provision will be severed from this Agreement and all other conditions and
provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full force and
effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the transactions
contemplated hereby is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any
Party. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid,
illegal or incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good
faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the

this Agreement. Each Party hereto (a) certifies that no representative, agent
or attorney of any other Party has represented, expressly

 



     

 

 



 

or otherwise, that such Party would not, in the event of any action, suit or
proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver and (b) acknowledges that it
and the other Parties hereto have been induced to enter into this Agreement,
by, among other things, the mutual waiver and certifications in this Section
8.8.

 



 

 **8.9** **Third Party Beneficiaries**

 



 

The provisions of Section 5.11 are: (i) intended for the benefit of all
present and former directors and officers of Goldcorp and its Subsidiaries, as
and to the extent applicable in accordance with their terms, and shall be
enforceable by each of such Persons and his or her heirs, executors
administrators and other legal representatives (collectively, the " **Third
Party Beneficiaries** ") and Goldcorp shall hold the rights and benefits of
Section 5.11 in trust for and on behalf of the Third Party Beneficiaries and
Goldcorp hereby accepts such trust and agrees to hold the benefit of and
enforce performance of such covenants on behalf of the Third Party
Beneficiaries; and (ii) in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other
rights that the Third Party Beneficiaries may have by contract or otherwise.
Except as provided in this Section 8.9, this Agreement shall not confer any
rights or remedies upon any Person other than the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

 



 

 **8.10** **Counterparts, Execution**

notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any applicable grant letter,

(ii) pursuant to the determination of the Board (as defined therein) pursuant
to Section 5.6(a)(ii) of the Arrangement Agreement, "Fair Market Value" (as

obtained by multiplying (A) the volume weighted average price of the Newmont
Shares on the NYSE for the 30 trading day period prior to and including the
particular day, by (B) the Equity Award Exchange Ratio.

 



 

(f) Each Goldcorp RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be deemed to be exchanged by the holder thereof in accordance with
subsection 7(1.4) of the Tax Act, without any further act of formality on its
part, for a Replacement RSU that has the same vesting conditions as the
Goldcorp RSU for which it was exchanged and that entitles the holder thereof
to receive, upon vesting thereof and in accordance with the terms of the
Newmont Incentive Plan, a number of Newmont Shares equal to the product
obtained by multiplying (A) the applicable number of Goldcorp Shares covered
by such Goldcorp RSU immediately prior to the Effective Time by (B) the Equity
Award Exchange Ratio; provided that any fraction of a Newmont Share that such
holder would be entitled to receive (after aggregating all Newmont Shares
issuable to such holder in respect of all such holders Replacement RSUs that
vest on a particular date date) shall be rounded down to the nearest whole
number, and:

 



 

(i) the holder thereof shall cease to be, and shall be deemed to cease to be,
the holder of each such Goldcorp RSU and the name of such holder shall be, and

Replacement RSU will be reduced such that (i) the excess (if any) of the
aggregate fair market value of the Newmont Shares underlying such holders
Replacement RSU immediately following the exchange over the aggregate exercise
price (if any) of such Replacement RSU does not exceed (ii) the excess (if
any) of the aggregate fair market value of the Goldcorp Shares underlying the
holders corresponding Goldcorp RSU immediately before the exchange over the
aggregate exercise price (if any) of such Goldcorp RSU; and

 



 

(iv) the Committee (as defined in the Newmont Incentive Plan) irrevocably
elects to settle all Replacement RSUs solely in consideration for Newmont
Shares, the Award Agreement (as defined in the Newmont Incentive Plan) in
respect of each such Replacement RSU will, and will be deemed to, provide that
the Committee (as defined in the Newmont Incentive Plan) shall not have the
discretion to pay cash in settlement of any Replacement RSU (notwithstanding
the terms of the Newmont Incentive Plan), and such Replacement RSUs are, and
are deemed to be, a right to acquire Newmont Shares (subject to the terms and
conditions of the Replacement RSU and the Newmont Incentive Plan).

 



 

The events provided for in this Section 3.1 will be deemed to occur on the
Effective Date, notwithstanding that certain procedures related thereto may
not be completed until after the Effective Date.

 



 

 **3.2** **No Fractional Shares**

 



 

(a) In no event shall any Goldcorp Shareholder be entitled to a fractional
Newmont Share. Where the aggregate number of Newmont Shares to be issued to a
Goldcorp Shareholder as consideration under the Arrangement would result in a
fraction of a Newmont Share being issuable, the number of Newmont Shares to be
received by such Goldcorp Shareholder shall be rounded down to the nearest
whole Newmont Share. In lieu of any such fractional Newmont Share, each
Goldcorp Shareholder otherwise entitled to a fractional interest in a Newmont
Share will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to an amount
representing such Goldcorp Shareholders proportionate interest in the net
proceeds from the sale by the Depositary on behalf of all such Goldcorp
Shareholders of the Newmont Excess Shares. Section 3.1(f) herein, sets forth
the treatment of any fraction of a Newmont Share that a former holder of
Goldcorp RSUs outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be
entitled to receive upon vesting of the applicable Replacement RSU and in
accordance with the terms of the Newmont Incentive Plan.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) As promptly as practicable following the Effective Time, the Depositary
shall determine the excess of (i) the number of Newmont Shares issued and
delivered to the Depositary pursuant to Article 5 representing the
Consideration Shares over (ii) the aggregate number of whole Consideration
Shares to be issued to Goldcorp Shareholders pursuant to Section 3.1(c) (such
excess the " **Newmont Excess Shares** "). Following the Effective Time, the
Depositary shall, on behalf of the former Goldcorp Shareholders, sell the
Newmont Excess Shares at the then prevailing prices on the NYSE. The sale of
the Newmont Excess Shares by the Depositary shall be executed on the NYSE
through one or more members firms of the NYSE and shall be executed in round
lots to the extent applicable. The Depositary shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to complete the sale of the Newmont Excess Shares as
promptly following the Effective Time as is practicable, consistent with
obtaining the best execution of such sales in light of prevailing market
conditions. Until the net proceeds of such sale or sales have been distributed
to former Goldcorp Shareholders, the Depositary shall hold such proceeds in
trust for such former Goldcorp Shareholders (the " **Newmont Share Trust** ").
The amount of all commissions, transfer taxes and other out-of-pocket
transaction costs, including expenses and compensation of the Depositary
incurred in connection with such sale of Newmont Excess Shares shall be paid
by Newmont. The Depositary shall determine the portion of the Newmont Share
Trust to which each former Goldcorp Shareholder is entitled, if any, by
multiplying the amount of the aggregate net proceeds composing the Newmont
Share Trust by a fraction, the numerator of which is the amount of the
fractional share interest to which such former Goldcorp Shareholder is
entitled (after taking into account all Goldcorp Shares held as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time by such former Goldcorp Shareholder) and the
denominator of which is the aggregate amount of fractional Newmont Shares to
which all former Goldcorp Shareholders are entitled.

 



 

(c) As soon as practicable after the determination of the amount of cash, if
any, to be paid to former Goldcorp Shareholders with respect to any fractional
Newmont Shares, the Depositary shall make available such amounts to such
former Goldcorp Shareholders.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 4 
DISSENT RIGHTS**

 



 

 **4.1** **Dissent Rights**

 



 

(a) In connection with the Arrangement, each registered Goldcorp Shareholder

Goldcorp Shares held by such Goldcorp Shareholder pursuant to Section 185 of
the OBCA, as modified by the Interim Order, the Final Order and this Section
4.1(a); provided that, notwithstanding Section 185(6) of the OBCA, the written
objection to the Arrangement Resolution referred to in Section 185(6) of the
OBCA must be received by Goldcorp not later than 4:00 p.m. (Toronto time) two
Business Days immediately preceding the date of the Goldcorp Meeting.
Dissenting Shareholders who are:

 



      

 

 



 

(i) ultimately entitled to be paid by Newmont the fair value for their Dissent
Shares (A) shall be deemed to not to have participated in the transactions in

and assigned such Dissent Shares (free and clear of any Liens) to Newmont in
accordance with Section 3.1(a); (C) will be entitled to be paid the fair value
of such Dissent Shares by Newmont, which fair value, notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained in the OBCA, shall be determined as of the close of
business on the day before the Arrangement Resolution was adopted at the
Goldcorp Meeting; and (D) will not be entitled to any other payment or
consideration, including any payment that would be payable under the
Arrangement had such holders not exercised their Dissent Rights in respect of
such Goldcorp Shares; or

 



 

(ii) ultimately not entitled, for any reason, to be paid by Newmont the fair
value for their Dissent Shares, shall be deemed to have participated in the
Arrangement in respect of those Goldcorp Shares on the same basis as a non-
dissenting Goldcorp Shareholder and shall be entitled to receive only the
Consideration from Newmont in the same manner as such non-Dissenting
Shareholders.

 



 

(b) In no event shall Newmont or Goldcorp or any other Person be required to
recognize a Dissenting Shareholder as a registered or beneficial owner of
Goldcorp Shares or any interest therein (other than the rights set out in this
Section 4.1) at or after the Effective Time, and as at the Effective Time the
names of such Dissenting Shareholders shall be deleted from the central
securities register of Goldcorp.

 



 

(c) For greater certainty, in addition to any other restrictions in the
Interim Order and under Section 185 of the OBCA, none of the following shall
be entitled to exercise Dissent Rights: (i) Goldcorp Shareholders who vote or
have instructed a proxyholder to vote such Goldcorp Shares in favour of the
Arrangement Resolution (but only in respect of such Goldcorp Shares), (ii)
holders of Goldcorp Options, Goldcorp RSUs, Goldcorp PSUs and Goldcorp Phantom
RSUs, and (iii) any other Person who is not a registered holder of Grizzles
Shares as of the record date for the Goldcorp Meeting.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 5 
DELIVERY OF CONSIDERATION**

 



 

 **5.1** **Certificates and Payments**

 



 

(a) Following receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Time,
Newmont shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Depositary sufficient
funds and Newmont Shares to satisfy the aggregate Consideration payable to the
Goldcorp Shareholders in accordance with Section 3.1, which cash and Newmont
Share shall be held by the Depositary as agent and nominee for such former
Goldcorp Shareholders for distribution to such former Goldcorp Shareholders in
accordance with the provisions of this Article 5.

 



     

 

 



 

(b) Upon surrender to the Depositary for cancellation of a certificate which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding Goldcorp
Shares that were transferred pursuant to Section 3.1(c), together with a duly
completed and executed Letter of Transmittal and any such additional documents
and instruments as the Depositary may reasonably require, the registered
holder of the Goldcorp Shares represented by such surrendered certificate
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor, and the Depositary shall
deliver to such Goldcorp Shareholder the Consideration that such Goldcorp
Shareholder has the right to receive under the Arrangement for such Goldcorp
Shares, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3, and any certificate
so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.

 



 

(c) After the Effective Time and until surrendered for cancellation as
contemplated by Section 5.1(b), each certificate that immediately prior to the
Effective Time represented one or more Goldcorp Shares (other than Goldcorp
Shares held by Newmont or any of its affiliates) shall be deemed at all times
to represent only the right to receive in exchange therefor the Consideration
that the holder of such certificate is entitled to receive in accordance with
Section 3.1, less any amounts withheld pursuant to Section 5.3.

 



 

(d) Following receipt of the Final Order and prior to the Effective Time,
Goldcorp shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Depositary (unless the
parties otherwise agree) sufficient funds to satisfy the aggregate amount of
cash payable to the holders of the Goldcorp Options in accordance with Section
3.1, which cash shall be held by the Depositary as agent and nominee for such
former holder of Goldcorp Options for distribution to such former holder of
Goldcorp Options in accordance with the provisions of this Article 5\. The
delivery of such funds to the Depositary following receipt of the Final Order
and prior to the Effective Time shall constitute full satisfaction of the
rights of former holders of Goldcorp Options and such former holders of
Goldcorp Options shall have no claim against Goldcorp or Newmont except to the
extent that the funds delivered by Goldcorp to the Depositary (except to the
extent such funds are withheld in accordance with Section 5.3) are
insufficient to satisfy the amounts payable to such former holders of Goldcorp
Options or are not paid by the Depositary to such former holders of Goldcorp
Options in accordance with the terms hereof. As soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the Depositary shall pay or cause to be paid the amounts, less
applicable withholdings, to be paid to former holders of Goldcorp Options
pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, at the
election of Goldcorp, Goldcorp shall be entitled to pay the cash payable to
the former holders of the Goldcorp Options pursuant to Section 3.1(b) through
its payroll service provider following the Effective Date.

 



 

 **5.2** **Lost Certificates**

 



 

In the event any certificate which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented one or more outstanding Goldcorp Shares that were transferred
pursuant to Section 3.1(c) shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such certificate to
be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Depositary will issue in exchange for such

 



     

 

 



 

lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, the Consideration deliverable in
accordance with such holders duly completed and executed Letter of
Transmittal. When authorizing such payment in exchange for any lost, stolen or
destroyed certificate, the Person to whom such cash is to be delivered shall
as a condition precedent to the delivery of such Consideration, give a bond
satisfactory to Newmont and the Depositary (acting reasonably) in such sum as
Newmont may direct, or otherwise indemnify Newmont and Goldcorp in a manner
satisfactory Newmont and Goldcorp, acting reasonably, against any claim that
may be made against Newmont and Goldcorp with respect to the certificate
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 



 

 **5.3** **Withholding Rights**

 



 

Newmont, Goldcorp, any of their affiliates and the Depositary, as applicable,
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold, or direct any other Person to deduct
and withhold on their behalf, from any amounts otherwise payable, issuable or
otherwise deliverable to any Goldcorp Securityholders and/or any other Person
under this Plan of Arrangement such amounts as are required or reasonably
believed to be required to be deducted and withheld from such amounts under
any provision of the Tax Act, the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986
or any provision of any other Law. To the extent any such amounts are so
deducted and withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes under
this Plan of Arrangement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which
such deduction and withholding was made. To the extent that the amount so
required to be deducted or withheld from any amounts payable, issuable or
otherwise deliverable to a Person under this Plan of Arrangement exceeds the
amount of cash otherwise payable to such Person, Newmont, Goldcorp, any of
their affiliates and the Depositary are hereby authorized to sell or otherwise
dispose, or direct any other Person to sell or otherwise dispose, of such
portion of the non-cash consideration or non-cash amounts payable, issuable or
otherwise deliverable hereunder to such Person as is necessary to provide
sufficient funds to Newmont, Goldcorp, any of their affiliates and the
Depositary, as the case may be, to enable it to comply with such deduction or
withholding requirement and Newmont, Goldcorp, any of their affiliates and the
Depositary, as applicable, shall notify the relevant Person of such sale or
other disposition and remit to such Person any unapplied balance of the net
proceeds of such sale or other disposition (after deduction for (x) the
amounts required to satisfy the required withholding under the Plan of
Arrangement in respect of such Person, (y) reasonable commissions payable to
the broker and (z) other reasonable costs and expenses).

 



 

 **5.4** **Distributions with respect to Unsurrendered Share Certificates**

 



 

No dividend or other distribution declared or made after the Effective Time
with respect to Newmont Shares with a record date after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to the holder of any unsurrendered certificate that,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, represented outstanding Goldcorp
Shares unless and until the holder of such certificate shall have complied
with the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2. Subject to applicable Law
and to Section 5.3, at the time of such compliance, there shall, in addition
to the delivery of Consideration to which such holder is thereby entitled, be
delivered to such holder, without interest, the amount of the dividend or
other distribution with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore
paid with respect to such Newmont Shares.

 



     

 

 



 

 **5.5** **Limitation and Proscription**

 



 

To the extent that a former Goldcorp Shareholder shall not have complied with
the provisions of Section 5.1 or Section 5.2 on or before the date that is six
years after the Effective Date (the " **final proscription date** "), then the
Consideration that such former Goldcorp Shareholder was entitled to receive
shall be automatically cancelled without any repayment of capital in respect
thereof and the Consideration to which such former Goldcorp Shareholder was
entitled, shall be delivered to Newmont by the Depositary and the Newmont
Shares forming part of the Consideration shall be deemed to be cancelled, and
the interest of the former Goldcorp Shareholder in such Newmont Shares (and
any dividend or other distribution referred to in Section 5.4) to which it was
entitled shall be terminated as of such final proscription date, and the
certificates formerly representing Goldcorp Shares shall cease to represent a
right or claim of any kind or nature as of such final proscription date. Any
payment made by way of cheque by the Depositary pursuant to this Plan of
Arrangement that has not been deposited or has been returned to the Depositary
or that otherwise remains unclaimed, in each case, on or before the final
proscription date shall cease to represent a right or claim of any kind or
nature and the right of any Goldcorp Shareholder to receive the Consideration
for Goldcorp Shares pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement shall terminate and
be deemed to be surrendered and forfeited to Newmont.

 



 

 **5.6** **No Liens**

 



 

Any exchange or transfer of securities pursuant to this Plan of Arrangement
shall be free and clear of any Liens or other claims of third parties of any
kind.

 



 

 **5.7** **Paramountcy**

 



 

From and after the Effective Time: (a) this Plan of Arrangement shall take
precedence and priority over any and all Goldcorp Shares issued prior to the
Effective Time; (b) the rights and obligations of the registered holders of

prior to or at the Goldcorp Meeting, with or without any other prior notice or

and, if required by the Court, by some or all of the Goldcorp Shareholders

accordance with the Arrangement Agreement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 7 
FURTHER ASSURANCES**

 



 

 **7.1** **Further Assurances**

 



 

Notwithstanding that the transactions and events set out in this Plan of
Arrangement shall occur and shall be deemed to occur in the order set out in
this Plan of Arrangement without any further act or formality, each of the
parties to the Arrangement Agreement shall make, do and execute, or cause to
be made, done and executed, all such further acts, deeds, agreements,
transfers, assurances, instruments or documents as may reasonably be required
by any of them in order further to document or evidence any of the
transactions or events set out in this Plan of Arrangement.

 



 

 **ARTICLE 8 
U.S. SECURITIES LAW EXEMPTION**

 



 

 **8.1**

 



 

Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, Goldcorp and Newmont
each agree that the Plan of Arrangement will be carried out with the intention
that, and they will use their commercially reasonable best efforts to ensure
that, all (i) Consideration Shares issued under the Arrangement will be issued
by Newmont in exchange for Goldcorp Shares and (ii) Replacement

 



     

 

 



 

RSUs to be issued to holders of Goldcorp RSUs in exchange for Goldcorp RSUs
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, pursuant to the Plan of
Arrangement, whether in the United States, Canada or any other country, in
reliance on the exemption from the registration requirements of the U.S.
Securities Act, as amended, as provided by Section 3(a)(10) thereof and
applicable state securities laws, and pursuant to the terms, conditions and
procedures set forth in the Arrangement Agreement. To the extent necessary,
Newmont shall, on or as promptly as practicable following the Effective Date,
file a registration statement on Form S-8 with the SEC to register the
issuance of Newmont Shares upon exercises of the Replacement RSUs. Newmont
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts ensure that the Consideration
Shares shall, at the Effective Time, either be registered or qualified under
all applicable U.S. state securities laws, or exempt from such registration
and qualification requirements. Holders of Goldcorp RSUs entitled to receive
Replacement RSUs will be advised that the Replacement RSUs issued pursuant to
the Arrangement have not been registered under the U.S. Securities Act and
will be issued by Newmont in reliance on the exemption from registration under
the U.S. Securities Act pursuant to Section 3(a)(10) thereof, but that such
exemption does not exempt the issuance of securities upon the exercises of
such securities; therefore, the underlying Newmont Shares issuable upon the
exercise of the Replacement RSUs, if any, cannot be issued in the U.S. or to a
person in the U.S. in reliance upon the exemption from registration provided
by Section 3(a)(10) and the Replacement RSUs may only be exercised pursuant to
an effective registration statement or a then available exemption from the
registration requirements of the U.S. Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws, if any.
