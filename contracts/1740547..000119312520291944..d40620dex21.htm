AGREEMENT

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the representations,

Parties agree as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.01 _The Merger_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, and pursuant to
Section 104H of the Companies Act 1981 of Bermuda, as amended (the " _Bermuda
Companies Act_ "), at the Effective Time, Merger Sub will be merged with and
into the Company (the " _Merger_ "). At the Effective Time, the separate
corporate existence of Merger Sub will cease and the Company will continue as
the surviving company in the Merger (the " _Surviving Company_ ").

 

Section 1.02 _Closing_. Subject to the provisions of _Article VII_ , the
closing (the " _Closing_ ") of the Merger will take place at the offices of
Jones Day, 3161 Michelson Drive, Irvine, California at 9:00 a.m., Pacific
time, on a date to be specified by the Company and Parent, which will be no
later than the fifth Business Day following the satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by Law) waiver by the Party or Parties entitled to the
benefits thereof of the conditions set forth in _Article VII_ (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of
those conditions), or at such other place, time and date as may be agreed in
writing between the Company and Parent. The date on which the Closing occurs
is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_."

Section 1.03 _Effective Time_. On the terms and subject to the conditions set
forth in this Agreement and the Statutory Merger Agreement, the Company,
Parent and Merger Sub will (a) on the Closing Date, execute and deliver the
Statutory Merger Agreement; (b) on or prior to the Closing Date, cause an
application for registration of the Surviving Company (the " _Merger
Application_ ") to be executed and delivered to the Registrar of Companies in
Bermuda (the " _Registrar_ ") as provided under Section 108 of the Bermuda
Companies Act and to be accompanied by the following documents required by
Section 108(2) of the Bermuda Companies Act: (i) a certified copy of the
resolutions of the Special Committee, board of directors of Merger Sub, and
the shareholders or other authority, if any, of Merger Sub and the Company;
(ii) a notice of the Merger containing the registered office address of the
Surviving Company, the memorandum of association of the Surviving Company, and
a statement confirming that the Surviving Company is to be registered as the
Surviving Company pursuant to the Merger; (iii) a statutory declaration by an
officer of each of Merger Sub and the Surviving Company that establishes to
the satisfaction of the Registrar that there are reasonable grounds for
believing that each merging company is, and the Surviving Company will be,
able to pay its liabilities as they become due, that the realizable value of
the Surviving Companys assets will not be less than the aggregate of its
liabilities and issued capital of all classes; and that either no creditor
will be prejudiced by the Merger, or adequate notices have been given to any
such creditor; and (c) cause to be included in the Merger Application
a request that the Registrar

 



2

    

 issue the certificate of merger with respect to the Merger (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ ") on the Closing Date at the time of day mutually
agreed upon by the Company and Parent and set forth in the Merger
Application. The Merger will become effective upon the issuance of the
Certificate of Merger by the Registrar or such other time and date as may be
set forth in the Certificate of Merger (the " _Effective Time_ "). The
Company, Parent, and Merger Sub agree that they will request that the
Registrar provide in the Certificate of Merger that the effective date of the
Merger be the Closing Date.

 

Section 1.04 _Effects_. The Merger will have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and Section 109(2) of the Bermuda Companies Act. Without limiting
the generality of the foregoing and subject thereto, at the Effective Time,
all of the property, rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises of
the Company and Merger Sub will vest in the Surviving Company, and all debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger Sub will become the debts,
Liabilities and duties of the Surviving Company.

 

Section 1.05 _Memorandum of Association and Bye-laws_. The memorandum of
association of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time will, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
further action, become the memorandum of association of the Surviving Company
until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law,
except that references to the name of Merger Sub will be replaced by
references to the name of the Surviving Company. The bye-laws of Merger Sub as
in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time will, at the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any further action, become the bye-
laws of the Surviving Company until thereafter changed or amended as
provided therein or by applicable Law, except that references to the name of
Merger Sub will be replaced by references to the name of the Surviving Company
(in each case, subject to _Section_ __ _ 6.04_).

 

Section 1.06 _Directors and Officers of Surviving Company_. The directors of
Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time, together with any
directors of the Company that Parent determines to appoint at the Effective
Time (subject to the agreement of such Persons to serve as directors of the
Surviving Company), will be the directors of the Surviving Company until
the earlier of their death, resignation or removal or until their respective
successors are duly elected and qualified, as the case may be. The officers of
the Company immediately prior to the Effective Time will be the officers of
the Surviving Company until the earlier of their death, resignation or
removal or until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and
qualified, as the case may be. If at any time after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Company determines, in its sole discretion, or is advised, that any
deeds, bills of sale, instruments of conveyance, assignments, assurances or
any other actions or things are necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Company its right, title or
interest in, to or under any of the rights, properties or assets of either of
the Company or Merger Sub acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Company
as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger or otherwise to carry
out this Agreement, then the officers and directors of the Surviving Company
will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of either
the Company or Merger Sub, all such deeds, bills of sale, instruments of
conveyance, assignments and assurances and to take and do, in the name and on
behalf of each of such companies or otherwise, all such other actions and
things as may be necessary or desirable to vest, perfect or confirm any and
all right, title or interest in, to and under such rights, properties or
assets in the Surviving Company or otherwise to carry out this Agreement.

ARTICLE II

 

EFFECT ON THE SHARE CAPITAL OF THE CONSTITUENT ENTITIES; EXCHANGE OF
CERTIFICATES

 

Section 2.01 _Effect on Share Capital_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or any holder of any of the common shares, par value $0.000037453 per
share, of the Company (the " _Common Shares_ ") or any of the common shares,
par value $0.000037453 per share, of Merger Sub (the " _Merger Sub Common
Shares_ "):

(a) _Cancellation of Shares_. Each Common Share owned by the Company as a
treasury share and each Common Share owned directly by any direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, in each case as of immediately prior
to the Effective Time (each an " _Excluded Share_ "), will be cancelled, be no
longer outstanding, and will automatically cease to exist, and no
consideration will be delivered in exchange therefor.

(b) _Shares to Remain Outstanding and Become Shares of the Surviving
Company_. Each Common Share that is owned directly by Parent as of immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each a " _Parent Owned Share_ ") will remain
outstanding and will constitute a common share of the Surviving Company. Each
Merger Sub Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time will remain outstanding and will constitute a common share of
the Surviving Company.

 

(c) _Cancellation of Common Shares_. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.02_ and
_Section_ __ _ 2.04_, each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time (other than (i) Excluded Shares, which will be
treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(a)_, (ii) Parent Owned Shares,
which will be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 2.01(b)_, and (iii)
Dissenting Shares, which will be treated in accordance with _Section_ __ _
2.03_), will be cancelled, be no longer outstanding, and will automatically
cease to exist, and, each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such Common Shares (each, a " _Certificate_
") and each holder of evidence in book-entry form that immediately prior to
the Effective Time represented any such Common Shares (" _Book-Entry Shares_
"), will cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to
receive $16.25 in cash, without interest, in respect of each such Common Share
(the " _Per Share Merger Consideration_ ").

(d) _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if between the Agreement
Date and the Effective Time, the outstanding Common Shares have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, by reason of any
issue, stock split, reverse stock split, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, consolidation or exchange of shares, or any similar event
has occurred, then any number or amount contained herein that is based upon
the number of Common Shares (including the Per Share Merger Consideration)
will be appropriately adjusted to provide to the holders of Common Shares,
Company Options, Company RSUs, SARs and Company Restricted Shares, as
applicable, the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior
to such event; _provided_ that nothing in this  _Section_ __ _ 2.01(d)_ will
be construed to permit the Company to take any action that is otherwise
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 

Section 2.02 _Exchange of Certificates; Payment Fund_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Merger Sub will, at its sole
cost and expense, appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to
the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment
and delivery of the aggregate amount of Per Share Merger Consideration payable
pursuant to this _Article II_ (the " _Aggregate Merger Consideration_ "). On
the Closing Date, Parent will cause Merger Sub to deposit with the Paying

 



4

    

 Agent for payment in accordance with this _Article II_ through the Paying
Agent, cash sufficient to pay the Aggregate Merger Consideration. All such
cash deposited with the Paying Agent is hereinafter referred to as the "
_Payment Fund_."

(b) _Letter of Transmittal_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event within 5 Business Days thereafter), the
Surviving Company will cause the Paying Agent to mail, or otherwise provide in
the case of Book-Entry Shares, to each holder of record of Common Shares in
respect of which the Per Share Merger Consideration is payable pursuant to
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(c)_ (i) a form of letter of transmittal in such form and
containing such other provisions as Parent may reasonably designate and as
are reasonably acceptable to the Company prior to the Effective Time (with
the Companys consent thereto not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed) (the " _Letter of Transmittal_ ") and which specifies that delivery
of such Common Shares will be effected and risk of loss and title will pass
(A) with respect to such Common Shares evidenced by Certificates, only upon
the proper delivery of the applicable Certificates and validly executed Letter
of Transmittal to the Paying Agent (and such other documents as the Paying
Agent may reasonably request) and (B) with respect to Book-Entry Shares, only
upon proper delivery of an "agents message" regarding the book-entry transfer
of Book-Entry Shares (or such other evidence, if any, of the transfer as the
Paying Agent may reasonably request), and (ii) instructions for effecting the
surrender of Book-Entry Shares or Certificates in exchange for the applicable
Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Common Shares
represented thereby.

(c) _Merger Consideration Received in Connection with Exchange_. Upon (i) in
the case of Common Shares represented by a Certificate, the surrender of such
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with the Letter of
Transmittal, duly, completely and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, or (ii) in the case of Common Shares held as Book-Entry
Shares, the receipt of an "agents message" by the Paying Agent, in each case
together with such other documents as reasonably may be required by the
Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificate or Book-Entry Shares will be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the consideration payable in respect
of the Common Shares previously represented thereby pursuant to  _Section_ __
_ 2.01_. In the event of a transfer of ownership of a Certificate or Book-
Entry Shares that has not been registered in the transfer records of the
Company, any Per Share Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Common
Shares previously represented thereby may be paid to the transferee or
transferees if the Certificate or Book-Entry Share representing such prior
Common Shares is presented to the Paying Agent (or, in the case of Book-Entry
Shares, proper evidence of such transfer) accompanied by all documents
required to evidence and effect such transfer and by evidence that any
applicable share transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as
contemplated by this  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(c)_, each Certificate and Book
Entry Share, including any prior Common Shares represented thereby, will, at
any time from and after the Effective Time, represent only the right to
receive upon such surrender the consideration that the holder of such
Certificate or Book Entry Share is entitled to receive from the Paying Agent
or the Surviving Company in respect of the prior Common Shares represented
thereby pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _ 2.02(c)_. No interest will be paid
or accrued on the cash payable upon surrender of the Certificates or Book-
Entry Shares.

 

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Common Shares_. The Per Share Merger
Consideration when actually paid in accordance with the terms of this
_Article II_ in respect of each cancelled Common Share and each Company Share
Award will be deemed to have been issued and paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to such Common Share or Company Share Award, as applicable.
From and after the Effective Time, there will be no further registration of
transfers on the share transfer books of the Surviving Company of Common
Shares or Company Share Awards that were outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective 

 



5

    

 Time. From and after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates (or
Book-Entry Shares) representing Common Shares outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will cease to have any rights with respect to such Common
Shares, except as otherwise provided for in this Agreement (including
_Section_ __ _ 2.01(c)_) or by applicable Law. If, after the Effective Time,
any Certificates formerly representing Common Shares (or Common Shares held
in book-entry form) are presented to Parent, the Surviving Company, or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they will be cancelled as provided in this
_Article II_ , with the holder thereof entitled to receive the Per Share
Merger Consideration payable in respect of the Common Shares represented
thereby pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and, in the case of Dissenting
Shares, subject to applicable Law.

 

(e) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including
any interest or any other amounts received with respect thereto) that remains
undistributed to the holders of Common Shares on the date that is 12 months
after the Effective Time may, upon Parents request, be delivered to the
Surviving Company (or its designee), and after any such delivery, any holder
of a Common Share who has not theretofore complied with this _Article II_ will
thereafter look only to the Surviving Company (subject to abandoned property,
escheat or other similar Laws) for payment of its claim for the Per Share
Merger Consideration payable with respect thereto, without any interest
thereon.

(f) _No Liability_. None of the Surviving Company, Parent, Merger Sub, or the
Paying Agent will be liable to any Person in respect of any portion of the
Payment Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat, or similar Law. Any other provision of this
Agreement notwithstanding, any portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration
to be paid in accordance with this _Article II_ that remains undistributed to
the holders of Certificates or Book-Entry Shares immediately prior to the date
on which such portion of the Aggregate Merger Consideration would otherwise
escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, will, to the
extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving
Company, free and clear of all claims or interests of any person previously
entitled thereto.

(g) _Investment of Payment Fund_. The Paying Agent will invest any cash
in the Payment Fund if and as directed by Merger Sub or the Surviving
Company. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments will be
paid to, and be the property of, the Surviving Company. No investment losses
resulting from any investment of the Payment Fund will diminish the rights of
any of the Companys shareholders to receive the portion of the Aggregate
Merger Consideration payable to them. To the extent there are losses with
respect to such investments or (subject to _Section_ __ _ 2.02(e)_) the
Payment Fund diminishes for any other reason below the level required to make
prompt cash payment of the aggregate funds required to be paid pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement, the Surviving Company will replace or restore the
cash in the Payment Fund so as to ensure that the Payment Fund is at all times
maintained at a level sufficient to make such cash payments.

 

(h) _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent, the Company, Merger Sub, the
Surviving Company and the Paying Agent (without duplication) will be entitled
to deduct and withhold from any amounts payable to any Person pursuant to this
Agreement such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with
respect to the making of such payment under applicable Law. Amounts so
withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority will be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person in
respect of which such deduction or withholding was made.

 

(i) _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by
Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond

 



6

    

 in such amount as Parent or the Paying Agent may determine is reasonably
necessary as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it or the
Surviving Company with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent (or, if
subsequent to the termination of the Payment Fund and subject to _Section_ __
_ 2.02(e)_, the Surviving Company) will deliver, in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate, the Per Share Merger Consideration
deliverable in respect of each Common Share represented thereby, pursuant to
this Agreement.

that the fair value of a Dissenting Share as appraised by the Supreme Court
of Bermuda under Section 106(6) of the Bermuda Companies Act (the " _Appraised
Fair Value_ ") is greater than the Per Share Merger Consideration, be entitled
to receive such difference from the Surviving Company by payment made within
30 days after such Appraised Fair Value is finally determined pursuant to such
appraisal procedure.

(b) In the event that a holder (i) fails to exercise any right to appraisal
within one month after the date the notice convening the Company Shareholders
Meeting has been given, or (ii) effectively withdraws or otherwise waives any
right to appraisal (each of the foregoing (i) or (ii), an " _Appraisal
Withdrawal_ "), such holder will have no other rights with respect to such
Dissenting Shares other than as contemplated by _Section_ __ _ 2.01_ and 
_Section_ __ _ 2.02_.

(c) The Company will give Parent (i) written notice of (A) any demands for
appraisal of Dissenting Shares or Appraisal Withdrawals and any other written
instruments, notices, petitions or other communication received by the Company
in connection with the foregoing and (B) to the extent that the Company has
Knowledge thereof, any applications to the Supreme Court of Bermuda for
appraisal of the fair value of the Dissenting Shares and (ii) to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the opportunity to participate with the Company

for appraisal under the Bermuda Companies Act. The Company will not, without
the prior written consent of Parent or as otherwise required by an order of a
Governmental Entity of competent jurisdiction, voluntarily make any payment
with respect to, negotiate with respect to, offer to settle or settle any such
demands or applications, or waive any failure to timely deliver a written
demand for appraisal or to timely take any other action to exercise appraisal

Company Share Award will receive in exchange therefor the Option

there is no pending Action and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there is no
Action threatened in writing with respect to any Company Benefit Plan (other
than routine claims for benefits) and no fact or event exists that would

audit or investigation by the IRS, the Department of Labor, the Pension
Benefit Guaranty Corporation or any other Governmental Entity; (iii) each
Company Benefit Plan intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has been determined by the IRS to be so qualified, and each trust created
thereunder has been determined by the IRS to be exempt from tax under the
provisions of Section 501(a) of the Code, and nothing has occurred since the
date of such determination that could reasonably be expected to give the IRS
grounds to revoke such determination; (iv) no non-exempt "prohibited
transaction" (as defined in Sections 406 and 408 of ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) or breaches of any of the duties imposed on "fiduciaries" (within
the meaning of Section 3(21) of ERISA) by ERISA have occurred with respect to
any Company Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject the
Company or any Company Subsidiary to any material Tax or penalty under Section
4975 of the Code or Section 502 of ERISA; and (iv) each Non-U.S. Benefit
Plan, if intended to qualify for special Tax treatment, meets all applicable
material requirements, and if required to be funded, book-reserved or secured
by an insurance policy, is so funded, book-reserved or secured in all
material respects, based on reasonable actuarial assumptions.

(g) With respect to any insurance policy providing funding for benefits under
any Company Benefit Plan, and, except as would not be reasonably expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect (i)

sharing arrangement, or other actual or contingent liability, nor

 



21

    

 would there be any such Liability if such insurance policy was terminated on
the Agreement Date; and (ii) no insurance company issuing any such policy is
in receivership, conservatorship, liquidation or similar proceeding and, to
the Companys Knowledge, no such proceedings with respect to any such insurer
are imminent.

 

(h) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.15(h)_ of the Company Disclosure
Letter or as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 2.04(a)_, _(b)_ or _(c)_ of this
Agreement, neither the execution or delivery of this Agreement or the
Statutory Merger Agreement nor the consummation of the Merger (alone or in
combination with any other event) will (i) result in any payment becoming due
under any Benefit Plan; (ii) increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Company Benefit Plan; (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment,
funding or vesting of any payments or benefits under any Company Benefit Plan
or to any Governmental Entity in respect of any current or former Service
Provider; (iv) result in the forgiveness in whole or in part of, or accelerate
the repayment date of, any outstanding loans that exist under or as part of
any Company Benefit Plan; (v) result in any breach or violation of, or a
default under, any Company Benefit Plan; or (vi) result in any amounts payable
or benefits provided to any such current or former director, officer or
employee to fail to be deductible for federal income Tax purposes by virtue of
Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of the Company
Subsidiaries has any obligation to gross-up, indemnify, or otherwise reimburse
any current or former Service Provider for any Tax incurred by such Service
Provider, including income Taxes, or Taxes incurred under Section 409A or 4999
of the Code. The Company has Made Available a list of all Contracts,

and, if applicable, settlement schedule of such awards, including any
accelerated vesting provisions, and (v) the exercise or purchase price
thereof, if applicable, and in the case of ESPP Purchase Rights, the fair
market value as of the offer date of the offering period. Each grant of
a Company Option, Company RSU, award of Company Restricted Shares, SAR, and
ESPP Purchase Right was properly approved by the Company Board (or a duly
authorized committee or subcommittee thereof) in compliance in all material
respects with Law, recorded on the Companys financial statements in
accordance with GAAP in all material respects consistently applied, and were
validly issued, and no such grants involved any "back dating," "forward
dating" or similar practices with respect to the effective date of the grant.
The exercise price of each Company Option and each SAR is not less than the
fair market value of a Common Share on the date of grant of such Company
Option or SAR, as applicable. Except for Company Options, Company RSUs, and
Company Restricted Shares, and the SARs, there are no awards or rights
outstanding under the Company Share Plan.

Section 5.03 _No Solicitation by the Company; Company Recommendation_.

(a) From the Agreement Date until the earlier of the Effective Time or the
date, if any, on which this Agreement is terminated pursuant to _Section_ __
_ 8.01_, except as explicitly permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.03(c)_ and
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_, the Company will not, and will cause each of the
Company Subsidiaries to not, and will instruct the Representatives of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to not, and to not publicly announce any
intention to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit, initiate, knowingly
encourage or knowingly facilitate any inquiry, discussion, offer or request
that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead to, an Alternative
Proposal (an " _Inquiry_ ") (it being understood and agreed that ministerial
acts that are not otherwise prohibited by this _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ (such as
answering unsolicited phone calls) will not be deemed to "facilitate" for
purposes of, or otherwise constitute a violation of, this  _Section_ __ _
5.03_); (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished to any Person or "Group" (as
such term is defined in Section 13(d) under the Exchange Act) any non-
public information with respect to any Inquiries or the making of any
proposal that constitutes, or would be reasonably expected to result in, an
Alternative Proposal; (iii) enter into, continue or maintain discussions or
negotiations with any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their
respective Affiliates) with respect to an Inquiry or an Alternative Proposal
(other than informing Persons of the provisions set forth in this _Section_ __

facts or clarify terms and conditions of such Alternative Proposal for the
sole purpose of the Special Committee reasonably informing itself about such
Alternative Proposal); (iv) approve, agree to, accept, endorse or recommend
any Alternative Proposal; (v) submit to a vote of its shareholders any

that, subject to compliance by the Company with the terms of this _Section_

accordance with _Section 5.03(d)_ that an Alternative Proposal constitutes a
Superior Proposal, or (2) the delivery by the Company of the notice required
by _Section 5.03(d)_ shall in and of themselves constitute an Adverse
Recommendation Change); or (vii) enter into any agreement in principle, letter
of intent, term sheet, merger agreement, acquisition agreement, option
agreement or other similar instrument providing for an Alternative Proposal.
The Company will, and will cause the Company Subsidiaries to, and will
instruct its and their Representatives to, cease immediately and cause to
be terminated any and all existing activities, discussions or negotiations,
if any, with any third party and its Representatives with respect to any
Alternative Proposal and will use its reasonable best efforts to cause any
such third party (together with its Representatives) that has executed a
confidentiality agreement in connection with any Alternative Proposal, within
the 12-month period prior to the Agreement Date, and that is in possession
of confidential information heretofore furnished by or on behalf of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries in connection with the
consideration of an Alternative Proposal (and all analyses and other materials
prepared by or on behalf of such Person that contain, reflect or analyze that
information) to return or destroy all such information as promptly as
practicable. It is agreed that any violation of the restrictions on the
Company set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.03_ by any Representative of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries will constitute a breach of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.03_ by the Company.

 



37

    

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_, if
the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or any of its or their
respective Representatives (including members of the Special Committee)
receives a bona fide Alternative Proposal by any Person or Group at any time
prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, and provided there has been no
material breach of _Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ that resulted in such Alternative
Proposal, the Company and its Representatives may, prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting, take the actions set forth in subsections (i) and/or
(ii) of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(b)_ if the Special Committee has determined,
in its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor and
outside legal counsel), that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or would
reasonably be expected to lead to a Superior Proposal and that the failure to
take such action would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the
directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law: (i) furnish or cause to be
furnished non-public information to and afford access to the business,
employees, officers, contracts, properties, assets, books and records of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the Person or Group and its
Representatives that made such Alternative Proposal, pursuant to an executed
(and the Company and/or Company Subsidiaries may enter into a) customary
confidentiality agreement that does not prohibit compliance by the Company
with any of the provisions of this Agreement (it being understood that the
Company shall not be required to include any "standstill" provision in such
confidentiality agreement), including this  _Section_ __ _ 5.03_; and (ii)
enter into, engage in and continue thereafter (so long as such Alternative
Proposal remains reasonably likely to lead to a Superior Proposal) discussions
or negotiations with the Person or Group and its Representatives that made
such Alternative Proposal with respect to such Alternative Proposal.

(c) Reasonably promptly (but in no event more than 48 hours) following
receipt (to the Knowledge of the Company) of any Alternative Proposal or any
Inquiry, the Company will advise Parent in writing of the receipt of such
Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, and the material terms and conditions of
such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry (including, in each case, the identity of
the Person or Group making any such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry), and the
Company will as reasonably promptly as practicable provide to Parent (i) a
copy of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, if in writing; or (ii) a summary
of the material terms of such Alternative Proposal or Inquiry, if oral. The
Company agrees that it will promptly provide to Parent any non-public
information concerning the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries that it
provides to any other Person or Group in connection with any such Alternative
Proposal that has not previously been provided to Parent. In addition, the
Company will keep Parent reasonably informed on a reasonably prompt basis of
any material developments regarding the Alternative Proposal or any material
change to the terms or status of the Alternative Proposal or Inquiry.

(d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, at any time prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, the Special Committee may (i) in the case of an
Intervening Event or if the Company has received a Superior Proposal (after
taking into account the terms of any revised offer by Parent pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_), and provided there has been no material breach of
_Section_ __ _ 5.03(a)_ that resulted in such Superior Proposal, cause the
Company to effect an Adverse Recommendation Change, and/or (ii) if the Company
has received a Superior Proposal (after taking into account the terms of any
revised offer by Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_), cause the
Company to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)_ to
enter into a definitive written agreement providing for such Superior
Proposal simultaneously with the termination of this Agreement, in the case of
clauses (i) and (ii), if the Special Committee has determined in good faith,
after consultation with outside legal counsel, that the failure to take such
action would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that the Special Committee
may not make an Adverse Recommendation Change or, in the case of a Superior
Proposal, terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)_,
unless:

 



38

    

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent at least five
Business Days in advance (the " _Notice Period_ ") of taking such action,
which notice will advise Parent of the circumstances giving rise to the
Adverse Recommendation Change, and, in the case of a Superior Proposal, that
the Special Committee has received a Superior Proposal and includes a copy of
the most recent version of such Superior Proposal;

(ii) during the Notice Period, the Company has negotiated with Parent in good
faith (if and to the extent Parent desires to so negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that, in the case
of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal ceases to constitute (in the
good faith judgment of the Special Committee) a Superior Proposal, or in the
case of an Intervening Event, the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change (in the judgment of the Special Committee after consultation with
outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel) would no longer be
reasonably likely to constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law; and

 

(iii) the Special Committee has determined in good faith, after considering
the results of such negotiations and giving effect to any proposals,
amendments or modifications made or agreed to in writing by Parent, if any,
and after consultation with its outside financial advisor and outside legal
counsel, that, in the case of a Superior Proposal, such Superior Proposal
remains a Superior Proposal or, in the case of an Intervening Event, that the
failure to make such Adverse Recommendation Change would continue to
reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary duties
under applicable Law.

 

If during the Notice Period any material revisions are made to the Superior
Proposal, the Company will deliver a new written notice to Parent and will
comply with the requirements of this _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ with respect to
such new written notice; _provided_ , _however_ , that for purposes of this
sentence, references to the five Business Day period above will be deemed to
be references to a three Business Day period.

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement will prevent the Company, the Company
Board or the Special Committee from issuing a "stop, look and listen"
communication pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or complying
with Rule 14d-9, Rule 14e-2 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A under the
Exchange Act with respect to an Alternative Proposal or from making any
disclosure to the Companys shareholders if the Special Committee (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) concludes that its failure to do so
would reasonably be likely to constitute a breach of the directors fiduciary
duties under applicable Law; _provided_ that (i) any such action taken or
statement made that relates to an Alternative Proposal will be deemed to be an
Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Special Committee reaffirms the
Company Recommendation in such statement or in connection with such action,
and (ii) it is understood and agreed that any factually accurate public
statement by the Company that merely describes the Companys receipt of an
Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with respect thereto

entitled to vote at the Company Shareholders Meeting; (ii) not change such
record date or establish a different record date for the Company Shareholders
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent unless required to do so
by applicable Law (and if the date of the Company Shareholders Meeting as

Company agrees that unless Parent has otherwise approved in writing (or as

of (A) seeking the Company Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder
Approval, (B) in accordance with Section 14A of the Exchange Act and the

adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting, or submit any other proposal to the
Companys shareholders in connection with the Company Shareholders Meeting,
without the prior written consent of Parent. The Company will use its
reasonable best efforts to (i) promptly cause the Proxy Statement to be mailed
to the Companys shareholders as of the record date established for the
Company Shareholders Meeting; and (ii) except if an Adverse Recommendation
Change has been made as permitted by _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)_ and remains in
effect, solicit the Company Shareholder Approval and the Minority
Shareholder Approval, including by retaining the services of a recognized
proxy solicitor reasonably acceptable to Parent. The Company will, through the
Special Committee, recommend to its shareholders that they give the Company
Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval (the " _Company
Recommendation_ ") and will include such recommendation in the Proxy Statement
and the Schedule 13E-3, in each case, unless the Special Committee
has validly made an Adverse Recommendation Change as permitted by _Section_
__ _ 5.03(d)_ that is still in effect. The Company agrees that, unless this
Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms prior thereto, its
obligations to hold the Company Shareholders Meeting pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 6.01_ will not be affected by the commencement, public
proposal, public disclosure or communication to the Company of any Alternative
Proposal, by the making of any Adverse Recommendation Change by the Special
Committee or by any other development; _provided_ , _however_ , that if the
public announcement of an Adverse Recommendation Change or the delivery of
notice by the Company to Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.03(d)(i)_
occurs less than 10 Business Days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting,
the Company will be entitled to postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting to a
date not more than 10 Business Days after the date such Company Shareholders
Meeting had previously been scheduled (but in no event to a date after the
date that is five Business Days before the End Date).

 

(f) The foregoing provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 6.01_ notwithstanding,
the Company will have the right, after consultation in good faith with
Parent, to make one or more successive changes

 



41

    

 in date, postponements or adjournments of the Company Shareholders Meeting
(i) to ensure that any supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement or
Schedule 13E-3 required under applicable Law is timely provided to the
shareholders of the Company within a reasonable amount of time, in the good
faith judgment of the Special Committee (after consultation with outside
counsel), in advance of the Company Shareholders Meeting; (ii) if required by
applicable Law or a request from the SEC or its staff; or (iii) if, on a date
for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled, the Company has not
received proxies representing a sufficient number of Common Shares to obtain
the Company Shareholder Approval and the Minority Shareholder Approval,
whether or not a quorum is present; _provided that_ (A) the duration of any
such adjournment or postponement is limited to the minimum duration
reasonably necessary to remedy the circumstances giving rise to such
adjournment or postponement; (B) no single such adjournment or postponement is
for more than five Business Days except as may be required by federal
securities Laws; and (C) in the case of clause (iii), the Company Shareholders
Meeting is not postponed to later than the date that is 10 Business Days after
the date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting was originally scheduled
without the prior written consent of Parent and that the Company will, and
will cause its proxy solicitor to, use reasonable best efforts to solicit such
additional proxies (or presence and affirmative vote in person of the
Companys shareholders at the Company Shareholders Meeting) as expeditiously
as reasonably possible, it being understood that time shall be of the essence.
If, on any date for which the Company Shareholders Meeting is scheduled,
the Company has not received proxies representing a sufficient number of
Common Shares to obtain the Minority Shareholder Approval, the Company will,
at Parents request, postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting on
one or more occasions for up to 30 days in the aggregate to allow for the
solicitation of additional proxies to obtain the Minority Shareholder
Approval. The Company will also consider in good faith any other request by
Parent to postpone the Company Shareholders Meeting.

Section 6.02 _Access to Information; Confidentiality_. Subject to applicable
Law, the Company will, and will cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to,
afford to Parent and Sumitomo and the Representatives of Parent and Sumitomo
reasonable access, upon reasonable advance notice, during the period from the
Agreement Date through the Effective Time, to all their respective
properties, books, contracts, commitments, personnel and records and, during
such period, the Company will, and will cause each of the Company Subsidiaries
to, furnish reasonably promptly to Parent (a) to the extent not
publicly available, a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement
and other document filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements
of federal or state securities Laws or commission actions; and (b) all other
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request (in each case, in a manner so as to not interfere in any
material respect with the normal business operations of the Company or any
Company Subsidiary);  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Company will not be
required to permit such access or make such disclosure, to the extent it
determines, after consultation with outside counsel, that such disclosure or
access would reasonably be likely to (i) violate the terms of any
confidentiality agreement or other Contract with a third party ( _provided_
that the Company will use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the required
Consent of such third party to such access or disclosure); (ii) result in the
loss of any attorney-client privilege ( _provided_ that the Company will use
its reasonable best efforts to allow for such access or disclosure (or as much
of it as possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-
client privilege); or (iii) violate any Law. All information provided by the
Company pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.02_ will be subject to the
Information Sharing and Cooperation Agreement by and among the Company and
Parent, dated as of May 21, 2020 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 6.03 _Efforts to Consummate_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions herein provided, each of Parent and
the Company will use their respective reasonable best efforts to promptly

comply with applicable Law and (y) to remove references concerning the
valuation of the businesses of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries.

(c) The Company will give prompt written notice to Parent, and Parent will
give prompt written notice to the Company, of (i) the occurrence, or failure
to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur has resulted in or
would reasonably be expected to result in the failure to satisfy or be able
to satisfy any of the conditions specified in _Article VII_ , and such written
notice will specify the condition which has failed or will fail to be

Company or any Company Subsidiary agree without the prior written consent of
Parent) to take any action (including entering into any consent decree, hold

43

together with all other such actions, restrictions, conditions, limitations
and requirements) would reasonably be expected to result in a material

Section 6.04 _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance_.

 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights existing as of the Agreement Date to
indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation from Liabilities for
acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time in favor of the
current and/or former directors, officers or employees of the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries as provided in their respective memorandum
of association or bye-laws (or comparable organizational documents) and any
indemnification or other similar agreements of the Company or any of the
Company Subsidiaries in effect as of the Agreement Date will continue in full
force and effect in accordance with their terms, and Parent will cause the
Surviving Company and the Company Subsidiaries to perform their respective
obligations thereunder. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after
the Effective Time, the Surviving Company will indemnify and hold harmless
each individual who was prior to or is as of the Agreement Date, or who
becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director, officer or employee of the
Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries or who was prior to or is as of
the Agreement Date, or who thereafter commences prior to the Effective Time,
serving at the request of the Company or any of the Company Subsidiaries as a
director, officer or employee of another Person (the " _Company Indemnified
Parties_ "), against all claims, Liabilities, Judgments, fines and fees, costs
and expenses, including reasonable attorneys fees and disbursements, incurred
in connection with any Action (including with respect to matters existing or
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including this Agreement and the
Transactions)), arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Company
Indemnified Party is or was a director, officer or employee of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary or is or was serving at the request of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary as a director, officer or employee of another Person,
whether asserted or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable Law. In the event of any such
Action, (x) each Company Indemnified Party will be entitled to advancement of
expenses incurred in the defense of any such Action from the Surviving Company
within 10 Business Days of receipt by the Surviving Company from the Company
Indemnified Party of a request therefor; _provided_ that any Person to whom
expenses are advanced provides an undertaking, if and only to the extent
required by the Bermuda Companies Act, the Surviving Companys memorandum of
association or bye-laws (or comparable organizational documents) or any
applicable indemnification agreement, to repay such advances if it is
ultimately determined by final non-appealable adjudication that such Person
is not entitled to indemnification and (y) the Surviving Company will
cooperate in the defense of any such matter.

 

(b) For a period of six years from and after the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company will, and Parent will cause the Surviving Company to, either maintain
or cause to be maintained in effect the current policies of directors and
officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance maintained by
the Company or the Company Subsidiaries or provide substitute policies for
the Company and its current and former directors and officers who are
currently covered by the directors and officers and fiduciary liability
insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company, in either case, of not
less than the existing coverage and having other terms not less favorable to
the insured Persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time, except that in no event will the Surviving Company
be required to pay with respect to such insurance policies in respect of any
one policy year more than 300% of the aggregate annual

 



44

    

 premium most recently paid by the Company prior to the Agreement Date (the "
_Maximum Amount_ "), and if the Surviving Company is unable to obtain the
insurance required by this  _Section_ __ _ 6.04(b)_ it will obtain as much
comparable insurance as possible for each year within such six-year period for
an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In lieu of such insurance,
prior to the Closing Date the Company may, at its option, purchase "tail"
directors and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
for a period of six years for the Company and its current and former
directors, officers and employees who are currently covered by the directors
and officers and fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained
by the Company, such tail insurance to provide coverage in an amount not less
than the existing coverage and to have other terms not less favorable to the
insured Persons than the directors and officers liability insurance and
fiduciary liability insurance coverage currently maintained by the Company
with respect to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or
before the Effective Time; _provided_ that in no event will the cost of any
such tail insurance exceed the Maximum Amount. The Surviving Company will
maintain such policies in full force and effect, and continue to honor the
obligations thereunder.

(c) The provisions of this  _Section_ __ _ 6.04_ (i) will survive
consummation of the Merger, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and
will be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the
Company Indemnified Parties) to the extent of such indemnified or insured
partys interest herein, and his or her heirs, and (iii) are in addition to,
and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or
contribution that any such Person may have by contract or otherwise.

(d) In the event that the Surviving Company or any of its successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and is not the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers or conveys all or substantially all of its properties and
assets to any Person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Company will

Surviving Company assume the Surviving Companys obligations set forth in this
_Section_ __ _ 6.04_.

 

Section 6.05 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to entry into a customary joint
defense agreement, the Company will give Parent the opportunity to consult
with the Company and participate in the defense or settlement of any
shareholder Action against the Company, any Company Subsidiary and/or their
respective directors or officers relating to the Transactions. None of
the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any Representative of the Company will
compromise, settle or come to an arrangement regarding any such shareholder
Action, in each case unless Parent has consented thereto in writing;
_provided_ that the Company may compromise, settle or come to an agreement

Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to the Company immediately
prior to the Effective Time to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

 

Section 6.07 _Public Announcements_. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger
Sub agrees that no public release or announcement concerning the Transactions
(including any communication required to be filed with the SEC pursuant to
Rule 14a-12 promulgated under the Exchange Act) will be issued by or on behalf
of any of them or their Subsidiaries without the prior written consent of the
Company (as to any release by Parent or its Affiliates), and Parent

 



45

    

 (as to any release by the Company or its Subsidiaries), which consent of
such Parties will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, except as such
release or announcement may be required by applicable Law or the rules or
regulations of any applicable national securities exchange or Governmental
Entity to which the relevant party is subject, in which case the party
required to make the release or announcement will use its reasonable best
efforts to allow each other party reasonable time to comment on such release

consistent with previous press releases, public disclosures or public
statements made by the Company, Parent or Sumitomo in compliance with this
_Section_ __ _ 6.07_ and do not reveal material, non-public information
regarding the other parties, the Merger, or the other Transactions, and (iii)
the restrictions set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 6.07_ do not apply to any
release or announcement (or any portion thereof) made or proposed to be made
in connection with, or in response to, an Adverse Recommendation Change or an
Alternative Proposal.

Affiliates, or preclude the ability of Parent or the Surviving Company or
their respective Affiliates to terminate the employment of any employee for

50

    

(g) by the Company if the Company Shareholder Approval has not been obtained

Section 8.02 _Effect of Termination_. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Parent or the Company as provided in  _Section_ __ _
8.01_, this Agreement will forthwith become void and have no effect, without
any Liability on the part of the Parties (or any shareholder or Representative
of a Party), other than Liability arising from a breach of the final sentence
of _Section_ __ _ 6.02_, _Section_ __ _ 6.07_, this _Section_ __ _ 8.02_,
_Section_ __ _ 8.03_ and _Article IX_ , which provisions will survive
such termination of this Agreement and _provided that_ , nothing herein will
relieve a Party from Liability resulting from such Partys fraud or willful
and material breach of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"willful breach" means a breach that is a consequence of an act or omission
undertaken by the breaching Party with the Knowledge that the taking of, or
failure to take, such act would, or would reasonably be expected to, cause or
constitute a breach of this Agreement; it being acknowledged and agreed,
without limitation, that any failure by any Party to consummate the Merger and
the other Transactions after the applicable conditions thereto have been
satisfied or waived (other than those conditions that by their nature are to
be satisfied at the Closing, which conditions would be capable of being
satisfied at such time) will constitute a willful breach of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.03 _Fees and Expenses_. Except as specifically provided for herein,
all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and the other
Transactions will be paid by the Party incurring such fees or expenses,
whether or not such transactions are consummated.

 

(a) The Company will pay to Parent a fee of $13,620,000 (the " _Termination
Fee_ ") if:

 

(i) the Company terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)_
or Parent terminates this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(f)_; or

(ii) (A) after the Agreement Date but prior to the termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01_, an Alternative Proposal is made
by a third party to the Company or the Special Committee and not withdrawn
(publicly if such Alternative Proposal has been made known publicly) prior to
the Company Shareholders Meeting or is made directly to the Companys
shareholders by a third party and not publicly withdrawn prior to the Company
Shareholders Meeting; (B) thereafter this Agreement is terminated by Parent or
the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_ (but in the case of a
termination by the Company, only if at such time Parent would not be
prohibited from terminating this Agreement pursuant to the proviso to 
_Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(i)_), by Parent pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(e)_
or by Parent or the Company pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(b)(iii)_; and (C)
within 12 months of such termination, (x) the Company enters into a
definitive Contract for an Alternative Proposal and such Alternative Proposal
is consummated (whether during or after such 12-month period) or (y) an
Alternative Proposal is consummated; _provided_ , _however_ , that for
purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)(ii)_, the references to 20% in the
definition of "Alternative Proposal" will be deemed to be references to 50%. 

Any Termination Fee due under this _Section_ __ _ 8.03(a)_ will be paid by
wire transfer of same-day funds (x) in the case of termination of this
Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 8.01(d)_, substantially concurrently
with and not later than the next Business Day following such termination, (y)
in the case of termination of this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
8.01(f)_, on the Business Day immediately following the date of such
termination, and (z) in the case of clause (ii) above, on the date of
consummation as referred to in clause (ii)(C) above.

(b) The Company acknowledges that the agreements contained in this  _Section_
__ _ 8.03_ are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, Parent and Merger Sub would not enter into this Agreement.
Accordingly, if the Company fails to pay the Termination 

 



51

    

 Fee as and when due to Parent pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_, it
will also be obligated to pay any costs and expenses incurred by Parent and
its Affiliates in connection with a legal action to enforce this Agreement
that results in a judgment against the Company for the Termination Fee (the "
_Costs and Expenses_ "), together with interest on the amount of any unpaid
Termination Fee and Costs and Expenses at the publicly announced prime rate
of Citibank, N.A. from the date such Termination Fee and/or Cost or Expense
was required to be paid to (but excluding) the payment date (the " _Interest_
"). If Parent receives payment of the Termination Fee (and if payable
pursuant to this _Section 8.03_, the Costs and Expenses and/or Interest)
under the circumstances in which it is payable as provided in this _Section_
__ _ 8.03_, without limiting Parents rights in the case of fraud or willful
breach, the receipt of the Termination Fee, together with the Costs and
Expense and/or Interest, if payable pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_,
will be deemed to be liquidated damages for any and all damages or losses
suffered or incurred by Parent, Merger Sub or any of its Affiliates in
connection with this Agreement and the termination of this Agreement (or any
matter forming the basis for such termination), and neither Parent, Merger
Sub nor any of their respective Affiliates will be entitled to bring any
Action or otherwise be entitled to any remedy against the Company or any of
its Affiliates, at law or in equity or otherwise, arising from or in
connection with this Agreement (including the termination thereof) or any of
the Transactions. Any payment of the Termination Fee made by the Company will
be payable only once and not in duplication even though such payment may be
payable under one or more provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 8.03_.

Section 8.04 _Amendment_. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties at any
time before or after receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval or the
Minority Shareholder Approval; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) after receipt
of the Company Shareholder Approval or the Minority Shareholder Approval, no
amendment that by Law or by the IRA, requires further approval by the
Companys shareholders will be made without the further approval of such
shareholders, and (ii) except as provided above, no amendment of this
Agreement will be submitted to be approved by the Companys shareholders
unless required by Law or the IRA. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the Parties and any such
amendment or waiver by the Company will be at the direction of and approved
by the Special Committee. Termination of this Agreement prior to the Effective
Time will not require the approval of the shareholders of Parent, Merger Sub,
or the Company.

 

Section 8.05 _Extension; Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of the other Parties; (b) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement; (c) waive compliance with any covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement; or (d) waive the satisfaction of
any of the conditions contained in this Agreement. No extension or waiver by
the Company will require the approval of the Companys shareholders unless
such approval is required by Law but will be at the direction of and approved
by the Special Committee. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver will be valid only if set forth in an instrument
in writing signed on behalf of such Party. No failure or delay by any Party
in exercising any right, power, or privilege hereunder will operate as a
waiver thereof nor will any single or partial exercise thereof preclude any
other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power,
or privilege. The rights and remedies herein provided will be cumulative and
not exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by Law.

to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. All Exhibits and Schedules
annexed hereto or referred to herein are hereby incorporated in and made a
part of this Agreement as if set forth herein. The table of contents, index of
defined terms and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and will not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of
this Agreement. Any capitalized term used in any Exhibit but not otherwise
defined therein has the meaning assigned

 



67

    

 to such term in this Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or
"including" are used in this Agreement, they will be deemed to be followed by
the words "without limitation." The words "hereof," "hereto," "hereby,"
"herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar import when used in this
Agreement will refer to this Agreement as a whole and not to any particular
provision of this Agreement. The term "or" is not exclusive. The word "extent"
in the phrase "to the extent" will mean the degree to which a subject or other
thing extends, and such phrase will not mean simply "if." The following
general rules apply: the singular number will include the plural, and vice
versa; the masculine gender will include the feminine and neuter genders; the
feminine gender will include the masculine and neuter genders; and the neuter
gender will include the masculine and feminine genders. Any Law defined or
referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that is referred to
herein will include any modification, amendment or re-enactment thereof, and
any Law substituted therefore, in each case as of the time of inquiry,
representation, or covenant and all rules, regulations and statutory
instruments issued or related to such Law. Any reference to a Governmental
Entity will be also deemed to refer to any successor thereto unless the
context requires otherwise. A reference to any agreement (including this
Agreement), or Contract is, unless otherwise specified, to the
agreement, Contract as amended, modified, supplemented or replaced at the
time of inquiry, representation or covenant. Neither the specification of any
dollar amount in this Agreement nor the inclusion of any specific item in the
Schedules or Exhibits is intended to imply that such amounts or higher or
lower amounts, or the items so included or other items, are or are not
material, and no Party will use the fact of setting of such amounts or the
fact of the inclusion of such item in the Schedules or Exhibits in any
dispute or controversy between or among the Parties as to whether any
obligation, item or matter is or is not material for purposes of this
Agreement. No prior draft of this Agreement nor any course of performance or
course of dealing will be used in the interpretation or construction of this
Agreement. Although the same or similar subject matters may be addressed in
different provisions of this Agreement, the Parties intend that, except as
reasonably apparent on the face of the Agreement or as expressly provided in
this Agreement, each such provision will be read separately, be given
independent significance and not be construed as limiting any other provision
of this Agreement (whether or not more general or more specific in scope,
substance or content). References herein to a Person are also to its
successors and permitted assigns. Unless otherwise specifically indicated, all
references to "$" will be deemed references to the lawful money of the United
States of America.

(b) Each Party represents and agrees with each other that it has been
represented by or had the opportunity to be represented by, independent
counsel of its own choosing, and that it has had the full right and
opportunity to consult with its respective attorney(s), that to the extent, if
any, that it desired, it availed itself of this right and opportunity, that
it or its authorized officers (as the case may be) have carefully read and
fully understand this Agreement in its entirety and have had it fully
explained to them by such Partys respective counsel, and that it or its
authorized officer (as the case may be) is competent to execute this
Agreement and has executed this Agreement free from coercion, duress or undue
influence. The Parties have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement in connection with the Transactions, with the
opportunity to seek advice as to their legal rights from such counsel. In the
event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises, this
Agreement is to be construed as jointly drafted by the Parties hereto and
no presumption or burden of proof is to arise favoring or disfavoring any
Party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or by
reason of the extent to which any such provision is inconsistent with any
prior draft hereof.

 

Section 9.05 _Severability_. If any term or other provision of this Agreement
is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or
public policy (a) such term or other provision will be fully separable; (b)
this Agreement will be construed and enforced as if such

 



68

    

 invalid, illegal or unenforceable provision had never comprised a part
hereof; and (c) all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement will
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as either the economic
or legal substance of the Transactions is not affected in any manner
materially adverse to any Party or such Party waives its rights under this
_Section_ __ _ 9.05_ with respect thereto. Upon such determination that any
term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced,
the Parties will negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to
effect the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in
an acceptable manner to the end that the Transactions are fulfilled to the
extent possible.

Section 9.06 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, each of which will be deemed an original, but all of which
together will constitute one and the same the same instrument. Counterparts
may be delivered via facsimile, electronic mail (including pdf or any
electronic signature complying with the U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000,
_e.g_., _www.docusign.com_ ) or other transmission method and any counterpart
so delivered will be deemed to have been duly and validly delivered and
be valid and effective for all purposes.

Section 9.07 _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
taken together with the Company Disclosure Letter, the Confidentiality
Agreement and the Voting Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
between the Parties with respect to the Merger and the other Transactions;
and (b) except for _Section_ __ _ 2.04_ and _Section_ __ _ 6.04_, this
Agreement is not intended to confer upon any Person other than the Parties any
rights or remedies.

Section 9.08 _GOVERNING LAW_. THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ALL MATTERS OF
CONSTRUCTION, VALIDITY AND PERFORMANCE AND ANY ACTION OR COUNTERCLAIM
(WHETHER IN CONTRACT, TORT, EQUITY OR OTHERWISE) DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS OR THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT HEREOF, WILL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF
DELAWARE, REGARDLESS OF THE LAWS THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE GOVERN UNDER ANY
APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CHOICE OR CONFLICTS OF LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THE PROVISIONS OF THE LAWS OF BERMUDA ARE MANDATORILY
APPLICABLE TO THE MERGER.

Section 9.09 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations under this Agreement will be assigned, in whole or in
part, by operation of Law or otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior
written consent of the other Parties; _provided_ that the rights, interests
and obligations of Merger Sub may be assigned to another direct or indirect
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment will relieve Merger
Sub of any of its obligations under this Agreement. Any purported
assignment without such consent will be void. Subject to the preceding
sentences, this Agreement will be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and
be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors and assigns.

 

Section 9.10 _Specific Enforcement; Jurisdiction; Venue_. The Parties
acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached, and that monetary damages,
even if available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is
accordingly agreed that the Parties will be entitled to an injunction or
injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this Agreement and
to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause the other Parties to
consummate the Merger and the other Transactions. It is agreed that

 



69

    

 the Parties are entitled to enforce specifically the performance of terms
and provisions of this Agreement in any court referred to below, without proof
of actual damages (and each Party hereby waives any requirement for the
securing or posting of any bond in connection with such remedy), this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The Parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement
is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law, or inequitable for any reason, nor
to assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy
for any such breach. In the event any Party brings any Action to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement prior to the Closing, the End Date will automatically be extended by
(i) the amount of time during which such Action is pending (including any
appeals therefrom), plus 20 Business Days, or (ii) such other time period
established by the court presiding over such Action. In addition, each of the
Parties irrevocably agrees that any Action arising out of or relating to this
Agreement brought by (x) Sumitomo, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates against the Company or its Affiliates or (y) by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries against Sumitomo, Parent, Merger Sub or their respective
Affiliates, in any such case, will be brought and determined in the Court of
Chancery of the State of Delaware; _provided_ , that if jurisdiction is not
then available in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware, then any
such Action may be brought in any federal court located in the State of
Delaware or any other Delaware state court, in each case, except to the extent
that any such Action mandatorily must be brought in Bermuda. Each of the
Parties hereby irrevocably submits to the jurisdiction of the
aforesaid courts for itself and with respect to its property, generally and
unconditionally, with regard to any such Action arising out of or relating to
this Agreement and the Transactions. Each of the Parties agrees not to
commence any Action relating thereto except in the courts described above in
Delaware, other than actions in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce
any judgment, decree, or award rendered by any such court in Delaware as
described herein. Each of the Parties further agrees that notice as provided
herein will constitute sufficient service of process and the Parties further
waive any argument that such service is insufficient. Each of the Parties
hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, and agrees not to assert, by
way of motion or as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any Action
arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the Transactions (a) any claim
that it is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of the courts in
Delaware as described herein for any reason; (b) that it or its property is
exempt or immune from jurisdiction of any such court or from any legal process
commenced in such courts (whether through service of notice, attachment prior
to judgment, attachment in aid of execution of judgment, execution of
judgment or otherwise); and (c) that (i) the Action in any such court is
brought in an inconvenient forum, (ii) the venue of such Action is improper,
or (iii) this Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in
or by such courts.

made on one or more occasions.

extent Parent or Merger Sub successfully asserts rights as a result of
such failure or delay that are not the subject to subclause (iv) of this

 renewal, extension, acceleration or other change in the time, place or

compromise, consolidation, subordination or other waiver, amendment or
modification of any of the terms or provisions of this Agreement made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement; (iii) any change in the corporate
existence, structure or ownership of Parent or Merger Sub; (iv) any
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization or other similar proceeding affecting
Parent or Merger Sub or their assets; (v) any request or acceptance of other
guaranties of the Guaranteed Obligations or the taking or holding of security
for the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations; (vi) the enforcement or
application of any security now or hereafter held in respect of the Guaranteed
Obligations; (vii) the exercise of other rights or remedies available to
the Company or the other beneficiaries, or any of them, under this Agreement,
at law or in equity, except to the extent Parent or Merger Sub successfully
asserts rights as a result of such exercise that are not the subject to
subclause (iv) of this  _Section_ __ _ 9.13(d)_; and (viii) any other act or
thing or omission, or delay to do any other act or thing, which may or might
in any manner or to any extent vary the risk of Sumitomo as an obligor in
respect of the Guaranteed Obligations (in all cases other than payment in
full of the Guaranteed Obligations, any insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization
or other similar proceeding affecting Sumitomo or its assets, and defenses to
the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available to Parent or
Merger Sub under this Agreement that are not the subject to subclause (iv) of
this _Section_ __ _ 9.13(d)_). Sumitomo waives promptness, diligence, notice
of the acceptance of the Guarantee and of the Guaranteed Obligations,
presentment, demand for payment, notice of non-performance, default, dishonor
and protest, notice of the Guaranteed Obligations incurred and all other
notices of any kind, all defenses which may be available by virtue of any
valuation, stay, statute of limitations, moratorium Law or other similar Law
now or hereafter in effect, any right to require the marshalling of assets of
Parent or Merger Sub or any other Person interested in the Transactions, any
right to require the Company to proceed against Parent or Merger Sub or any
other Person, any right to require the Company to proceed against or exhaust
any security or pursue any other remedy, any defense arising by reason of the
incapacity, lack of authority or any disability or other defense of Parent or
Merger Sub and all suretyship defenses generally (in all cases other than
fraud by the Company, payment in full of the Guaranteed Obligations, any
principles or provisions of law, statutory or otherwise, that are or might be
in conflict with the terms of the guarantee set forth in this _Section_ __ _
9.13_, any legal or equitable discharge of Sumitomos obligations hereunder
and defenses to the payment of the Guaranteed Obligations that are available
to Parent or Merger Sub under this Agreement). Sumitomo acknowledges that it
has received and will receive substantial direct and indirect benefits from
the Transactions and that the waivers set forth in this _Section_ __ _ 9.13_
are knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

 

(e) No failure on the part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in
exercising, any right, remedy or power pursuant to this  _Section_ __ _
9.13_ will operate as a waiver thereof, nor will any single or partial

At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the
part of the Company, Parent, Merger Sub or any holder of any of the common
shares, par value $0.000037453 per share of the Company (the " _Common Shares_

---|---

Each Common Share owned by the Company as a treasury share and each Common
Share owned directly by any direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the
Company, in each case as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (each an "

exchange therefor. 

---|---|--- 



     | b. |

Each Common Share that is owned directly by Parent as of immediately prior to
the Effective Time (each a " _Parent Owned Share_ ") will remain outstanding

---|---|--- 



     | d. |

Each Common Share issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (other than (i) Excluded Shares and (ii) Parent Owned Shares), will be
cancelled. When so cancelled, all such Common Shares will no longer be
outstanding, and will automatically cease to exist, and, each holder of a
certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such
Common Shares and each holder of evidence in book-entry form that immediately
prior to the Effective Time represented any such Common Shares, will cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive $16.25 in
cash, without interest, in respect of each such Common Share (subject to any
additional rights provided to dissenting shareholders under the Bermuda
Companies Act). 

---|---|--- 
 



   9. |

Share Awards then outstanding will be treated as follows: 

---|--- 
 



     | a. |

Each then-outstanding and unexercised Company Option (whether vested or
unvested) and SAR (whether vested or unvested) will be cancelled and the
holder thereof will have the right to receive an amount (subject to any
applicable withholding tax) in cash, without interest, equal to the product of
(i) the excess, if any, of the Per Share Merger Consideration over the
applicable exercise price per Common Share of such Company Option or over the
applicable strike price per 

---|---|--- 
        |  Common Share of such SAR, multiplied by (ii) the total number
of Common Shares subject to such Company Option or SAR, it being understood
that, each unexercised Company Option and SAR, whether vested or unvested,
with an exercise price or strike price equal to or greater than the Per Share
Merger Consideration will be cancelled immediately prior to the Effective Time
without consideration therefor. 
---|--- 
 



     | b. |

Each then-outstanding Company RSU and Company Restricted Share (whether vested
or unvested) that has not been settled in Common Shares will be cancelled and
the holder thereof will have the right to receive a single lump sum cash
payment, without interest, equal to the (i) Per Share Merger Consideration,
less (ii) any applicable withholding for taxes.

Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, (i) with respect to any
Company Share Award that constitutes nonqualified deferred compensation
subject to Section 409A of the United States Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as
amended (the " _Code_ "), and that the Company determines prior to the
Effective Time is not eligible to be cancelled in accordance with Treasury
Regulation Section 1.409A-3(j)(4)(ix)(B), such payment will be made at the
earliest time permitted under the applicable Company Share Award that will not
trigger a tax or penalty under Section 409A of the Code and (ii) in the event
of any Company Share Award subject to Section 409A of the Code, the payment of
the amount of cash with respect thereto shall be delayed and paid in
accordance with the timing requirements of the definitive grant agreement
related to such award, to the extent necessary to comply with Section 409A of
the Code.

specified period or periods; (iii) " _Company RSU_ " means a time-based
restricted share unit granted under the Company Share Plan; (iv) " _Company

   10. |

This Agreement may not be amended except by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of each of the Parties. Any agreement on the part of a Party to a
waiver of any of its rights under this Agreement will be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure
of any Party to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise
will not constitute a waiver of such rights. 

---|--- 



   11. |

Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement will be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the other
Parties; _provided that_ the rights, interests and obligations of Merger Sub
may be assigned to another direct or indirect wholly owned subsidiary of
Parent, but no such assignment will relieve Merger Sub of any of its
obligations under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such
consent will be void. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement will
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns. 

---|--- 
      12. |

This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of which will
be deemed an original, but all of which together will constitute one and the
same the same instrument. Counterparts may be delivered via facsimile,
electronic mail (including pdf or any electronic signature complying with the
U.S. federal ESIGN Act of 2000, _e.g_.,  _www.docusign.com_ ) or other
transmission method and any counterpart so delivered will be deemed to have
been duly and validly delivered and be valid and effective for all purposes. 

---|--- 
 



   13. |

The terms and conditions of this Agreement and the rights of the parties
hereunder will be governed by and construed in all respects in accordance
with the laws of Bermuda. The parties to this agreement hereby irrevocably
agree that the courts of Bermuda shall have non-exclusive jurisdiction in
respect of any dispute, suite, action arbitration or proceedings ("
_Proceedings_ ") which may arise out of or in connection with this Agreement
and waive any objection to Proceedings in courts of Bermuda on the grounds of
venue or on the basis that the Proceedings have been brought in an
inconvenient forum.
