Section 2.06. _Purchase Price Adjustments_.

  

(a) _Distribution_. Unless it would cause a Working Capital Deficit, the
Parties agree that Seller shall have the right, at or prior to the Closing, to
cause the Company to distribute cash to Seller, by one or more distributions;
_provided, however_ , that Seller shall cause the Company to have, at the
Closing, any amounts of cash required to be maintained in its restricted cash
account pursuant to any Support Obligations listed on _Schedule 4.20_.

  

(b) _Post-Closing Adjustment_. Within 90 days after the Closing Date, Buyer
shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and deliver to Seller a statement (the
" _Closing Statement_ "), which shall be calculated in accordance with GAAP,
consistent with the accounting methods, policies, principles, practices,
procedures, classifications and estimation methodologies (whether with regard
to reserves or otherwise) that were used in the preparation of the Worksheet
(and to the extent of any conflict GAAP controls, unless otherwise expressly
indicated on the Worksheet), and shall include (i) a calculation of the
Adjustment Amount (including a calculation of the Closing Working Capital, the
Closing Indebtedness and the Closing Transaction Expense Amount) and (iii)
Buyer's determination of the final Closing Amount resulting therefrom (such
calculations and determination, " _Buyer 's Final Closing Amount_"). No fact
or event, including any market or business development, occurring after the
Closing, and no change in GAAP or Law after the Closing, shall be taken into
consideration in the preparation of the Closing Statement or the determination
of Buyer's Final Closing Amount.

  

(c) _Seller Examination and Review_. Seller shall have a period of 60 days
after delivery of the Closing Statement to review it and make any objections
it may have in writing to Buyer, and to set forth Seller's (i) calculation of
the Closing Working Capital, (ii) calculation of the Closing Indebtedness,
(iii) calculation of the Closing Transaction Expense Amount and (iv)
determination of the Final Closing Amount (such calculations and
determination, " _Seller 's Final Closing Amount_"). For purposes of Seller's
evaluation of Buyer's Final Closing Amount, Buyer shall, and shall cause the
Acquired Companies to, promptly make copies available to and promptly provide
reasonable access to Seller and its Representatives, upon reasonable advance
notice and during normal business hours, such information, books, records,
data and working papers as Seller shall reasonably request in order for Seller
to analyze Buyer's Final Closing Amount; and shall promptly permit reasonable
access, upon reasonable advance notice and during normal business hours to the
personnel of the Acquired Companies as may be reasonably requested by Seller
and its Representatives to analyze Buyer's Final Closing Amount. If Seller
does not provide Seller's Final Closing Amount within such 60-day period, then
Buyer's Final Closing Amount shall be final and binding on the Parties and
shall constitute the Final Closing Amount for all purposes hereunder.

  

(d) _Resolution of Disputes_.

  

(i) If Seller delivers Seller's Final Closing Amount to Buyer within the
60-day period contemplated by _Section 2.06(c)_ , then Buyer and Seller shall
attempt to resolve the matter or matters in dispute for a period of 30 days
after Seller's delivery of Seller's Final Closing Amount (the " _Settlement
Period_ "). A matter identified in dispute by Seller in Seller's Final Closing
Amount shall not be considered resolved unless agreed to in writing by both
Buyer and Seller. Any matter resolved by the Parties pursuant to this _Section
2.06(d)(i)_ shall be final and binding upon the Parties and shall constitute a
portion of the Final Closing Amount for all purposes hereunder. Unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the Parties, Buyer's Final Closing Amount
and Seller's Final Closing Amount may not be changed or amended.

         

(ii) If disputes with respect to Buyer's Final Closing Amount or one or more
of the items that comprise Buyer's Final Closing Amount cannot be resolved by
Buyer and Seller by the expiration of the Settlement Period, then, at the
request of Buyer or Seller, the specific matters that remain in dispute (but
no others) shall be submitted to BDO USA, LLP or such other independent
accounting firm or consulting firm of national reputation as may be mutually
agreed by the Parties acting reasonably (the " _Accounting Firm_ "). If such
accounting or consulting firm does not agree to serve as the Accounting Firm
within ten days after written request from the Parties to serve, then the
Parties shall mutually select an alternative independent accounting firm or
consulting firm of national reputation with which such Party has not done
business within the last two years to serve as the Accounting Firm. If the
Parties cannot mutually agree on the Accounting Firm, each Party shall propose
one independent accounting firm or consulting firm of national reputation to
act as the Accounting Firm, and if on the next Business Day, the Dow Jones
Industrial Average closes on an even number (to the immediate left of the
decimal, without rounding), then Buyer's selection shall act as the Accounting
Firm; but if the Dow Jones Industrial Average closes on an odd number (to the
immediate left of the decimal, without rounding), then Seller's selection
shall act as the Accounting Firm. Seller and Buyer shall enter into an
engagement letter with the Accounting Firm, which engagement letter shall be
consistent with the provisions of this Agreement and shall set forth the scope
of work and requirements described in this _Section 2.06(d)_ , and shall
deliver to such Accounting Firm the Closing Statement (including Buyer's Final
Closing Amount), Seller's Final Closing Amount and the Estimated Closing
Amount.

  

(iii) Within 14 days after the Accounting Firm and the Parties have executed
an engagement letter, each Party may provide the Accounting Firm with a
written submission explaining the items that remain in dispute and any items
that have been mutually resolved by the Parties, as well as any supporting
materials previously exchanged between the Parties that each Party deems
necessary for the Accounting Firm's resolution of the dispute. Within ten days
after the Parties exchange written submissions, each Party may submit to the
Accounting Firm a written response, which can include any additional
supporting materials previously exchanged between the Parties that each Party
deems necessary for the Accounting Firm's resolution of the dispute. Within 14
days thereafter, the Accounting Firm must, at either Party's request, hear
argument by the Parties and testimony from witnesses. No Party shall engage in
_ex parte_ communications with the Accounting Firm. Each Party shall also
provide the Other Party with copies of all written materials submitted to the
Accounting Firm by such Party.

       

(iv) The Parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm to deliver to Buyer and
Seller, as soon as practicable, but not later than 90 days (or such other time
as the Parties hereto shall agree in writing) after the Accounting Firm and
the Parties have executed an engagement letter, a written report setting forth
the Accounting Firm's resolution of each of the disputed items, which
determinations shall be made in accordance with the Worksheet and the
definitions and principles set forth in this Agreement and shall be final and
binding on Buyer and Seller. The Accounting Firm shall be limited to selecting
on an item-by-item basis either the item proposed by Buyer in Buyer's Final
Closing Amount or that same item proposed by Seller in Seller's Final Closing
Amount and shall have no authority to select any other amount or reach a
compromise resolution with respect to a disputed item. The Accounting Firm's
written report shall also contain the calculation of the Final Closing Amount,
which will be calculated in accordance with _Section 2.02_ based on (A) any
undisputed items in the Closing Statement, (B) any items mutually resolved by
the Parties pursuant to _Section 2.06(d)(i)_ and (C) the Accounting Firm's
resolution of each disputed item in accordance with this _Section
2.06(d)(iv)_.

  

(v) The Accounting Firm shall act as an arbitrator, and not as an expert, with
respect to all issues that arise from and relate to this _Section 2.06_ ,
including with respect to any issues relating to this _Section 2.06_ that may
arise before the Accounting Firm has been engaged.

  

(vi) Judgment may be entered on the determination of the Accounting Firm in
New York State Supreme Court or any other court having jurisdiction over the
Party against which such determination is to be enforced.

  

(vii) The fees and expenses of the Accounting Firm shall be borne by the
Parties based upon the inverse proportion of the dollar amount of disputed
items resolved in favor of such Party (i.e., so that the prevailing Party
bears a lesser amount of such fees and expenses). Other than the fees and
expenses of the Accounting Firm, each Party will bear its own fees, costs and
expenses in connection with matters contemplated by this _Section 2.06(d)_.

  

(viii) Seller and Buyer agree that the procedure set forth in this _Section
2.06(d)_ for resolving disputes with respect to the calculation of disputed
components of the Final Closing Amount is the sole and exclusive method of
resolving such disputes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this _Section 2.06(d)_
shall not prohibit Seller or Buyer from initiating litigation to compel
arbitration pursuant to this _Section 2.06(d)_ or to enforce the determination
of the Accounting Firm.

  

(e) _Payment of Post-Closing Adjustment_. If the Estimated Closing Amount is
greater than the Final Closing Amount, then, within 15 Business Days following
the final determination thereof, Seller shall pay to Buyer, by wire transfer
in immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Buyer,
the amount of such excess. If the Final Closing Amount is greater than the
Estimated Closing Amount, then, within 15 Business Days following the final
determination thereof, Buyer shall pay to Seller, by wire transfer in
immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by Seller,
the amount of such excess.

       

(f) _Tax Treatment_. Any payments made pursuant to _Section 2.06(e)_ shall be
treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the Parties for Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

  

Section 2.07. _Tax Withholding_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to
the contrary, Buyer and the Company will be entitled to deduct or withhold or
cause to be withheld from amounts payable under this Agreement any amount that
is required to be deducted or withheld under applicable Tax Law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld and remitted to the appropriate Taxing Authority,
such amounts will be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been
paid to the Persons with respect to whom such amounts were withheld.

Section 6.02. _Access of Buyer_.

  

(a) Buyer acknowledges that Seller has had discussions with certain Company
Employees regarding the sale of the Acquired Interests, including the
preparation and negotiation of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents, and that Buyer shall not have access (before or after the Closing)
to any information related to such discussions, including any internal drafts
of this Agreement or other Transaction Documents, or any information regarding
any other bids for the Acquired Companies or specifically related to the sale
process for the Acquired Companies and the activities of Seller in connection
therewith, and Buyer hereby agrees that it shall not have any rights to any
such information; _provided_ that nothing in this _Section 6.02(a)_ waives
Buyer's rights to access, request and use any factual information concerning
the Acquired Companies, the Assets or the Business. Any communications between
the Acquired Companies, on the one hand, and Sidley Austin LLP, on the other
hand, relating to the negotiation, preparation, execution and delivery of this
Agreement or any other Transaction Documents, and the consummation of the
transaction contemplated hereby and thereby, shall be deemed to be attorney-
client privileged, and the expectation of client confidentiality relating
thereto shall belong solely to the Seller.

  

(b) Subject to _Section 6.02(a)_ , during the Interim Period, Seller shall
cause the Company to provide Buyer and its Representatives with reasonable
access, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business hours, to the
Assets of the Acquired Companies and the officers and employees of the Company
who have significant responsibility for the Assets of the Acquired Companies,
but only to the extent that such access (i) does not unreasonably interfere
with the Business of the Acquired Companies or the safe commercial operations
of the Assets of the Acquired Companies and (ii) is reasonably related to
Buyer's obligations and rights hereunder; _provided, however_ , that (A)
Seller and the Company shall have the right to have a Representative present
for any communication regarding the Company's operation of the Business, (B)
Buyer shall and shall cause its Representatives to observe and comply with all
health, safety and security requirements of the Company and (C) Buyer shall
not conduct any environmental sampling, testing or other intrusive or invasive
indoor or outdoor investigation of air, surface water, groundwater, soil or
anything else at or in connection with the Assets of the Acquired Companies
without Seller's prior approval, which approval may be withheld in Seller's
sole discretion. Buyer shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
Representatives to, hold in confidence all such information on the terms and
subject to the conditions contained in the Confidentiality Agreement;
_provided, however_ , that if the Confidentiality Agreement was executed by an
Affiliate of Buyer, then Buyer hereby agrees to be bound by and to comply with
the terms and conditions of such Confidentiality Agreement as if Buyer were
such Affiliate of Buyer. Notwithstanding the foregoing, during the Interim
Period, Buyer shall have no right of access to, and none of Seller, the
Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates shall have any obligation to
provide any information, the disclosure of which (1) would reasonably be
expected in the opinion of counsel to jeopardize any privilege available to
Seller, the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates, (2) would cause
Seller, the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates to breach a
confidentiality obligation to any third party that is not waived after
commercially reasonable efforts of Seller, (3) would result in a violation of
Law; _provided_ , _further_ , that, in each case, Seller shall notify Buyer in
writing that information has been withheld, provide the reason that the
information was withheld, and, where possible, redact such withheld
information but otherwise deliver any documents containing the withheld
information.

         

(c) Buyer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Seller, the Acquired Companies
and their respective Affiliates and any of their respective Representatives
for any and all Losses incurred by Seller, the Acquired Companies, any of
their respective Affiliates or their respective Representatives arising out of
the access rights under this _Section 6.02_ , including any Claims by any of
Buyer's Representatives for any injuries or property damage while accessing
any Assets purported to be held or used by Seller or the Acquired Companies,
except to the extent caused by the gross negligence or willful misconduct of
Seller or an Acquired Company.

  

(d) Buyer agrees that Buyer will not contact customers, potential customers,
suppliers, vendors, contractors or agents of the Acquired Companies or the
Company Employees with respect to this Agreement, the transactions
contemplated hereby or the Business of the Acquired Companies without the
prior written consent of Seller (which consent may be withheld by Seller in
its sole discretion).

  

Section 6.03. _Regulatory and Other Approvals; Cooperation_. During the
Interim Period:

  

(a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, each of
the Parties shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other Parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Law to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as practicable,
including: (i) the preparation and filing as promptly as practicable of all
necessary applications, notices, petitions, registrations, filings, ruling

licenses, orders, registrations, approvals, permits, rulings, authorizations
and clearances necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Governmental
Authority in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, (ii) the obtaining of all other necessary consents, approvals or
waivers from third parties, _provided, however_ , that none of Buyer, Seller
or any Acquired Company shall be obligated to make any payment in connection
with seeking such consents or approvals or shall have any liability for
failure to obtain any such consents or approvals; _provided, further_ , that
for purposes of clarification, the obtaining of such consents or approvals
shall not be a condition to the Closing except to the extent expressly set
forth in _Section 7.06_ or _Section 8.06_ , as applicable, and (iii) the
execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

(b) In connection with any required filings or approvals or consents of

reasonably required to complete lawfully the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

       

(c) Each Party shall provide prompt notification to the other when it becomes
aware that any consent or approval referred to in this _Section 6.03_ is

applicable HSR Act waiting period, shall promptly furnish each other with
copies of any notices, correspondence or other written communication with the
relevant Governmental Authority, shall promptly make any necessary or
advisable subsequent or supplemental filings or submissions required or
requested by the relevant Governmental Authority and shall, to the extent
reasonably necessary and appropriate, cooperate with and assist one another
in, and provide information necessary for, the preparation of such filings or
submissions. Buyer and Seller shall each be responsible for one half of all
filing fees in connection with filings under the HSR Act.

  

(ii) The Parties shall promptly notify each other of any communication
concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder with any

and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of the other
Parties in connection with, any proposed communication or submission
concerning this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereunder with any
Governmental Authority.

  

(iii) No Party shall participate in any meeting or substantive discussion with
any Governmental Authority in respect of any such filings or related
investigations or other inquiries, or enter into any agreement with any
Governmental Authority, unless, to the extent practicable, it consults with
the other Parties in advance and, to the extent practicable and permitted by
such Governmental Authority, gives the other Parties the opportunity to attend
and participate in such meeting or discussion.

  

(iv) Each Party shall promptly furnish the Other Party in advance, subject in
appropriate cases to appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit
disclosure to outside lawyers and consultants, with (A) draft copies prior to
submission to a Governmental Authority, with reasonable time and opportunity
to comment and discuss, of all correspondence, filings, materials and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) that they,
their subsidiaries or their respective Representatives intend to submit to any
Governmental Authority, it being understood that copies of correspondence,
filings, materials and communications received from any Governmental Authority
shall be immediately provided to the Other Party promptly upon receipt and (B)
such necessary information and reasonable assistance in connection with their
preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of information
to any Governmental Authority, including any filings necessary or appropriate
under the provisions of the HSR Act.

       

(v) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be construed so as to require a Party, or any of its respective Affiliates,
without its written consent, to (i) sell, license, dispose of, hold separate
or operate in any specified manner any of its respective assets, properties or
businesses (or to discuss, agree or commit to any of the foregoing), (ii)
enter into any Order or agreement that alters its business or commercial
practices in any way or that in any way limits or could reasonably be expected
to limit the right of Buyer to own, operate or retain all or any portion of
Buyer's or the Acquired Companies' assets, properties or businesses or Buyer's
freedom of action with respect thereto or to otherwise receive the full
benefits of this Agreement, (iii) contest, resist or defend any investigation
or Proceeding instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by any Governmental

or any Law that is effect and that enjoins, restrains, prevents, prohibits or
makes illegal the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The obligations of each Party under this _Section 6.03_ to use
commercially reasonable efforts shall be limited to compliance with the
reporting provisions of the HSR Act and with its obligations under this
_Section 6.03_.

  

(vi) Buyer and Seller shall not, and shall cause their respective Affiliates
not to, take any action that would reasonably be expected to adversely affect
the approval of any Governmental Authority of any of the filings referred to
in this _Section 6.03_.

  

Section 6.04. _Tax Matters_.

  

(a) With respect to any Tax Return that is required to be filed by any
Acquired Company on or prior to the Closing Date with respect to a Pre-Closing
Period, Seller shall prepare or cause to be prepared such Tax Return. With
respect to any Tax Return that is required to be filed by any Acquired Company
after the Closing Date for a Pre-Closing Period and with respect to a Straddle
Period, Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared such Tax Return. All such
Tax Returns shall be prepared on a basis consistent with past practice except
to the extent otherwise provided in this Agreement or otherwise required by
applicable Law. Reasonably in advance of the due date (including extensions)
for each Tax Return for a Pre-Closing Period or for a Straddle Period, the
Party responsible for preparing such Tax Return shall deliver a copy of such
Tax Return to the Other Party for its review and reasonable comment. The Party
responsible for preparing such Tax Return shall consider in good faith any
such comments received from the Other Party not less than 15 days prior to the
due date (including extensions) for filing such Tax Return and shall deliver a
final copy of such Tax Return to such Other Party not less than seven days
prior to such due date. Seller shall cause each Tax Return to be filed on or
prior to Closing Date to be timely filed and shall timely pay the Taxes shown
due thereon. The Parties agree that, notwithstanding any other provision
herein, all deductions that may be claimed by an Acquired Company with respect
to the payment of Transaction Expenses shall be allocated to Pre-Closing
Periods (or, if applicable, to the portion of any Straddle Period ending on
the Closing Date), and for the avoidance of doubt all such deductions shall be
allocated by such Acquired Company entirely to Seller, in each case, except as
otherwise required by applicable Law.

       

(b) Each of Buyer and Seller shall be liable for and pay, and shall indemnify
and hold harmless Seller from and against 50% of any and all Losses incurred
in connection with or arising from any sales Tax, use Tax, stamp Tax, transfer
Tax, conveyance, registration or other similar Tax imposed on the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, provided that the Parties will cooperate in
good faith to minimize the incurrence of any such Taxes.

  

(c) After the Closing, Seller and Buyer shall:

  

(i) assist the Other Party in preparing any Tax Returns which such Other Party
is responsible for preparing and filing in accordance with _Section 6.04(a)_ ,
and in connection therewith, provide the Other Party with any necessary powers
of attorney;

  

(ii) cooperate fully in preparing for and defending any audits of, or disputes
with Taxing Authorities regarding, any Tax Returns of the Acquired Companies;

  

(iii) make available to the other and to any Taxing Authority as reasonably
requested all information, records, and documents relating to Taxes of the
Acquired Companies; and

  

(iv) furnish the other with copies of all correspondence received from any
Taxing Authority in connection with any Tax audit or information request with
respect to the Acquired Companies.

  

(d) The portion of Taxes attributable to a Straddle Period that are allocated
to the portion of the taxable period of such Straddle Period ending on the
Closing Date shall be determined as follows:

  

(i) in the case of any Tax of an Acquired Company that is based on income,
sales, revenue, production or similar items, or other Taxes not described in
_Section 6.04(d)(ii)_ , and pertains or is attributable to any Straddle
Period, the amount of such Tax attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on Closing Date shall be determined based on an interim closing
of the books as of the close of business on the Closing Date; and

  

(ii) in the case of any liability of any Acquired Company for any real
property, personal property, ad valorem and similar Taxes attributable to a
Straddle Period, the amount of such property Tax attributable to the portion
of the taxable period ending on the Closing Date shall be deemed to be the
amount of such property Tax for the entire Straddle Period, multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in such Straddle Period
ending on and including the Closing Date, and the denominator of which is the
number of days in such Straddle Period.

       

(e) The Parties agree that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will be treated as the purchase and sale of the Assets of the Acquired
Companies (ignoring for this purpose any Equity Interests in an Acquired
Company that is disregarded as an entity separate from its owner) for U.S.
federal income tax purposes (and any applicable state or local Taxes that
follow the U.S. federal income tax treatment). Within 90 days after the
Closing Date (but no later than January 31, 2020), Buyer shall prepare or
cause to be prepared and delivered by Buyer an allocation schedule and any
supporting documents related thereto (the " _Allocation Schedule_ "),
allocating the Purchase Price (as adjusted for any other amounts that are
required to be taken into account as consideration for the purchase and sale
contemplated under this Agreement for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, including liabilities of the Company) among the assets of the
Acquired Companies for all purposes (including Tax and financial accounting)
in a manner consistent with Section 1060 of the Code and Treasury Regulations
thereunder. Within 30 days after receiving such Allocation Schedule, Seller
shall notify Buyer in writing regarding any objections Seller may have to the
allocations on the Allocation Schedule, together with the basis for any such
objections. Seller and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve any
disagreement regarding the Allocation Schedule as soon as practicable (taking
into account the due date of any Tax Returns on which the allocation set forth
in the Allocation Schedule is required to be reflected) and shall memorialize
any agreed allocation in a final Allocation Schedule, which shall be final and
binding; _provided, however_ , if the disagreements with respect to
the Allocation Schedule cannot be resolved by Buyer and Seller with 30 days
after Seller notifies Buyer in writing of such objections, then, at the
request of Buyer or Seller, Buyer and Seller shall promptly engage the
Accounting Firm to resolve the disagreement, and the Accounting Firm's
determination of the Allocation Schedule shall be final and binding on the
Parties. The fees of the Accounting Firm will be paid one-half by Buyer and
one-half by Seller. Buyer and Seller shall, and shall cause the Acquired
Companies and any Buyer Affiliates (with respect to Buyer) and any Seller
Affiliates (with respect to Seller) to, report and file Tax Returns in all
respects consistent with any final Allocation Schedule. None of Buyer, Seller,
the Acquired Companies, or any of their respective Affiliates shall take any
position for Tax purposes (whether in audits, Tax Returns or otherwise) that
is inconsistent with any final Allocation Schedule unless required to do so by
applicable Law. If any Taxing Authority disputes the allocation set forth in
the Allocation Schedule, the Party that receives notice (or the Party whose
Affiliate receives notice) of the dispute shall promptly notify the Other
Party of such dispute and the Parties shall cooperate in good faith in
responding to such dispute in order to preserve the effectiveness of the
allocation set forth in the Allocation Schedule.

 

(f) Without the prior written consent of Buyer (which consent may be withheld
in Buyer's sole discretion), Seller (and, prior to the Closing, the Acquired
Companies) shall not, to the extent it may affect, or relate to, the Acquired
Companies, make, change, or rescind any Tax election, amend any Tax Return or
take any position on any Tax Return, take any action, omit to take
any action, or enter into any other transaction that would have any effect on
Buyer or the Acquired Companies.

 

(g) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Buyer and Seller agree to
report each indemnification payment made in respect of a Loss as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for U.S. federal income tax purposes (and
for purposes of any applicable state or local Taxes that follow the U.S.
federal income tax treatment).

 

Section 6.05. _Public Announcements_. _ _ The Parties will consult with each
other prior to issuing any press release or making a public announcement of
any nature with respect to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated
hereby and shall not make or issue, or cause to be made or issued, any such
press release or public announcement prior to such consultation and without
the prior written consent of the Other Party (which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) except to the extent, but only to such
extent, that, in the opinion of the Party issuing such press release or making
such public announcement may be required by Law, any listing agreement with
any securities exchange or any securities exchange regulation, in which case
the Party proposing to issue such press release or make such public
announcement shall use its reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with
the Other Party before issuing any such press release or making such public
announcement and shall reasonably cooperate with the Other Party in good
faith with respect to the timing, manner and content of disclosure.

     

Section 6.06. _Confidentiality_. __

 

(a) Buyer agrees to be bound by the Confidentiality Agreement as if it were a
signatory, and shall, and shall cause each member of the Buyer Group to, hold
in confidence all documents and information furnished to it by or on behalf of
Seller, the Acquired Companies or their respective Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement pursuant to the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement; _provided, however_ , that, at Closing the
Confidentiality Agreement and the obligations under this _Section 6.06(a)_
shall terminate (even with respect to retained Confidential Information (as

Companies). If for any reason this Agreement is terminated prior to the
Closing Date, the Confidentiality Agreement shall nonetheless continue in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms.

 

(b) The Parties agree to keep the terms of this Agreement confidential, except

applicable Law or Order or requested by any Governmental Authority or self-
regulatory organization having jurisdiction over either Party; _provided_
, that the Party required or requested to make such disclosure uses
reasonable efforts to consult in good faith with the Other Party before making
such disclosure and reasonably cooperates with the Other Party in good faith
with respect to the timing, manner and content of such disclosure, (ii) as
may be required to enforce the terms of this Agreement, defend itself from
Claims arising under this Agreement, or for purposes of compliance with
financial reporting obligations, (iii) in connection with obtaining or
maintaining the RandW Policy or pursuing any Claims with respect thereto, (iv)
to their respective Representatives (including prior to the Closing with
respect to Seller, the employees of the Company) as necessary in connection
with the ordinary conduct of their respective businesses, (v) to any direct
and indirect holders of Equity Interests in such Party or any Affiliate of
such Party and (vi) any bona fide potential lender to such Party that is a
commercial bank, investment bank or similar financial institution.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement and without
limiting the foregoing, Seller may disclose to its current or prospective
direct or indirect partners and limited partners any information,
including information relating to this Agreement, as is required to be
disclosed by Seller under its partnership agreement or limited liability
company agreement, as applicable, or as is customarily disclosed by Seller to
current or prospective direct or indirect partners and limited partners in
the ordinary course of business (including a summary of historic investments).

 

(c) From and after the Closing Date, except with the express prior written
approval of Buyer and subject to the last sentence of  _Section 6.06(b)_ ,
Seller shall hold, and shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to hold,
in confidence and not disclose to any third party and shall not use, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives not to use, for any purpose,
any and all information, whether written or oral, concerning the Acquired
Companies, the Assets or the Business; _provided_ , _however_ , that Seller
may use any such information that is or becomes generally available to the
public (other than as a result of its disclosure by Seller or its Affiliates
or Representatives in breach of this _Section 6.06(c)_ );  _provided_ ,
_further_ , that Seller shall be able to use any such information (i) as may
be reasonably required by Seller in connection with any insurance claims by,
actions, suits or Proceedings or Tax audits against or governmental
investigations of Seller or any of its Affiliates, (ii) to comply with
its obligations, or enforce its rights, under this Agreement and each
Transaction Document or (iii) to the extent such disclosure is otherwise
required by applicable Law or Order. If any Seller or its Affiliates or
Representatives is compelled to disclose any such information by judicial or
administrative process or by other requirements of applicable Law or Order,
Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing prior to such disclosure and
shall disclose or cause its Affiliates or Representatives to disclose only
that portion of such information that Seller is advised by its counsel that is
legally required to be disclosed _; provided_ , that Seller shall, at Buyer's
expense, exercise its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an appropriate
protective order or other reasonable assurance that confidential treatment
will be accorded such information.

     

Section 6.07. _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) During the Interim Period, upon reasonable prior notice, Buyer shall be
permitted to engage in discussions with management of the Company during
normal business hours regarding the terms of their employment, compensation,
benefits, and equity participation arrangements with the Company and its
Affiliates and negotiate any employment, compensation, or retention
arrangements desirable (to be effective on or after the Closing) with any
officer, director, or employee of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ , that

unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), Seller may have an officer,
director, employee or manager of Seller present at all such discussions and
negotiations.

 

(b) The Company shall have all obligations, and Buyer shall cause the Company
to take all actions required, from and after the Closing under the Company
Plans, and Seller and its Affiliates shall have no obligation or liability
with respect to the Company Plans after the Closing.

 

(c) Notwithstanding _Section 6.07(b)_ , from and after the Closing, Buyer
shall, and shall cause its Affiliates, including the Company, to, honor and
continue all employment, incentive, severance, retention and termination
plans, policies, programs, agreements and arrangements, in each case in
accordance with their terms as in effect immediately prior to the Closing,
including with respect to any payments, benefits or rights arising as a result
of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (either alone or in
combination with any other event). Without limiting the foregoing, Buyer
shall cause the Company to pay all amounts payable to the employees of the
Company who are employed as of the Closing (" _Company Employees_ ") in
connection with accrued but unpaid compensation and bonuses, as of the
Closing, in accordance with the Company Plan that provides annual incentive
compensation for fiscal year 2019 for the Company Employees in accordance
with the terms of such Company Plan as in effect as of the Effective Date,
which shall be paid no later than two and one-half months after the last day
of fiscal year 2019; _provided_ that such accrued and unpaid incentive
compensation shall not be less than the amounts accrued by the Company through
the Closing Date with respect to each Company Employee who is employed on the
Closing Date.

     

(d) After the Closing, at the direction of Seller, Seller shall fund, and
Buyer, acting purely as the agent for Seller as a matter of convenience,
shall cause the Company to pay on behalf of Seller through its payroll
provider, a Sale Incentive Bonus to each Company Employee who (x) is entitled
to a Sale Incentive Bonus, as determined by Seller in its sole discretion and
(y) has executed a release of the Acquired Companies, in form and substance
approved by Buyer prior to the execution of this Agreement, with respect to
any and all Claims against the Acquired Companies with respect to such Sale
Incentive Bonus. The Parties agree that (i) Seller shall be solely
responsible for determining the amounts payable under any Sale Incentive Bonus
Agreement, (ii) Seller shall fund all Sale Incentive Bonus payments by wire
transfer in immediately available funds to the Company's payroll provider
within 35 days after the Closing Date, (iii) Buyer shall cause the Company's
payroll provider to pay such Sale Incentive Bonuses to the Company Employees
in accordance with the instructions delivered to Buyer by Seller, and
(iv) Seller shall be entitled to report on all applicable Tax Returns all
income tax deductions resulting from the accrual and related payment of the
Sale Incentive Bonus and neither Party shall take any inconsistent position on
any Tax Return or otherwise, except as a result of or in response to any
subsequent Tax Claim. Clauses (i) through (iii) of this _Section 6.07(d)_
shall survive the Closing until all amounts due and payable under the Sale
Incentive Bonus Agreements have been paid.

 

(e) For all purposes (including for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate, level of benefits, vesting and benefit accruals (but not for
purposes of defined benefit pension accruals)) under any "employee benefit
plan" (as such term is defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, but without regard to
whether the applicable plan is subject to ERISA) and any other employee
benefit plan, program, policy or arrangement maintained by Buyer or any of
its Affiliates, including the Company, including any vacation, paid time off
and severance plans, each Company Employee's service with or otherwise
credited by the Company or any of its Affiliates shall be treated as service
with Buyer or any of its Affiliates, including the Company; _provided,
however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits.

 

(f) Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates, including the Company to,
waive, or cause to be waived, any pre-existing condition
limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods
under any welfare benefit plan maintained by Buyer or any of its Affiliates,
including the Company, in which Company Employees (and their eligible
dependents) will be eligible to participate from and after the Closing,
except to the extent that such pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions,
actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods would not have been
satisfied or waived under the comparable Company Plan immediately prior
to the Closing. Buyer shall, or shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Company) to, recognize, or cause to be recognized, the dollar amount of all
co-payments, deductibles and similar expenses incurred under the Company Plans
by each Company Employee (and his or her eligible dependents) during the
calendar year in which the Closing occurs for purposes of satisfying such
year's deductible and co-payment limitations under the relevant welfare
benefit plans in which such Company Employee (and dependents) will be
eligible to participate from and after the Closing; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that Seller must provide, or cause to be provided, to Buyer all necessary
documentation held or reasonably accessible by Seller in order to effectuate
the foregoing within 30 days after the Closing Date.

     

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall (i) be
treated as an amendment of any Company Plan or any other arrangement
or create any rights or obligations except between the parties hereto, (ii)
give any employee or former employee or any other individual associated
therewith or any employee benefit plan or trustee thereof or any other third
person any right to enforce the provisions of this _Section 6.07_ or entitle
any person not a party to this Agreement to assert any claim hereunder, or
(iii) obligate Buyer, the Company or any of their Affiliates to (A) maintain
any particular benefit plan, except in accordance with the terms of such plan
or (B) retain the employment of any particular employee.

 

Section 6.08. _D andO Coverage_. __

 

(a) Prior to or at the Closing, the Company shall purchase a "tail" policy of
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Closing with respect to those persons who are
currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy on the same terms and scope with respect to such coverage,
and amount, for such individuals for six years after the Closing.

 

(b) For a period of six years following the Closing, Buyer shall not, and
shall cause the Company not to, make any material alteration or amendment to
any directors' or officers' liability insurance or to provisions of any
directors' or officers' indemnification under Charter Documents of the Company
that, in either case, would negatively affect coverage, exculpation or
indemnification of the directors and officers of the Company at or prior to
the Closing who are currently covered by the Company's directors' and
officers' liability insurance policy. Buyer shall, and shall cause
the Company to, require any successor to the Company (whether by merger,
purchase or otherwise) to be bound by the provisions of this _Section 6.08_ ,
it being the intent of Buyer and Seller that the directors and officers of
the Company at or prior to the Closing who are currently covered by the
Company's directors' and officers' liability insurance policy shall continue
to be entitled to such coverage, exculpation and indemnification to the
greatest extent permitted under the Laws of the State of Delaware.

 

(c) The obligations of Buyer under this _Section 6.08_ shall not be terminated
or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Person to whom this
_Section 6.08_ applies without the consent of the affected Person, it being
expressly agreed that each Person to whom this _Section 6.08_ applies shall be
a third-party beneficiary of this _Section 6.08_.

 

Section 6.09. _Further Assurances_. _ _ Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at any time or from time to time after the Closing, at any
Party's request and without further consideration, the Other Party shall (and
in the case of Buyer, Buyer shall and shall cause the Acquired Companies, as
applicable, to) execute and deliver to such Party such other instruments of
sale, transfer, conveyance, assignment and confirmation, provide such
materials and information and take such other actions as such Party may
reasonably request in order to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. Buyer agrees to provide such assurances as to financial
capability, resources and creditworthiness as may be reasonably requested by
any third party whose consent or approval is sought under this Agreement.

 

Section 6.10. _Resignation and Removal_. Notwithstanding anything in this
Agreement to the contrary, at or prior to the Closing, Seller may (though it
need not do so, except as provided in _Section 2.04(d)_ ) cause or accept the
resignation or removal of any manager, partner, officer and/or director, as
applicable, nominated or appointed by Seller or its Affiliates to any board or
operating, management or other committee of any Acquired Company.

     

Section 6.11. _Certain Payments_. _ _ At or prior to the Closing,

 

(a) Seller will pay, or cause the Acquired Companies to pay, all Transaction
Expenses; and

 

(b) Seller shall cause any accounts payable or accounts receivable between an
Acquired Company, on the one hand, and Seller or a Non-Company Affiliate, on
the other hand, to be paid in full.

 

Section 6.12. _Post-Closing Access to Information_. __ After the Closing Date,
and subject to any confidentiality restrictions and attorney-client privilege,
Seller and Buyer shall grant each other (or their respective designees),
and Buyer shall cause the Acquired Companies to grant to Seller (or its
designees), access at all reasonable times to all of the books, ledgers,
minute books, files, reports, plans, corporate and operating records and any
other material documents relating to the Business in Buyer's, Seller's or the
Non-Company Affiliates' possession or the possession of any Acquired Company
and that relate to the period of time prior to the Closing (the " _Records_
"), and shall afford such Party the right (at such Party's expense) to take
extracts therefrom and to make copies thereof, to the extent reasonably
necessary to implement the provisions of, or to investigate or defend any
Claims among the Parties and/or their Affiliates arising under, this
Agreement. Each Party shall maintain, and Buyer shall cause the Acquired
Companies to maintain, such Records until the seventh anniversary of the
Closing Date (or for such longer period of time as a Party shall advise the
Other Party is necessary in order to have the Records available with respect
to Tax matters), or if any of the Records pertain to any Claim or
dispute pending on the seventh anniversary of the Closing Date, such Party
shall maintain any of the Records designated by such Party or its
Representatives until such Claim or dispute is finally resolved and the time
for all appeals has been exhausted.

 

Section 6.13. _Delivery of Records_. Within 30 Business Days after the
Closing, Seller shall deliver to Buyer all Records of the Acquired Companies
in the possession or control of Seller or its Affiliates or otherwise not
located at the premises of the Acquired Companies.

 

Section 6.14. _Exclusivity_. __From the Effective Date until the earlier of
the Closing Date or the termination of this Agreement, Seller agrees that it
will not, and will cause its Affiliates not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
encourage, solicit, initiate, facilitate or continue inquiries regarding an
Acquisition Proposal; (ii) enter into discussions or negotiations with, or
provide any information to, any Person concerning a possible Acquisition
Proposal; or (iii) enter into any agreements or other instruments (whether or
not binding) regarding an Acquisition Proposal. Seller shall immediately cease
and cause to be terminated, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the
Company) and all of its and their Representatives to immediately cease and
cause to be terminated, all existing discussions or negotiations with any
Persons conducted heretofore with respect to, or that could lead to, an
Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein,
Seller, its Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives may
respond to any unsolicited proposal regarding an Acquisition Proposal by
indicating that Seller and the Acquired Companies are subject to an
exclusivity agreement and are unable to provide any information related to
the Acquired Companies or the Business or entertain any proposals or offers or
engage in any negotiations or discussions concerning an Acquisition Proposal
for as long as this Agreement remains in effect. For purposes hereof,
"Acquisition Proposal" will mean any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person (other than Buyer or any of its Affiliates) concerning (i) a merger,
consolidation, liquidation, recapitalization, equity exchange or
other business combination transaction directly or indirectly involving
Seller or the Acquired Companies; (ii) the issuance or acquisition, directly
or indirectly, of any equity securities in Seller or the Acquired Companies;
or (iii) the sale, lease, exchange or other disposition of any material
portion of the Company's Assets outside of the ordinary course of business.

     

Section 6.15. _Casualty Loss and Takings_. During the Interim Period, if the
Assets of the Acquired Companies are damaged by fire, explosion, act of God,
theft, vandalism, flood, wind, earthquake, sabotage, explosion, equipment
failure or otherwise (each such event, an " _Event of Loss_ "), or are taken
by a Governmental Authority by exercise of the power of eminent domain or
condemnation or for which an Acquired Company or Seller receives written
notice that such Asset will be taken (each, a " _Taking_ "), then Seller shall
notify Buyer promptly in writing of such Event of Loss or Taking and the
following provisions of this _Section 6.15_ shall apply:

 

(a) Following the occurrence of (i) any one or more Events of Loss, if the
aggregate costs to restore, repair or replace the Assets of the Acquired
Companies subject to such Event of Loss to a condition reasonably comparable
to their prior condition, plus the amount of any lost profits reasonably
expected to accrue after Closing as a result of such Event of Loss, such
amount pursuant to this clause (i) to be determined by an independent third
party appraiser or other qualified expert selected by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to Seller (collectively, " _Restoration Costs_ "), or (ii) any one
or more Takings, if the value of the Real Property subject to such Taking plus
the amount of any lost profits reasonably expected to accrue after Closing as
a result of such Taking, less any condemnation award received by Buyer
(provided that any such condemnation award is made available to Buyer), such
amount pursuant to this clause (ii) to be determined by an independent third
party appraiser or other qualified expert selected by Buyer and reasonably
acceptable to Seller (collectively, the " _Condemnation Value_ "), is, in the
aggregate, less than or equal to $5,000,000, there shall be no effect on the
transactions contemplated hereby (including for purposes of the Closing
conditions, the Adjustment Amount and the termination provisions hereunder),
except that Buyer shall be entitled to receive all insurance proceeds
attributed to the Event of Loss or Taking and any condemnation award, and any
such proceeds and award will be excluded from the calculation of the Closing
Working Capital.

 

(b) Subject to the termination right of Buyer set forth in _Section 6.15(d)_ ,
upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of Loss or Takings involving
aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value in excess of $5,000,000 (a
" _Major Loss_ "), Seller shall have, in the case of a Major Loss, the
option, exercised by written notice to Buyer, to restore, repair or replace
the damaged Assets prior to Closing to a condition reasonably comparable to
their condition as of the Effective Date. If Seller elects to so restore,
repair or replace the assets or properties relating to a Major Loss, which
election shall be made by notice to Buyer prior to the Closing Date and as
soon as practicable following the occurrence of the Major Loss (a " _Repair
Election_ "), Seller will complete or cause to be completed prior to
the Closing, as a condition to Buyer's obligation to consummate the Closing,
the repair, replacement or restoration of the damaged Assets to a condition
reasonably comparable to their condition as of the Effective Date, and the
Closing Date shall be postponed (and the Outside Date shall be extended)
until the amount of time reasonably necessary to complete the restoration,
repair or replacement of such Assets as reasonably agreed by Buyer and Seller
has elapsed, but not more than 60 days past the original Outside Date. During
such repair period, Seller shall consult with Buyer on a regular basis
regarding the status of the repair and method of repair and shall take into
account Buyer's reasonable comments and requests in performing such repair.
If (i) Seller does not deliver a Repair Election, (ii) the repair is not
performed in accordance with the provisions of this _Section 6.15(b)_ or
(iii) such Major Loss is the result in whole or in part of one or more
Takings or is otherwise not capable of being restored, repaired or replaced,
the provisions of _Section 6.15(c)_ will apply.

     

(c) Subject to the termination right of Buyer set forth in _Section 6.15(d)_ ,
in the event that (i) Seller does not deliver a Repair Election, (ii) the
repair is not performed in accordance with the provisions of _Section 6.15(b)_
, or (iii) the Major Loss is the result in whole or in part of one or more
Takings or is otherwise not capable of being restored, repaired or replaced,
then the Parties shall (A) promptly cause an independent third-party appraiser
or other qualified person selected by Buyer and reasonably acceptable to
Seller to determine the Restoration Costs as of such date, taking into
consideration all repair, replacement and restoration work, if any, actually
completed by Seller (the " _Remaining Restoration Costs_ "), (B) reduce the
Purchase Price payable at Closing by an amount equal to such Remaining
Restoration Costs  _less_ any proceeds received by the Acquired Companies
prior to the Closing (in connection with insurance claims or claims against
third parties) as a result of such Casualty Loss or Takings; and (c) proceed
to Closing (subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the other Closing
conditions); _provided, however_ , that there shall be no effect on the
transactions contemplated hereby (including for purposes of the Closing
conditions, the Adjustment Amount and the termination provisions hereunder)
following such reduction in the Purchase Price. To assist Buyer in
its evaluation of any and all Events of Loss, Seller shall provide Buyer with
reasonable access, upon reasonable prior notice and during normal business
hours, to the affected Assets and such information as Buyer may reasonably
request in connection therewith, but only to the extent that such access (x)
does not unreasonably interfere with the Business of the Acquired Companies or
the safe commercial operations of the Assets of the Acquired Companies and (y)
is reasonably related to Buyer's obligations under this _Section 6.15_.
Subject to the following sentence, after the Closing, Buyer shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to submit claims and recover proceeds under
any insurance policies that provide coverage for Casualty Losses or Takings
that resulted in a Purchase Price reduction in accordance with this _Section
6.15(c)_ (such claims, " _Post-Closing Insurance Claims_ ") and, if any
amounts are paid or to be paid by the insurer in respect thereof, Buyer shall
request that such insurer make payment directly to Seller in such amount or
Buyer shall transfer such proceeds directly to Seller no later than 10 days
after receipt of such proceeds. At Seller's election, if contractually
and legally authorized under the applicable insurance policies, Buyer shall
take, and shall cause the Acquired Companies to take, all reasonably necessary
action for the Seller to bring and manage a claim against the applicable
insurance policies in Buyer's name or in the name of the Acquired Companies;
_provided, however_ , that Buyer shall, and shall cause the Acquired Companies
to, take all action reasonably necessary to assist and cooperate with Seller
in managing and adjusting such claim. Notwithstanding anything in this
_Section 6.15(c)_ to the contrary, the aggregate proceeds payable to Seller
in respect of any Post-Closing Insurance Claims shall not exceed the total
amount of the Purchase Price reduction.

        

(d) In the event that the aggregate Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value
with respect to one or more Events of Loss and/or Takings equals an amount in
excess of $20,000,000, then either Party shall have the right to terminate
this Agreement; _provided_ , that in the event that Buyer delivers written
notice to Seller that the Purchase Price reduction shall be an amount not
greater than $20,000,000 regardless of the actual amount of aggregate
Restoration Costs and Condemnation Value, then Seller shall not be permitted
to terminate this Agreement pursuant this _Section 6.15(d)_.

  

Section 6.16. _R andW Policy_. __ Buyer has entered into a binder agreement (the
" _Binder Agreement_ ") of a buyer-side representation and warranty insurance
policy to be issued simultaneously with the execution of this Agreement (the "
_R andW Insurance Policy_"), to provide Buyer with recourse with respect to
Losses, suffered or incurred from claims of breaches of representations and
warranties arising under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents.
Buyer and its Affiliates shall not, and shall not consent to, amend, waive or
otherwise modify the Binder Agreement or the RandW Insurance Policy in any
manner that would allow the RandW Insurance Provider to subrogate or otherwise
make or bring any claim or suit against the Seller, its Affiliates or their
Representatives, other than in the case of Fraud by such Person. All
qualifications and exceptions contained in _Article III_ and _Article IV_
relating to materiality or words of similar import (including "Material
Adverse Effect") shall be disregarded for purposes of determining whether
there has been a breach or inaccuracy of any such representation or warranty
and for purposes of determining the amount of Losses resulting therefrom.

  

Section 6.17. _Seller Marks_. Except in connection with historical, tax,
employment or similar references to the Business, or for purposes of a
prospectus or similar disclosures as are necessary and appropriate to describe
the historical relationship of the Acquired Companies and Seller and its
Affiliates or as otherwise required by Law, Seller agrees that as soon as
practicable following the Closing, but in no event later than 60 days after
the Closing, Seller shall cease and permanently discontinue any and all uses
of any names, business names, trade names, brand names, registered and
unregistered trademarks, logos or service marks of Seller or the Acquired
Companies (collectively, the " _Seller 's Marks_") (or any variation or
derivative of such Seller's Marks or any other similar Intellectual Property
confusingly similar thereto), and permanently remove or cover all Seller's
Marks from any publications, signage, corporate letterhead, invoices,
stationery, business cards, marketing materials, website content or other
materials in the possession or under the control of Seller bearing any of
Seller's Marks (except to the extent any such materials must be retained to
comply with applicable Laws or document retention notices issued by any
Governmental Authority, have been archived, or are contained in electronic
backups maintained by the Seller or its Affiliates in accordance with their
standard document retention procedures). Within 60 days after the Closing
Date, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, make all filings with
any Governmental Authority to effect the elimination of any use of the trade
name "Leaf River" from the businesses of Seller or its Affiliates.

  

Section 6.18. _Non-Solicitation_. For a period of one year after the Closing
Date, Seller will not, and will cause the MIRA Affiliates not to, directly or
indirectly solicit the employment or services of, or otherwise employ or
engage any Company Employee then-employed by Buyer or the Company who was an
employee of the Company as of the Effective Date; provided, however, that
Seller and the MIRA Affiliates shall not be prohibited from soliciting or
hiring (a) any such Company Employee who approaches Seller or any such MIRA
Affiliate of his or own initiative, without any direct or indirect
solicitation by Seller or such MIRA Affiliate or (b) any such Company Employee
who responds to an advertisement or other general solicitation that is not
targeted, directly or indirectly, at Buyer, the Company or any then-current
Company Employee. The Parties agree and acknowledge that the limitations as to
time and scope of activity to be restrained by this _Section 6.18_ are
reasonable, do not impose any greater restraint than is necessary to protect
the legitimate business interests of Buyer and are fair in light of the amount
of compensation that Seller is receiving in connection with this Agreement,
either directly or indirectly.

         

Section 6.19. _Notification of Post-Signing Matters_. During the Interim
Period, the Seller shall promptly notify Buyer in writing with respect to any
matter first arising or occurring after the Effective Date which, if such
matter had arisen or occurred prior to or on the Effective Date, would have
been required to be set forth or described in the Schedules (a " _Post-Signing
Matter_ ") only if Seller expressly acknowledges in writing that such Post-
Signing Matter causes the conditions to Closing set forth in _Section 7.01_ or
_Section 7.02_ to fail to be satisfied, in which case Buyer shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01(e)_ (subject to
any applicable cure periods and the proviso in _Section 9.01(e)_ ) or, subject
to the satisfaction (or waiver) of the other conditions set forth in _Article
VII_ and _Article VIII_ , proceed with the Closing. For avoidance of doubt,
Seller shall not, and shall cause its MIRA Affiliates that are involved in the
negotiation of the Transaction Documents and Representatives not to, notify
Buyer of any other Post-Signing Matter.

have completed the repair, replacement or restoration of the Assets affected

(c) by either Seller or Buyer, if any final, non-appealable Order issued, or
Law enacted, entered into or promulgated, issued, adopted, decreed or
otherwise implemented by a Governmental Authority, in each case permanently
restrains, enjoins, has the effect of making illegal or otherwise prohibits
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a

_Section 7.04_ , _Section 7.05_ , _Section 8.04_ or _Section 8.05_ ;
_provided,_ that the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this
_Section 9.01(c)_ shall not be available to a Party whose failure to act in

been cured by the earlier of 30 days after written notice thereof is delivered
to Buyer and the Outside Date; _provided, however_ , that Seller shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(d)_

agreement contained in this Agreement and such breach would give rise to the
failure of a condition set forth in _Section 7.01_ or _Section 7.02_ if
continuing on the Closing Date;

  

(e) by Buyer, if Seller shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties, covenants or agreements contained in this Agreement, and such

been cured by the earlier of 30 days after written notice thereof is delivered
to Seller and the Outside Date; _provided, however_ , that Buyer shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this _Section 9.01(e)_

contained in this Agreement and such breach would give rise to the failure of
a condition set forth in _Section 8.01_ or _Section 8.02_ if continuing on the
Closing Date; or

  

(f) by Seller, by written notice to Buyer, if (i) all of the conditions set
forth in _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ have been satisfied (other than any
conditions set forth _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ that by their nature are
to be satisfied by actions taken at the Closing or any unsatisfied conditions
that Seller is willing to waive or that result from Buyer's breach), (ii)
Buyer has failed to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
by the date the Closing should have occurred pursuant to _Section 2.03_ ,

forth in _Article VII_ and _Article VIII_ have been satisfied (other than any

result from Buyer's breach) or that it is willing to waive any unsatisfied
conditions to its obligation to consummate the Closing as set forth in
_Article VIII_ , and that Seller stands ready, willing and able to consummate
the Closing and (iv) Buyer fails to consummate the Closing within five
Business Days after Seller's delivery of such notice.

       

  

(g) by either Seller or Buyer in accordance with, but subject to, the
provisions of _Section 6.15(d)_.

  

Section 9.02. _Effect of Termination_. __ If any Party terminates this
Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.01_ , all obligations and liabilities of the
Parties under this Agreement shall terminate and become void; _provided,
however_ , that (i) nothing herein shall relieve any Party (A) from liability
for any willful or intentional breach of any representation, warranty,
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or (B) from its indemnification
obligations pursuant to _Section 6.02(c)_ , in each case arising prior to the
date of such termination, and (ii) the terms of _Section 6.05_ , _Section

hereunder and thereunder shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the Laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice or
conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of New York or any
other jurisdiction) that would permit or require the application of the laws
of another jurisdiction.

 

 (b) SUBJECT TO _Section 2.06(d)(viii)_ , ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR
PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY MAY BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN EACH CASE LOCATED
IN THE CITY OF NEW YORK AND COUNTY OF NEW YORK, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY
SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION
OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL
TO SUCH PARTYS ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS
FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE
PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF
VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE
AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION
OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM.

 

 (c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY THAT MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS
CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT
ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE OTHER TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS
OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS
AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (I) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER
PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT
SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (II) SUCH
PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (III) SUCH PARTY MAKES
THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (IV) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS
IN THIS _SECTION 11.10(c)_.

   Section 11.11. _Specific Performance._

 

 (a) Each Party hereby acknowledges and agrees that the rights of each Party
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby are special, unique and of
extraordinary character and that, if any Party violates or fails or refuses to
perform any covenant or agreement made by it herein, the non-breaching Party
may be without an adequate remedy at law. If any Party violates or fails or
refuses to perform any covenant or agreement made by such Party herein
(including failing to comply with its obligations under _Section 6.03_ ), then
the non-breaching Party, subject to the terms hereof and in addition to any
remedy at law for damages or other relief, may institute and prosecute an
action in any court of competent jurisdiction to enforce specific performance
of such covenant or agreement or seek any other equitable relief.

 

 (b) Without limiting the general right to specific performance set forth in
_Section 11.01(a)_ , each of the Parties acknowledges and agrees that, due to
the nature of the Acquired Companies, including the unique nature of the
customer relationships and other facts and circumstances, a non-breaching
Party would be damaged irreparably if a Party breaches its obligation to
consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as required
hereunder, provided that all of the conditions to Closing set forth hereunder
have been satisfied or waived by the Party seeking to enforce this Agreement
(other than the covenants in _Section 2.03_ , _Section 2.04_ and _Section
2.05_ , which the Party seeking enforcement would be otherwise prepared to
satisfy at Closing, as applicable). Accordingly, in the event of any such
breach of a Partys obligation to consummate the Closing, provided that all of
the conditions to Closing set forth hereunder have been satisfied or waived by
the Party seeking to enforce this Agreement (other than the covenants in
_Section 2.03_ , _Section 2.04_ and _Section 2.05_ , which the Party seeking
enforcement would be otherwise prepared to satisfy at Closing, as applicable),
then the Parties acknowledge and agree that, prior to a termination of this
Agreement by either Party pursuant to _Section 9.01_ , the Party seeking to
enforce this Agreement shall be entitled, at its election, to specifically
enforce the performance of the Other Partys obligation to consummate the
Closing as required hereunder in any Proceeding, including a Proceeding for
injunctive relief. If, prior to the Outside Date, any Party brings an action
to specifically enforce the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement by another Party, then the Outside Date shall automatically be
extended by the amount of time during which such action is pending.

 

 (c) Each of the Parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an
injunction, specific performance or other equitable relief when expressly
available pursuant to the terms of this Agreement on the basis that (i) there
is adequate remedy at law or (ii) an award of specific performance is not an
appropriate remedy for any reason in equity or at law, other than on the basis
that such remedy is not expressly available pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. Any Party seeking an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches
or threatened breaches of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement when expressly available pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement shall not be required to provide any bond or other security in
connection with any such order or injunction.

   Section 11.12. _Non-Recourse_. Other than with respect to the RandW Insurance
Policy, this Agreement may only be enforced against, and any Claim based upon,
arising out of, or related to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution or
performance of this Agreement may only be brought against, the entities that
are expressly named as Parties hereto and then only with respect to the
specific obligations set forth herein or therein with respect to such Party.
For further clarity, no past, present or future director, manager, officer,
employee, incorporator, manager, member, partner, stockholder, Affiliate,
agent, attorney or other Representative (in each case, in their capacities as
such) of any Party or of any Affiliate of any Party hereto, or any of their
successors or permitted assigns (collectively, the " _Non-Party Affiliates_
"), shall have any liability for any obligations or liabilities of any Party
under this Agreement or for any Claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the other Transaction
Documents, and each Party hereby waives and releases all such liabilities
against any such Non-Party Affiliates. The Non-Party Affiliates are expressly
intended as third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 11.12_.

 

 Section 11.13. _Financing Sources_.

 

 (a) Each Party covenants and agrees that (i) it shall not institute, and
shall cause its Affiliates not to institute, a legal proceeding (whether at
Law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) against any of the
Financing Sources arising under or in connection with this Agreement, the Debt
Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing, or the negotiation, execution, or
performance of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt
Financing, and (ii) none of such Financing Sources shall have any liability or
obligations (whether at Law, in equity, in contract, in tort, or otherwise) to
any Party, or any of the respective Affiliates or Representatives of any
Party, arising under or in connection with this Agreement, or the negotiation,
execution, or performance of this Agreement, the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Debt Financing.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, each Party
hereby (i) agrees that it will not bring or support, or permit any of its
Affiliates or Representatives to bring or support, any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description,
whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
against any Financing Source in any way relating to this Agreement or any of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in any forum other than the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York (and appellate
courts thereof), or if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is vested
in the Federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), (ii) irrevocably waives,
to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which it may now or
hereafter have to the laying of venue of, and the defense of an inconvenient
forum to the maintenance of, any such action in any such court, (iii) agrees
that a final judgment in any such action shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any manner
provided by laws, (iv) agrees that the laws of the State of New York shall
govern any such action and (v) agrees that all of the provisions of _Section
11.10_ relating to waiver of jury trial shall apply to any action, cause of
action, claim, cross-claim, or third party claim referenced in this _Section
11.13(b)_.

 

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
_Section 11.05_ , _Section 11.06_ , _Section 11.07_ and the provisions of
_Section 11.10_ relating to governing law and waiver of jury trial and this
_Section 11.13_ are for the benefit of and may be enforced by the Financing
Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the Debt Financing. 

 

 (d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, 
_Section 11.05_ , _Section 11.06_ , _Section 11.07_ , _Section 11.10_ and this
_Section 11.13_ (in each case, together with any related defined terms as they
affect such Section) may not be amended, modified, waived, supplemented or
terminated, directly or indirectly, in a manner that is adverse in any respect
to any of the Financing Sources party to the Debt Commitment Letter or the
Debt Financing without the prior written consent of such Financing Sources.
