5

    

(b) Holdings shall have sixty (60) days from the date on which the Parent
Statement is delivered to Holdings (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the
Parent Statement. During the Review Period, upon reasonable prior written
notice, Parent, Buyer and the Acquired Entities shall provide Holdings
and its Representatives with reasonable access, during normal business hours,
to the Acquired Entities books and records as may be reasonably requested by
Holdings and its Representatives in order to verify the information contained
in the Parent Statement; _provided_ that such access shall not unreasonably
interfere with any of the businesses or operations of Parent or its Affiliates
(including the Acquired Entities). Unless Holdings delivers written notice to
Parent prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time, on the last day of the Review
Period that it objects to any item or items shown or reflected in the Parent
Statement, specifying in reasonable detail the item or items to which it
objects and reasons therefor (such item or items, the " _Disputed Items_ "
and such notice, the " _Dispute Notice_ "), then the Parent Statement shall be
deemed accepted by Holdings for all purposes hereof. For the avoidance of
doubt, Holdings may provide a Dispute Notice on the basis that it has not
been provided with adequate information or access in order to understand and
evaluate the calculations on the Parent Statement. In the event Holdings
delivers a Dispute Notice prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the last
day of the Review Period, Holdings and Parent shall attempt in good faith to
resolve each Disputed Item, and any resolution agreed by them in writing shall
be final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of determining the payments
in  _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_. In the event that, for any reason, Holdings and
Parent are unable to resolve in writing each Disputed Item within fifteen (15)
days (or such longer period as Parent and Holdings may agree in
writing) following the delivery of the Dispute Notice, each unresolved
Disputed Item shall be referred to KPMG LLP. If KPMG LLP is unwilling or
unable to serve as the Independent Accountant, Holdings and Parent shall
jointly select and retain a nationally recognized accounting firm that is not
the auditor or independent accounting firm of any of Parent or the Seller
Parties and impartial to serve as the Independent Accountant (KPMG LLP or such
other accounting firm engaged in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_, the " _Independent Accountant_ "). If, within
fifteen (15) days after the date KPMG LLP informs Holdings and Parent that it
is unable or unwilling to serve as the Independent Accountant, Holdings and
Parent cannot mutually agree on an alternate Person to serve as the
Independent Accountant, either Holdings or Parent may request the American
Arbitration Association to appoint as the Independent Accountant, within
fifteen (15) days from the date of such request or as soon as practicable
thereafter, a partner in a nationally recognized accounting firm that is not
the auditor or independent accounting firm of any of Parent or the Seller
Parties, who is a certified public accountant and who is independent of
Holdings and Parent and impartial. If any Disputed Item is referred to the
Independent Accountant, each of Parent, on the one hand, and Holdings, on the
other hand, shall prepare separate written reports of each such Disputed Item
and deliver such reports to the Independent Accountant within twenty (20) days
after the date the Independent Accountant is retained. Each of Parent and
Holdings shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Independent
Accountant, acting as an expert, as soon as practicable and in any event,
barring exceptional circumstances, within thirty (30) days after receiving
such written reports, to determine the manner in which the Disputed Items
shall be treated in the Parent Statement; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
dollar amount of each Disputed Item shall be determined within the range of
dollar amounts proposed by Parent, on the one hand, and Holdings, on
the other hand. Parent and Sellers acknowledge and agree that (i) the review
by and determination of the Independent Accountant shall be limited only to
the Disputed Items contained in the reports

 



6

    

 prepared and submitted to the Independent Accountant by Parent and Holdings
and (ii) the determinations by the Independent Accountant shall be based
solely on (1) such reports submitted by Parent and Holdings and the basis for
Parents and Holdings respective positions and (2) the terms of (including
the definitions contained in) this Agreement. Neither of Parent nor Holdings
shall authorize the Independent Accountant to modify or amend any term or
provision hereof or modify items previously agreed in writing between Parent
and Holdings. Parent and Holdings each agree to enter into an engagement
letter with the Independent Accountant containing customary terms and
conditions for this type of engagement. Each of Parent and Holdings shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with and provide information and
documentation, including work papers, to assist the Independent Accountant.
Any such information or documentation provided by any Party to the Independent
Accountant shall be concurrently delivered to the other Party, subject, in the
case of independent accountant work papers, to such other Party entering into
a customary confidentiality and release agreement with respect thereto.
Neither Parent nor Holdings shall disclose to the Independent Accountant, and
the Independent Accountant shall not consider for any purposes, any settlement
discussions or settlement offers made by any of the Parties related to any
Disputed Item. The determinations by the Independent Accountant as to the
Disputed Items shall be in writing and shall be an expert determination that
is final, binding and conclusive for all purposes of determining the
adjustments in _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_, if any, and such determination may be
entered and enforced in any court of competent jurisdiction. The costs and
expenses of the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between Parent, on
the one hand, and Sellers, on the other hand, based on the percentage which
the portion of all Disputed Items submitted to the Independent Accountant that
are not resolved in favor of Sellers bears to the amount of all Disputed
Items submitted to the Independent Accountant. As an illustrative example, if
Disputed Items asserting that the Closing Consideration should be increased by
$1,000 are submitted to the Independent Accountant, and the Independent
Accountant finally determines that the Closing Consideration should be
increased by $300, then the costs and expenses of the Independent Accountant
shall be allocated 70% (i.e., $700/$1000) to Sellers and 30% (i.e.,
$300/$1000) to Parent.

 

(c) _Post-Closing Adjustment Amount_ _._

 

(i) If the Closing Consideration, as finally determined under _Section_ __
_ 1.5(b)_ (the " _Final Closing Consideration_ "), exceeds the Estimated
Closing Consideration, then within five (5) Business Days after the
determination of the Final Closing Consideration in accordance with 
_Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_, Parent shall cause Buyer to pay to each Seller an
amount in cash equal to (1) such Sellers Ownership Percentage, _multiplied
by_ (2) such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with the applicable wiring instructions identified in the Payment
Statement.

 

(ii) If the Estimated Closing Consideration exceeds the Final Closing
Consideration, then within five (5) Business Days after the determination of
the Final Closing Consideration in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 1.5(b)_,
Sellers shall, jointly and severally, pay to Buyer an aggregate amount in cash
equal to such excess, by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with the wiring instructions delivered to Seller in writing by
Buyer.

 



7

    

(iii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, any
payment pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 1.5(c)_ shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Estimated Closing Consideration for all Income Tax purposes
to the maximum extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 1.6 _Withholding_. Each of Parent, Buyer and the Seller Parties
shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any amounts otherwise payable
hereunder such amounts as Parent, Buyer or the Seller Parties shall determine
in good faith are required to be deducted or withheld with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code or any other provision of applicable
Law. Any amounts so deducted and withheld and, if required, timely remitted to
the applicable Taxing Authority shall be treated for all purposes hereof as
having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made. Except as a result of the failure to provide the
IRS Form W-9 or certificate, as applicable, required under _Section_ __ _
1.3(a)(iv)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 1.3(a)(v)_, if Parent or Buyer determines
that it is required to so deduct or withhold, Parent or Buyer, as applicable,
shall as soon as reasonably practicable notify the applicable Seller Parties
of its intent to deduct or withhold and shall reasonably cooperate with such
Seller Parties in good faith to reduce or mitigate such withholding.

 

Section 1.7 _Purchase Price_ _Allocation_.

 

(a) On or before the date that is forty-five (45) days after the date that
the Final Closing Consideration is finally determined pursuant to _Section_
__ _ 1.5_, solely for Tax purposes, Holdings shall deliver to Parent a
proposed allocation of the Final Closing Consideration (including any
liabilities that are deemed assumed by Buyer for U.S. federal Income Tax
purposes) among the assets of the Acquired Entities and the restrictive
covenants provided in the Key Persons Agreement in accordance with Section
1060 of the Code, the Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder and the
methodologies for determining fair market value reflected in _Section_ __ _
1.7(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule (such allocation, " _Sellers_ __
_Allocation_ "). If Parent disagrees with Sellers Allocation, Parent may,
within twenty (20) days after delivery of Sellers Allocation, deliver a
notice (" _Parent_ __ _s Allocation Notice_ ") to Holdings to such effect,
specifying those items as to which Parent disagrees and setting forth
Parents proposed allocation. If Parents Allocation Notice is duly delivered,
Parent and Holdings shall, during the fifteen (15) days following such
delivery, work together in good faith to reach agreement on the disputed
items or amounts in order to determine the allocation of the Final Closing
Consideration (including any liabilities that are deemed assumed by Buyer for
U.S. federal Income Tax purposes). If Holdings and Parent are unable to reach
such agreement, they shall promptly thereafter submit for resolution the items
remaining in dispute to the Independent Accountant and shall instruct the
Independent Accountant to make a written determination consistent with 
_Section_ __ _ 1.7(a)_ regarding such dispute as promptly as practicable, and
in any event within thirty (30) calendar days after the date on which such
dispute is referred to the Independent Accountant (or such longer period as
the Independent Accountant may reasonably require). The fees and expenses of
the Independent Accountant shall be allocated between Parent, on one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, based upon the percentage which the portion of the
contested amount not awarded to or not included in an allocation determined
by the Independent Accountant for each party bears to the amount actually
contested by the Parties in the aggregate, as determined by the Independent
Accountant. Subject to the preceding sentence, the allocation, as prepared by
Holdings if no Parents Allocation Notice has been timely given, as adjusted
pursuant to any agreement between Holdings and Parent, or as determined by the
Independent Accountant (the " _Allocation_ "), shall be conclusive and
binding on the Parties.

 



8

    

(b) To the extent permitted by applicable Law, Parent, Buyer and Sellers
agree to (and shall cause their respective Affiliates to) report, act and file
in accordance with the Allocation in any relevant Tax Returns or Tax filings
and to cooperate in the preparation of any such Tax forms. The Parties shall
promptly advise one another of the existence of any Tax proceeding related to
the Allocation. None of the Parties shall take any position with respect to
Taxes (whether on any Tax Returns, in any Tax proceeding or otherwise) that is
inconsistent with the Allocation except to the extent required by applicable
Law or otherwise required pursuant to a "determination" within the meaning of
Section 1313(a) of the Code (or any analogous provision of state, local or
non-U.S. Law).

to consummate any transaction contemplated hereby.

 

Section 3.4 _Ownership and Operations of Buyer_. Parent owns of record all
of the outstanding Equity Securities of Buyer. Buyer was formed solely for
the purpose of engaging in the transactions contemplated hereby and has no
assets, liabilities or obligations of any nature, except for those incident to

the Closing, shall not have engaged in any other business activities except
for those relating to such transactions.

 

Section 3.5 _Claims; Orders_. There is no material Claim pending (or, to
Parents Knowledge, threatened) against Parent or Buyer, and there is no
material Order outstanding against Parent or Buyer or to which Parent or Buyer

agreements hereunder or consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 3.6 _Financing_. Parent and Buyer have on the date hereof
sufficient funds (or commitments for all such funds), and at Closing will
have sufficient funds, required in order to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein, on the terms hereof and pay the related fees and

Parent delivered to Holdings a true, complete and correct copy of the executed
commitment letter, together with all schedules, annexes, attachments and
exhibits thereto, from Credit Suisse Loan Funding LLC, Credit Suisse AG,
Cayman Islands Branch, Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and

 



34

    

 Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (each of the foregoing financial
institutions, together with any of its designated affiliates of similar
creditworthiness, collectively, the " _Lenders_ "), dated as of the date
hereof (the " _Commitment Letter_ "), pursuant to which the Lenders have
committed, subject to the terms and conditions set forth therein, to provide
debt financing (the " _Financing_ ") to Parent in the amounts described
therein for the purposes of funding the transactions contemplated hereby and
the related fees and expenses. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is
in full force and effect and has not been withdrawn or terminated or
otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. The Commitment
Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of
Parent, Buyer and, to Parents Knowledge, the other parties thereto,
enforceable in accordance with its terms except as limited by the Bankruptcy
and Equitable Exceptions. Other than the Commitment Letter, there is no
agreement, side letter or arrangement relating to the Financing that
could adversely affect the conditionality of the Financing, and the
Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations
of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the
terms therein. Other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter and
in any related fee letters (of which Parent has delivered true and complete
copies, redacted to remove fee amounts and other economic terms, to Holdings
on or prior to the date hereof), there are no other agreements, side letters
or arrangements relating to the Financing that could affect the amount or
availability of the Financing. The Commitment Letter is not subject to any
contingency or condition of any kind whatsoever, including any subsequent
approval process, related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any "flex" provisions or
similar provisions affecting the structure, pricing, maturity,
amortization or any other terms) other than as set forth in the executed
copies thereof attached hereto and in the related fee letters provided in
connection therewith. As of the date hereof, assuming that the representations
and warranties in  _Article_ __ _ II_ are true and correct in all material
respects, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time
or both, would (i) constitute a default or breach of Parent or Buyer, or, to
Parents Knowledge, of any other party thereto, under any term or condition
of the Commitment Letter; (ii) make any of the assumptions or any of the
statements set forth in the Commitment Letter inaccurate in any material
respect; (iii) result in any of the conditions to the funding of the
Financing on the Closing Date in the Commitment Letter not being satisfied; or
(iv) otherwise result in or would reasonably be expected to result in any
portion of the Financing not being available to Parent on the Closing Date.
As of the date hereof, no party to the Commitment Letter has notified Parent
or Buyer of its intention to terminate the Commitment Letter or not to provide
the Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions in  _Section_ __ _
5.1_ and _Section_ __ _ 5.2_, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Buyer
has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis,
any term or condition of closing to be satisfied by it with respect to the
Commitment Letter or that the full amount of the Financing will not be
available as of the Closing. As of the date hereof, Parent has fully paid any
and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment Letter (or
any related fee letter or engagement letter) to be paid on or before the date
hereof. Neither the Commitment Letter nor any related fee letter or engagement
letter contains any commitment fee or other fee payable by the Seller Parties
or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates prior to Closing. The
aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing required
to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions hereby on
the Closing Date, and are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parents
obligations under this Agreement, including the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date and payment of the
related fees and expenses.

 



35

arrangements made, directly or indirectly, by or on behalf of Parent, Buyer
or any of their respective Affiliates, except for any such fee or commission
payable solely by Parent, Buyer or their respective Affiliates. __

 

Section 3.8 _Solvency_. Assuming that the representations and warranties
in Article II are true and correct in all material respects, the transactions
contemplated hereby (including any financings to be undertaken in connection
therewith) will not, as of immediately following Closing, render the Company
or any Company Subsidiary insolvent, such that (i) the Company or any Company
Subsidiary will have incurred debts beyond its ability to pay such debts as
they mature or become due, (ii) the then present fair saleable value of the
assets of the Company and each Company Subsidiary will not exceed the amount
that will be required to pay its probable liabilities (including the probable
amount of all contingent liabilities) and its debts as they become absolute
and matured, (iii) the assets of each Company or any Company Subsidiary, in
each case at a fair valuation, will not exceed its respective debts (including
the probable amount of all contingent liabilities) or (iv) the Company or any
Company Subsidiary will have unreasonably small capital to carry on
its business as presently conducted or as proposed to be conducted. No
transfer of property is being made and no obligation is being incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby with the intent to
hinder, delay or defraud either present or future creditors of the Company or
any Company Subsidiary.

Section 3.9 _Purchase for Investment_. Buyer is purchasing the Purchased
Interests for investment for its own account and not with a view to, or for
sale in connection with, any distribution thereof. Buyer (either alone or
together with its advisors) has sufficient knowledge and experience in
financial and business matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits
and risks of its investment in the Purchased Interests and is capable of

4.5(a)_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule, each Business Employee who, as of

 



44

    

 immediately prior to the Closing, is employed by an Acquired Entity
(including all Business Employees who are on a leave of absence as of the

disability) shall continue employment with the Acquired Entity immediately
following the Closing or become employed by Parent or an Affiliate thereof
(each, a " _Continuing Employee_ ").

 

(b) _Continuation Period Compensation_. For the period beginning on the
Closing Date and continuing thereafter for twelve (12) months following the
Closing Date (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall provide, or shall
cause its Affiliates or the Company, as applicable, to provide Continuing
Employees with (i) compensation, including annual base salary, wage levels,
commission rates, component pay opportunities and incentive pay opportunities
(excluding long-term incentive, deferred compensation and target annual cash
incentive opportunities), that are at least equal to those provided to each
such Continuing Employee by the Company, the Seller Parties or an Affiliate
thereof on the Closing Date, (ii) long-term incentive opportunities that are
the same as those provided by Parent to similarly situated employees of
Parent and its Affiliates as of the Closing Date, (iii) target annual cash
incentive opportunities that are at least equal to those provided to each such
Continuing Employee by the Company, the Seller Parties or an
Affiliate thereof on the Closing Date, and (iv) employee benefits, including
employee health, welfare and retirement benefits and fringe benefits that are
substantially comparable in the aggregate to such employee benefits provided
to each such Continuing Employee by the Company, the Seller Parties or an
Affiliate thereof on the Closing Date, excluding, for all purposes of this
clause (iv), the value of any defined benefit pension plan benefits,
discretionary matching contributions made under retirement plans maintained
by the Seller Parties or their respective Affiliates (for purposes of clarity,
the matching contribution under the Reyes Holdings 401(k) Thrift Plan equal to
50% up to the first 10% of pay shall in no event be considered discretionary
and, therefore, is not excludable for purposes of this clause (iv) as a
discretionary matching contribution) and retiree medical benefits to the
extent such plans are offered or provided for by Parent or its Affiliates; 
_provided_ , _however_ , that, nothing herein shall be deemed to limit the
right of Parent, any of its Affiliates or the Company to (x) terminate the
employment of any Continuing Employee at any time or (y) change or modify
any employee benefit plan or arrangement in accordance with their terms.
During the Continuation Period, Parent shall provide or cause its Affiliate to
provide, severance benefits to all Continuing Employees who are involuntarily
terminated without "cause" or who resign for "good reason." Such severance
benefits shall be the same as the severance benefits provided by the Parent to
its employees. For purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)_, "cause" shall
mean a violation of company policy, dishonesty, violation of standards of
integrity, violation of Law that could impact Parent or its Affiliates, or a
willful and deliberate failure to perform employment duties, and "good
reason" shall mean (A) a reduction of an employees compensation or benefits
in contravention of this _Section_ __ _ 4.5(b)_, or (B) the change of the
facility or office location to which such employee is expected to commute to
perform his or her services to a facility or location that is a distance of
twenty-five (25) miles or greater from the employees then-current facility or
office location; _provided_ that permitting or requiring an employee to work
virtually from his or her personal residence (or other location of his or her
choice) shall in no event constitute "good reason." Notwithstanding anything
in this paragraph to the contrary, Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliate
to, comply with the compensation and benefits requirements of any Collective
Bargaining Agreement.

 



45

    

(c) _Parent Plans; Service Crediting_. For eligibility, vesting, and
accrual purposes under the employee benefit plans of Parent and its Affiliates
that are offered and that provide benefits to Continuing Employees after the
Closing Date (the " _Parent Plans_ "), each Continuing Employee shall be
credited with his or her years of service or comparable experience with the
Seller Parties and its Affiliates before the Closing Date to the same extent
as such employee was entitled before the Closing Date to credit for such
service under any similar Seller Plan, except to the extent such credit would
result in a duplication of benefits or for purposes of any defined benefit
pension plan or retiree medical plan, to the extent such plans are offered or
provided for by Parent or its Affiliates, if any. For purposes of each Parent
Plan providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any
Continuing Employee, to the extent such Continuing Employee satisfied
participation requirements and waiting period requirements under comparable

Parent contained in the applicable Financing Documents (other than those
conditions that by its terms will be satisfied on the Closing Date),

rise to any breach or default) by any party to any Financing Document
(including the Commitment Letter) of which Parent becomes aware, (ii) of the
receipt or delivery of any written notice or other written communication, in
each case from any Person with respect to (1) any actual or potential breach,
default, termination or repudiation by any party to any Financing Document
(including the Commitment Letter) or (2) any material dispute or disagreement
between or among parties to any Financing Document (including the Commitment
Letter) with respect to the obligation to fund the Financing or the amount of
the Financing to be funded at the Closing or any other event or condition that

good faith that it will not be able to obtain all or any portion of the
Financing on the terms and conditions, in the manner or from the sources
contemplated by the Commitment Letter; _provided_ that in no event will
Parent be under any obligation to disclose any information pursuant to this

amend, replace, supplement or otherwise modify, or waive any of its rights
under, the Commitment Letter, and/or substitute other debt or equity financing
for all or any portion of the Financing from the same and/or alternative
financing sources to the extent that any such amendment, replacement,
supplement or other modification to or waiver of any provision of the
Commitment Letter would

 



50

    

 (i) change the amounts to be funded under the Financing (including by
changing the amount of original issue discount) from that contemplated in the
Commitment Letter and related "flex provisions" of the fee letter relating to
the Commitment Letter (such that the aggregate funds that would be available
to Parent on the Closing Date would not be sufficient to provide the funds
required to be funded on the Closing Date to consummate the transactions
contemplated herein and related fees and expenses), (ii) amend the conditions
precedent or contingencies to the Financing as set forth in the Commitment
Letter in a manner that makes it less likely the Financing will be funded on
the Closing Date or impose new or additional conditions or expands any
existing condition to the receipt of the Financing, (iii) otherwise expand,
amend, modify or waive any provision of the Commitment Letter in a manner that
in any such case would reasonably be expected to (A) delay or make less
likely the funding of the Financing (or satisfaction of the conditions
precedent to the funding of the Financing) on the Closing Date or otherwise
prevent or impair the transactions contemplated hereby in any material
respect or (B) adversely affect the ability of Parent to timely consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby or (iv) adversely impact the ability of
Parent or Buyer to enforce its rights against the other parties to the
Commitment Letter; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may replace or amend
the Commitment Letter to add lenders, lead arrangers, bookrunners, syndication
agents or similar entities who had not executed the Commitment Letter as of
the date hereof. In such event, the term Commitment Letter as used herein
shall be deemed to include any new commitment letters entered into in
accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 4.9(d)_ and the term "Financing" as used
herein shall be deemed to include any substitute debt or equity financing
obtained in accordance with this _Section_ __ _ 4.9(d)_, as applicable.

 

(e) If any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in the Commitment Letter, Parent shall
(i) promptly (and in any event within three (3) Business Days) notify Holdings
of such unavailability, expiration or termination and the reasons therefor,
(ii) as promptly as practicable use its reasonable best efforts to arrange to
obtain alternative financing (the " _Alternative Financing_ ") (which
Alternative Financing shall have terms and conditions (including fees and the
"flex" provisions) not less favorable in any material respect than those set
forth in the Commitment Letter (in the reasonable judgment of Parent) and in
an aggregate amount such that Parent will have on the Closing Date sufficient
funds to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date
and related fees and expenses) to replace any unavailable portion of the
Financing, to be consummated no later than the day on which the Closing shall
occur pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 1.2_, (iii) provide to Holdings true,
correct and complete copies of the commitment letter and related fee letter
(redacted to remove fee amounts and other economic terms) relating to such
Alternative Financing to replace the Financing and (iv) keep
Holdings reasonably informed of material developments in respect of the
process of obtaining such Alternative Financing. In the event any Alternative
Financing is obtained, all references herein to the "Financing" shall be
deemed to include such Alternative Financing and all references herein to the
"Commitment Letter" shall include the applicable commitment letter for the
Alternative Financing. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, compliance by Parent with this _Section_ __ _ 4.9(e)_ shall not
relieve Parent or Buyer of their obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether or not the Financing is available.

 

(f) Prior to the Closing, the Seller Parties shall use reasonable best
efforts to provide to Parent, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Acquired Entities

 



51

    

 and their respective Representatives to, at Parents sole cost and expense,
provide to Parent such cooperation that may be reasonably requested by Parent

assistance with marketing efforts and diligence related to the Financing,
including inventory appraisals and field audits with respect to the Acquired

information. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section_ __ _ 4.9_ to the
contrary, neither the Seller Parties, the Acquired Entities nor any of their
respective Subsidiaries shall be required to (A) pay any commitment fee or
similar fee or incur any liability (or cause their respective managers,

connection with the Financing prior to the Closing), (B) approve or enter into
any agreement or binding commitment in connection with the Financing prior to
the Closing (other than customary authorization letters described above), (C)

connection with such cooperation or any information provided in connection
therewith. The Acquired Entities hereby consent to the use of their logos in

and, at in the Seller Parties sole discretion, either (i) apply any insurance
proceeds received from a Third Party and resulting from such Post-Signing
Casualty Claim that are received prior to the Closing to the restoration,
replacement or repair of such damaged asset or (ii) hold, or cause to be held,

information of the other Party (in such capacity, the " _Disclosing Party_ "),
including the Seller Parties, with respect to the Acquired Entities, and

56

    

 documents) to the extent required by applicable Law; _provided_ that (i)
prior to disclosing any such confidential or proprietary information pursuant
to this  _Section_ __ _ 4.16(d)_, (1) the Receiving Party and its
Representatives shall have the reasonable opportunity to seek an appropriate
protective order or other remedy and (2) the Receiving Party shall consult
and cooperate with the Disclosing Party, at the Disclosing Partys sole cost
and expense, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law regarding
taking steps to resist or narrow the scope of such requirement and (ii) if (1)
such a protective order or other remedy is not obtained or if the Disclosing
Party waives compliance with the terms of this _Section_ __ _ 4.16_, and (2)
the Receiving Party or its Representative is nonetheless, in the opinion
of counsel, required by applicable Law to disclose such information, the
Receiving Party or its Representative shall (A) disclose only that portion of

counsel is legally required, (B) give advance notice to the Disclosing Party
of the information to be disclosed as far in advance as is practicable and (C)
use reasonable efforts to obtain reliable assurance that confidential
treatment shall be accorded to such information. For purposes of this
_Section_ __ _ 4.16_, "confidential or proprietary information" of the
Disclosing Party shall not include information that (x) is or becomes
generally known to the public through no fault of the Receiving Party or any

the Seller Parties, including any modification, waiver or amendment that would
allow the insurer thereunder, except in the case of Actual Fraud, to
subrogate or otherwise make or bring any Claim against the Seller Parties or

Section 4.18 _Waiver of Conflicts Regarding Representation;_
_Nonassertion_ _of Attorney-Client Privilege_.

(a) Buyer waives and will not assert, and agrees to cause the Acquired
Entities to waive and not to assert, any conflict of interest arising out of
or relating to the representation, after the Closing (the " _Post-Closing
Representation_ ") of the Seller Parties or any member, manager, officer,
employee, manager or director of any Seller Party or any Acquired Entity (any
such Person, a " _Designated Person_ ") in any matter involving this Agreement
or any other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby, including any
litigation or other dispute proceeding between or among Parent, Buyer, the
Acquired Entities or any of their respective Affiliates, by Winston and Strawn
LLP, Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP or any other legal counsel currently
representing the Seller Parties in connection with this Agreement or any
other agreements or transactions contemplated thereby (whether or not such
legal counsel also

 



57

    

 represented the Seller Parties) (the " _Current Representation_ "), even
though the interests of such Designated Person may be directly adverse to
Parent, Buyer, any Acquired Entity or any of their respective Affiliates.

(b) It is the intention of the Parties that all rights to any attorney-
client privilege applicable to communications between Winston and Strawn LLP,
Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP and any other legal counsel currently
representing the Acquired Entities in connection with the
Current Representation (whether or not such legal counsel also represented
the Seller Parties) shall be retained solely by the Seller Parties (and not
the Acquired Entities); _provided_ __ that the foregoing waiver and
acknowledgement of retention shall not extend to any communication to the
extent not involving this Agreement or any other agreements or transactions
contemplated thereby. Accordingly, from and after the Closing, the Acquired
Entities shall not have access to any such communications, or to the files of
Winston and Strawn LLP, Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP or any other legal
counsel currently representing the Acquired Entities (whether or not such
legal counsel also represented the Seller Parties) in connection with the
Current Representation, in each case, to the extent such communications are
not otherwise in the possession of the Acquired Entities. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, upon and after the Closing, (i) the Seller
Parties and their respective Affiliates shall be the sole holders of the
attorney-client privilege with respect to the Current Representation, and the
Acquired Entities shall not be holders thereof and (ii) to the extent that
files of Winston and Strawn LLP, Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP or any other
legal counsel currently representing the Acquired Entities in connection with
the Current Representation (whether or not such legal counsel
also represented the Seller Parties) constitute property of a client with
respect to the Current Representation, only the Seller Parties and their
respective Affiliates shall hold such property rights; _provided_ , _however_
, that (1) in the event that, after the Closing, a dispute arises between
Parent, Buyer or any Acquired Entity, on the one hand, and a Third Party, on
the other hand, then, subject to _Section_ __ _ 4.18(d)_, Parent, Buyer or
any Acquired Entity, as applicable, may assert the attorney-client privilege
or other applicable privilege or protection to prevent disclosure of such
communications to such Third Party and (2) in the event that, after the
Closing, a dispute arises between Parent, Buyer or any Acquired Entity, on
the one hand, and the Seller Parties or any of their Representatives, on the
other hand, nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 4.18_ shall prohibit Parent, Buyer
or any Acquired Entity, from seeking discovery of any such communication to
the extent Parent, Buyer or any Acquired Entity establishes that such
privilege or protection has previously been waived as to third parties.

 

(c) Parent and Buyer agree, on their own behalf and on behalf of each of
their Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired Entities), that
in the event of a dispute between the Seller Parties or an Affiliate of
thereof, on the one hand, and any Acquired Entity, on the other hand, arising
out of or relating to any matter in which Winston and Strawn LLP, Arnold and
Porter Kaye Scholer LLP or any other legal counsel currently representing the
Acquired Entities in connection with the Current Representation jointly
represented both (i) the Seller Parties and (ii) the Acquired Entities, if
applicable, neither the attorney-client privilege, the expectation of client
confidence, nor any right to any other evidentiary privilege or any work
product doctrine will protect against or prevent disclosure by Winston and
Strawn LLP, Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP or any other legal counsel
currently representing any of the Acquired Entities in connection with the
Current Representation to the Seller Parties or any Affiliate thereof of any
information or documents developed or shared during the course of any such
joint representation.

 



58

    

(d) In the event that any third party shall seek to obtain from Parent,
Buyer or their Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Acquired
Entities) attorney-client communications involving Winston and Strawn LLP,
Arnold and Porter Kaye Scholer LLP or any other legal counsel
currently representing the Acquired Entities in connection with the Current
Representation, then Buyer shall notify the Seller Parties of such application
sufficiently in advance of any hearing on the application to permit the Seller
Parties to participate in any such proceedings.

Section 4.19 _Pre-Closing Actions_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, Sellers and Holdings shall consummate the Pre-
Closing Reorganization in the manner described in _Exhibit A_ , or in a
manner substantially similar thereto; _provided_ that Sellers and Holdings
shall obtain the consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed) if any alteration in the consummation of the Pre-
Closing Reorganization from the transactions described in _Exhibit A_ could
reasonably be expected to adversely impact Parent (or any of its Affiliates,
including the Acquired Entities).

(b) The Seller Parties shall, and shall cause their respective
Representatives to, (i) reasonably consult with Parent regarding the Pre-

the Seller Parties shall, and shall cause their respective Representatives to,

title and interest in and to the accounts receivable of the Acquired Entities
that would otherwise be subject to the Securitization Facility, free and clear
of all Liens (other than Permitted Liens), including all Liens under the
Securitization Facility, and (ii) cause Reyes Funding, L.L.C., a Delaware
limited liability company (" _Funding Company_ "), to assign, convey, deliver
and transfer to the Company all right, title and interest in and to all bank
accounts that are in the name of Funding Company and which relate to the
collection of the Acquired Entities accounts receivable. As of the Closing,
Holdings shall deliver to Parent evidence of the completion of the actions
contemplated by the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii) in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent.

(d) Prior to the Closing, Holdings shall, and shall cause its
Affiliates (other than the Acquired Entities) to, assign and transfer to one
(1) or more Acquired Entities designated in writing by Parent, and cause such
Acquired Entities to accept and assume, all of

 the current liabilities of Holdings and its Affiliates (other than the
Acquired Entities) related to the businesses of the Acquired Entities that are
of the type identified as current liabilities of Newco in the line-items
contained in _Exhibit I_ , whether incurred prior to, on or after the date
hereof; _provided_ that all such assigned and transferred current liabilities
shall be current liabilities of NewCo for purposes of calculating Net Working
Capital.

Section 4.20 _Transition_. Prior to the Closing, the Seller Parties shall
reasonably cooperate, upon Parents reasonable request, and consistent with
all applicable Laws, with the transition of the businesses of the Acquired
Entities to Parent as of the Closing, including providing information to
Parent, upon Parents reasonable request, related to the Acquired Entities
risk management (including exposure information, loss data or insurance-
related information), Tax and treasury functions. Parent shall reimburse the
Seller Parties, on an as-invoiced basis and not more frequently than monthly,
for any reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs incurred in
connection with any such request.

cause, and shall be permitted to cause Lone Oak  Shawano, L.L.C. to use
commercially reasonable efforts to cause, the Shawano Project to be
constructed in the ordinary course of business substantially in
accordance with the Shawano Plans and the Shawano Budget, including entering
into commercially reasonable contracts and undertaking commercially reasonable
obligations related to the construction of the Shawano Project and paying for
work and services performed and materials delivered in furtherance of the
Shawano Project. In no event shall Parents prior approval with respect to
such construction be required, except neither Sellers nor any of the Acquired
Entities shall, without Parents prior written consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), (a) increase the total cost of
the Shawano Project, as set forth in the Shawano Budget, by more than 5% in
the aggregate (a " _Material Price Increase_ ") or (b) materially and
adversely alter the scope of the Shawano Project as reflected in the Shawano
Plans (a " _Material Scope Change_ "). Sellers shall keep Parent reasonably
apprised of the progress of the Shawano Project, including any changes, other

Commodity Hedge Contract_ "), the Seller Parties and their Affiliates shall
assign, transfer, convey and deliver as of the Closing all right, title and
interest in and to, and Parent or its applicable Subsidiary shall accept and
assume as of the Closing all Liabilities under, each Commodity Hedge Contract.

 (i) any of Parent or Buyer fail to perform or comply with any of their
respective covenants or agreements hereunder, or any of the representations or
warranties in _Article_ __ _ III_ fails to be accurate, which failure (1)
would give rise to the failure of a condition in  _Section_ __ _ 5.3(a)_ or
_Section_ __ _ 5.3(b)_, as applicable, to be satisfied and (2) is not
reasonably capable of being cured by Parent or Buyer, as applicable, by the
Outside Date (as it may be extended under _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ )
or, if reasonably capable of being cured by Parent or Buyer, as applicable, by
the Outside Date (as it may be extended under _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_
), is not cured by Parent or Buyer, as applicable, within thirty (30) days
after Holdings delivers written notice of such failure to Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Holdings shall not have the right to terminate this Agreement
under this _Section_ __ _ 6.1(d)(_ _i_ _)_ if any Seller Party shall have
failed to perform any of its covenants or agreements hereunder, or any of the
representations or warranties in _Article_ __ _ II_ fails to be accurate,
which failure would give rise to the failure of a condition in _Section_ __ _
5.2(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 5.2(b)_, as applicable; or

 

 (ii) (1) all of the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 5.1_ and  _Section_ __
_ 5.2_ have been satisfied, except for any condition that by its nature is to
be satisfied at the Closing ( _provided_ that such condition would be capable
of being satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination),
(2) Holdings has irrevocably confirmed by written notice to Parent that (A)
the conditions in _Section_ __ _ 5.3_ have been satisfied or duly waived by
Holdings, except for any condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at
the Closing ( _provided_ that such condition would be capable of being
satisfied if the Closing Date were the date of such termination), (B) the
Seller Parties are ready, willing and able to consummate the Closing and (C)
if Parent and Buyer take all actions required hereby to consummate the
Closing, the Seller Parties shall take all actions required hereby to
consummate the Closing (such notice, a " _Closing Failure Notice_ ") and (3)
Parent and Buyer fail to consummate the Closing within three (3) Business Days
following the later of (A) delivery of the Closing Failure Notice and (B) the
date on which the Closing should have occurred under  _Section_ __ _ 1.2_
(the occurrence of the foregoing clauses (1), (2) and (3), a " _Parent Closing
Failure_ ").

 

Section 6.2 _Effect of Termination; Procedure for Termination_. This
Agreement may be terminated only under  _Section_ __ _ 6.1_. In order to
terminate this Agreement under _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, the Party desiring to
terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of such termination to the
other Parties under  _Section_ __ _ 9.8_, specifying the provision hereof
under which such termination is effected. If this Agreement is terminated
under _Section_ __ _ 6.1_, this Agreement shall immediately become void and
of no effect, and no Party shall have any further Liability,

 



65

    

 whether arising before, at or after such termination, that may be based on,
arise out of or relate to this Agreement, except that (a) this _Section_ __ _
6.2_,  _Section_ __ _ 4.9(g)_, _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, _Article_ __ _ IX_ and
the Confidentiality Agreements, and the Parties Liabilities thereunder, shall
survive such termination and remain in full force and effect in accordance
with their terms and (b) except as provided, and subject to the limitations,
in _Section_ __ _ 6.3(c)_, no such termination shall relieve any Party from
Liability for any Actual Fraud or any Willful Breach occurring prior to such
termination.

 Section 6.3 _Termination Fees_.

 

(a) If Holdings terminates this Agreement pursuant to (i) _Section
6.1(d)(i)_ or (ii) _Section 6.1(d)(ii)_, in each case, Parent shall pay to
Holdings a fee of $100,000,000 in cash (the " _Parent Breach Termination Fee_
"), by wire transfer of immediately available funds in accordance with the
Seller Wiring Instructions, no later than two (2) Business Days after the
date of such termination.

(b) If either Parent or Holdings terminates this Agreement under _Section_
__ _ 6.1(b)(_ _i_ _)_ or _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(ii)_ (but only if the
applicable Legal Restraint relates to the HSR Clearance) and, at the time of
such termination, all of the conditions in _Article_ __ _ V_ have been
satisfied or duly waived by all Parties entitled to the benefit thereof,
except for (i) the condition in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(a)_, (ii) the condition
in _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b)_ (but only if the applicable Legal Restraint relates
to the HSR Clearance), (iii) the condition in _Section_ __ _ 5.2(d)_ or (iv)
any other condition that by its nature is to be satisfied at the Closing (
_provided_ that such condition would be capable of being satisfied if the
Closing Date were the date of such termination), Parent shall pay to Holdings
a fee of $80,000,000 in cash (the " _Parent _ _Antitrust_ _Termination Fee_ "
and, together with the Parent Breach Termination Fee, the " _Parent
Termination Fees_ "), by wire transfer of immediately available funds in
accordance with the Seller Wiring Instructions, no later than two (2)
Business Days after the date of such termination.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including _Section_
__ _ 6.2_), if this Agreement is terminated under circumstances in which
Parent is required to pay a Parent Termination Fee, other than the Seller
Parties right to payment of the Reimbursable Expenses, (i) seeking and
obtaining Parents payment of such Parent Termination Fee shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy of the Seller Parties and their respective
Representatives for any Claims or Losses suffered or incurred by the Seller
Parties or any of their respective Representatives that may be based on, arise
out of or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby,
(ii) other than the obligation to pay such Parent Termination Fee, Parent,
Buyer and their respective Representatives shall have no further Liability
that may be based on, arise out of or related to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) none of the Seller Parties or any of
their respective Representatives shall have, and the Seller Parties, on
behalf of themselves and their respective Representatives, expressly waive and
relinquish, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute)
or in equity) that may be based on, arise out of or related to this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby, and (iv) the maximum aggregate
Liability of Parent and its Representatives to the Seller Parties and their
respective Representatives that may be based on, arise out of or related to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby shall not exceed such
Parent Termination Fee and, subject to 

 



66

    

  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_, none of the Seller Parties or any of their
respective Representatives shall seek to recover monetary damages in excess of
such amount. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary (including
_Section_ __ _ 6.2_), in no event (1) shall Parent be required to pay to
Holdings any Parent Termination Fee more than once or (2) shall Parent be
required to pay to Holdings more than one (1) Parent Termination Fee.

(d) The covenants and agreements under this  _Section_ __ _ 6.3_ are an
integral part of the transactions contemplated hereby, and without such
covenants and agreements, the Parties would not have entered into this
Agreement. Accordingly, if Parent fails to pay a Parent Termination Fee when
due pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 6.3_, then Parent shall pay Holdings
interest on such overdue amount from the date such payment was required to be
made until the date of payment at the prime lending rate as published in the
_Wall Street Journal_ , in effect on the date such payment was required to be
made. Each Party further acknowledges and agrees that, on behalf of itself and
its Affiliates, that the payment of any Parent Termination Fee is not
a penalty but is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will
compensate the Parties and their respective Affiliates in the circumstances in
which such Parent Termination Fee is payable, for the efforts and resources
expended and the opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and
in reliance on this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be
impossible to calculate with precision;  _provided_ that nothing in this
sentence shall limit the rights of any Seller Party under _Section_ __ _
9.5_, _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ or otherwise with respect to Reimbursable Expenses.

_Section_ __ _ 7.4_ prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period
under this _Section_ __ _ 7.1_, the Claim that is the subject of such Claim
Notice shall survive until such Claim is finally and fully resolved in

limit any Liability for, or any Partys right or ability to bring a Claim
after any such survival period for, Actual Fraud.

Section 7.2 _Indemnification_.

 

 (a) From and after the Closing, subject to the other provisions of this

the Parent Indemnified Persons harmless from and against, any and all Losses
actually suffered, paid or incurred by the Parent Indemnified Persons
(including, after the Closing, any Acquired Entity) to the extent arising from
or related to any of the following:

 

(i) any failure of the representations and warranties in _Article_ __ _
II_ to be true and correct as of the date hereof or as of the Closing as if
made anew as of the Closing, in each case, read without giving effect to any
exception, limitation or qualifier therein as to materiality, "material," "in
all material respects" or "Material Adverse Effect" (except for the No Scrape
Representations and the terms "Material Contract" and "Material Environmental
Permit") (any such failure, a " _Seller Rep Breach_ "), except for any Seller
Rep Breach arising as a result of any Claim instituted after the date hereof
(1) that is substantially similar in nature, scope and amount to the Claims
set forth in Item 1 of  _Section_ __ _ 2.12(b)(_ _i_ _)_ of the Seller
Disclosure Schedule and (2) for which a reserve is included as a current
liability in Net Working Capital;

Indemnified Persons harmless from and against, any and all Losses actually
suffered, paid or incurred by the Seller Indemnified Persons to the extent
arising from or related to any of the following:

 

(i) any failure of the representations and warranties in _Article_ __ _
III_ to be true and correct as of the date hereof or as of the Closing as if
made anew as of the Closing, in each case, read without giving effect to any
exception, limitation or qualifier therein as to materiality, "material" or
"in all material respects" (any such failure, a " _Parent Rep Breach_ "); and

(ii) any breach of any covenant or agreement of Parent or Buyer
hereunder.

 



68

    

Section 7.3 _Limitations_.

 

 (a) The Seller Parties shall not have any obligation to indemnify the
Parent Indemnified Persons for any individual Claim or group of related
Claims with respect to any Losses until the aggregate amount of Losses that
otherwise would be payable pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ with
respect to such Claim or group of related Claims exceeds $50,000 (the " _Per
Claim Threshold_ "), it being understood that any such individual Claim or
group of related Claims for amounts less than the Per Claim Threshold shall be
ignored in determining whether the Deductible has been exceeded.

 (b) Except for Actual Fraud or any Seller Rep Breach arising from or
related to any Seller Fundamental Representation or any Seller Tax
Representation, the Seller Parties shall not have any obligation to indemnify
the Parent Indemnified Persons (i) under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_
until the aggregate amount of all Losses for which the Seller Parties are
obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons under _Section_ __ _
7.2(a)(_ _i_ _)_ collectively exceeds $10,000,000 (the " _Deductible_ "), at
which point the Seller Parties shall indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons
for all such Losses in excess of the Deductible (subject to _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_ and the other provisions of this  _Article_ __ _ VII_) or (ii) under
_Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(iii)(2)_ until the aggregate amount of all Losses for
which the Seller Parties are obligated to indemnify the Parent Indemnified
Persons under  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(iii)(2)_ exceeds $2,000,000, at which
point the Seller Parties shall indemnify the Parent Indemnified Persons for
50% of all such Losses in excess of such amount (subject to  _Section_ __ _
7.3(c)_ and the other provisions of this _Article_ __ _ VII_).

 

 (c) Except for Actual Fraud, the Seller Parties liability to the Parent
Indemnified Persons under  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a_ _)(_ _i_ _)_ (including
with respect to any Seller Rep Breach arising from any Seller Fundamental
Representation or any Seller Tax Representation) and _Section_ __ _
7.2(a)(iii)_ shall not exceed, in the aggregate, $10,000,000.

Section 7.4 _Indemnification Procedures_.

 

 (a) Any Person seeking indemnification under _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (each,
an " _Indemnified Person_ ") shall assert any Claim for indemnification,
including any Third-Party Claim, by delivering written notice thereof (a "
_Claim Notice_ ") in accordance with _Section_ __ _ 9.8_ to the Party from
which indemnification is sought under _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (the "
_Indemnifying Party_ "). Each Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail
the nature of the Claim and the amount of any Losses arising therefrom (to
the extent known) and attach copies of all material written evidence thereof
that the Indemnified Person has received from any Person that is not a Party
or a Person that is an Affiliate of a Party (a " _Third Party_ ") to the date
of the Claim Notice. Such Claim Notice shall be delivered to the Indemnifying
Party as promptly as reasonably practicable after receipt by the Indemnified
Person of any written evidence from a Third Party with respect to a Third-
Party Claim or after the Indemnified Person becomes aware of any other Claim
for indemnification hereunder; _provided_ that failure to give any such Claim
Notice on a timely basis shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnifying Party shall have been
actually and materially prejudiced as a result of such failure.

 (b) Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice for a Claim
brought by a Third Party (a " _Third-Party Claim_ "), the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled

 



69

    

 to (i) assume and have sole control over the defense and investigation of
such Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense (subject to the last
sentence of this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_) and with counsel of its own
choosing if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified
Person within thirty (30) days after the delivery of such Claim Notice by the
Indemnified Person and (ii) negotiate a settlement or compromise of, or
consent to the entry of an Order related to, such Claim; _provided_ that, if
(1) such settlement, compromise or consent does not include a full and
unconditional waiver and release by such Third Party of all applicable
Indemnified Persons for all Losses related to such Third-Party Claim, or (2)
such settlement, compromise or consent imposes a Lien on any of the assets of
any such Indemnified Person, such settlement, compromise or consent shall be
permitted only with the prior written consent of such Indemnified Person
(whether or not such Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to
such Third-Party Claim), which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed. If the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of
the defense and investigation of any such Third-Party Claim, then the
Indemnified Person shall be entitled to participate in (but not control) such
defense and investigation with counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnifying Party at such Indemnified Persons sole cost and expense;
_provided_ , _however_ , that, if in the reasonable opinion of counsel to the
Indemnified Person, there are legal defenses available to the Indemnified
Person that are different from or additional to those available to the
Indemnifying Party or there exists a conflict of interest between the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Person that cannot be waived, the
Indemnifying Party shall be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of one
(1) legal counsel to the Indemnified Person (but only to the extent such fees
and expenses constitute Losses for which the Indemnifying Party is otherwise
obligated to provide indemnification for under _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ and, in
any event, subject to the limitations contained in this _Article_ __ _ VII_).

 

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 7.4(b)_,
the Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume and control the
defense or investigation of any Third-Party Claim that (i) seeks an injunction
or other equitable relief against an Indemnified Person, (ii) involves an
allegation that an Indemnified Person committed a criminal act or (iii) would
reasonably be expected to result in Losses to all applicable Indemnified
Persons which, taken with other then-existing Losses for which such
Indemnifying Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this
_Article_ __ _ VII_, would exceed the then-remaining limit of liability of
such Indemnified Person under _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ by more than 50%. If,
within thirty (30) days after delivery by an Indemnified Person of any Claim
Notice related to a Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party (1) (A) notifies
such Indemnified Person in writing that the Indemnifying Party does not elect
to defend and investigate such Third-Party Claim or (B) fails to deliver to
the Indemnified Person a written election to assume the defense and
investigation of such Third-Party Claim or (2) is not entitled to assume the
defense or investigation of such Third-Party Claim, then (I) such Indemnified
Person may, at its option, defend, investigate, settle or compromise, or
consent to an entry of an Order related to, such Third-Party Claim; _provided_
that any such settlement, compromise or consent shall be permitted only with
the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (whether or not the
Indemnifying Party is an actual or potential party to such Third-Party Claim),
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed, and
(II) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but not control) any such
defense and investigation at its sole cost and expense.

 



70

    

 (d) Notwithstanding anything in this  _Section_ __ _ 7.4_ to the
contrary, _Article_ __ _ VIII_ shall govern for purposes of any Third-Party
Claim that is a Tax Claim.

 

Section 7.5 _Losses; Mitigation_.

 

 (a) The amount of any and all Losses of an Indemnified Person that is
indemnifiable under this  _Article_ __ _ VII_ shall be determined net of any
amounts actually recovered by such Indemnified Person under any insurance
policy or any indemnity, contribution or reimbursement arrangement or Contract
under which such Indemnified Person has rights to recovery related to such
Losses (in each case, except for the RandW Insurance Policy). If an Indemnified
Person recovers any such amounts, then such Indemnified Person will, without
duplication, promptly reimburse the Indemnifying Party the excess (if any) of
(i) the amount paid to the Indemnified Person by the Indemnifying Party in
respect of such Losses, _plus_ the amount received by the Indemnified Person
in respect thereof, _minus_  (ii) the full amount of the Losses.

 (b) Except to the extent related to Taxes, each Indemnified Person shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate all Losses after becoming
aware of any event that could reasonably be expected to give rise to any Loss
that is indemnifiable under this _Article_ __ _ VII_, including by
using commercially reasonable efforts to make claims, or otherwise seek
recovery, under any insurance policy, or any indemnity, contribution or
reimbursement arrangement or Contract, in each case, under which such
Indemnified Person has rights to recovery related to such Losses _provided_ ,
_however_ , that neither Parent nor any of its Representatives shall be
required to make any claim, or otherwise seek recovery, under the RandW
Insurance Policy.

 

 (c) The amount of Losses indemnifiable under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(_ _i_
_)_ or  _Section_ __ _ 7.2(b)(_ _i_ _)_ shall be determined without giving
effect to any exception, limitation or qualifier as to materiality,
"material," "in all material respects" or "Material Adverse Effect" in any
representation or warranty in _Article_ __ _ II_ or _Article_ __ _ III_.

 

 (d) The Parent Indemnified Persons shall not be entitled to recover or
make a Claim against the Seller Parties under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)_ for any
Loss (and no such Loss shall be aggregated for purposes of _Section_ __ _
7.3(a)_ or _Section_ __ _ 7.3(b)_) to the extent such Loss is taken into
account in determining the Final Closing Consideration.

Section 7.6 _Exclusive Remedy; Release; Actual Fraud_.

 

 (a) Without limiting any of Parents or its Representatives rights under
the RandW Insurance Policy, from and after the Closing, the provisions of
_Section_ __ _ 1.5_, this _Article_ __ _ VII_, _Section_ __ _ 9.5_ with
respect to any covenant or agreement hereunder that survives the
Closing under _Section_ __ _ 7.1_) and the TSA (such provisions,
collectively, the " _Remedy Provisions_ ") shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for any Claim (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether
at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity) that may be
based on, arise out of or relate to this Agreement or any other agreement or
document contemplated hereby (including the negotiation, execution,
performance or subject matter hereof or thereof) or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any Losses alleged to be suffered by any
Party, any Parent Indemnified Person or any Seller Indemnified Person as a

 



71

    

 result of the actions or failure to act by any Party in connection herewith
or the transactions contemplated hereby. In furtherance of the foregoing,
effective from and after the Closing, and without limiting any Partys rights
under the Remedy Provisions, (i) Parent, on behalf of itself and its
Representatives, hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, the Seller Parties and their respective
Representatives, whether in any individual, corporate or any other capacity,
from and against any and all other rights, Claims and causes of action it may
have against the Seller Parties or their respective Representatives
relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter hereof or any other
agreement or document contemplated hereby or the transactions contemplated
hereby or thereby, including whether arising under or based upon any Law or
otherwise, and (ii) the Seller Parties, on behalf of themselves and their
respective Representatives, hereby waives and releases, to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, Parent and its Representatives, whether in any
individual, corporate or any other capacity, from and against any and all
other rights, Claims and causes of action it may have against Parent or its
Representatives relating (directly or indirectly) to the subject matter hereof
or any other agreement or document contemplated hereby or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, including whether arising under or based upon
any Law or otherwise. The provisions herein relating to indemnification, and
the limits imposed on the Indemnified Persons remedies with respect to this
Agreement and any other agreement or document contemplated hereby and the
transactions contemplated hereby and thereby (including _Section_ __ _ 7.3_
and this _Section_ __ _ 7.6_) were specifically bargained for between
sophisticated parties and were specifically taken into account in the
determination of the amounts to be paid to the Seller Parties hereunder. No
Indemnified Person may avoid the limitations on liability set forth in this 
_Article_ __ _ VII_ by seeking Losses for breach of contract, tort or
pursuant to any other theory of liability.

 

 (b) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing herein,
including in  _Article_ __ _ II_ or _Article_ __ _ III_ or otherwise in
this _Article_ __ _ VII_, shall limit any Partys Liability for, or any
Partys right or ability to bring a Claim (whether under this _Article_ __ _
VII_ or otherwise) for, Actual Fraud.

Section 7.7 _Adjustments for Tax Purposes_. The Parties agree that any
indemnification payments made hereunder shall be treated for Income Tax
purposes as an adjustment to the Final Closing Consideration to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law.

 

Section 7.8 _Indemnified Escheat Liabilities_.

 

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, if,
after the Closing Date, a Party receives notice of any audit, demand, claim,
proposed adjustment, assessment, examination or other administrative or court
proceeding (an " _Escheat Claim_ ") with respect (in whole or in part) to any
Indemnified Escheat Liabilities, such Party shall provide a copy of such
document to the potentially indemnifying Party within twenty (20) days of
receipt; _provided_ , _however_ , that no failure or delay on the part of the
Party entitled to indemnification to give such notice shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the indemnifying Party
hereunder except to the extent the indemnifying Party is actually and
materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. Any information provided or
obtained under this paragraph shall be kept confidential, except as may
otherwise be necessary in connection with the filing of return or other
document relating to escheat or unclaimed property, refund claims, or any
Escheat Claim, or as required by applicable Law.

 



72

    

(b) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 7.8(c)_, Parent or
Buyer shall have the sole right to control the conduct and resolution of any
Escheat Claim relating solely to any Acquired Entity; _provided_ , _however_ ,
in the case of an Escheat Claim (or any portion thereof) for which the
resolution thereof could reasonably be expected to result in an Indemnified
Escheat Liability for which the Seller Parties are liable under _Section_ __ _
7.2(a)(iii)_, (i) Holdings may, at the expense of the Seller Parties,
participate in the defense of any such Escheat Claim and (ii) Parent shall
not, and shall not allow the Acquired Entity to, settle or otherwise resolve
any such Escheat Claim without the prior written consent of Holdings (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such
settlement or other resolution could reasonably be expected to materially
increase the escheat or unclaimed property liability of the Seller Parties
or any of its Affiliates for any period prior to the Closing Date.

(c) With respect to any Escheat Claim relating both to an Acquired Entity,
on the one hand, and any Seller Party or an Affiliate thereof, on the other
hand, the Party that would bear the burden of the greatest portion of the
Liability shall, at its own expense, have the right to control the conduct of
such Escheat Claim (the " _Escheat Controlling Party_ "); _provided_ that (i)
the Escheat Controlling Party shall provide the other Parties hereto (the "
_Escheat  Non-Controlling Party_") with a timely and reasonably detailed
account of each stage of such Escheat Claim, (ii) the Escheat Non-Controlling
Party shall have the right to participate in such Escheat Claim at its own
cost, (iii) the Escheat Controlling Party shall consult with the Escheat Non-
Controlling Party before taking any significant action in connection with
such Escheat Claim, (iv) the Escheat Controlling Party shall consult with the
Escheat Non-Controlling Party and offer the Escheat Non-Controlling Party an
opportunity to comment before submitting any written materials prepared or
furnished in connection with such Escheat Claim, (v) the Escheat Controlling
Party shall defend such Escheat Claim diligently and in good faith as if it
were the only party in interest in connection with such Escheat Claim and
(vi) the Escheat Controlling Party shall not, and shall not allow its
Affiliates to, settle or otherwise resolve any such Escheat Claim without the
prior written consent of the Escheat Non-Controlling Party (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned) if such settlement
or abandonment could have an adverse impact on the Escheat Non-Controlling
Party or any of its direct or indirect owners; _provided_ , _further_ , that,
for the avoidance of doubt, for purposes of this clause _(c)_ , Holdings shall
act as the Escheat Controlling Party or the Escheat Non-Controlling Party, as
the case may be, on behalf of the Seller Parties, and Parent shall act as the
Escheat Controlling Party or the Escheat Non-Controlling Party on behalf of
Parent and Buyer.

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the
provisions contained in _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ shall apply mutatis mutandis to
Indemnified Escheat Liabilities.

ARTICLE VIII

 

 _TAX MATTERS_

 

Section 8.1 _Responsibility for Filing Tax Returns_.

 

 (a) Holdings shall prepare or cause to be prepared all (i) Income Tax
Returns for the Acquired Entities in respect of any taxable period ending on
or prior to the Closing Date and due after the date hereof and (ii) all other
Tax Returns for the Acquired Entities required to be filed after the date
hereof but on or prior to the Closing Date (each such Tax Return described in
the preceding clause (i) and clause (ii), a " _Pre-Closing Tax Return_"). Each
Pre-Closing Tax Return shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the
Acquired Entities respective past practices. Holdings shall timely file, or
cause to be timely filed, all Pre-Closing Tax Returns that are required under
applicable Law to be filed (taking into account applicable extensions) on or
before the Closing Date. Holdings shall deliver, or cause to be delivered, to
Parent all Pre-Closing Tax Returns that are required to be filed by
the Acquired Entities after the Closing Date at least ten (10) days prior to
the due date for filing such Pre-Closing Tax Returns (taking into account
applicable extensions) and Parent shall timely file or cause to be timely
filed all such Pre-Closing Tax Returns. With respect to any such Pre-Closing
Tax Return, Holdings shall consider in good faith all reasonable comments of
Parent that are provided by Parent to Holdings at least five (5) days prior to
the due date for filing such Pre-Closing Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions).

 

 (b) Parent shall, except to the extent any Tax Returns are the
responsibility of Holdings under  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)_, prepare and timely
file all other Tax Returns required to be filed by or with respect to the
Acquired Entities. Any such Tax Return for a taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date shall be prepared in a manner consistent with the Acquired
Entities respective past practices, and shall be submitted to Holdings for
its review and comment not less than ten (10) days (in the case of any Income
Tax Return), or five (5) days (in the case of any Non-Income Tax Return),
prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (taking into account
applicable extensions). Parent shall consider in good faith all reasonable
comments of Holdings that are provided by Holdings to Parent at least five
(5) days (in the case of any Income Tax Return), or three (3) days (in the
case of any Non-Income Tax Return), prior to the due date for filing such Tax
Return (taking into account applicable extensions).

 (c) 

 

(i) Upon the written request of Parent setting forth the amount owed with
respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Return or other Tax Return for a taxable period
beginning before the Closing Date, the Seller Parties shall pay to Parent, no
later than three (3) days prior to the due date (taking into
account applicable extensions) for the applicable Pre-Closing Tax Return or
other Tax Return for a taxable period beginning before the Closing Date (or
the date on which such Parent request was received, whichever is later), an
amount equal to the Indemnified Taxes for which the Seller Parties are liable
pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(iii)_. No failure or delay of Parent in
providing such a Tax Return for Holdings review and comment shall reduce or
otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of the Seller Parties
hereunder except to the extent the Seller Parties are actually and materially
prejudiced by such failure or delay (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction).

 



74

    

(ii) No later than three (3) days after the filing of any Pre-Closing Tax
Return or other Tax Return for a taxable period beginning before the Closing
Date, Parent shall (1) provide the Seller Parties with a calculation of the
excess of (A) the sum of (x) any Taxes that have previously been paid by the
Seller Parties and (y) any Taxes specifically included as a liability in the
calculation of the Net Working Capital, as finally determined under _Section_
__ _ 1.5_, and that resulted in an actual reduction of the Final Closing
Consideration, in each case, that are shown as due on such Tax Return over (B)
the total Tax liability reflected on such Tax Return actually filed, and (2)
pay to Sellers, pro rata in accordance with their respective Ownership
Percentages, the amount described in the preceding clause (1).

 

 (d) Parent shall not, and shall not allow any Acquired Entity to initiate
(or agree to) any Seller Tax Matter without the prior written consent of
Holdings (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed).

 

Section 8.2 _Straddle Periods_. For purposes hereof, in the case of any
Taxes that are payable with respect to a Straddle Period, the portion of any
such Taxes that is allocable to the pre-Closing portion of the Straddle Period
shall:

 

 (a) in the case of property Taxes and other similar Taxes imposed on a
periodic basis for a Straddle Period, the amounts that are attributable to
the portion of the Straddle Period ending on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date shall be determined by multiplying the Taxes for the entire
Straddle Period (or, in the case of such Taxes determined on an arrears
basis, the amount of such Taxes for the immediately preceding period) by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar days in the portion
of the Straddle Period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date
and the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period;

 (b) in the case of Taxes in the form of interest or penalties, all such
Taxes shall be treated as attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax Period to the
extent relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period whether such items are
incurred, accrued, assessed or similarly charged on, before or after the
Closing Date;

 

 (c) in the case of Taxes imposed on an Acquired Entity, Buyer or Parent or
any of their respective Affiliates as a result of income of any entity, plan
or arrangement treated as a partnership or disregarded entity for Tax purposes
(a " _Flow-Thru Entity_ ") realized prior to the Closing Date (such income
being computed, except as provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.8_, assuming the
Flow-Thru Entity had a year that ends on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date and elected to close its books), such Taxes shall be treated as
Taxes of the Acquired Entities for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; _provided_ that
for the avoidance of doubt, Taxes imposed or assessed pursuant to Sections
6221 through 6241 of the Code in respect of or relating to any "reviewed
year" (within the meaning of Section 6225(d)(1) of the Code), or portion
thereof, that falls within a Pre-Closing Tax Period shall be treated as Taxes
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period; and

 



75

    

 (d) in the case of all other Taxes for a Straddle Period (including
Income Taxes, franchise/capital Taxes, employment Taxes, sales and use Taxes
and withholding Taxes) the amount attributable to the portion of the Straddle
Period ending on the day immediately prior to the Closing Date shall be
determined as if the Acquired Entities filed a separate Tax Return with
respect to such Taxes for the portion of the Straddle Period ending as of the
end of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date using a "closing of the
books methodology;"  _provided_ that exemptions, allowances or deductions
that are calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and
amortization deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on the
day immediately prior to the Closing Date and the period beginning on the
Closing Date in proportion to the number of days in each period.

 

Section 8.3 _Tax Refunds_. All refunds of Taxes payable by an Acquired
Entity for any Pre-Closing Tax Period to the extent paid by the Acquired
Entity prior to the Closing or specifically included as a liability in the
calculation of Net Working Capital (as finally adjusted pursuant to 
_Section_ __ _ 1.5_) or of Taxes for which a Seller Party has indemnified the
Parent Indemnified Persons under _Section_ __ _ 7.2_ (whether in the form of
cash received or a credit against Taxes otherwise payable) shall be the
property of Sellers. Parent shall pay or cause to be paid any such Tax refund
to Sellers, pro rata in accordance with their respective Ownership
Percentages, within fifteen (15) days after receipt thereof (without interest,
except for interest received from a Taxing Authority), net of any Taxes
imposed on such refund and any reasonable out-of-pocket expenses that Parent,
Buyer, the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates directly incur (or
shall directly incur) for their receipt of such Tax refund (and related
interest). Any other Tax refunds related to any Acquired Entity shall be for
the sole account of Parent and Buyer. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 8.3_
shall require that Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates make any payment
with respect to any refund for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for the
benefit of Parent and Buyer) that is with respect to (a) any refund of Tax
that is the result of the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax
attribute or Tax credit incurred in a Post-Closing Tax Period; or (b) any
refund of a Tax to the extent that it gives rise to a payment obligation by
Parent, Buyer, the Acquired Entities or any of their Affiliates after the
Closing Date to any Person under applicable Law or pursuant to a provision of
a contract or other agreement entered (or assumed) by an Acquired Entity on
or prior to the Closing Date.

Section 8.4 _Contests Related to Taxes_.

 

 (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section_ __ _ 7.4_, if,
after the Closing Date, a Party receives notice of any audit, demand, claim,
proposed adjustment, assessment, examination or other administrative or court
proceeding (a " _Tax Claim_ ") with respect (in whole or in part) to any
Indemnified Taxes, such Party shall provide a copy of such document to the
potentially indemnifying Party within twenty (20) days of receipt; _provided_
, _however_ , that no failure or delay on the part of the Party entitled to
indemnification to give such notice shall reduce or otherwise affect the
obligations or liabilities of the indemnifying Party hereunder except to the
extent the indemnifying Party is actually and materially prejudiced by such
failure or delay. Any information provided or obtained under this paragraph
shall be kept confidential, except as may otherwise be necessary in connection
with the filing of a Tax Return, refund claims, or any Tax Claim, or as
required by applicable Law.

 



76

    

 (b) Except as otherwise provided in  _Section_ __ _ 8.4(c)_ with respect
to Tax Claims relating to a Flow-Through Tax Return, Parent or Buyer shall
have the sole right to control the conduct and resolution of any Tax Claim of
any Acquired Entity; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that, in the case of a Tax
Claim (or any portion thereof) relating to any taxable period beginning before
the Closing Date of any Acquired Entity for which the resolution thereof could
reasonably be expected to result in an Indemnified Tax for which the Seller
Parties are liable under _Section_ __ _ 7.2(a)(iii)_, (i) Holdings may, at
the expense of the Seller Parties, participate in the defense of any such Tax
Claim and (ii) Parent shall not, and shall not allow the Acquired Entity to,
settle or otherwise resolve any such Tax Claim without the prior written
consent of Holdings (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed
or conditioned) if such settlement or other resolution could reasonably be
expected to materially increase the Tax liability of the Seller Parties or any
of its Affiliates for any Pre-Closing Tax Period.

 

 (c) With respect to any Tax Claims relating to a Flow-Through Tax Return,
Holdings shall have the sole right to control the conduct and resolution of
any such Tax Claim of any Acquired Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in
the case of a Tax Claim (or any portion thereof) relating a Flow-Through Tax
Return for which an election under Section 6221(b) or 6226 of the Code (and
any similar or analogous election under state or local Tax Law) is not
available or the resolution thereof could reasonably be expected to adversely
affect the Tax liability of Parent, Buyer or any of their Affiliates after
the Closing, (i) Holdings shall keep Parent reasonably informed regarding the
status of such Tax Claim, (ii) Holdings shall control such Tax Claim
diligently and in good faith as if it were the only party in interest in
connection with such Tax Claim, and (iii) Holdings shall not, and shall not
allow the Acquired Entity or any of its Affiliates to, settle or otherwise
resolve any such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of Parent (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned).

Section 8.5 _Cooperation Related to Taxes_. Parent, Buyer, the Acquired
Entities and the Seller Parties shall cooperate (and shall cause their
Affiliates to cooperate) fully, as and to the extent reasonably requested by
the other party, in connection with (a) preparing and filing any Tax Return,
amended Tax Return or claim for refund relating to any Acquired Entity, its
business or assets, (b) determining a liability for Taxes or an indemnity
obligation relating to Taxes under this Agreement or a right to refund of
Taxes relating to any Acquired Entity, its business or assets, or (c) any
audit, examination, assessment, litigation or other proceeding with respect to
Taxes of any Acquired Entity, its business or assets. Such cooperation shall
include the retention and (upon the other partys request) the provision of
any information, records or other documents necessary or reasonably requested
in connection with the foregoing or otherwise to allow Parent, Buyer, any
Acquired Entity or any of their Affiliates to comply with any information
reporting or withholding requirements contained in the Code or other
applicable Laws, and making employees available on a mutually convenient basis
to provide additional information and explanation of any material provided
hereunder. Any information obtained under this _Section_ __ _ 8.5_ or under
any other Section hereof providing for the sharing of information or review of
any Tax Return or other schedule relating to Taxes for any Acquired Entity
shall be kept, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, confidential by
the parties hereto and their respective legal and tax advisors. Each party
shall retain all Tax Returns, schedules and all material records and
other documents relating to Tax matters of any Acquired Entity, its business
or assets until the later of (i) the expiration of the statute of limitations
for the Tax periods to which the Tax Returns and other documents relate or
(ii) six (6) years following the due date (without extension) for such Tax
Returns.

 



77

    

Section 8.6 _Transfer Taxes_ _._ All Transfer Taxes shall be borne 50% by
Parent, on the one hand, and 50% by the Seller Parties, on the other hand.
Unless otherwise required by applicable Law, Parent shall be responsible for
preparing and timely filing any Tax Return relating to such Transfer
Taxes and the Seller Parties shall timely pay its allocable portion of any
such Transfer Taxes to Parent. To the extent that any Transfer Taxes are
required by Law to be paid by the Seller Parties and remitted to any Taxing
Authority, Parent shall timely pay its allocable portion of any such Transfer
Taxes to the Seller Parties, and the Seller Parties shall timely remit such
Taxes (or cause such Taxes to be timely remitted) to the Taxing Authority. __

 

Section 8.7 _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax Sharing Agreements (other
than this Agreement), whether or not written, that may have been entered into
by a Seller Party or any of its Affiliates on the one hand, and any Acquired
Entity, on the other hand, shall be terminated as to such Acquired Entity as
of the Closing, and no payments which are owed by or to such Acquired Entity
pursuant thereto shall be made thereunder after the Closing.

Section 8.8 _Tax Treatment_.

 (a) The Seller Parties and Parent agree that, for U.S. federal Income Tax
purposes (and applicable state and local Income Tax purposes), (i) Buyers
purchase of all the Purchased Company LLC Interests is intended to be governed
by IRS Revenue Ruling 99-6, 1999-1 C.B. 432 (Situation 2), and, pursuant
thereto, on the Closing Date, (1) with respect to Buyer, (A) the Company shall
be deemed to make a liquidating distribution of its assets to Sellers,
and (B) Buyer shall be deemed to acquire, by purchase, all such assets from
Sellers, and (2) with respect to Sellers, Sellers shall be treated as selling
partnership interests in the Company, in each case, in exchange for the Final
Closing Consideration (as finally determined pursuant to _Section_ __ _
1.5_) (as properly adjusted for assumed liabilities, including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the liabilities set forth in the Company Payoff Letters)
and net of the Owned Real Property Purchase Price and shall report gain or
loss, if any, resulting from the sale of their partnership interests in
accordance with Section 741 of the Code, (ii) Buyers purchase of the
Purchased Real Estate LLC Interests shall be treated as a taxable sale of the
assets of the Acquired Real Estate Subsidiaries in exchange for the Owned Real
Property Purchase Price and, (iii) for the avoidance of doubt, the Income Tax
Returns described in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(a)(_ _i_ _)_ shall, to the maximum
extent permitted by applicable Law, include any deductions allowable with
respect to the Unpaid Transaction Expenses (collectively, the " _Intended
Tax Treatment_ ").

 (b) The Seller Parties and Parent shall not (and shall cause their
respective Affiliates not to) take any position on any Tax Return or during
the course of any Tax proceeding inconsistent with the Intended Tax Treatment,
unless otherwise required by a final determination of a Taxing Authority.

 

Section 8.9 _Certain Elections_.

 

 (a) Parent, Buyer, the Company and the Seller Parties acknowledge and
agree that the Company and any other Acquired Entity treated as a partnership
for U.S.

 



78

Company and such other Acquired Entity to, to the extent an election under
Section 754 of the Code (a " _Section_ __ _ 754 Election_") is not already
in effect with respect to the Company or such Acquired Entity, make a timely
and valid Section 754 Election with respect to the taxable year that includes
the Closing. 

 (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, Parent,
Buyer, the Company and the Seller Parties acknowledge and agree, with respect
to any partnership Income Tax Returns of the Company and any other Acquired
Entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal Income Tax purposes (or any
similar or analogous state or local Income Tax purposes) for a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, to minimize, to the maximum extent possible, any obligations of
the Company or such Acquired Entity to pay Taxes in connection with any audit
of the Company, such Acquired Entity and/or any partnership of which the
Company or Acquired Entity is a partner by means of an election under Section
6221(b) of the Code (and any similar or analogous election under state or
local Tax Law) if available, and, if such election is not available (or not
made), by means of an election under Section 6226 of the Code (and any similar
or analogous election under state or local Tax Law); _provided_ that for the
avoidance of doubt, if the Company or such Acquired Entity is required to
make any payment to a Taxing Authority in connection with such an audit, the
Seller Parties shall pay over to Parent an amount equal to the amount of such
payment made on behalf of or with respect to the Company or Acquired Entity
within five (5) days following written demand therefor.(taking into account
applicable extensions).

 

Section 8.10 _Exclusivity_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, in the event of a conflict or inconsistency between the provisions of
this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ and the provisions of _Article_ __ _ VII_, the
provisions of this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ shall govern.

the covenants and agreements in this _Article_ __ _ VIII_ (other than

Returns described in  _Section_ __ _ 8.1(c)_) shall survive the Closing Date
until sixty (60) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations period (including any extensions or waivers thereof).

act of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations
and warranties hereunder of the other Parties or (c) waive compliance with
any covenant or agreement hereunder of the other Parties or any of its
conditions to the Closing in _Article_ __ _ V_; _provided_ that any such
extension or waiver shall be in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of
such extending or waiving Party. The failure of any Party to assert any of its
rights hereunder or otherwise shall not be a waiver of such rights, and no
single or partial exercise by any Party of any of its rights hereunder shall
preclude any other or further exercise of such rights or any other rights
hereunder.

 



79

    

Section 9.3 _Entire Agreement; Counterparts_.

 

 (a) This Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreements (except for Sections 4
and 7 of the General Confidentiality Agreement, which sections shall
terminate and be of no force or effect after the Parties execution and
delivery hereof) and the Facilities Access Agreements (i) are the entire
agreement and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written
and oral, among the Parties related to the subject matter hereof and thereof
(although any provisions of the Confidentiality Agreements conflicting
herewith shall be governed by this Agreement) and (ii) are not intended to
confer any rights, benefits, remedies or Liabilities on any Person except for
the Parties and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except as
provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.7(c)_.

 

 (b) This Agreement may be executed in two (2) or more counterparts, all of
which shall be considered one and the same agreement and shall become
effective when two (2) or more counterparts have been executed by each of the
Parties and delivered to the other Parties (including by email of a portable
document format (pdf)).

 

Section 9.4 _Applicable Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL_. This
Agreement (including, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, the
Confidentiality Agreements), and all Claims and causes of action (whether in
contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law
or by statute) or in equity) that may be based on, arise out of or relate to
this Agreement (including, for purposes of this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, the
Confidentiality Agreements) (including the negotiation, execution, performance
or subject matter hereof) or the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, " _Governed Claims_ "), shall be governed by the Laws of the
State of Delaware applicable to agreements made and to be performed solely
therein, without giving effect to principles of conflicts of law. For any
Governed Claim, each Party (a) irrevocably and unconditionally consents and
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction and venue of the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware or, to the extent such court does not have subject
matter jurisdiction, the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware or,
to the extent such court does not have subject matter jurisdiction, the
Superior Court of the State of Delaware (such courts, collectively, the "
_Selected Courts_ "), (b) agrees that such Governed Claim shall be heard and
determined exclusively under clause (a) of this _Section_ __ _ 9.4_, (c)
waives any objection to laying venue for such Governed Claim in any
Selected Court, (d) waives any objection that any Selected Court is an
inconvenient forum or does not have jurisdiction over any Party and (e) agrees
that service of process upon such Party for such Governed Claim shall be
effective if such process is given as a notice under _Section_ __ _ 9.8_.
EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
GOVERNED CLAIM.

 

Section 9.5 _Remedies; Specific Performance_. The Parties acknowledge and
agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any provision
hereof was not performed, or threatened to not be performed, under their
specific terms or were otherwise breached and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. Accordingly, at any time
prior to the termination hereof under _Article_ __ _ VI_, each Party shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches hereof 

 



80

    

 and to bring any Claim to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions hereof, without proof of actual damages (and each Party waives any
requirement for the securing or posting of any bond in connection with such
remedy), this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled
at law or in equity; _provided_ , _however_ , that the right of the Seller
Parties to enforce specifically (through an injunction or otherwise) Parents
or Buyers obligation, as applicable, to consummate the Closing shall be
available only if a Parent Closing Failure has occurred and the proceeds of
the Financing are available or will be available at the Closing; _provided_ ,
_further_ , that in no event shall the Seller Parties or any of its
Representatives (a) be entitled to both an injunction or injunctions to cause
Parent or Buyer to fully enforce the terms of the Commitment Letter, or any
definitive agreements related thereto, against the Financing Sources and to
cause the Financing Sources to fund the Financing and (b) payment of any
Parent Termination Fee or any portion thereto. No Party shall assert (i) that
a remedy of specific enforcement is unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law
or inequitable for any reason or (ii) that a remedy of monetary damages would
provide an adequate remedy for any such breach. For the avoidance of doubt, no
Financing Source shall be subject to any special, consequential, punitive or
indirect damages or damages of a tortuous nature. In the event any Party seeks
an injunction or Claim to enforce specifically the performance of terms and
provisions hereof pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 9.5_, the Outside Date (as
it may be extended under _Section_ __ _ 6.1(b)(i)_), shall automatically be
extended by (i) the amount of time during which such Claim is pending or (ii)
such other time period established by the court presiding over such Claim.

Section 9.6 _Payment of Expenses_. Whether or not the Closing occurs,
except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 9.6_ of the Seller Disclosure Schedule
and except for payment of the other Reimbursable Expenses, each Party shall
pay all fees, costs and expenses incurred by it related to this Agreement
(including the negotiation, preparation or execution hereof) or any
transaction contemplated hereby. Parent shall be responsible for all fees
associated with obtaining the RandW Insurance Policy, including the total
premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commission, Taxes related to such
policy and any other fees and expenses related to obtaining the RandW Insurance
Policy.

 

Section 9.7 _Assignability; Third-Party Rights_. Neither this Agreement
nor any of the rights, interests, covenants or agreements hereunder shall be
assigned by any of the Parties, in whole or in part (whether by operation of
Law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other Parties, and
any such assignment without such consent shall be null and void, except that
Buyer may assign, in its sole discretion, any or all of its rights, interests
and obligations hereunder to any entity that is wholly owned, directly or
indirectly, by Parent. This Agreement shall be binding on, inure to the
benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Except as provided in _Section_ __ _ 4.7(c)_, nothing
herein is intended to or shall confer on any Person (except for the Parties)
any right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever.

 



81

shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (a) when delivered personally by
hand (with written confirmation of receipt by nonautomatic means, whether

contrary, each of the Seller Parties, on behalf of the Seller Related Parties,
and each other Party, on behalf of itself and each of its Affiliates, hereby
(a) agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of

thereof) and irrevocably submits itself and its property with respect to any
such proceeding to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts, (b) agrees that
any such proceeding shall be governed by the laws of the State of New York
