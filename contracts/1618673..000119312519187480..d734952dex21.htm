&#147;<U>Financing</U>&#148;) to Parent in the amounts described therein for the purposes of funding the transactions contemplated hereby and the related fees and expenses. As of the date hereof, the Commitment Letter is in full force and effect and
has not been withdrawn or terminated or otherwise amended, supplemented or modified in any respect. The Commitment Letter, in the form so delivered, is a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent, Buyer and, to Parent&#146;s Knowledge, the other
parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with its terms except as limited by the Bankruptcy and Equitable Exceptions. Other than the Commitment Letter, there is no agreement, side letter or arrangement relating to the Financing that could
adversely affect the conditionality of the Financing, and the Commitment Letter contains all of the conditions precedent to the obligations of the parties thereunder to make the Financing available to Parent on the terms therein. Other than as
expressly set forth in the Commitment Letter and in any related fee letters (of which Parent has delivered true and complete copies, redacted to remove fee amounts and other economic terms, to Holdings on or prior to the date hereof), there are no
other agreements, side letters or arrangements relating to the Financing that could affect the amount or availability of the Financing. The Commitment Letter is not subject to any contingency or condition of any kind whatsoever, including any
subsequent approval process, related to the funding of the full amount of the Financing contemplated by the Commitment Letter (including any &#147;flex&#148; provisions or similar provisions affecting the structure, pricing, maturity, amortization
or any other terms) other than as set forth in the executed copies thereof attached hereto and in the related fee letters provided in connection therewith. As of the date hereof, assuming that the representations and warranties in
<U>Article</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;II</U> are true and correct in all material respects, no event has occurred which, with or without notice, lapse of time or both, would (i)&nbsp;constitute a default or breach of Parent or Buyer, or, to Parent&#146;s

any of the conditions to the funding of the Financing on the Closing Date in the Commitment Letter not being satisfied; or (iv)&nbsp;otherwise result in or would reasonably be expected to result in any portion of the Financing not being available to
Parent on the Closing Date. As of the date hereof, no party to the Commitment Letter has notified Parent or Buyer of its intention to terminate the Commitment Letter or not to provide the Financing. Assuming satisfaction of the conditions in
<U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;5.1</U> and <U>Section</U><U></U><U>&nbsp;5.2</U>, as of the date hereof, neither Parent nor Buyer has reason to believe that it will be unable to satisfy, on a timely basis, any term or condition of closing to be
satisfied by it with respect to the Commitment Letter or that the full amount of the Financing will not be available as of the Closing. As of the date hereof, Parent has fully paid any and all commitment fees or other fees required by the Commitment
Letter (or any related fee letter or engagement letter) to be paid on or before the date hereof. Neither the Commitment Letter nor any related fee letter or engagement letter contains any commitment fee or other fee payable by the Seller Parties or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates prior to Closing. The aggregate proceeds from the Financing constitute all of the financing required to be provided by Parent for the consummation of the transactions hereby on the Closing Date, and
are sufficient for the satisfaction of all of Parent&#146;s obligations under this Agreement, including the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby on the Closing Date and payment of the related fees and expenses. </P>
