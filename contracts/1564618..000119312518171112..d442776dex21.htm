common shares, par value $0.01 per share, of IBG (the " _IBG Shares_ "),
without interest and subject to adjustment in accordance with Section 1.05(C)
(the " _Merger Consideration_ ").

 

(B) All GBNK Shares issued and outstanding immediately prior to the

immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _GBNK_ _ 2005_ _RSA_ "),
consistent with the terms of such plan shall vest and be entitled to receive
the Merger Consideration set forth in Section 1.05(A) in respect of each

Long-Term Incentive Plan, as amended (the " _GBNK 2015 Equity Plan_ "), that
is outstanding as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _GBNK_ _2015
RSA_ ") shall be converted into a restricted stock award in respect of IBG
Shares (each, an " _Adjusted RSA_ "), with the same terms and conditions as
were applicable under such GBNK 2015 RSA immediately prior to the Effective
Time (except that with respect to any performance-vesting GBNK 2015 RSA, the
performance-based vesting conditions applicable to such GBNK 2015 RSA
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall not apply from and after the

with the number of GBNK Shares determined as set forth below), _multiplied by_
(ii) the Exchange Ratio, with any fractional shares rounded up to the next
whole number of shares. For purposes of this Section 1.06(B), the number of
GBNK Shares subject to each GBNK 2015 RSA for which the performance period is
not completed as of the Effective Time shall be the target number of GBNK
Shares subject to such GBNK 2015 RSA.

(C) _GBNK Actions_. Prior to the Effective Time, the GBNK Board or the
appropriate committee thereof shall adopt resolutions and take such other
actions with respect to the GBNK RSAs as are necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 1.06.

(D) _IBG Actions_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective

Form S-8, or a post-effective amendment to a registration statement previously
filed under the Securities Act, with respect to the IBG Shares subject to the
Adjusted RSAs.

Registration Statement, all amendments and supplements thereto and all
responses to requests for additional information. GBNK agrees to
reasonably cooperate with IBG and IBGs counsel and accountants in requesting
and obtaining appropriate opinions, consents and letters from its financial
advisor and independent auditor and in taking such other required actions in
connection with the Registration Statement and the Proxy Statement. If GBNK
has reasonably cooperated and promptly provided information required to be
delivered by it for inclusion in the Registration Statement and Proxy
Statement as required by this Section 1.08(A) and Section 5.02, IBG shall
file, or cause to be filed, the Registration Statement with the SEC on or

GBNK shall prepare and deliver (at its expense) the Proxy Statement to its
stockholders as promptly as practicable after the date that the Registration
Statement is declared effective and a final prospectus (relating to the
Registration Statement) and Proxy Statement is on file with the SEC before
such mailing, and shall hold the GBNK Meeting as promptly as practicable
thereafter and in any event on or before the sixtieth (60th) day after the
date that the Registration Statement is declared effective. Except as
otherwise set forth in Section 1.08(C), neither GBNK nor the GBNK Board nor
any committee thereof shall (i) withhold, withdraw or modify in any manner
adverse to IBG or propose publicly to withhold, withdraw or modify in any

result from a breach of Section 5.10) is made to GBNK by a third party, and

(3) the GBNK Board, after consultation with its outside counsel, has
determined in good faith, after giving effect to all of the adjustments which
may be offered by IBG pursuant to subclause (c) of item (4) below, that
failure to make a GBNK Change in Recommendation would reasonably be expected
to be inconsistent with the GBNK Boards fiduciary duties under applicable
Law; and

(4) (a) the GBNK Board has concluded in good faith, after giving effect to
all of the adjustments which may be offered by IBG pursuant to subclause (c)
below, that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, (b)
GBNK has notified IBG, at least five Business Days in advance, of its
intention to make a GBNK Change in Recommendation in response to such

Recommendation, GBNK has, and has caused its financial and legal advisors to,

(b) above, negotiated with IBG in good faith for a period of up to five
Business Days (to the extent IBG desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal ceases to constitute a Superior Proposal. Any change to
the material terms of an Acquisition Proposal shall require a new notice of
GBNKs intention to make a GBNK Change in Recommendation and the provisions of
this Section 1.08(C) shall apply anew to such Acquisition Proposal.

 

(D) The Board of Directors of IBG (the " _IBG Board_ ") shall duly call,
give notice of, and cause to be held, a meeting of its shareholders (the "

expense) of the Proxy Statement to its shareholders as promptly as
practicable after the date that the Registration Statement is declared
effective and a final prospectus (relating to the Registration Statement) and

company mutually agreeable to IBG and GBNK (the " _Exchange Agent_ "), for the
benefit of the holders of the GBNK Shares (i) certificates for shares or, at
IBGs option, evidence of shares in book entry form, including via the direct

payable in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to Section 1.05(C) (such IBG
Shares and cash described in the foregoing clauses (i) and (ii), " _Exchange
Fund_ ").

 

(B) As soon as practicable after the Effective Time, but in no event more
than five Business Days after the Effective Time, the Resulting Corporation
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to mail
to each record holder of an outstanding certificate or certificates
representing GBNK Shares (each, a " _Certificate_ ", it being understood that
any reference herein to " _Certificate_ " shall be deemed to include reference
to book-entry accounts relating to the ownership of GBNK Shares), a form
letter of transmittal which will specify that delivery shall be effected, and
risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper
delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and contain instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates for payment therefor.
IBG shall provide a draft of the form of letter of transmittal to GBNK no

letter of transmittal and any associated cover letter shall be mutually
acceptable to IBG and GBNK before such transmittal materials are mailed to

represented by the Certificate, and (ii) an amount of cash as payment in lieu

Certificates representing Cancelled Shares) shall from and after the Effective
Time represent for all purposes only the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without any interest thereon. Promptly after receipt of the
Transmittal Materials, the Resulting Corporation will use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause the Exchange Agent to review the Transmittal
Materials in order to verify proper completion and execution thereof. As soon
as practicable after the Effective Time and the surrender of a Certificate to

Materials, the Resulting Corporation will use commercially reasonable efforts

filing. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the
Resulting Corporation, they shall be promptly presented to the Exchange Agent
and exchanged as provided in this Section 2.04.

(D) No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective Time
with respect to IBG Shares and payable to the holders thereof shall be paid to

shall be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions,
without interest thereon, which had become payable after the Effective Time
with respect to the IBG Shares represented by such Certificate.

(E) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains unclaimed by the
stockholders of GBNK for twelve months after the Exchange Agent mails the
letter of transmittal pursuant to this Section 2.04 shall be delivered to the
Resulting Corporation upon demand, and any stockholders of GBNK who have not
theretofore complied with the exchange procedures in this Section 2.04 shall
look to the Resulting Corporation only, and not the Exchange Agent, for the
payment of the Merger Consideration in respect of such shares. If outstanding
Certificates for GBNK Shares are not surrendered or the payment for them is
not claimed before the date on which such IBG Shares or cash would otherwise
escheat to any governmental unit or agency, the unclaimed items shall, to the
extent permitted by abandoned property or any other applicable Law, become the
property of the Resulting Corporation (and to the extent not in its possession
shall be delivered to it), free and clear of all claims or interest of any
Person previously entitled to such property.

(F) If any IBG Shares are to be issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of the issuance thereof that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
appropriately endorsed (or accompanied by an appropriate instrument of
transfer) and otherwise in proper form (reasonably satisfactory to the
Resulting Corporation) for transfer, and that the Person requesting such
exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent in advance any transfer or other
taxes required by reason of the issuance of a certificate representing IBG
Shares in any name other than that of the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered, or required for any other reason, or shall establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or not
payable. The Exchange Agent, IBG or the Resulting Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any portion of the Merger Consideration
or other consideration payable under this Agreement such amounts as the
Exchange Agent, IBG or the Resulting Corporation, as the case may be, is
required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or any provision of state,
local or foreign tax Law, with respect to the making of such payment. To the
extent that the amounts are so withheld by the Exchange Agent, IBG or the
Resulting Corporation, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder
of GBNK Shares or GBNK RSAs in respect of whom such deduction and withholding
was made by the Exchange Agent, IBG or the Resulting Corporation, as the case
may be.

 



-12- (G) None of IBG, the Resulting Corporation, GBNK, the Exchange Agent
or any other Person shall be liable to any former holder of GBNK Shares for
any IBG Share (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash
properly delivered to a public official pursuant to applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Laws.

(H) If any Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, then upon the
making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming such Certificate
to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by IBG, the Resulting
Corporation or the Exchange Agent, the posting by such Person of a bond in
such amount as IBG, the Resulting Corporation or the Exchange Agent may
direct (not to exceed the amount of Merger Consideration relating to the
relevant missing Certificate) as indemnity against any claim that may be made
against IBG, the Resulting Corporation, Independent Bank, or GBNK with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof pursuant to this Agreement.

the meaning of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a plan that has two or more
contributing sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control,

There have been no prohibited transactions (described under ERISA § 406 or
Code § 4975(c)), breaches of fiduciary duty or any other breaches or
violations of any Law applicable to the Employee Plans and related Funding
Arrangements that would reasonably be expected to subject IBG, Independent
Bank, GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary to any material taxes, penalties or other
liabilities. For purposes of this Agreement, " _ERISA Affiliate_ " shall
mean, with respect to any entity, trade or business, any other entity, trade

with respect to each Employee Plan.

 

(E) There are no pending claims, lawsuits or actions relating to any
Employee Plan (other than ordinary course claims for benefits) and, to the
Best Knowledge of GBNK, none are threatened and no set of circumstances exists
that would reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the Employee
Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the Employee
Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Employee Plans that
would reasonably be expected to result in any material liability of GBNK or
any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the
U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S. Department of Labor, any
participant in an Employee Plan or any other party. No Employee Plan is under
audit or the subject of an investigation by the IRS, the U.S. Department of
Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the SEC or any other
Governmental Authority, nor is any such audit or investigation pending or, to
the Best Knowledge of GBNK, threatened.

applicable state Law).

 

(G) There are no material surrender charges, penalties, or other costs or
fees that would reasonably be expected to be imposed by any Person against
GBNK, any GBNK Subsidiary, an Employee Plan, or any other Person, including an
Employee Plan participant or beneficiary, as a result of the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement with respect to any
insurance, annuity or investment contracts or other similar investment held by
any Employee Plan.

(H) With respect to each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA)
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to, currently or in
the past six years, by any trade or business with which GBNK or any GBNK
Subsidiary is required by any of the rules contained in the Code or ERISA to
be treated as a single employer (" _Controlled Group Plans_ "):

 

(1) All Controlled Group Plans which are "group health plans" (as defined
in the Code and ERISA) have been operated before the Closing such that
failures to operate such group health plans in compliance, in all material
respects, with Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA and Code § § 4980B and
4980D would not reasonably be expected to subject GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary
to material liability;

(2) There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a defined benefit plan (as
defined in ERISA), nor has there been a Controlled Group Plan that is a
defined benefit plan in the last five calendar years; and

 



-30- (3) There is no Controlled Group Plan that is a "multiple employer plan"
or "multi-employer plan" (as either such term is defined in ERISA), nor has
there been a Controlled Group Plan that is either a multiple employer plan or
multi-employer plan since 2007.

 

(I) Except as otherwise set forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.28(I)_ ,
neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in conjunction with
any other event) result in, cause the vesting, funding, exercisability or
delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any payment, right or
other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other service provider of
GBNK or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any limitation on the right of
GBNK or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge, terminate or receive
a reversion of assets from any Employee Plan or related trust. Except as
otherwise set forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.28(I)_ , without limiting the
generality of the immediately preceding sentence, no amount paid or payable
(whether in cash, in property or in the form of benefits) by GBNK or any of
its Subsidiaries in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
(either solely as a result thereof or as a result of such transactions in
conjunction with any other event) will be an "excess parachute payment"
within the meaning of section 280G of the Code. Copies of GBNKs section 280G
calculations with respect to the four most highly compensated disqualified
individuals in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby are
included in _Confidential Schedule 3.28(I)_.

(J) No Employee Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of taxes
under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code or otherwise.

 

Section 3.29. _Bank Secrecy Act, Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and U.S.A.

International Money Laundering Abatement and Anti-Terrorist Financing Act,

promulgated thereunder, and it has not received any written notice of any, and
to the Best Knowledge of GBNK there is no, threatened administrative
inquiry, proceeding or investigation with respect to its compliance with such
Laws.

of Guaranty Bank have been made in compliance in all material respects with
all applicable statutes and regulatory requirements at the time of such loan

Section 3.33. _Zoning and Related Laws_. Except as disclosed on
_Confidential Schedule 3.33_ , all real property owned or operated by
Guaranty Bank and the use thereof is in compliance with applicable Law,
including building, zoning and other Laws, except where the failure, whether
individually or in the aggregate, to be so in compliance would not reasonably
be expected to result in a Material Adverse Change.

Section 3.34. _Business Combination_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are exempt from the requirements of Section 203 of the
DGCL and any other applicable Takeover Statute.

 

Section 3.35. _Fairness Opinion_. Before the execution of this Agreement,
the GBNK Board has received an opinion (which, if initially rendered
verbally, has been or will be confirmed by a written opinion, dated the same
date) from Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc., to the effect that, based upon and
subject to the factors, assumption and limitations set forth therein, as of
the date thereof, the Exchange Ratio to be received by the holders of GBNK
Shares pursuant to this Agreement, is fair to such holders from a financial
point of view. As of the date of this Agreement, such opinion has not been
amended or rescinded.

Section 3.36. _Investment Securities_.

 

(A) Each of GBNK and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all
securities held by it in all material respects (except securities sold under
repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity) free and
clear of any Lien, except to the extent that such securities are pledged in
the ordinary course of business consistent with prudent business practices to
secure obligations of GBNK or any of its Subsidiaries and except for such
defects in title or Liens that would not be material to GBNK and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Such securities are valued on the books of
GBNK and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects.

 



-32- (B) GBNK and each of its Subsidiaries employs investment, securities
risk management and other policies, practices and procedures that GBNK and
each such Subsidiary believes are prudent and reasonable in the context of
such businesses, and GBNK and its Subsidiaries have, since January 1, 2016,
been in material compliance with such policies, practices and procedures in
all material respects.

Section 3.37. _Risk Management Instruments_. Except as otherwise set
forth in _Confidential Schedule 3.37_ , neither GBNK nor any GBNK Subsidiary
is a party to nor has it agreed to enter into an exchange traded or over-the-
counter equity, interest rate, foreign exchange or other swap, forward,
future, option, cap, floor or collar or any other contract that is a
derivatives contract (including various combinations thereof), other than
those entered into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance with
applicable Laws and with counterparties believed to be financially
responsible, all of which are legal, valid and binding obligations of GBNK or
its applicable Subsidiary, enforceable against GBNK or such Subsidiary in
accordance with their respective terms and conditions, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, conservatorship, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, receivership or similar Laws and judicial
decisions affecting the rights of creditors generally and by general
principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity),
and GBNK and its applicable Subsidiaries and, to GBNKs Best Knowledge, each
counterparty thereto, have duly performed in all material respects all of
their material obligations thereunder.

 

Section 3.38. _Indemnification_. To the Best Knowledge of GBNK, no action
or failure to take action by any present or former director, officer,
employee or agent of GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary has occurred which would give
rise to a material claim by any such individual for indemnification from GBNK
or any GBNK Subsidiary.

 

Section 3.39. _Organization and Qualification of the Trusts_. GBNK has two
special purpose trust subsidiaries, CenBank Statutory Trust III (" _CenBank
Trust_ ") and Guaranty Capital Trust III (" _Guaranty Trust_ ", and, together
with the CenBank Trust the " _Trusts_ "). With respect to the Trusts:

 

(A) (i) CenBank Trust has issued and sold preferred securities (the "
_CenBank Preferred Securities_ ") and common securities (the " _CenBank
Common Securities_ ") under an Amended and Restated Trust Agreement (the "
_CenBank Trust Agreement_ ") and GBNK has issued to CenBank Trust Floating
Rate Junior Subordinated Debentures (the " _CenBank Debentures_ "), under an
Indenture (CenBank Trusts Indenture and the CenBank Trust Agreement are
collectively referred to as the " _CenBank Trust Operative Documents_ ") and
(ii) Guaranty Trust has issued and sold capital securities (the " _Guaranty
Trust Capital Securities_ ") and common securities (the " _Guaranty Trust
Common Securities_ ") under an Amended and Restated Declaration of Trust
(the " _Guaranty Trust Agreement_ ", and, together with the CenBank Trust
Agreement, the " _Trust Agreements_ "), and GBNK has issued to the Guaranty
Trust, Junior Subordinated Debentures (the " _Guaranty Trust Debentures_ ",
and, together with the CenBank Debentures, the " _Debentures_ "), under an
Indenture (Guaranty Trusts Indenture and the Guaranty Trust Agreement are
collectively referred to, together with the CenBank Trust Operative
Documents, the " _Operative Documents_ "). _Confidential Schedule 3.39_ sets
forth, with respect to the Trusts, the (i) dates of the respective Operative
Documents, (ii) aggregate liquidation value of the CenBank Preferred
Securities, CenBank Common Securities, Guaranty Trust Capital

 



-33-  Securities and Guaranty Trust Common Securities (together, the " _Trust
Securities_ "), (iii) aggregate amount of Debentures that have been issued to
each Trust by GBNK, (iv) the rate paid on the respective Trust Securities and
the Debentures (collectively, the " _Securities_ "), (v) the dates after which
GBNK may redeem the respective Debentures at par, and (vi) the maturity date
of the respective Debentures.

(B) The Trusts have been duly created and each is validly existing in good
standing as a statutory trust under the Laws of the State of Delaware with
the power and authority to own property and to conduct the business it
transacts and proposes to transact and to enter into and perform its
obligations under the Operative Documents. Each Trust is not a party to or
otherwise bound by any material agreement other than the Operative Documents
and a Placement Agreement of even date with the Trust Agreement. Each Trust is
and will, be classified for tax purposes as a grantor trust and not as an
association taxable as a corporation.

(C) The Trust Securities have been duly authorized by the respective Trust
Agreements, have been validly issued and represent undivided beneficial
interests in the assets of the respective Trusts. None of the Trust Securities
is subject to preemptive or other similar rights. All of the outstanding
CenBank Common Securities and Guaranty Trust Common Securities (the " _Common
Securities_ ") are directly owned by GBNK free and clear of any pledge,
security interest, claim, Lien or other encumbrance, and have been issued in
compliance with applicable federal and state securities Laws. The Common
Securities satisfy the eligibility requirements of Rule 144A(d)(3) issued
under the Securities Act. Neither GBNK nor any Trust is an "investment
company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company," in each case
within the meaning of Section 3(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as
amended, without regard to Section 3(c) of that act. The Debentures are not
held of record by stockholders of GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary.

(D) The sole assets of each Trust are its Debentures, any interest paid on
such Debentures to the extent not distributed, proceeds of such Debentures, or
any of the foregoing.

 

(E) All of the proceeds from the sale of the CenBank Preferred Securities
and the Guaranty Trust Capital Securities issued by each respective Trust
have been invested in its respective Debentures. All of the proceeds from the
sale of the Common Securities issued by each respective Trust have been
invested in the respective Debentures. All Debentures are and have been held
by each Trust since their initial issuance.

(F) Neither Trust was not formed to, and is not authorized to, conduct any
trade or business and neither Trust has conducted any trade or business since
it was formed. The Trusts exist for the exclusive purposes of (i) issuing and
selling its respective CenBank Preferred Securities and the Guaranty Trust
Capital Securities, as applicable, and its respective Common Securities, (ii)
using the proceeds from the sale of its respective CenBank Preferred
Securities and the Guaranty Trust Capital Securities, as applicable, and its
respective Common Securities to acquire its respective Debentures, and (iii)
engaging only in activities necessary, advisable or incidental thereto. Each
Trust was formed to facilitate direct investment in the assets of such Trust,
and the existence of multiple classes of ownership is incidental to that
purpose. There is no intent to provide holders of such interests in each Trust
with diverse interests in the assets of each Trust.

 



-34- (G) Since January 1, 2015, GBNK has not exercised its right to
defer interest payments on the Debentures.

(H) Each Trusts income consists solely of payments made by GBNK
with respect to the respective Debentures, and such payments are not derived
from the active conduct of a financial business by such Trust. Both GBNKs
obligation to make those payments and the amounts thereof are set forth in the
respective Debentures. Neither GBNKs obligation to make those payments nor
the amounts payable by GBNK is dependent on income or profits of GBNK or any
Affiliate of GBNK (although GBNKs ability to do so is so dependent).

 

(I) GBNK has not issued any class of capital shares either pari passu or
senior to the Debentures. All Debentures are either pari passu or senior to
GBNKs trade accounts payable arising in the ordinary course of business.

 

(J) GBNK and the Trusts have created a debtor-creditor relationship between
GBNK, as debtor, and each Trust, as a creditor, and GBNK and the Trusts have
treated the Debentures as indebtedness for all tax purposes.

 

Section 3.40. _Investment Advisor Subsidiary_.

 

(A) _Confidential Schedule 3.40_ lists each GBNK Subsidiary that provides
investment management, investment advisory or sub-advisory services to any
Person (including management and advice provided to separate accounts and
participation in wrap fee programs) and that is required to register with the
SEC as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as
amended (the " _Investment Advisers Act_ ") (each, an " _Advisory Entity_ ").
Each Advisory Entity is registered as an investment adviser under the
Investment Advisers Act and has operated since January 1, 2015 and is
currently operating in compliance with all Laws applicable to it or its
business and has all registrations, permits, licenses, exemptions, orders and
approvals required for the operation of its business or ownership of its
properties and assets substantially as presently conducted, except as would
not reasonably be expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to result
in a Material Adverse Change in GBNK. Each "investment advisory
representative" (as defined under the Investment Advisers Act) required to be
registered as such with any state securities authority has been since January
1, 2015 and is so registered, except as would not reasonably be expected,
either individually or in the aggregate, to result in a Material Adverse
Change in GBNK. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending
or, to GBNKs Best Knowledge, threatened that would reasonably be expected to
assert noncompliance with any applicable Law or lead to the revocation,
amendment, failure to renew, limitation, suspension or restriction of any such
registrations, permits, licenses, exemptions, orders and approvals in any
material respect.

(B) Each Advisory Entity has been since January 1, 2015 and is in all
material respects in compliance with each contract for services provided in
its capacity as an Advisory Entity to which it is a party.

 

(C) The accounts of each advisory client of GBNK or its Subsidiaries, for
purposes of the Investment Advisers Act, that are subject to ERISA have been
managed by the applicable Advisory Entity in all material respects in
compliance with the applicable requirements of ERISA.

 



-35- (D) Except as disclosed on a Uniform Application for Investment
Adviser Registration on Form ADV (each, a " _Form ADV_ ") neither an Advisory
Entity nor to the Best Knowledge of GBNK any of their directors, officers, or
employees has been the subject of any disciplinary proceedings or orders of
any Governmental Authority arising under applicable Law which would be
required to be disclosed on Forms ADV. None of the Advisory Entities nor any
"person associated with an investment adviser" (as defined in the Investment
Advisers Act) of any of them is ineligible pursuant to Section 203 of the
Investment Advisers Act to serve as an investment advisor or as a Person
associated with a registered investment advisor, and there is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to GBNKs Best Knowledge, threatened
that would reasonably be expected to result in ineligibility of any such
person.

 

(E) GBNK has made available to IBG true and complete copies of each Form
ADV filed since January 1, 2015 by each Advisory Entity, reflecting all
amendments thereto to the date hereof (each, a " _GBNK Form ADV_ "). The GBNK
Forms ADV were each timely filed, were complete and accurate in all material
respects at the time of filing thereof, and are in compliance in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Investment Advisers Act.
Since January 1, 2015, each Advisory Entity has made available to each
advisory client its Form ADV to the extent required by the
Investment Advisers Act. GBNK has made available to IBG true and complete
copies of all deficiency letters and inspection reports or similar documents
furnished to any Advisory Entity by the SEC since January 1, 2015 and the
Advisory Entitys responses thereto, if any.

(F) None of GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary serves as an investment adviser (or
an investment sub-adviser) to a registered investment company.

 

Section 3.41. _No Broker-Dealer Subsidiary_. Neither GBNK nor any
Subsidiary of GBNK is a broker-dealer required to be registered under the
Exchange Act with the SEC. Neither GBNK nor any Subsidiary of GBNK is subject
to Section 9(a) or 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

 

Section 3.42. _Broker_ __ _s Fees_. Neither GBNK nor any of its
Subsidiaries has any responsibility or liability for any fees, expenses or
commissions payable to any agent, representative, finder, financial advisor or
broker in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by
this Agreement, except for Keefe, Bruyette and Woods, Inc., pursuant to an
agreement, a copy of which has been provided to IBG.

 

Section 3.43. _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 

(A) Except for the representations and warranties in this Article III,
neither GBNK nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to GBNK and its Subsidiaries, or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, and GBNK hereby disclaims any such
other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, and except for the representations and warranties made
by GBNK in this Article III, neither GBNK

 



-36-  nor any Person makes or has made any representation to IBG or any of IBGs
Affiliates or representatives with respect to any oral or written information
presented to IBG or any of IBGs Affiliates or representatives in the course
of their due diligence investigation of GBNK (including any financial
projections or forecasts), the negotiation of this Agreement or in the course
of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(B) GBNK acknowledges and agrees that neither IBG nor any other Person has
made or is making any express or implied representation or warranty other
than those contained in Article IV.

ARTICLE IV

 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF IBG

 

Except (a) as disclosed in the correspondingly enumerated section or
subsection of the _Confidential Schedules_ delivered herewith ( _provided_ ,
that each exception set forth on any _Confidential Schedule_ shall be deemed
to qualify such other representation and warranty to the extent that the
relevance of such exception to such other representation and warranty
is reasonably apparent on the face of the disclosure (notwithstanding the
absence of a specific cross-reference)) or (b) disclosed in any IBG SEC
Reports publicly filed prior to the date hereof (but excluding any disclosures
set forth in any "risk factors," "forward-looking statements" or "market
risk" sections or other statements that are similarly non-specific or
cautionary, predictive or forward-looking in nature), IBG hereby makes the
following representations and warranties to GBNK.

each respective IBG Subsidiary as now owned, and to carry on its business as
it is now being conducted and to enter into and carry out its obligations
under this Agreement and the other agreements contemplated hereby to which it
is a party. IBG and each IBG Subsidiary is duly licensed or qualified to do
business in each jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased
by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the
failure to be so licensed or qualified would not reasonably be expected to,
individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Change in IBG.
True and complete copies of the Certificate of Formation and Bylaws of IBG,
as amended to date, have been delivered or are otherwise made available to
GBNK.

 

(B) IBG is the sole record and beneficial owner of all of the issued and
outstanding shares of capital stock and equity securities of Independent Bank

indirectly, own or control any Affiliate (as defined in Section 10.10(A)) or

all requisite regulatory approvals and governmental permits and licenses
necessary to own their respective IBG Subsidiary.

 

Section 4.02. _Execution and Delivery_. IBG has full corporate power and
authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and the other agreements to

Agreement by the board of directors of Independent Bank and IBG as its sole
shareholder, no other corporate proceedings or approvals are necessary on the
part of IBG or its shareholders to approve this Agreement or the other

and to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby. This
Agreement and the other agreements and documents contemplated hereby to which
IBG is a party have been or at Closing will be duly executed by IBG and each

the dependents of any thereof, regardless of whether funded or unfunded are
referred to herein collectively as the " _IBG Employee Plans_ " and
individually as an " _IBG Employee Plan_ ".

 

(B) No IBG Employee Plan is subject to Section 302 or Title IV or Section
412 or 4971 of the Code. Neither IBG, its Subsidiaries nor any of their
respective ERISA Affiliates has, at any time during the preceding six years,
contributed to, been obligated to contribute to or had any liability
(including any contingent liability) with respect to any plan subject to
Section 302 or Title IV of ERISA, any "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA or a plan that has two or more contributing
sponsors, at least two of whom are not under common control, within the
meaning of Section 4063 of ERISA. No liability under Section 302 or Title IV
of ERISA has been incurred by IBG, its Subsidiaries or their respective ERISA
Affiliates or their respective predecessors that has not been satisfied in
full, and no condition exists that presents a risk to IBG, its Subsidiaries or
any such ERISA Affiliates of incurring any such liability. There have been no
prohibited transactions (described under ERISA § 406 or Code § 4975(c)),
breaches of fiduciary duty or any other breaches or violations of any Law
applicable to the IBG Employee Plans and related IBG Funding Arrangements that
would reasonably be expected to subject IBG, Independent Bank, GBNK or
any GBNK Subsidiary to any material taxes, penalties or other liabilities.

(C) Each IBG Employee Plan that is represented to be qualified under Code
§ 401(a) has a current favorable determination or opinion letter, and there
are no existing circumstances, and no events have occurred that could
reasonably be expected to adversely affect the qualified status of any such
IBG Employee Plan or the related IBG Funding Arrangement. All reports,
descriptions and filings required by the Code, ERISA or any government agency
with respect to each IBG Employee Plan have been timely and completely filed
or distributed. Each IBG Employee Plan has been operated in material
compliance with applicable Law and in accordance with its terms. All
contributions (including all employer contributions, employee salary reduction
contributions and all premiums or other payments (other than claims)) that
are due have been made with respect to each IBG Employee Plan.

 

(D) There are no pending claims, lawsuits or actions relating to any IBG
Employee Plan (other than ordinary course claims for benefits) and, to the
Best Knowledge of IBG, none are threatened and no set of circumstances exists
that would reasonably give rise to a claim or lawsuit, against the IBG
Employee Plans, any fiduciaries thereof with respect to their duties to the
IBG Employee Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the IBG
Employee Plans that would reasonably be expected to result in any material
liability of IBG or any of its Subsidiaries to the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation, the U.S. Department of the Treasury, the U.S.
Department of Labor, any participant in an IBG Employee Plan or any other
party. No IBG Employee Plan is under audit or the subject of an investigation
by the IRS, the U.S. Department of Labor, the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation, the SEC or any other Governmental Authority, nor is any such
audit or investigation pending or, to the Best Knowledge of IBG, threatened.

 



-49- (E) With respect to each "employee benefit plan" (as defined in ERISA)
maintained or contributed to or required to be contributed to, currently or in
the past six (6) years, by any trade or business with which IBG or any IBG
Subsidiary is required by any of the rules contained in the Code or ERISA to
be treated as a single employer (" _IBG Controlled Group Plans_ "):

(1) All IBG Controlled Group Plans which are "group health plans" (as
defined in the Code and ERISA) have been operated before the Closing such that
failures to operate such group health plans in compliance, in all material
respects, with Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title 1 of ERISA and Code § § 4980B
and 4980D would not reasonably be expected to subject IBG or any IBG
Subsidiary to material liability;

 

(2) There is no IBG Controlled Group Plan that is a defined benefit plan
(as defined in ERISA), nor has there been a IBG Controlled Group Plan that is
a defined benefit plan in the last five calendar years; and

(3) There is no IBG Controlled Group Plan that is a "multiple employer
plan" or "multi-employer plan" (as either such term is defined in ERISA), nor
has there been an IBG Controlled Group Plan that is either a multiple employer
plan or multi-employer plan since 2007.

(F) Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (either alone or in
conjunction with any other event) result in, cause the vesting, funding,
exercisability or delivery of, or increase in the amount or value of, any
payment, right or other benefit to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of IBG or any of its Subsidiaries, or result in any
limitation on the right of IBG or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, merge,
terminate or receive a reversion of assets from any IBG Employee Plan or
related trust. Without limiting the generality of the immediately preceding
sentence, no amount paid or payable (whether in cash, in property or in the
form of benefits) by IBG or any of its Subsidiaries to employees of IBG or any
of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Closing in connection with
the transactions contemplated hereby (either solely as a result thereof or as
a result of such transactions in conjunction with any other event) will be an
"excess parachute payment" within the meaning of section 280G of the Code.

(G) No IBG Employee Plan provides for the gross-up or reimbursement of
taxes under Section 409A or 4999 of the Code.

the Equal Credit Opportunity Act (15 U.S.C. § 1691 et seq.), and the Flood
Disaster Protection Act (42 USC § 4002, et seq.), and all regulations
promulgated thereunder. Since December 31, 2015, IBG has not received any
written notices of any violation of such acts or any of the regulations
promulgated thereunder, and it has not received any written notice of any, and
to the Best Knowledge of IBG there is no, threatened administrative inquiry,
proceeding or investigation with respect to its compliance with such Laws.

Section 4.29. _Usury Laws and Other Consumer Compliance Laws_. All
loans of Independent Bank have been made in compliance in all material
respects with all applicable statutes and regulatory requirements at the time
of such loan or any renewal thereof, including Regulation Z (12 C.F.R. § 226
et seq.) issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
("FRB"), the Federal Consumer Credit Protection Act (15 U.S.C. § 1601 et seq.)
and all statutes governing the operation of banks operating in the State of
Texas. Each such loan was made by Independent Bank in the ordinary course of
its lending business.

Section 4.30. _Business Combination_. This Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby are exempt from the requirements of Section 21.606 of the
TBOC and any other applicable Takeover Statute.

 

Section 4.31. _Fairness Opinion_. Before the execution of this Agreement,
IBG has received an oral opinion from Stephens Inc., which will be followed
by a written opinion, to the effect that, subject to the terms, conditions and
qualifications set forth therein, as of the date thereof, the Merger
Consideration to be paid by IBG pursuant to this Agreement is fair from a
financial point of view to IBG. As of the date of this Agreement, such opinion
has not been amended or rescinded.

 

Section 4.32. _Investment Securities_.

 

(A) Each of IBG and its Subsidiaries has good and marketable title to all
securities held by it in all material respects (except securities sold under
repurchase agreements or held in any fiduciary or agency capacity) free and
clear of any Lien, except to the extent that such securities are pledged in
the ordinary course of business consistent with prudent business practices to
secure obligations of IBG or any of its Subsidiaries and except for such
defects in title or Liens that would not be material to IBG and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Such securities are valued on the books of IBG
and each of its Subsidiaries in accordance with GAAP in all material
respects.

 



-51- (B) IBG and each of its Subsidiaries employs investment, securities
risk management and other policies, practices and procedures that IBG and
each such Subsidiary believes are prudent and reasonable in the context of
such businesses, and IBG and its Subsidiaries have, since January 1, 2016,
been in material compliance with such policies, practices and procedures in
all material respects.

Section 4.33. _Evidences of Indebtedness_. All evidences of indebtedness
that are reflected as assets of IBG or any IBG Subsidiary are legal, valid and
binding obligations of the respective obligors thereof, enforceable in
accordance with their respective terms (except as limited by applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar Laws affecting
creditors generally and the availability of injunctive relief, specific
performance and other equitable remedies), and are not subject to
any asserted or, to the Best Knowledge of IBG, threatened, defenses, offsets
or counterclaims that may reasonably be asserted against IBG, any IBG
Subsidiary or the present holder thereof. The credit and collateral files of
Independent Bank contain all material information (excluding general, local
or national industry, economic or similar conditions) actually known to IBG or
Independent Bank that is required to evaluate, in accordance with generally
prevailing practices in the banking industry, the collectability of the loan
portfolio of Independent Bank (including loans that will be outstanding if
Independent Bank advances funds it is obligated to advance), except for items
identified on Independent Banks internal exception list which has been made
available to GBNK. Neither IBG nor Independent Bank is aware of, nor has IBG
or Independent Bank received notice of, any past or present conditions,
events, activities, practices or incidents that may result in a violation of
any Environmental Law with respect to any real property securing any
indebtedness reflected as an asset of Independent Bank. With respect to any
loan or other evidence of indebtedness all or a portion of which has been sold
to or guaranteed by any governmental authority, including the Small Business
Administration, each of such loans was made in compliance and conformity with
all relevant Laws and procedures such that such governmental authoritys
guaranty of such loan is effective during the term of such loan in all
material respects. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 4.33, no representation or warranty is being made as to the
sufficiency of collateral securing, or the collectability of, the loans of
Independent Bank.

IBG Subsidiary is a party to nor has it agreed to enter into an exchange
traded or over-the-counter equity, interest rate, foreign exchange or other
swap, forward, future, option, cap, floor or collar or any other contract
that is a derivatives contract (including various combinations thereof), other
than those entered into in the ordinary course of business and in accordance
with applicable Laws and with counterparties believed to be financially
responsible, all of which are legal, valid and binding obligations of IBG or
its applicable Subsidiary, enforceable against IBG or such Subsidiary in
accordance with their respective terms and conditions, except as
enforceability may be limited by bankruptcy, conservatorship, insolvency,
moratorium, reorganization, receivership or similar Laws and judicial
decisions affecting the rights of creditors generally and by general
principles of equity (whether applied in a proceeding at law or in equity),
and IBG and its applicable Subsidiaries and, to IBGs Best Knowledge, each
counterparty thereto, have duly performed in all material respects all of
their material obligations thereunder. 

Section 4.35. _Indemnification_. Except as otherwise set forth on
_Confidential Schedule_ __ _ 4.35_, to the Best Knowledge of IBG, no action
or failure to take action by any

Subsidiary has occurred which would give rise to a material claim by any such
individual for indemnification from IBG or any IBG Subsidiary.

Section 4.36. _Broker_ __ _s Fees_. Neither IBG nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any responsibility or liability for any fees, expenses

Section 4.37. _No Other Representations or Warranties_.

 

(A) Except for the representations and warranties in this Article IV,
neither IBG nor any other Person makes any express or implied representation
or warranty with respect to IBG and its Subsidiaries, or their respective
businesses, operations, assets, liabilities, conditions (financial or
otherwise) or prospects, and IBG hereby disclaims any such
other representations or warranties. In particular, without limiting the
foregoing disclaimer, and except for the representations and warranties made
by IBG in this Article IV, neither IBG nor any Person makes or has made any
representation to GBNK or any of GBNKs Affiliates or representatives with
respect to any oral or written information presented to GBNK or any of GBNKs
Affiliates or representatives in the course of their due diligence
investigation of IBG (including any financial projections or forecasts), the
negotiation of this Agreement or in the course of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

 

(B) IBG acknowledges and agrees that neither GBNK nor any other Person has

any additional information that IBG may reasonably request, and shall
specifically provide to IBG a weekly written report of all loans made,
renewed or modified by Guaranty Bank. No investigation by IBG or its

a level consistent with Guaranty Banks historical methodology and in
compliance with GAAP.

 

Section 5.07. _Untrue Representations_. GBNK shall promptly notify IBG in
writing if GBNK becomes aware of any fact or condition that makes untrue, or
shows to have been untrue, in any material respect, any material written

their Properties. GBNK shall promptly notify IBG in writing of any legal
action, suit or proceeding or judicial, administrative or governmental
investigation, pending or, to the Best Knowledge of GBNK, threatened against
GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary that (i) questions or would

 



-59-  reasonably be expected to question the validity of this Agreement or the
agreements contemplated hereby, or any actions taken or to be taken by GBNK or
any GBNK Subsidiary pursuant hereto or (ii) seeks to enjoin or otherwise
restrain the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

Section 5.09. _Adverse Changes_. GBNK shall promptly notify IBG in writing
if any change shall have occurred or, to the Best Knowledge of GBNK, been
threatened (or any development shall have occurred or, to the Best Knowledge
of GBNK, been threatened involving a prospective change) in the business,
financial condition or operations of GBNK and/or any GBNK Subsidiary that has
resulted in or would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change in GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary or lead to a failure to obtain necessary
regulatory approval of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. 

Section 5.10. _No Negotiation with Others_.

 

(A) GBNK agrees that it shall not, and that it shall cause each GBNK
Subsidiary and the respective employees, directors, officers, financial
advisors, agents and other representatives of GBNK and each GBNK Subsidiary
(collectively, " _GBNK Representatives_ ") not to, directly or indirectly, (i)
solicit, knowingly encourage or facilitate, initiate or participate in any
negotiations or discussions with any third party (except for the limited
purpose of notifying such Person of the existence of the provisions of this
Section 5.10) regarding an Acquisition Proposal (as defined below),
whether by acquisition, business combination, purchase of securities or
assets or otherwise; (ii) disclose to any third party any information
concerning the business, Properties, books or records of GBNK or any GBNK
Subsidiary in connection with any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii) cooperate
with any third party to make any Acquisition Proposal. Promptly upon receipt
of any unsolicited offer, GBNK will communicate to IBG the terms of any
proposal or request for information and the identity of the parties involved.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, unless
this Agreement has been terminated in accordance with its terms, GBNK shall
not, and it shall cause each GBNK Subsidiary and GBNK Representative not to,
execute or enter into any letter of intent, agreement in principle, merger
agreement, asset or stock purchase or share exchange agreement, option
agreement or other contract related to any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance with Section 5.10(B)).

(B) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
5.10, if at any time after the date hereof and before the receipt of the
Requisite GBNK Stockholder Approval, GBNK and the GBNK Representatives, having
each theretofore complied with the terms of Section 5.10(A), receives a bona
fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal, GBNK and the GBNK
Representatives may engage in negotiations and discussions with, and furnish
any information and other access (so long as all such information and access
has previously been made available to IBG or is made available to IBG before
or concurrently with the time such information or access is made available to
such person) to, any Person making such Acquisition Proposal if, and only if,
the GBNK Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal and financial advisors, that (i) such Acquisition Proposal constitutes
or is reasonably likely to become a Superior Proposal (as defined below) and
(ii) the failure of the GBNK Board to furnish such information or access or
enter into such discussions or negotiations would be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties under applicable Law; but before furnishing any such
information, GBNK shall have received from the Person making such Acquisition
Proposal

 



-60-  an executed confidentiality agreement with terms at least as restrictive in
all material respects on such Person as the Confidentiality Agreement entered
into with IBG dated April 20, 2018 (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "),
which confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit GBNK from complying with
the terms of this Section 5.10. GBNK will promptly, and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours, (x) notify IBG in writing of the receipt of such
Acquisition Proposal or any request for information relating to GBNK or for
access to the Properties, books or records of GBNK by any Person that has
made, or to the Best Knowledge of GBNK may be considering making, an
Acquisition Proposal and (y) communicate the material terms of such
Acquisition Proposal to IBG, including as they may change upon any
modification or amendment to the terms thereof, and including the identity of
the Person making the Acquisition Proposal and a copy thereof if in writing
and any related documentation or correspondence. GBNK will keep IBG reasonably
apprised of the status of and other matters relating to any such Acquisition
Proposal on a timely basis, including providing a copy of all further related
documentation or correspondence.

(C) GBNK agrees that it (i) will and will cause the GBNK Subsidiaries and
GBNK Representatives to, cease immediately and terminate any and all existing
activities, discussions or negotiations with any third parties conducted
heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or similar transaction
and (ii) will not release any third party from, or waive any provisions of,
any confidentiality or standstill agreement to which it or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or similar
transaction, and will enforce the terms thereof and will promptly request from
such third parties the return or destruction of any confidential information
of GBNK provided thereunder. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent (I) GBNK or the GBNK Board from (i) taking the actions provided in
Section 1.08(C) or 5.10(B) subject to compliance with the terms thereof, (ii)
responding to an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition Proposal for the sole
purpose of clarifying the terms and conditions of the Acquisition Proposal,
or (iii) informing any Person who submits an unsolicited bona fide Acquisition
Proposal of GBNKs obligations pursuant to Section 5.10(A), or (II) either
party, in consultation with outside counsel, complying with its disclosure
obligations under federal or state Law including in connection with a GBNK
Change in Recommendation (provided that any GBNK Change in Recommendation
shall be subject to Section 1.08(C) and shall have the effects set forth in
this Agreement).

(D) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Acquisition Proposal_ " means any
offer, inquiry, indication of interest or proposal from a party other than IBG
regarding any of the following (other than the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement) involving GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary: (i) any merger,
reorganization, consolidation, share exchange, recapitalization, business
combination, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction involving
GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary or any sale, lease, exchange, mortgage, pledge,
transfer or other disposition of 20% or more of the consolidated assets of
GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary, in a single transaction or series of related
transactions; or (ii) any acquisition by any party or group of
parties (including the shareholders or equity holders thereof), directly or
indirectly, including by any tender offer or exchange offer, of 20% or more of
the outstanding GBNK Shares or of the total voting power of GBNK or any GBNK
Subsidiary.

 

(E) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Superior Proposal_ " means an
unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made by a party other than
IBG to acquire, directly or

 



-61-  indirectly, pursuant to a tender offer, exchange offer, merger,
consolidation or other business combination or similar transaction, all or
substantially all of the consolidated assets of GBNK or all of the GBNK
Shares and that the GBNK Board determines in its good faith judgment, after
consultation with its outside legal and financial advisors (i) is or would
result in a transaction that if consummated would be more favorable to GBNKs
stockholders from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into
account all of the terms and conditions of such proposal and of this Agreement
(including any proposal by IBG to amend the terms of this Agreement) and (ii)
is capable of being, and is reasonably likely to be, consummated on a timely
basis on the terms so proposed taking into account all financial, regulatory,
legal and other aspects of such proposal.

 

Section 5.11. _Non-Governmental Consents and Approvals_. GBNK shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all consents and approvals from
third parties necessary or advisable in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. GBNK will cooperate in all commercially
reasonable respects with IBG to obtain all such approvals and consents
required of IBG. Without limiting the foregoing, as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date hereof, GBNK shall cause each of its Subsidiaries
that is an Advisory Entity to inform their investment advisory clients of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and request each such clients
written consent to the deemed assignment of its management contract resulting
from the change in ownership of GBNK and the relevant Advisory Entity
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and use all
reasonable efforts to obtain such consent on or before the Effective Time.
While GBNK shall request affirmative written consents from each Advisory
Entitys clients to such deemed assignment, a negative consent will
constitute valid consent to the extent permitted by applicable Law and the
applicable management contract if (i) a negative consent is not expressly
prohibited by the management contract (for purposes of this Agreement, it is
assumed that, unless an agreement expressly requires written consent to an
"assignment" as defined under the Investment Advisers Act or a change in
control, then such "negative consent" or "silence" is permissible hereunder
and thereunder), (ii) a notice describing the change in control and the
negative consent in a form reasonably acceptable to IBG and GBNK is sent to
each client, and (iii) sixty (60) days elapse from the date that notice is
received at the clients office during which period the client continues to
have its account managed by the applicable Advisory Entity and does not notify
the applicable Advisory Entity that it is withholding its consent and such
client shall not have otherwise provided a notice of termination of the
relevant management contract that provides for the termination to be effective
as of or prior to the Closing Date.

 

Section 5.12. _Termination of Employee Plans_. If requested by IBG in
writing delivered to GBNK by 20 Business Days before the Closing Date, the
GBNK Board (or the appropriate committee thereof) shall adopt resolutions and
take such corporate action as is necessary to terminate any Employee Plan that
is a tax-qualified savings plan (the " _GBNK 401(k) Plans_ "), effective as
of the day prior to the Closing Date. The form and substance of such
resolutions and any other actions taken in connection with the foregoing
termination shall be subject to the review and approval of IBG. Following the
Effective Time and (if IBG determines in its sole discretion that a
determination letter is appropriate) as soon as practicable following receipt
of a favorable determination letter from the IRS on the termination of the
GBNK 401(k) Plans, the assets thereof shall be distributed to the
participants, and IBG shall, to the extent permitted by IBGs 401(k) plan (the
" _IBG 401(k) Plan_ "), permit the employees of GBNK and its Subsidiaries who
are actively employed as of the date immediately following the distribution of
account

 



-62-  balances under the GBNK 401(k) Plans to make rollover contributions of
"eligible rollover distributions" (within the meaning of Section 401(a)(31) of
the Code, but excluding loans), in the form of cash, from the amounts
distributed to such employee from the GBNK 401(k) Plan to the IBG 401(k) Plan.

 

Section 5.13. _Other Agreements_. GBNK shall, and shall cause each GBNK
Subsidiary to, execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and such other
agreements, certificates of merger, certificates, and other documents
reasonably necessary to effect the Merger and the Bank Merger, and to take all
actions reasonably necessary or required to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 5.14. _Support Agreement_. GBNK shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to cause each outside director of GBNK and Guaranty Bank to execute
and deliver to IBG, contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement, a
Director Support Agreement providing for the continuing support of
Independent Bank by the outside directors (the "Director Support Agreements").

 

Section 5.15. _Conforming Accounting Adjustments_. GBNK shall, if
requested in writing by IBG, consistent with GAAP and applicable banking Laws
immediately before Closing, make such accounting entries as GBNK may
reasonably request in order to conform the accounting records of GBNK to the
accounting policies and practices of IBG. No such adjustment by GBNK or any
GBNK Subsidiary shall of itself constitute or be deemed to be a breach,
violation or failure by GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary to satisfy any
representation, warranty, covenant, condition or other provision of this
Agreement or constitute grounds for termination of this Agreement by IBG or
be an acknowledgment by GBNK of any adverse circumstances for purposes of
determining whether the conditions to IBGs obligations under this Agreement
have been satisfied. The recording of any such adjustments shall not be
deemed to imply any misstatement of previously furnished financial statements
or information and shall not be construed as concurrence by GBNK, any GBNK
Subsidiary or their respective management with any such adjustments.

Section 5.16. _D andO Liability Insurance_. Contemporaneously with the
Closing, GBNK shall purchase an extended reporting period for six (6) years
under GBNKs existing directors and officers liability insurance policy for
purposes of covering actions occurring prior to the Effective Time, on terms
approved by IBG. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
aggregate cost of the premiums for such coverage shall not exceed 300% of the
current annual premium for such insurance paid by GBNK as of the date of this
Agreement.

 

Section 5.17. _Termination of DP Contracts and IT Conversion_. At IBGs
request and in consultation with IBG, GBNK will use commercially reasonable
efforts, including but not limited to notifying appropriate parties and
negotiating in good faith a reasonable settlement, to ensure that the DP
Contracts and contracts related to the provision of any other electronic
banking services, if the Merger occurs, be terminated after the consummation
of the Merger on a date to be mutually agreed upon by IBG and GBNK. Such
notice and actions by GBNK will be in accordance with the terms of such
contracts. GBNK shall use reasonable efforts and cooperate with IBG to
facilitate a smooth conversion of data processing, item processing, network
and related hardware and software, telephone systems, telecommunications, data
communications and other technologies, including participating in conversion
planning, design, mapping and testing activities before the Closing Date.

 



-63- Section 5.18. _Obligations Related to Trust Preferred and
Debt Securities_.

(A) GBNK will reasonably cooperate with IBG to permit IBG, as the Resulting
Corporation, upon completion of the Merger, to assume expressly the
obligations of GBNK to the extent required under the indentures governing
GBNKs trust preferred securities and any debt securities of GBNK or any GBNK
Subsidiary or related guaranties, and the parties shall cooperate and execute
one or more supplemental indentures, guarantees and other instruments,
including any related certificates, opinions or other documentation,
reasonably required in connection therewith.

 

(B) If requested by IBG, GBNK shall deliver all notices and take all other
actions to facilitate the termination at the Closing of all commitments in
respect of the Credit Agreement, dated as of March 30, 2016, between Guaranty
Bancorp and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, and the repayment in full
on the Closing Date of all obligations, and releases of all Liens securing
obligations, in respect of the indebtedness thereunder; _provided_ , IBG shall
provide any funds required to effect all such repayments at or prior to the
Closing. In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, if requested
by IBG, GBNK shall use commercially reasonable efforts to deliver to IBG at
least two Business Days prior to the Closing Date an executed payoff letter
with respect to such credit facility in form and substance customary for
transactions of this type, which payoff letter shall, among other things,
include the payoff amount.

 

Section 5.19. _Transaction Litigation_. GBNK shall give IBG prompt notice
of any litigation against GBNK and/or its directors relating to the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give IBG
the opportunity to participate, at IBGs cost, in the defense or settlement of
any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the
prior written consent of IBG, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this paragraph,
"participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
litigation by the litigating party, consistent with the common interest of
GBNK and IBG in these matters and the applicable privileges and protections
provided therein, and the non-litigating party may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to the litigation and any documents to be prepared
or filed in connection therewith, which will be reasonably considered in good
faith by the litigating party.

statements therein not false or misleading, to promptly inform GBNK thereof
and to take the necessary steps to correct the Registration Statement or the

circumstances, is reasonably expected to become the subject of litigation,
against IBG or Independent Bank or affecting any of their respective
properties, if such litigation or potential litigation is reasonably likely,
in the event of an unfavorable outcome, to result in a Material Adverse
Change. IBG shall promptly notify GBNK in writing of any legal action, suit or
proceeding or judicial, administrative or governmental investigation, pending
or, to the Best Knowledge of IBG, threatened against IBG or Independent Bank
that (i) questions or would reasonably be expected to question the validity of

-66- Section 6.07. _Regulatory and Other Approvals_. With the reasonable

consummate the Merger, the Bank Merger and the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, including the applications for the prior approval of the
Merger and the Bank Merger by the FRB (or appropriate Federal Reserve Bank
acting on delegated authority), the TDB, the FDIC and the Colorado Division of
Banking (collectively, the " _Regulatory Approvals_ "). _Provided_ that GBNK
has promptly provided information reasonably requested by IBG and its
comments to draft applications, and otherwise complied with Section 5.02, IBG
shall file all such applications on or before the thirtieth (30th) day
following the date of this Agreement. IBG shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to obtain all such regulatory approvals and any other approvals from
third parties at the earliest practicable time. IBG and GBNK shall have the
right to review in advance, and, to the extent practicable, each will consult
the other on, in each case subject to applicable Law relating to the exchange
of information, all the information relating to IBG or GBNK, as the case may
be, and any of their respective Subsidiaries, which appears in any filing
made with, or written materials submitted or proposed to be submitted to, any
third party or any Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of
the parties hereto shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. In
addition, IBG shall keep GBNK reasonably informed as to the status of such
applications and filings; IBG shall promptly furnish GBNK and its counsel with
copies of all such regulatory filings and all correspondence with respect
thereto to the extent permitted by applicable Law; and to the extent permitted
by applicable Law, each party shall promptly advise the other upon receiving
any communication from any Governmental Authority whose consent or approval
is required for consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that causes such party to believe that there is a reasonable
likelihood that any such approval will not be obtained or that the receipt of
any such approval will be materially delayed. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, IBG shall not be required to (and GBNK
shall not be permitted to, without IBGs prior written consent) take any
action, or commit to take any action, or agree to any condition or
restriction, involving IBG, GBNK or any of their respective Subsidiaries
pursuant to this Section 6.07 or otherwise in connection with obtaining any
permits, consents, approvals and authorizations that would reasonably be
expected to be materially burdensome on IBG, GBNK, the Resulting Corporation
or their respective Subsidiaries or require a material modification of, or
impose any material limitation or restriction on, the activities, governance,
legal structure, capital structure, compensation or fee arrangements of IBG,
GBNK, the Resulting Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries (any
of the foregoing, a " _Burdensome Condition_ "); _provided, however_ , that
the following shall not be deemed to be a Burdensome Condition: any restraint,
limitation, term, requirement, provision or condition that applies generally
to bank holding companies and banks as provided by statute, regulation, or
written and publicly available supervisory guidance of general applicability,
in each case, as in effect on the date hereof.

 

Section 6.08. _Other Agreements_. IBG shall, and shall cause Independent
Bank to, execute and deliver the Bank Merger Agreement and such other
agreements, certificates of merger, certificates, and other documents
reasonably necessary to effect the Merger and the Bank Merger and to take all
actions reasonably necessary or required to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby in accordance with the terms hereof.

 



-67- Section 6.09. _Employee Matters_.

 

(A) To the extent that an employee of GBNK and its Subsidiaries immediately
prior to the Closing (collectively, the " _Covered Employees_ ") becomes
eligible to participate in an employee benefit plan maintained by the
Resulting Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (other than GBNK or its
Subsidiaries) following the Effective Time, the Resulting Corporation shall
cause such employee benefit plan to recognize the service of such Covered
Employee with GBNK or its Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility,
participation, vesting and benefit accrual under such employee benefit plan of
the Resulting Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries, to the same extent that
such service was recognized immediately prior to the Effective Time under a
similar Employee Plan in which such Covered Employee was eligible to
participate immediately prior to the Effective Time; _ provided_ that, such
recognition of service shall not (i) operate to duplicate any benefits of a
Covered Employee with respect to the same period of service, or (ii) apply for
purposes of any retiree medical plans or for purposes of benefit accrual
under any defined benefit pension plan. With respect to any health care,
dental or vision plan of the Resulting Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
(other than GBNK and its Subsidiaries) in which any Covered Employee is
eligible to participate, for the plan year in which such Covered Employee is
first eligible to participate, the Resulting Corporation shall (x) cause any
preexisting condition limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such
Resulting Corporation or Subsidiary plan (excluding any Employee Plan) to be
waived with respect to such Covered Employee to the extent that such
limitation would have been waived or satisfied under the similar Employee Plan
in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time, and (y) use commercially reasonable efforts to cause any
health care, dental and vision expenses incurred by such Covered Employee in
the year that includes the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such
Covered Employee is first eligible to participate) to be recognized for
purposes of any applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense
requirements under any such health, dental or vision plan of the Resulting
Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (excluding any Employee Plan), to the
extent that any such amount was recognized for a similar purpose under the
Employee Plans in which such Covered Employee participated immediately prior
to the Effective Time.

 

(B) From and after the date hereof, any written communications to the
employees, officers or directors of GBNK or any of its Subsidiaries
pertaining to compensation or benefit matters after the Closing or otherwise
relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, shall be in the
form of mutually agreeable communications, prepared in prior
consultation with IBG, it being agreed that IBG and GBNK shall cooperate,
including by providing IBG a reasonable period of time to review any such
communication, in providing mutually agreeable communications.

 

(C) For a period beginning at the Effective Time and continuing through the
first anniversary thereof, the Resulting Corporation and its Subsidiaries
shall provide severance to each Covered Employee pursuant to the terms and
conditions of the severance plan or policy of GBNK or its Subsidiaries
applicable to such Covered Employee as of the date hereof (in each case, as
set forth on _Confidential Schedule_ ___6.09(C)_ ).

(D) Prior to the Effective Time, GBNK may pay to each Covered Employee who
at the time of the payment is then participating in any GBNK annual cash bonus
plan or

Closing Date; _provided_ that, the aggregate of such bonus payments must not
exceed GBNKs unpaid aggregate accrual for such bonus payments as of the
Closing Date (the " _Bonus Accrual Amount_ "). The Bonus Accrual Amount shall
be based on the amount accrued by GBNK in respect of the Annual Bonus Plans in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices and in

The Bonus Accrual Amount shall be allocated among such Covered Employees in
the ordinary course of business consistent with past practices. GBNK shall
consult with IBG regarding the determination and allocation of the Bonus
Accrual Amount and consider IBGs comments on such determination and the
allocation thereof in good faith. For the avoidance of doubt, (i) if bonuses
are paid to employees under the Annual Bonus Plans in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practices prior to the Effective Time, this
Section 6.09(D) shall have no force and effect and (ii) any bonuses paid
pursuant to this Section 6.09(D) shall be paid in a manner which avoids the
duplication of any benefits which may be provided under any other Employee
Plan.

 

(E) From and after the Effective Time, the Resulting Corporation shall, or
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, (i) assume and honor the Employee Plans set
forth on _Confidential Schedule 3.28_ in accordance with their terms;
_provided_ that, nothing herein shall prohibit the Resulting Corporation from
amending, suspending or terminating any such Employee Plan to the extent
permitted by the governing documents of such Employee Plan or applicable Law,
and (ii) honor and discharge all GBNKs and the GBNK Subsidiaries obligations
and assume all of its and their defenses under existing change of control and
employment agreements to which GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary is a party that are
set forth on _Confidential Schedule 3.28_. Without limiting the generality of
Section 10.13, the provisions of this Section 6.09 are solely for the benefit
of the parties to this Agreement, and no current or former employee, officer,
director or independent contractor or any other individual associated
therewith shall be regarded for any purpose as a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement. In no event shall the terms of this Agreement be deemed to (a)
establish, amend or modify any Employee Plan or any other employee benefit
plan, program, agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by the
Resulting Corporation, IBG, GBNK or any of their respective affiliates; (b)
alter or limit the ability of IBG or any of its Subsidiaries to amend, modify
or terminate any Employee Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit

independent contractor any right to employment or continued employment or
continued service with the Resulting Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, following the Closing Date, GBNK and its Subsidiaries), or
constitute or create an employment agreement with any employee.

 

Section 6.10. _Adverse Changes_. IBG shall promptly notify GBNK in writing
if any change shall have occurred or, to the Best Knowledge of IBG, been
threatened (or any development shall have occurred or, to the Best Knowledge
of IBG, been threatened involving a prospective change) in the business,
financial condition, or operations of IBG and/or Independent Bank that has
resulted in or may reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Change with respect to IBG or Independent Bank or lead to a failure to obtain
necessary regulatory approval of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. 

 



-69- Section 6.11. _Issuance of IBG Common Shares_. The IBG Shares to be
issued by IBG to the stockholders of GBNK pursuant to this Agreement will, on
the issuance and delivery to such stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, be
duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable. The IBG Shares
to be issued to the stockholders of GBNK pursuant to this Agreement are and
will be free of any preemptive rights of the stockholders of GBNK or any other
Person, and are not and will not be restricted securities under the Securities
Act, except for IBG Shares issued by IBG to any GBNK stockholders who may be
deemed to be an "affiliate" of IBG under the Securities Act after completion
of the Merger.

 

Section 6.12. _Access to Properties and Records_ _._ To the extent
permitted by applicable Law, IBG shall and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries, upon reasonable notice from GBNK to IBG to: (a) afford the
employees and officers and authorized representatives (including legal
counsel, accountants and consultants) of GBNK reasonable access to
the properties, books and records of IBG and its Subsidiaries during regular
business hours in order that GBNK may have the opportunity to make such
reasonable investigation as it shall desire to make of the affairs of IBG and
its Subsidiaries, and (b) furnish GBNK with such additional financial and
operating data and other information as to the business and properties of IBG
as GBNK may, from time to time, reasonably request; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that GBNK shall request permission for all such access reasonably in advance
and all such access shall be conducted in a manner designed to minimize
disruption to the normal business operations and employee or customer
relations of IBG and each IBG Subsidiary. No investigation by GBNK or its
representatives shall affect the representations and warranties set forth
herein.

 

Section 6.13. _Director and Officer Indemnification_. From and after the
Effective Time, the Resulting Corporation shall indemnify, defend and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, each present and
former officer, director and employee of GBNK and any GBNK Subsidiary against
all costs or expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), judgments,
fines, losses damages or liabilities arising, in whole or in part, out of
matters, actions or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time and
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that such person is or was an
officer, director or employee of GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary (including,
without limitation, matters, actions or omissions related to the negotiation,
execution, approval and performance of this Agreement or consummation of the
Merger), including advancement of expenses as further specified below. If the
Resulting Corporation or any of its successors or assigns shall consolidate
with or merge into any other entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or shall transfer all or
substantially all of its assets to any other entity, then and in each case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Resulting Corporation or the surviving company shall assume the obligations
set forth in this Section 6.13 prior to or simultaneously with the
consummation of such transaction. The Resulting Corporation shall also advance
expenses as incurred by any such indemnified party hereunder to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law; _ provided_ that the indemnified party to
whom expenses are advanced provides an undertaking to repay such advances if
it is ultimately determined that such indemnified party is not entitled to
indemnification. The Resulting Corporation shall reasonably cooperate with the
indemnified party, and the indemnified party shall reasonably cooperate with
the Resulting

 



-70-  Corporation, in the defense of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation. The obligations of the Resulting Corporation under this Section
6.13 shall not be terminated or modified after the Effective Time in a manner
so as to adversely affect any party entitled to indemnification hereunder
without the prior consent of such affected party. The provisions of this
Section 6.13 shall survive the Effective Time and are intended for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each party entitled to
indemnification hereunder and his or her heirs and representatives.

 

Section 6.14. _Appointment of Directors_. Effective immediately after the
Effective Time, the IBG Board shall adopt resolutions and take such other
action as necessary to appoint Edward B. Cordes and Paul W. Taylor (the "
_GBNK Nominees_ ") to the IBG Board, each for a term expiring at the next
annual meeting of the shareholders of IBG following the Effective Time. IBG
shall nominate, and recommend that the IBG shareholders elect, each of the
GBNK Nominees to the IBG Board as a Class III director at the 2019 annual
meeting of IBG shareholders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IBGs obligation
to nominate and recommend each GBNK Nominee is subject to such GBNK Nominees
compliance with IBGs governance and ethics policies in place from time to
time, as reasonably determined by IBGs Corporate Governance and Nominating
Committee.

Section 6.15. _Section 16 Matters_. Each of the GBNK Board and the IBG
Board shall, prior to the Effective Time, take all such reasonable actions as
may be necessary or appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3 under the Exchange Act
to exempt the conversion of GBNK Shares and GBNK equity awards pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement by officers and directors of GBNK subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by officers or
directors of GBNK who may become an officer or director of the Resulting
Corporation subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the
Exchange Act. In furtherance of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time,
(i) the GBNK Board shall adopt resolutions that specify (A) the name of each
individual whose disposition of GBNK Shares (or GBNK equity awards) is to be
exempted, (B) the number of GBNK Shares (and GBNK equity awards) to be
disposed of by each such individual and (C) that the approval is granted for
purposes of exempting the disposition from Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act
under Rule 16b-3(e) of the Exchange Act and (ii) the IBG Board shall adopt
resolutions that specify (A) the name of each individual whose acquisition of
IBG Shares (or IBG equity awards) is to be exempted, (B) the number of IBG
Shares (and IBG equity awards) to be acquired by each such individual and (C)
that the approval is granted for purposes of exempting the acquisition from
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3(d) of the Exchange Act.
Each party shall provide to counsel of the other party for its review (x)
copies of such resolutions to be adopted by the respective boards of
directors prior to such adoption and (y) copies of such resolutions as
adopted, and each party shall provide the other party with such information as
shall be reasonably necessary for the other partys board of directors to set
forth the information required in the resolutions of such board of directors.

 

Section 6.16. _Dividends_. After the date of this Agreement, IBG and GBNK
shall coordinate with the other the declaration of any dividends in respect
of IBG Shares and GBNK Shares and the record dates and payment dates relating
thereto, it being the intention of the parties that holders of GBNK Shares
shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend, in any
quarter with respect to their GBNK Shares and any IBG Shares any such holder
receives in exchange therefor in the Merger.

 



-71- Section 6.17. _Takeover Statutes_. No party shall take any action that
would cause this Agreement, the Merger or any of the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be subject to requirements imposed by any
takeover Laws of any state, including any "moratorium," "control share,"
"fair price," "takeover" or "interested shareholder" Law (any such Laws, "
_Takeover Statutes_ "), and each party shall take all necessary steps within
its control to exempt (or ensure the continued exemption of) the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or if necessary
challenge the validity or applicability of, any applicable Takeover Statute,
as now or hereafter in effect.

 

Section 6.18. _Untrue Representations_. IBG shall promptly notify GBNK in
writing if IBG becomes aware of any fact or condition that makes untrue, or
shows to have been untrue, in any material respect, any material written
information provided by IBG to GBNK, any confidential schedule to this
Agreement or any representation or warranty made by IBG in Article IV or that
results in IBGs failure to comply with any covenant, condition or agreement
contained in this Agreement.

 

Section 6.19. _Transaction Litigation_. IBG shall give GBNK prompt notice
of any litigation against IBG and/or its directors relating to the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and shall give GBNK the
opportunity to participate, at GBNKs cost, in the defense or settlement of
any such litigation, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without the
prior written consent of GBNK, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. For purposes of this paragraph,
"participate" means that the non-litigating party will be kept apprised of
proposed strategy and other significant decisions with respect to the
litigation by the litigating party, consistent with the common interest of IBG
and GBNK in these matters and the applicable privileges and protections
provided therein, and the non-litigating party may offer comments or
suggestions with respect to the litigation and any documents to be prepared
or filed in connection therewith, which will be reasonably considered in good
faith by the litigating party.

not relating to the same Acquisition Proposal as that referenced in clause
(i), then GBNK shall on the earlier of (x) the date such a transaction is
consummated or (y) the date any such definitive agreement is entered into, as
applicable, pay IBG a fee equal to $40,000,000 (the " _Termination Fee_ ") by
wire transfer of immediately available funds; _provided_ , that, for purposes
of this Section 9.04(A), all references in the definition of Acquisition
Proposal to "20%" shall instead refer to "50%".

(B) In the event this Agreement is terminated by IBG pursuant to Section
9.01(G), then GBNK shall, within two Business Days after the date of
termination, pay IBG the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 

(C) In the event this Agreement is terminated by GBNK pursuant to Section
9.01(H), then IBG shall, within two Business Days after the date of
termination, pay GBNK the Termination Fee by wire transfer of immediately
available funds.

 

(D) Each of GBNK and IBG acknowledges that the agreements contained in this
Section 9.04 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and that, without these agreements, IBG and GBNK, respectively,
would not enter into this Agreement; accordingly, if GBNK or IBG, as
applicable, fails promptly to pay the amount due pursuant to this Section
9.04, and, in order to obtain such payment, IBG or GBNK (as applicable)
commences a suit which results in a judgment against GBNK or IBG (as
applicable) for the fee set forth herein or any portion thereof, GBNK or IBG,
as applicable, shall pay to the other party its fees and expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit. In
addition, if IBG or GBNK fails to pay the amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 9.04, then IBG or GBNK, as applicable, shall pay interest on such
overdue amounts (for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid and ending on the date that such
overdue amount is actually paid in 

 



-78-  full) at a rate per annum equal to the "prime rate" published in _The Wall
Street Journal_ on the date such payment was required to be made plus 200
basis points for the period commencing as of the date that such overdue
amount was originally required to be paid. The amounts payable by GBNK or IBG
pursuant to this Section 9.04 constitute liquidated damages and not a penalty,
and, except in the case of fraud, or willful breach of this Agreement, shall
be the sole monetary remedy of IBG or GBNK, as applicable, in the event of a
termination of this Agreement specified in such section. In no event shall any
party be required to pay the Termination Fee more than once. Each partys
obligation to pay the Termination Fee shall survive termination of this
Agreement.

Section 10.03. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the documents
and instruments referred to herein), the Confidentiality Agreement, and the

by the parties to each other at the Closing constitute the full understanding
of the parties, a complete allocation of risks between them and a complete
and exclusive statement of the terms and conditions of their agreement
relating to the subject matter hereof, and supersede any and all prior
agreements, whether written or oral, that may exist between the parties with
respect thereto. Except as otherwise specifically provided in this Agreement,
no conditions, usage of trade, course of dealing or performance, understanding
or agreement purporting to modify, vary, explain or supplement the terms or
conditions of this Agreement shall be binding unless hereafter or
contemporaneously herewith made in writing and signed by the party to be
bound, and no modification shall be effected by the acknowledgment or
acceptance of documents containing terms or conditions at variance with or in
addition to those set forth in this Agreement. Each party to this Agreement
acknowledges that, in executing and delivering this Agreement, it has relied

without the necessity of proving actual damages or posting bond or other
security, the other party shall be entitled to seek temporary
and/or permanent injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of such
performance and to specific enforcement of such covenants in addition to any
other remedy to which such other party may be entitled, at law or in equity.

 

Section 10.12. _Rules of Construction_. When a reference is made in this
Agreement to an Article, Section, Exhibit or _Confidential Schedule_ , such
reference shall be to an Article or Section of, or an Exhibit or _Confidential
Schedule_ to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The table of contents
and headings contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation of this
Agreement. Whenever the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in
this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without
limitation." The words "hereof," "herein" and "hereunder" and words of similar
import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as a whole
and not to any particular provision in this Agreement. Each use herein of the
masculine, neuter or feminine gender shall be deemed to include the other
genders. Each use herein of the plural shall include the singular and vice
versa, in each case as the context requires or as is otherwise appropriate.
The word "or" is used in the inclusive sense. Any agreement, instrument or
statute defined or referred to herein or in any agreement or instrument that
is referred to herein means such agreement, instrument or statute as from
time to time amended, modified or supplemented, including (in the case of
agreements or instruments) by waiver or consent and (in the case of statutes)
by succession of comparable successor statutes and references to all
attachments thereto and instruments incorporated therein. References to a

-85- Section 10.13. _Binding Effect; Assignment_. __ All of the terms,
covenants, representations, warranties and conditions of this Agreement shall
be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the
parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors, and permitted assigns.
Nothing expressed or referred to herein is intended or shall be construed to
give any Person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right,
remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement, or any provision herein
contained, it being the intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement,
the assumption of obligations and statements of responsibilities hereunder,
and all other conditions and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of the
parties to this Agreement and for the benefit of no other Person. Nothing in
this Agreement shall act to relieve or discharge the obligation or liability
of any third party to any party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision
give any third party any right of subrogation or action over or against any
party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, it is specifically intended by the parties to this Agreement that
the persons entitled to the benefits of the covenants contained in Section
6.13 are third-party beneficiaries solely with respect to such section. No
party to this Agreement shall assign this Agreement, by operation of law or
otherwise, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other
party. Any assignment made or attempted in violation of this Section 10.13
shall be void and of no effect.

 

Section 10.14. _Public Disclosure_. None of IBG, Independent Bank, GBNK or
any GBNK Subsidiary will make, issue or release, or cause to be made, issued
or released, any announcement, public statement, press release, or other
public disclosure of the existence, terms, conditions or status of this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written
consent of the other parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
IBG and GBNK, upon prior written notice to the other party, will be permitted
to make, subject to the terms of this Agreement, any public disclosures
or governmental filings as legal counsel may deem necessary to maintain
compliance with or to prevent violations of applicable federal or state Laws
or that may be necessary to obtain regulatory approval for, or to otherwise
effect, the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 10.15. _Extension; Waiver_. At any time before the Closing Date,
the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards
of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i) extend the time for the
performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party
hereto, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant
hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions
contained herein. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument
signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to
insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure. No party to this Agreement shall by any act
(except by a written instrument given pursuant to this Section 10.15) be
deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in
any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise,
nor any delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder by any
party hereto shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise
of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A
waiver of any party of any right or remedy on any one occasion shall not be
construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such party would otherwise have
on any future occasion or to any right or remedy that any other party may have
hereunder.

 



-86- Section 10.16. _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by a written
instrument signed by the parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by
their respective boards of directors, at any time before or after approval of
this Agreement by the GBNK stockholders or the IBG shareholders; but after the
approval of this Agreement by the GBNK stockholders or the IBG shareholders,
there shall not be, without the further approval of such stockholders or
shareholders, as applicable, any amendment of this Agreement that requires
such further approval under applicable Law.
