terms, covenants, representations, warranties and conditions of this Agreement shall be binding upon, and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors, and permitted assigns. Nothing
expressed or referred to herein is intended or shall be construed to give any Person other than the parties hereto any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this Agreement, or any provision herein contained, it being the
intention of the parties hereto that this Agreement, the assumption of obligations and statements of responsibilities hereunder, and all other conditions and provisions hereof are for the sole benefit of the parties to this Agreement and for the
benefit of no other Person. Nothing in this Agreement shall act to relieve or discharge the obligation or liability of any third party to any party to this Agreement, nor shall any provision give any third party any right of subrogation or action
over or against any party to this Agreement. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, it is specifically intended by the parties to this Agreement that the persons entitled to the benefits of the covenants contained in
Section&nbsp;6.13 are third-party beneficiaries solely with respect to such section. No party to this Agreement shall assign this Agreement, by operation of law or otherwise, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the other party.
Any assignment made or attempted in violation of this Section&nbsp;10.13 shall be void and of no effect. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;10.14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Public Disclosure</U>. None of IBG, Independent Bank, GBNK or any GBNK Subsidiary will make,
issue or release, or cause to be made, issued or released, any announcement, public statement, press release, or other public disclosure of the existence, terms, conditions or status of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby without
the prior written consent of the other parties to this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, IBG and GBNK, upon prior written notice to the other party, will be permitted to make, subject to the terms of this Agreement, any public disclosures or
governmental filings as legal counsel may deem necessary to maintain compliance with or to prevent violations of applicable federal or state Laws or that may be necessary to obtain regulatory approval for, or to otherwise effect, the transactions
contemplated hereby. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Section&nbsp;10.15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Extension; Waiver</U>. At any time before the Closing Date, the
parties hereto, by action taken or authorized by their respective boards of directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (i)&nbsp;extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of the other party hereto,
(ii)&nbsp;waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties contained herein or in any document, certificate or writing delivered pursuant hereto or (iii)&nbsp;waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions contained herein.
Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written instrument signed on behalf of such party, but such extension or waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with an
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. No party to this Agreement shall by any act (except by a written instrument given pursuant to this
Section&nbsp;10.15) be deemed to have waived any right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any breach of any of the terms and conditions hereof. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder by
any party hereto shall operate as a waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, power or privilege. A waiver of any
party of any right or remedy on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that such party would otherwise have on any future occasion or to any right or remedy that any other party may have hereunder. </P>
