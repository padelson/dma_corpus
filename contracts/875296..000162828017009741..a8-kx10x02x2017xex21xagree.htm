ARTICLE III.

CONVERSION OF SHARES



Section 3.1 Conversion of Shares. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub, the Company, any
holders of shares of Common Stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common
Stock"), of the Company or the holder of any shares of common stock of Sub:



(a)Each outstanding share of Common Stock that is held in the treasury of the
Company immediately prior to the Effective Time and any shares of Common Stock
owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent, Sub or any other
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent shall be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor.



(b)Each share of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than shares of Common Stock to be canceled in accordance
with Section 3.1(a) and other than Dissenting Company Shares (as defined in
Section 3.4)) shall be converted into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation an amount in cash, without interest, equal to $1.03 (the "Merger
Consideration"). All such shares of Common Stock, at the Effective Time, shall
no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and retired, and
shall cease to exist and each holder of such shares, whether represented by
certificate or certificates (the "Common Stock Certificates") or
uncertificated shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the
right to receive the Merger Consideration, without interest.



-2- 

(c)Each share of common stock of Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into and become at the Effective
Time one fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01
per share, of the Surviving Corporation.



Section 3.2 Adjustment to the Merger Consideration. The Merger Consideration
shall be adjusted appropriately to reflect the effect of any stock split,
reverse stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Common Stock), reclassification, combination,
exchange of shares or other like change with respect to Common Stock
occurring, or with a record date, on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time, and such adjustment to the Merger Consideration shall provide
to the holders of Common Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by
this Agreement prior to such action provided, however, that nothing in this
Section 3.2 shall be construed to permit the Company to take any action that
is otherwise prohibited or restricted under this Agreement.



Section 3.3 Exchange of Certificates. (a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective
Time, Parent shall appoint a commercial bank or trust company reasonably
acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent hereunder (the "Paying
Agent") for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of the
Common Stock Certificates or evidence of ownership of uncertificated shares of
Common Stock (the "Uncertificated Shares"). Parent will enter into a paying
agent agreement in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Company
prior to the Effective Time. All of the fees and expenses of the Paying Agent
shall be borne by Parent.



(b) Surviving Corporation to Provide Funds. Prior to the filing of the
Certificate of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware,
Parent or Sub shall deposit with the Paying Agent cash in an aggregate amount
sufficient to pay the Merger Consideration for all shares of Common Stock
other than shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(a), and Dissenting
Company Shares (such amounts, the "Exchange Fund"). The Paying Agent shall
cause the Exchange Fund to be (i) held for the benefit of the applicable
holders of shares of Common Stock and (ii) subject to Section 3.3(c) promptly
applied to making the payments provided for in Section 3.1. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any purpose that is not provided for herein. The Paying
Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund, as directed by the
Parent, in direct obligations of the United States of America, obligations for
which the full faith and credit of the United States of America is pledged to
provide for the payment of all principal and interest, commercial paper
obligations receiving the highest rating from either Moody's Investors
Service, Inc. or Standard and Poor's or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or banker's acceptances of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such
bank which are then publicly available), or a combination thereof, provided
that, in any such case, no such instrument shall have a maturity exceeding
three months. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments
shall be kept in the Exchange Fund. To the extent that there are losses with
respect to such investments, or the Exchange Fund diminishes for other reasons
below the level required to make prompt payments of the Merger Consideration
as contemplated hereby, Parent shall promptly replace or restore the portion
of the Exchange Fund lost through investments or other events so as to ensure
that the Exchange Fund is, at all times, maintained at a level sufficient to
make such payments. Any portion of the Exchange Fund (including the proceeds
of any interest and other income received by the Paying Agent in respect of
such funds) that remains undistributed to the holders of shares of Common
Stock nine months after the Effective Time of the Merger shall be delivered to
Parent at such time. Thereafter, holders of shares of Common Stock shall look
only to Parent (subject to the terms of this Agreement) as a general creditor
for payment of the Merger Consideration, without interest, upon the surrender
of any Common Stock Certificates or evidence of ownership of Uncertificated
Shares held by them.

-3- 

(c) Exchange Procedures. As soon as practicable after the Effective Time,
Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a
Common Stock, other than holders of shares to be cancelled pursuant to Section
3.1(a), (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Common Stock shall pass, only
upon actual delivery of such Common Stock free and clear of Liens to the
Paying Agent, and shall be in a form and have such other provisions as Parent
may reasonably specify) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of such Common Stock Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in
exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a Common Stock
Certificate (or delivery of such customary affidavits and indemnities with
respect to a lost certificate which the Paying Agent and/or the Company's
transfer agent may reasonably require) or, in the case of the Uncertificated
Shares, other such other evidence, if any, of transfer as the Paying Agent may
reasonably request for cancellation to the Paying Agent or to such other agent
or agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed, and such other documents as
may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Common
Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the amount of cash into which the shares of Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Common Stock Certificate or the Uncertificated
Shares shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1Section 3.1, and the
Common Stock Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No
interest will be paid or will accrue on the cash payable upon the surrender of
any Common Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares. In the event of a
transfer of ownership of Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer
records of the Company, payment may be made to a person other than the person
in whose name the Common Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares so
surrendered is registered, if such Common Stock Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer
and the person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or other Taxes
required by reason of such Common Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
or establish to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is
not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.3, each
Common Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares (other than Common Stock
Certificates representing Dissenting Company Shares or shares to be cancelled
pursuant to Section 3.1(a)) shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the amount of
Merger Consideration, without interest, into which the shares of Common Stock
theretofore represented by such Common Stock Certificate or Uncertificated
Shares shall have been converted pursuant to Section 3.1. If any Common Stock
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall not have been surrendered prior to
six years after the Effective Time (or immediately prior to such time on which
any payment in respect hereof would otherwise escheat or become the property
of any governmental unit or agency), the payment in respect of such Common
Stock Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and
clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of the Paying Agent, Parent, the Company,
Sub or the Surviving Corporation or any party hereto shall be liable to any
former stockholder of the Company for any cash or interest delivered to a
public official pursuant to applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar
Laws. Each of the Paying Agent, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement or any other amounts otherwise payable pursuant to
this Agreement to any holder of shares of Common Stock (or Common Stock
Certificates or Uncertificated Shares) or Options such amounts as it is
required to deduct and withhold, if any with respect to the payment of such
consideration under all applicable Tax Laws and pay such withholding amount
over to the appropriate Tax authority. To the extent that amounts are so
properly withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of
this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of a Common Stock Certificate
or holder of Uncertificated Shares formerly representing shares of Common
Stock.



-4- 

Section 3.4 Dissenting Company Shares. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, if required by the DGCL but only to the extent
required thereby, shares of Common Stock which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by any holder who
is entitled to demand and who have properly exercised appraisal rights with
respect thereto in accordance with, and who complied in all respects with,
Section 262 of the DGCL (the "Dissenting Company Shares") will not be
exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger Consideration, and holders of
such shares will be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262 unless and until
such holders fail to perfect or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to
appraisal and payment under the DGCL. At the Effective Time, the Dissenting
Company Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate or
evidence of shares in book-entry form that immediately prior to the Effective
Time represented Dissenting Company Shares shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the appraised value of such
shares in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262. If, after the
Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or effectively withdraws or
loses such right or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that
such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by such Section 262, such
shares will thereupon be treated as if they had been converted into and have
become exchangeable for, at the Effective Time, the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, without any interest thereon. Upon the Company's receipt
of any appraisal demand in accordance with the provisions of such Section 262,
withdrawals of any such demands and any other related instruments served
pursuant to the DGCL (collectively, the "Appraisal Documents") that are
received by the Company, the Company shall promptly provide Parent with a copy
of such Appraisal Documents and Parent shall have the right to participate in
and direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. The
Company shall not, except with the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to any such appraisal demand or offer to settle or settle
any such appraisal demand.



Section 3.5 No Further Ownership Rights in the Shares. From and after the
Effective Time, the holders of shares of Common Stock which were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to have any rights with
respect to such shares of Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by applicable Law. All cash paid upon the surrender of Common
Stock Certificates and Uncertificated Shares in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the shares of Common Stock.



Section 3.6 Closing of Company Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of shares
of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall
thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Common Stock Certificates
representing shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent
for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided in this
Article III.



Section 3.7 Stock Options.

(a) Within one (1) Business Day of the date hereof (the "Option Notice Date"),
the Company shall deliver a written notice to each holder of options to
purchase shares of Common Stock under the Company's Equity Incentive Plan (the
"Company Stock Plan") or otherwise (individually, an "Option" and
collectively, the "Options") outstanding as of the date hereof, which notice
shall inform such holder that any unexercised and/or unvested portions of his
or her Options outstanding as of the Option



-5- 



Notice Date shall have become immediately exercisable and vested in full as of
the Option Notice Date and shall remain vested and exercisable for a period of
least thirty (30) days prior to the Closing Date and that the exercise and/or
vesting of any Option that is permissible solely by reason of this Section
3.7(a) shall be conditioned upon the consummation of the Merger. Such notice
shall also inform such holder of the effect of the Merger on his or her
Options and set forth such holder's rights with respect to his or her Options
under the Company Stock Plan or otherwise and the treatment of his or her
Options pursuant to this Section 3.7.



(b) By virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Sub,
the Company or any holders of any securities thereof, all Options outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, whether or not then vested and/or
exercisable, shall be canceled at the Effective Time and each holder of an
Option will be entitled to receive from the Surviving Corporation, for each
share of Common Stock subject to an Option, an amount in cash equal to the
excess, if any, of the Merger Consideration over the per share exercise price
of such Option, without interest. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section
3.7 shall be subject to all applicable withholding of Taxes and shall be paid
through the payroll systems of the Surviving Corporation promptly following
the Effective Time. The Company shall take all actions necessary to effectuate
the foregoing.



Section 3.8 Closing. The consummation of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at the offices of Haynes and Boone, LLP, 30 Rockefeller Plaza, 26th
Floor, New York, NY 10012, at 9:30 a.m. New York time on the second Business
Day after the day on which the last of the conditions set forth in Article
VIII (other than those that by their terms can only be fulfilled at the
Closing, it being understood that the occurrence of the Closing shall remain
subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions at Closing) is
fulfilled or (to the extent permitted by Law) waived by the party entitled to
waive such condition or at such other time and place as Parent and the Company
shall agree in writing; provided that without the written consent of Parent,
the Closing shall not occur on a date that is less than sixty (60) days after
the date hereof. The date on which the closing occurs is referred hereto as
the "Closing Date."



Section 3.9 Necessary Further Actions. If, at any time after the Effective
Time, any further action is necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Corporation with full right, title
and possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Sub, the directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation are fully authorized in the name and on behalf of the Company and
the Company Stockholders to take all such lawful and necessary action.

good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in which it is incorporated.
The Company has the requisite power and authority to own, lease and operate
its properties and assets and to carry on their respective businesses as now
being conducted. The Company is duly qualified to do business and in good
standing in each jurisdiction in which the properties or assets owned, leased
or operated by it or the business conducted by it requires such qualification,

individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Material Adverse Effect"
means any change, circumstance, event, occurrence, condition or effect (each,
an "Effect"), that, when considered either individually or in the aggregate,

understood that the exception in this clause (a) shall not prevent or
otherwise affect the underlying cause of any such decrease (to the extent not
otherwise falling within any of the other exceptions in clauses (b) through
(i)) from being taken into account in determining whether a Material Adverse
Effect has occurred), (b) any change in general political conditions or
general conditions in the economy or the financial, debt, credit or securities

acceleration of any obligation or loss of material benefit under any Contract
triggered by the consummation of the Merger that is otherwise not set forth in
Section 4.4(b) of the Disclosure Schedule may be taken into account in
determining whether a Material Adverse Effect has occurred, (i) any action
taken by the Company at the request or with the consent of Parent, except in
each case to the extent such effects directly or indirectly resulting from or
arising out of the matters described in clauses (a) through (i) above
disproportionately affect the Company as compared to other companies operating
in a similar industry as the Company or in the same countries or regions of
the world in which the Company conducts business (in which case, such effects
shall be taken into account when determining whether a "Material Adverse
Effect" has occurred or is reasonably likely to occur) or (B) the ability of
the Company to consummate the Merger and to perform its obligations hereunder.

ARTICLE V.

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT AND SUB



Parent and Sub, jointly and severally, represent and warrant to the Company as
follows:

Section 5.1 Organization, Standing and Power. Each of Parent and Sub is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of Delaware,
respectively, and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease and
operate its assets and carry on its business as now being conducted. Each of
Parent and Sub is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign corporation
authorized to do business in each jurisdiction in which the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of business conducted by it makes such
qualification necessary, except as would not be reasonably be expected to
prevent or delay materially consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger.

Section 5.2 Sub. Since the date of its incorporation, Sub has not carried on
any business or conducted any operations, other than the execution of this
Agreement, the performance of its obligations hereunder and matters ancillary
thereto. Sub was incorporated solely for the purpose of consummating the
Merger. All of the outstanding shares of capital stock of Sub have been
validly issued, are fully paid and nonassessable and are owned by, and at the
Effective Time will be owned by, Parent free and clear of all Liens.

Section 5.3 Authority; Non-Contravention. Each of Parent and Sub has all
requisite power and authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate
the Merger. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and
Sub and the consummation by Parent and Sub of the Merger have been duly
authorized by all necessary action on the part of each of Parent and Sub. This
Agreement has been duly

-28- 

executed and delivered by each of Parent and Sub and (assuming the valid
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company)
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of Parent and Sub
enforceable against Parent and Sub in accordance with its terms, subject to
the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement does not, and the consummation of the Merger and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not, conflict with, or result in any violation of, or
default (with or without notice or lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise
to a right of termination, cancellation or acceleration of any obligation or
to the loss of a material benefit under, or result in the creation of any Lien
upon any of the properties or assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries (as
hereinafter defined) under, any provision of (i) the charter, by-laws or other
organizational documents of Parent and any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) any
Contract to which Parent or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or by which any
of their respective properties or assets are bound, or (iii) any judgment,
order, decree, statute, Law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective properties or
assets, other than, in the case of clause (ii) or (iii), any such conflicts,
violations, defaults, rights, or Liens that, individually or in the aggregate,
would not reasonably be expected to materially impair the ability of Parent
and Sub to perform their obligations hereunder or would not reasonably be
expected to prevent the consummation of the Merger. No Consents of, or
Registrations with, any Governmental Entity, is required by or with respect to
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Parent or Sub or is necessary for the
consummation of the Merger, except for (i) compliance with the provisions of
Exchange Act, (ii) the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware and appropriate documents with the relevant
authorities of other states in which the Company is qualified to do business,
(iii) the HSR Act and similar foreign and supranational Laws relating to
antitrust and anti‑competition clearances or notices, (iv) those matters,
including but not limited to, regulatory consents, approvals and waivers, set
forth in the Disclosure Schedule hereto, (v) as may be required in connection
with the Taxes described in Section 7.11, and (vi) such other Consents or
Registrations the failure of which to be obtained or made would not,
individually or in the aggregate, materially impair the ability of Parent and
Sub to perform their obligations hereunder or would not be reasonably expected
to prevent or materially delay the consummation of the Merger.

Section 5.4 Information Statement. The information supplied or to be supplied
in writing by Parent, Sub or any of their Representatives for inclusion or
incorporation by reference in the Information Statement will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which it is made, not misleading at the date
it is first mailed to the Company Stockholders and at the time of the Company
stockholders meeting and at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof.
Any document that is required to be filed or furnished by Parent, Sub or any
of their respective Affiliates with any Governmental Entity in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement will, when filed with or
furnished to such Governmental Entity, comply as to form in all material
respects with applicable Law.

Section 5.5 Financing.

(j)Parent has delivered to the Company a true and complete copy of the
executed Equity Commitment Letter as in effect on the date hereof. The Equity
Commitment Letter has not been amended or modified in any manner prior to the
date of this Agreement. As of the date hereof, the Equity Commitment Letter is
in full force and effect and represents a valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of Parent and, to the knowledge of Parent, each other party
thereto, to provide the financing contemplated thereby subject only to the
satisfaction or waiver in accordance with the terms thereof of the conditions
set forth in the Equity Commitment Letter, except as may be limited by Laws
affecting the enforcement of

-29- 

creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
considered in a Legal Proceeding at Law or in equity). Assuming the Equity
Commitment Letter is funded in accordance with its terms and conditions and
taking into account the cash balances of the Company, Parent and Sub will have
at and after the Closing, funds sufficient to pay: (a) the aggregate Merger
Consideration, (b) all amounts required to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1 and
Section 3.2 hereof, and (c) all related fees and expenses required to be paid
by Parent and Sub in connection with the Merger, the , and, as of the date
hereof, (i) no such amendment is contemplated and (ii) the respective
commitments contained in the Equity Commitment Letter has not been withdrawn
or rescinded. As of the date hereof, there are no side letters or other
Contracts or arrangements related to the funding or investing, as applicable,
of the equity financing contemplated by the Equity Commitment Letter (the
"Equity Financing") and the other transactions contemplated hereby.



(b) As used in this Agreement, "Equity Commitment Letter" shall mean,
collectively, each equity commitment letter, dated as of the date of this
Agreement, between Parent and the investment funds or other Persons listed on
Exhibit A to this Agreement, together with all exhibits, schedules and other
attachments thereto and pursuant to which, upon the terms and subject to the
conditions set forth therein, such investment funds or other Persons have
committed, directly or indirectly, to invest or cause to be invested in the
equity capital of Parent the amount set forth therein for the purposes of
financing the transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger
Consideration.



Section 5.6 Litigation. Except for matters which are not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to prevent or materially delay, or materially
impair the ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the Merger, there are no
Legal Proceedings pending against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries.



Section 5.7 Brokers. No broker, investment banker or other Person is entitled
to any broker's, finder's or other similar fee or commission in connection
with the Merger based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of the Parent or
Sub for which the Company is responsible.



Section 5.8 Ownership of Shares. Parent and its Subsidiaries do not
beneficially own any shares of Common Stock as of the date hereof. Neither
Parent nor Sub, alone or together with any other Person, was at any time, or
became, an "interested stockholder" of the Company as defined in Section 203
of the DGCL, or has taken any action that would cause the restrictions on
business combinations with interested stockholders set forth in Section 203 of
the DGCL to be applicable to this Agreement.



Section 5.9 Solvency. Parent is not entering into this Agreement with the
intent to hinder, delay or defraud either existing or future creditors of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries immediately following the Closing after
giving effect to the Merger. As of the Effective Time, assuming satisfaction
of the conditions to Parent's and Sub's obligations to consummate the Merger,
or waiver of such conditions, assuming accuracy of the representations and
warranties of the Company contained herein, and after giving effect to Merger
and the payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration, payment of the
aggregate consideration to be paid to holders of Options in the Merger,
payment of all related fees and expenses, each of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will be Solvent. For purposes of this Section 5.9 the term
"Solvent" when used with respect to any Person, means that, as of any date of
determination, (a) the amount of the "fair saleable value" of the assets of
such Person will, as of such date, exceed the value of all "Liabilities of
such Person, including contingent and other Liabilities" as of such date, as
such quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable
federal Laws governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, (b) such
Person will not have, as of such date, an unreasonably small amount of capital
for the operation of the businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be
engaged following such date, and (c) such Person will be able to pay



-30- 

its Liabilities, including contingent Liabilities, as they become absolute and
mature, taking into account the timing of and amounts of cash to be payable on
or in respect of its Indebtedness, in each case, after giving effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. For purposes of this definition,
"not have an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the
businesses in which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay
its Liabilities, including contingent and other Liabilities, as they mature"
means that such Person will be able to generate enough cash from operations,
asset dispositions or refinancings, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

establish and maintain from and after the Effective Time until the sixth
anniversary thereof provisions in its Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws

to those persons than the provisions of the Company Charter and Company By-
Laws as in effect as of the date hereof.





-34- 

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, to the
fullest extent permitted under applicable law as modified by the provisions of
the Certificate of Incorporation and By-Laws as in effect as of the date
hereof and only to the same extent as such persons are indemnified as of the

each present and former trustee of any employee benefit plan of the Company
(each such director, officer or trustee, together with such person's heirs,
executors or administrators, an "Indemnified Party" and collectively, the
"Indemnified Parties") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, Liabilities and

for the Indemnified Parties and such officers) with a claims period of at
least six (6) years from the Effective Time from an insurance carrier
reasonably acceptable to the Company with respect to directors' and officers'
liability insurance for the benefit of the Company and its officers, directors

indemnitors shall pay such Indemnified Party's costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, incurred in connection with pursuing such
claim against the indemnitors.

merges into any other person or entity and shall not be the continuing or
surviving entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys
all or substantially all its properties and assets to any person or entity,
then, and in each such case, proper provision shall be made so that such
continuing or surviving entity or transferee, as the case may be, assumes the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.1.

date of this Agreement through the earlier of (1) the Effective Time and (2)
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1 (the "Pre-Closing
Period"), the Company shall not, directly or indirectly, and shall cause or
permit any directors, officers, other employees, agents, attorneys,
accountants, financial or other advisors and representatives of the Company
("Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) solicit, initiate,
knowingly encourage or knowingly facilitate the making, submission or
announcement of any offer, proposal, inquiry or indication of interest
relating to any Acquisition Transaction (an "Acquisition Proposal") or an
inquiry, indication of interest or request for information, or the making of

provided, however, that none of the foregoing restrictions shall apply to the
Company's and its Representatives' interactions with Parent, Sub and their
respective subsidiaries and representatives. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company acknowledges and agrees that any action taken by
any Representative of the Company that, if taken by the Company would
constitute a breach of this Section 7.3, shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of this Section 7.3 by the Company.



(b) At any time prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time on October 14, 2017,
nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board
from, furnishing non-public information regarding the Company to, or entering
into discussions or negotiations (including, as a part thereof, exchanging any
counterproposals) with, the Person making such Acquisition Proposal and its
Representatives in response to a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal (or a written Acquisition Proposal from a Person with whom the
Company has had discussions with respect to an Acquisition Proposal prior to
the date hereof pursuant to a confidentiality agreement) that is submitted to
the Company by such Person (and not withdrawn) after the date hereof which the
Company Board determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
legal counsel and financial advisor(s)) is, or could reasonably be expected to
lead to, a Superior Proposal if (i) neither the Company nor any Representative
of the Company shall have breached in any material respect any of the
provisions set forth in this Section 7.3, (ii) the Company Board determines in
good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary obligations to the Company's
stockholders under applicable Law, (iii) prior to furnishing any such non-
public information to, or entering into discussions or negotiations with, such
Person, (A) the Company gives prompt written notice to Parent of the identity
of such Person and of the Company's decision to furnish non-public information
to, or enter into discussions or negotiations with, such Person, and (B) the
Company receives from such



-36- 

Person an executed confidentiality agreement (an "Acceptable Confidentiality
Agreement") containing terms, including any standstill provision, that are in
all material respects no less restrictive of such person than those contained
in the Confidentiality Agreement, and (iv) contemporaneously with or prior to
furnishing any such non-public information to such Person, the company makes
available to Parent all such non-public information (to the extent such non-
public information has not been previously made available to Parent). Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, it is understood that any violation
of the restrictions set forth in the preceding sentence by any Representative
of the Company shall be deemed to be a breach by the Company.



(i)For purposes of this Agreement, a "Superior Proposal" shall mean a written
proposal or offer by a Person that the Company Board (or a committee thereof)
has determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), such Person has made or is
financially capable of making a bona fide written offer to purchase, in
exchange for consideration consisting exclusively of cash or publicly traded
equity or debt securities or a combination thereof, all or substantially all
of the outstanding Common Stock or the Company's assets, that is on terms and
conditions that the Company Board (or a committee thereof) determines, in its
reasonable, good faith judgment, after consultation with the Company's
financial advisors and outside counsel, and after taking into account the
likelihood and timing of consummation of the purchase transaction contemplated
by such bona fide written offering, to be more favorable from a financial
point of view to the Company's stockholders than the Merger and is reasonably
capable of being completed, taking into account all factors deemed relevant (a
"Superior Proposal").



(c) If the Company or any of its Representatives receives an Acquisition
Proposal or any request for non-public information at any time during the Pre-
Closing Period (other than from Parent, Sub or their respective
Representatives), then the Company shall promptly (and in no event later than
twenty-four (24) hours after receipt of such Acquisition Proposal or request)
advise Parent in writing of such Acquisition Proposal or request (including
the identity of the Person making or submitting such Acquisition Proposal or
request and the material terms thereof) and provide Parent with a copy of such
Acquisition Proposal or request if it is in writing, subject to the
confidentiality obligations of the Company. The Company shall keep Parent
promptly informed with respect to any material development relating to such
Acquisition Proposal or request and any modification or proposed modification
thereto, and provide Parent with copies of such development, modification and
proposed modification if they are in writing.



(d) The Company shall and shall cause its Representatives to immediately cease
and cause to be terminated any existing discussions between the Company or any
of its Representatives and any Person (other than Parent, Sub and their
respective Representatives) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal or
Acquisition Inquiry pending as of the date of this Agreement and cease, and
cause its Representatives to cease, providing or making available any non-
public information to such Persons.



(e) The Company agrees not to release any Person from, or to amend or waive
any provision of, any confidentiality, "standstill," nonsolicitation or
similar agreement to which the Company is or becomes a party or under which
the Company has or acquires any rights, and will use commercially reasonable
efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced each such agreement at the request
of Parent; provided, however, that this Section 7.3(e) shall not preclude the
Company from responding to a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition
Proposal submitted to the Company by a party that is bound by a "standstill"
agreement and shall not require the Company to enforce or cause to be enforced
it rights under such "standstill" agreement relating to the submission of such
unsolicited Acquisition Proposal. The Company also shall promptly request each
Person that has executed a confidentiality agreement in connection with its
consideration of a possible



-37- 

Acquisition Transaction to return or destroy in accordance with the terms of
such confidentiality agreement all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company.



(i) Subject to the Company's right to make a Recommendation Change to the
extent permitted by Section 7.3(e)(ii) or Section 7.3(e)(iv), the Company
agrees that neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall withdraw
or modify in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, and that no resolution of the
Company Board or any committee thereof shall be adopted to withdraw or modify
in a manner adverse to Parent or Sub, the recommendation or declaration of
advisability by such Company Board or any such committee of this Agreement or
the Merger (it being understood that the Company Board's recommendation shall
be deemed to have been modified in a manner adverse to Parent and Sub if it
shall no longer be unanimous) (any such withdrawal, modification or adoption
being referred to in this Agreement as a "Recommendation Change").



(ii) A Recommendation Change may be made at any time prior to the Stockholder
Approval if: (i) an Acquisition Proposal is made that did not result from a
breach by the Company or any of its Representatives of any of the provisions
of Section 7.3; (ii) at least two (2) days prior to the date of any meeting of
the Company Board (or any committee thereof) at which the Company Board (or
committee) will consider whether such Acquisition Proposal may constitute a
Superior Proposal or whether such Acquisition Proposal may require the Company
to make a Recommendation Change, the Company provides Parent with a written
notice specifying the date and time of such meeting, the reasons for holding
such meeting and a description of such Acquisition Proposal; (iii) the Company
Board determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), (A) that such Acquisition Proposal
would, if this Agreement were not amended or an alternative transaction with
Parent were not entered into, constitute a Superior Proposal and (B) that in
light of such Acquisition Proposal, the failure to make a Recommendation
Change, if this Agreement were not amended or an alternative transaction with
Parent were not entered into, would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent
with the Company Board's fiduciary obligations to the Company's stockholders
under applicable Law; (iv) the Company delivers to Parent a Superior Proposal
Notice in accordance with Section 7.3(e)(iv) with respect to such Acquisition
Proposal (including as an attachment the Specified Definitive Acquisition
Agreement (as defined in Section 7.3(e)(iv)) relating to such Acquisition
Proposal) and otherwise complies in all respects with the notice, negotiation
and other requirements set forth in Section 7.3(e)(iv); and (v) following the
negotiation period(s) described in Section 7.3(e)(iv), the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside legal
counsel and its financial advisor(s), and after taking into account any
definitive written proposal submitted to the Company by Parent or Sub to amend
this Agreement or to enter into an alternative transaction as a result of any
negotiations contemplated by Section 7.3(e)(iv), that (A) such Acquisition
Proposal constitutes a Superior Proposal, and (B) in light of such Acquisition
Proposal, the failure to make a Recommendation Change would reasonably be
expected to be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary obligations to
the Company's stockholders under applicable Law. For avoidance of doubt, a
Recommendation Change shall have no effect on the effectiveness of the
Stockholder Approval. The foregoing shall not affect that right of the Company
to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1(f).



(iii) [Reserved]







-38- 

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 7.3(e)(ii),
a Recommendation Change may not be made pursuant to Section 7.3(e)(ii), and
this Agreement may not be terminated pursuant to Section 9.1(f), unless: (i)
the Company Board shall have received an Acquisition Proposal that it has
determined to be a Superior Proposal pursuant to Section 7.3(e)(ii) and shall
have received from the Person making such Acquisition Proposal a definitive
acquisition agreement, duly executed on behalf of such Person, providing for
the consummation of the transaction contemplated by such Acquisition Proposal,
(the "Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement"); (ii) not less than four
(4) Business Days (or such longer period as provided below) prior to any such
Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 7.3(e)(ii) and not less than four
(4) Business Days (or such longer period as provided below) prior to any
termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to Section 9.1(d), the
Company shall have delivered to Parent a written notice (the "Superior
Proposal Notice") stating that the Company (or the Company Board) intends to
take such action pursuant to Section 7.3(e)(ii) and/or Section 9.1(d) and
intends to enter into the Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement with
respect to such Acquisition Proposal; (iii) during the four (4) Business Day
period commencing on the date of Parent's receipt of such Superior Proposal
Notice (as such period may be extended as provided below), the Company and its
Representatives shall negotiate in good faith with Parent and its officers,
directors and representatives regarding any revisions to the terms of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement proposed by
Parent and the Company shall have made its Representatives reasonably
available for the purpose of engaging in negotiations with Parent (to the
extent Parent desires to negotiate) regarding a possible amendment of this
Agreement or a possible alternative transaction so that the Acquisition
Proposal that is the subject of the Superior Proposal Notice ceases to be a
Superior Proposal; and (iv) any definitive written proposal made by Parent or
Sub to amend this Agreement or enter into an alternative transaction during
the negotiations described in clause "(iii)" above shall have been considered
by the Company Board in good faith, and, after the expiration of the
negotiation period described in clause "(iii)" above, the Company Board shall
have determined in good faith, after consultation with the Company's outside
legal counsel and its financial advisor(s), that such Acquisition Proposal
still constitutes a Superior Proposal; provided, however, that, in the event
of any amendment to the financial or other material terms of such Acquisition
Proposal or any prior amendment to such Acquisition Proposal, the Company
shall be required to deliver to Parent a new Superior Proposal Notice in
respect of each (or any subsequent) amendment (including as attachments
thereto a copy of the new Specified Definitive Acquisition Agreement relating
to such amended Acquisition Proposal), and the negotiation period described in
clause "(iii)" above from the date of Parent's receipt of each such new
Superior Proposal Notice, with respect to any such amendment.



(f) Nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board
from disclosing to the Company's stockholders a position with respect to a
tender offer by a third party pursuant to Rules 14d-9 and 14e-2(a) promulgated
under the Exchange Act or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A; provided, however,
that unless such disclosure consists solely of a "stop, look and listen"
communication containing only statements contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under
the Exchange Act, the Company shall first comply with Section 7.3(e)(ii) to
the extent applicable to such disclosure.



(g) For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" shall mean any
direct or indirect transaction or series of transactions with any Person other
than Parent or Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries involving:







-39- 

(A)any merger, consolidation, amalgamation, share exchange, business
combination, issuance of securities, acquisition of securities,
reorganization, recapitalization, tender offer, exchange offer or other
similar transaction: (i) in which the Company is a constituent corporation;
(ii) in which a Person or "group" (as defined in the Exchange Act and the
rules thereunder) of Persons directly or indirectly acquires beneficial or
record ownership of securities representing more than 15% of the outstanding
securities of any class of voting securities of the Company; or (iii) in which
the Company issues securities representing more than 15% of the outstanding
securities of any class of voting securities of the Company; or

(B)any sale, lease, exchange, transfer, license, acquisition or disposition of
any business or businesses or assets that constitute or account for 15% or
more of the consolidated net revenues, consolidated net income or consolidated
assets of the Company.



Section 7.4 Stockholder Consent; Preparation of the Information Statement.



(a) Pursuant to the Voting Agreements, certain stockholders of the Company
have agreed to vote and deliver a written consent in the form attached hereto
as Exhibit B with respect to the shares of Common Stock owned by them in favor
of approval and adoption of this Agreement and approving the Merger and the
other Transactions contemplated hereby (such written consent, as duly executed
and delivered holders holding a majority of the issued and outstanding shares
of Common Stock, the "Stockholder Consent" which shall constitute the
Stockholders Approval). As soon as practicable upon receipt of the Stockholder
Consent, the Company will provide Parent with a facsimile copy of such
Stockholder Consent, certified as true and complete by an executive officer of
the Company. In connection with the Stockholder Consent, the Company shall
take all actions necessary to comply, and shall comply in all respects, with
the DGCL, including Section 228 and Section 262 thereof, the Company Charter
and the Company By-laws.



(b) Within 20 days of the date hereof, the Company shall prepare and file with
the SEC a written information statement of the type contemplated by Rule 14c-2
of the Exchange Act containing the information specified in Schedule 14C under
the Exchange Act concerning the Stockholder Consent, the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "Information Statement").
Each of the Company and Parent shall furnish all information concerning such
person to the other as may be reasonably requested in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Information Statement. The Company
shall promptly notify Parent upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or
its staff or any request from the SEC or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Information Statement and shall provide Parent with copies
of all correspondence between it and its representatives, on the one hand, and
the SEC, on the other hand. Each of the Company and Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any
comments of the SEC with respect to the Information Statement. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, prior to filing or mailing the Information Statement (or any
amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC with
respect thereto, the Company (i) shall provide Parent a reasonable opportunity
to review and comment on such document or response and (ii) shall include in
such document or response all comments reasonably proposed by Parent. If, at
any time prior to the date that is 20 days after the Information Statement is
first mailed to the Company's stockholders, any information relating to the
Company, Parent or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors
should be discovered by the Company or Parent which is required to be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Information Statement, so that the
Information Statement shall not contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, the party that





-40- 

discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto, and
an appropriate amendment or supplement describing such information shall be
filed with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated
to the stockholders of the Company.



(c) The Company agrees that the Information Statement will comply as to form
in all material respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act and that
none of the information included or incorporated by reference in the
Information Statement will, at the date the Information Statement is filed
with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company, or at the time of
any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading, except that no
covenant is made by the Company with respect to statements made in the
Information Statement based on information supplied in writing by or on behalf
of Parent specifically for inclusion or incorporation for reference therein.
Parent agrees that none of such information will, at the date the Information
Statement is filed with the SEC or mailed to the stockholders of the Company,
or at the time of any amendment or supplement thereof, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.



(d) Each of the Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to cause
the Information Statement to be (i) filed with the SEC in definitive form as
contemplated by Rule 14c-2 under the Exchange Act and (ii) mailed to the
Company Stockholders, in each case as promptly as practicable after, and in
any event within two days after, the latest of (A) confirmation from the SEC
that it has no further comments on the Information Statement, (iii)
confirmation from the SEC that the Information Statement is otherwise not to
be reviewed or (iv) expiration of the 10-day period after filing in the event
the SEC does not review the Information Statement.



Section 7.5 Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to restrictions of
applicable Law, the Company shall afford to Parent, and to Parent's officers,
employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors, consultants and other
representatives and advisors, upon reasonable notice, reasonable access during
normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time to all
their respective properties, books, contracts, commitments and records and,
during such period, the Company shall furnish reasonably promptly to Parent
(a) a copy of each report, schedule, registration statement and other document
filed by it during such period pursuant to the requirements of Federal or
state securities Laws and (b) all other information concerning its business,
properties and personnel as Parent may reasonably request; provided, however,
that the Company may withhold the documents and information to the extent
required to comply with the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third
party in effect on the date of this Agreement or to the extent that such
information is commercially sensitive as between Parent and Sub, on the one
hand, and the Company on the other; and provided further that such
investigation or access shall not unreasonably disrupt the Company's
operations. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section, the
Company shall not be required to provide any information which it reasonably
believes it may not provide Parent or Sub by reason of applicable Law, rules
or regulations, which constitutes information protected by attorney/client
privilege, which the Company or any Subsidiary is required to keep
confidential by reason of contract, agreement or understanding with third
parties, or which the Company reasonably believes is competitively sensitive.
All information exchanged pursuant to this Section 7.5 shall be subject to the
Confidentiality Agreement.









-41- 

Section 7.6 Commercially Reasonable Efforts; Notification. (a) Upon the terms
and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties
shall use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all
reasonable actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things reasonably necessary,
proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the Merger, including (i) the identification and obtaining
of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents, approvals, orders
and authorizations, from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary
Registrations (including, without limitation, under the Hart-Scott Rodino
Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the "HSR Act") and any other
applicable foreign and/or supranational antitrust competition or similar Laws)
and the taking of all reasonable steps as may be necessary to obtain an
approval or waiver form, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any
Governmental Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals
or waivers from third parties, (iii) the defending of any Legal Proceedings
challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including, when
reasonable, seeking to have any stay or temporary restraining order entered by
any court or other Governmental Entity vacated or reversed, (iv) the taking of
all reasonable steps to provide any supplemental information requested by a
Governmental Entity, including participating in meetings with officials of
such entity in the course of its review of this Agreement, the Merger or the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (v) the execution and
delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and
to fully carry out the purposes of this Agreement, and (vi) the satisfaction
of the conditions precedent set forth in Article VIII; provided, however, with
respect to filings under the HSR Act, such filings shall be made within ten
(10) days after the date of this Agreement; provided further, however, that
the obligations set forth in this sentence shall not be deemed to have been
breached as a result of actions by the Company expressly permitted under
Section 6.1. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be obligated
to prepay or redeem debt, amend or waive the provisions of any Contract, or to
pay any consent or similar fees or payments, or divest any assets or enter
into commitments regarding the conduct of its business or licensing of
technology or know-how unless such action is conditioned upon the consummation
of the Merger. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and its Subsidiaries
shall not take or agree to take any action or make any commitment with respect
to any acquisition of businesses or assets which would reasonably be expected
to materially delay or prevent consummation of the Merger.



(b) Without limitation of the foregoing, each of Parent and the Company
undertakes and agrees to (i) respond as promptly as practicable to any
inquiries received from the United States Federal Trade Commission (the "FTC")
or the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice (the
"Antitrust Division") for information or documentation and to all inquiries
and requests received from any state attorney general or other Governmental
Entity in connection with antitrust matters, and (ii) not enter into any
agreement with the FTC, the Antitrust Division or any other Governmental
Entity not to consummate the Merger, except with the prior written consent of
the other parties hereto. Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to take
(and if such offer is accepted, commit to take) all steps necessary to avoid
or eliminate impediments under any antitrust, competition, or trade regulation
Law that may be asserted by the FTC, the Antitrust Division, any state
attorney general or any other Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger
so as to enable the consummation thereof as promptly as reasonably practicable
and shall defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in any
court by any party, including appeals. Without limiting the foregoing, Parent
shall propose, negotiate, offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is
accepted, commit to and effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or
otherwise, the sale, divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses
of Parent or, effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation,
or their respective subsidiaries or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit
to take any action which it is capable of taking and if the offer is accepted,
take or commit to take such action that limits its freedom of action with
respect to, or its ability to retain, any of the businesses, services or
assets of Parent, the Surviving Corporation



-42- 

or their respective Subsidiaries, in order to avoid the entry of, or to effect
the dissolution of, any injunction, temporary restraining order or other order
in any suit or proceeding, which would otherwise have the effect of preventing
or delaying the consummation of the Merger. At the request of Parent, the
Company shall agree to divest, hold separate or otherwise take or commit to
take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to, or its
ability to retain, any of the businesses, services, or assets of the Company,
provided that any such action may be conditioned upon the consummation of the
Merger.



(c) Each party shall (i) promptly notify the other party in advance of any
communication, whether written or oral, to that party from the FTC, the
Antitrust Division, any state attorney general or any other Governmental
Entity and, subject to applicable Law, permit the other party to review in
advance any proposed communication to any of the foregoing and reasonably
consider each other's views concerning any such communication; (ii) not agree
to participate in any substantive meeting, discussion, conference or material
communication with any Governmental Entity in respect of any filings,
investigation or inquiry concerning this Agreement, or the Merger unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat or therein; and (iii) furnish the other party with copies
of, subject to subsection (i) above, all correspondence, filings, and
communications (and memoranda setting forth the substance thereof) between
them and their Affiliates and their respective representatives on the one
hand, and any Governmental Entity or members or their respective staffs on the
other hand, with respect to this Agreement, and the Merger.



(d) In connection with the continuing operation of the business of the Company
between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time, subject to
applicable Law, the Company shall consult in good faith on a reasonably
regular basis with Parent to report material, individually or in the
aggregate, operational developments, the general status of relationships with
customers, suppliers, and resellers, the general status of ongoing operations
and other matters reasonably requested by Parent pursuant to procedures
reasonably requested by Parent; provided, however, that no such consultation
shall operate as a waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty,
covenant, agreement or other provision in this Agreement, or the obligations
of the parties (or remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the
obligations of the parties under this Agreement.



(e) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, the Company shall promptly notify
Parent in writing of:



(i) the occurrence of any matter or event that has resulted or, if left
uncured, would reasonably be expected to result, in any condition to the
transactions contemplated hereby and set forth in Section 8.1(a) not being
satisfied;



(ii) any written notice or other communication from any person (other than a
Governmental Entity) alleging that notice to or consent of such person is
required in connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement;



(iii) any written notice or other communication from any distributor, Material
Supplier, Material Customer or Material Distributor to the effect that such
distributor, Material Supplier, Material Customer or Material Distributor is
terminating or otherwise materially adversely modifying its relationship with
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a result of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement;



-43- 

(iv) any material written notice or other material communication from any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and a copy of any such notice or communication
shall be furnished to Parent, together with the Company's written notice;



(v) any filing or notice made by the Company with any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, and a copy of any such filing or notice shall be furnished to
Parent together with the Company's written notice; and



(vi) any Legal Proceedings commenced or, to the Knowledge of the Company,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting the
Company that, if pending on the date of this Agreement, would have been
required to have been disclosed pursuant to Section 4.8 or that relate to the
consummation of the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, however, that no such notification shall operate as a
waiver or otherwise affect any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement
or other provision in this Agreement, or the obligations of the parties (or
remedies with respect thereto) or the conditions to the obligations of the
parties under this Agreement.



(f) Except as prohibited by applicable Law, Parent shall promptly notify the
Company in writing of the occurrence or existence of any change, event,
occurrence, fact, circumstance, effect or other matter that had or would
reasonably be expected to have any material adverse effect with respect to the
ability of Parent or Sub to consummate the Merger.



Section 7.7 Benefit Plans.



(a) Parent agrees to cause the Surviving Corporation to maintain for a period
of one year after the Effective Time for each individual employed by the
Company without an employment agreement in effect on the date of this
Agreement and who remains employed by the Surviving Corporation during such
one year period, (i) the base salary or base wages of such employees of the
Company on the date of this Agreement and (ii) employee benefits (other than
equity-based, incentive, change in control, transaction bonus or similar
plans, programs or arrangements) that are no less favorable in the aggregate

Subsidiaries to employees who are similarly situated to such employee, or (z)
a combination of clauses (x) and (y), with the election between clauses (x),

in its sole discretion.



(b) To the extent that employees of the Company become eligible to participate
in any employee benefit plan, program or arrangement maintained by Parent or
any of its Subsidiaries, then for purposes of determining eligibility to
participate and vesting, service with the Company prior to the Effective Time
shall be treated as service with Parent or any of its Subsidiaries provide
such service credit does not result in a duplication of benefits and excluding
new plans, programs or arrangements under which prior service credit is not
provided to participants generally. In addition, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause all such plans to waive any pre-existing
conditions, actively-at-work exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation by and coverage of such employees (to the extent that satisfied
under the corresponding Employee Benefit Plan immediately prior to the
Effective Time) and to





-44- 

provide that any expenses, co-payments, and deductibles paid or incurred on or
before the Effective Time by or on behalf of any such employees in respect of
the applicable plan year in which the Merger occurs shall be taken into
account under applicable Parent benefit plans for purposes of satisfying
applicable deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket provisions.



(c) No provision contained in this Section 7.7 shall (i) create any right in
any employee of the Company to continued employment by Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation, or preclude the ability of Parent, the Company or
the Surviving Corporation to terminate the employment of any employee for any
reason; (ii) prevent the amendment, modification or termination thereof after
the Closing Date in a manner that is not inconsistent with Section 7.7(a);
(iii) be treated as an amendment to any particular employee benefit plan of
Parent or the Company; or (iv) create any third-party beneficiary rights in
any Person, including any employee of the Company, or any beneficiary or
dependent thereof.

all fees and expenses incurred in connection with the Merger shall be paid by
the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is
consummated; provided, that, any expenses of the Company incurred in
connection with this Agreement (and the other transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby) which are set forth on Section 7.8 of the Disclosure Schedule
shall be paid by Parent in the event the Merger is consummated.

release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. Parent and
Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, shall use reasonable
efforts to consult with each other before issuing, and provide each other the
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other
public statements with respect to the Merger and, unless it has made
reasonable efforts to do the foregoing, shall not issue any such press release
or make any such public statement, except as may be required by applicable
Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with
any national securities exchange.

directors, shall adopt a resolution consistent with the interpretive guidance
of the SEC so that the disposition of Common Stock and Options pursuant to
this Agreement by any officer or director of the Company who is a covered
person for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act shall be an exempt
transaction for purposes of Section 16 of the Exchange Act.









-45- 

Section 7.13 Transaction Litigation. Subject to applicable Law, other than
with respect to any litigation where Parent is adverse to the Company, the
Company will give Parent the reasonable opportunity, at Parent's sole cost and
expense, to participate, subject to a customary joint defense agreement, in
(but not control) the defense of any Legal Proceeding against the Company or
its directors or officers relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Merger, and no such settlement will be
agreed to or offered without the prior written consent of Parent (such consent
not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and the Company shall
consult in good faith with Parent on litigation strategy. Subject to
applicable Law, other than with respect to any litigation where the Company is
adverse to Parent, Parent will give the Company the reasonable opportunity, at

Section 9.2 Effects of Termination. (a) The Company agrees to pay Parent a fee
equal to $5,506,000, plus the reasonable out of pocket expenses of Parent and

stockholders of the Company, and thereafter and within twelve (12) months
after such termination either the Company has entered into a definitive
agreement relating to an Acquisition Proposal or an Acquisition Transaction
contemplated by an Acquisition Proposal has been consummated (in which case,
the fee shall be payable no later than the first to occur of such entry into
such definitive agreement or completion of such transaction).



(b) The fee payable pursuant to Section 9.2(a) shall be made by wire transfer
of same day funds. The Company acknowledges that the agreement contained in
Section 9.2(a) are an integral part of this Agreement, and that, without this

the Company fails to promptly pay the amount due pursuant to Section 9.2(a)
(but in any event within two Business Days) following delivery by Parent of an
invoice therefor, and, in order to obtain such payment, Parent or Sub
commences a suit which results in a binding nonappealable judgment rendered by

expenses (including attorneys' fees) in connection with such suit.



(c) Subject to the rights under Section 10.3, Parent agrees that the payment
provided for in Section 9.2(a) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of
Parent upon termination of this Agreement under circumstances giving rise to
an obligation (or potential obligation) of the Company to pay the amount set
forth in Section 9.2(a) , and such remedy shall be limited to the aggregate of
the sums stipulated in such section; provided, however, that nothing herein
shall relieve any party from Liability for the willful breach of any of its
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement. In no event shall the Company be required to pay to Parent more
than one termination fee pursuant to Section 9.2(a).



(d) Nothing in this Article IX shall be deemed to impair the right of any
party to bring any action or actions for specific performance, injunctive
and/or other equitable relief (including the right of any party to compel
specific performance by another party of its obligations under this Agreement)
pursuant to, and subject to the limitations set forth in, Section 10.3 prior
to the valid termination of this Agreement, except that, although the Company,
in its sole discretion, may determine its choice of remedies hereunder,
including by pursuing specific performance in accordance with, but subject to
the limitations of, Section 10.3, under no circumstances shall the Company be
permitted or entitled to receive both specific performance of the type
contemplated by Section 10.3 and any monetary damages.



(e) In the event of termination of this Agreement by either the Company or
Parent as provided in Section 9.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void
and have no effect, without any Liability or obligation on the part of Parent,
Sub or the Company, other than the provisions of Section 5.7, the penultimate
sentence of Section 7.5, Section 7.8, Articles IV and V and except for any
intentional breach by a party of any of its representations, warranties,
covenants or agreements set forth in this Agreement (which intentional breach
and Liability therefor shall not be affected by termination of this Agreement
or any payments required to be made pursuant to this Section 9.2).



Section 9.3 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the parties at any
time before the Effective Time. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties.

acts of the other parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies

-53- 

in the representations and warranties contained in this Agreement or in any
document delivered pursuant to this Agreement or (c) waive compliance with any
of the agreements or conditions contained in this Agreement. Any agreement on
the part of a party to any such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set
forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. The failure
of any party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this
Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a waiver of such rights.



Section 9.5 Procedure for Termination, Amendment, Extension or Waiver. A
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.1, an amendment of this
Agreement pursuant to Section 9.3 or an extension or waiver pursuant to
Section 9.4 shall, in order to be effective, require in the case of Parent,
Sub or the Company, action by its Board of Directors or the duly authorized
designee of its Board of Directors.
