iii AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

 

This Agreement and Plan of Merger (this " _Agreement_ ") is made and entered
into as of November 16, 2014, among Halliburton Company, a Delaware
corporation (" _Parent_ "), Red Tiger LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and

conditions set forth herein (the " _Merger_ ").

WHEREAS, the board of directors (the " _Board_ ") of the Company has
unanimously (a) determined that it is in the best interests of the Company and
its stockholders, and declared it advisable, to enter into this Agreement, (b)
approved the execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, and (c) resolved to recommend adoption of this Agreement
by the stockholders of the Company.

WHEREAS, the Board of Parent has resolved to submit to the stockholders of
Parent for their approval the issuance of shares of Parent Common Stock (as
defined in _Section 3.1(a)_).

WHEREAS, as a result of the Merger, and in accordance with the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ ") and the
Limited Liability Company Act of the State of Delaware (the " _Limited
Liability Company Act_ "), each issued and outstanding share of common stock,

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the representations,
warranties and covenants contained in this Agreement, and for other valuable
consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged,
Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows: ARTICLE I

 

THE MERGER

 

Section 1.1 T _he Merger_.

 

Upon the terms and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions
hereof, and in accordance with the applicable provisions of this Agreement
and the DGCL and the Limited Liability Company Act, at the Effective Time, the
Company shall be merged with and into Merger Sub. As a result of the Merger,
the separate corporate existence of the Company shall cease and Merger Sub

Subsidiary of Parent. Merger Sub as the surviving entity after the Merger is
sometimes referred to as the " _Surviving Entity_."

 

Section 1.2 _Closing; Effective Time._

 

(a) _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take place
at 9:00 a.m. (Central time) on a date to be specified by the parties, which
shall be no later than the second Business Day after satisfaction or (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law (as defined in _Section 4.3(b)_) waiver of
the conditions set forth in _Article VIII_  (other than any such conditions
which by their nature cannot be satisfied until the Closing Date, which shall
be required to be so satisfied or (to the extent permitted by applicable Law)
waived on the Closing Date), at the offices of Baker Botts L.L.P., 910
Louisiana Street, Houston, Texas 77002, unless another date, time or place is
agreed to in writing between Parent and the Company. The " _Closing Date_ " is
the date on which the Closing occurs. " _Business Day_ " means any day that
is not a Saturday, Sunday or other day on which banks are required or
authorized by Law to be closed in New York, New York.

 

(b) _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date or as promptly as practicable
thereafter, the Company shall cause the Merger to be consummated by filing a
certificate of merger, in accordance with the DGCL and the Limited Liability
Company Act, with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the "
_Certificate of Merger_ "), in such form as required by, and executed
in accordance with the relevant provisions of, the DGCL and the Limited
Liability Company Act (the time of such filing (or such later time as is
specified in such Certificate of Merger as agreed between Parent and the
Company) being the " _Effective Time_ ").

Section 1.3 _Effect of the Merger._

 

At the Effective Time, the Merger will have the effects set forth in this
Agreement and the applicable provisions of the DGCL and the Limited Liability
Company Act. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject
thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges, powers
and franchises of each of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Entity, and all debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of the Company and the Merger Sub shall become
the debts, liabilities, obligations, restrictions, disabilities and duties of
the Surviving Entity.

 

ARTICLE II

THE SURVIVING ENTITY

Section 2.1 _Certificate of Formation; Limited Liability Company Agreement._

 

The certificate of formation of Merger Sub shall be and remain the certificate
of formation of the Surviving Entity from and after the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended in accordance with the Limited Liability Company Act. The
limited liability company agreement of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time shall be the limited liability company agreement
of the Surviving Entity from and after the Effective Time, until thereafter
amended in accordance with the Limited Liability Company Act, the Surviving
Entitys Certificate of Formation and such limited liability company
agreement. 

 



2 Section 2.2 _Managers and Officers of the Surviving Entity._

 

From and after the Effective Time, the managers and officers of Merger Sub
shall be the managers and officers of the Surviving Entity, in each case,
until the earlier of their death, resignation, removal or until their
respective successors are duly elected and qualified in accordance with the
Surviving Entitys Certificate of Formation and the Limited Liability Company
Act.

 

Section 2.3 _Directors and Officers of Parent._

 

Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to
take all necessary corporate action so that upon and after the Effective Time
the size of the Board of Parent is increased by three members, and three
members of the Board of the Company who are independent with respect to Parent
selected by mutual agreement of Company and Parent (the " _Company Directors_
") are appointed to the Board of Parent to fill the vacancies on the Board of
Parent created by such increase. Parent, through the Board of Parent and
subject to the Board of Parents fiduciary duties to the stockholders
of Parent, shall take all necessary action to nominate the Company Directors
for election to the Board of Parent in the proxy statement relating to the

ARTICLE III

CONVERSION OF SHARES

Section 3.1 _Effect on Capital Stock._

 

As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or any other holder of any shares
of capital stock of the Company or limited liability company interests of
Merger Sub:

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 3.1(f)_, each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (other than any shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled
pursuant to _Section 3.1(d)_ and any Appraisal Shares) shall be converted
automatically at the Effective Time into the right to receive 1.12 shares of
common stock of the Parent (the " _Stock Exchange Ratio_ "), par value $2.50
per share (the " _Parent Common Stock_ "), and $19.00 in cash (the " _Cash
Portion_ ," and together with the Stock Exchange Ratio, the " _Merger
Consideration_ ").

 

(b) _Certificates_. All shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be
outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and
each holder of (i) a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented such shares of Company Common Stock (a " _Stock Certificate_ ") or
(ii) a non-certificated share of Company Common Stock held by book entry (a "
_Book Entry Share_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive, upon the surrender of such Stock Certificate or
Book Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.3_: (A) the Merger
Consideration, (B) certain dividends and other distributions under _Section
3.1(e)_, and (C) cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock
under _Section 3.1(f)_, in each case without interest, and in each case to
be issued or paid in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.3_.

 



3 (c) _Adjustments_. If, between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time, the shares of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall be
changed or proposed to be changed into a different number or class of shares
by reason of the occurrence of or record date with respect to any
reclassification, recapitalization, split-up, combination, exchange of shares
or similar readjustment, in any such case within such period, or a stock
dividend thereon shall be declared with a record date within such period,
appropriate adjustments shall be made to the Merger Consideration to provide
to the holders of Company Common Stock the same economic effect as
contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event. Nothing in this _Section
3.1(c)_ shall be construed to permit any party to take any action that is
otherwise prohibited or restricted by any other provision of this Agreement.

(d) _Treatment of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Each share of
Company Common Stock held in the treasury of the Company and each share of
Company Common Stock owned by Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Entity or any
wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company or Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and no cash, Parent Common Stock or other
consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor and no payment or
distribution shall be made with respect thereto.

 

(e) _Dividends and Distributions_. No dividends or other distributions
declared or made having a record date after the Effective Time with respect
to shares of Parent Common Stock shall be paid to the holder of any
unsurrendered Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share with respect to the
applicable Merger Consideration represented thereby until the holder of record
of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share has surrendered such Stock
Certificate or Book Entry Share in accordance with _Section 3.3_. Subject to
the effect of applicable Laws (including escheat and abandoned property laws),
following surrender of any such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share, there
shall be paid to the holder thereof, without interest, in addition to the
applicable Merger Consideration, (i) the amount of dividends or other
distributions with a record date after the Effective Time theretofore payable
with respect to the Merger Consideration, and (ii) if the payment date for any
dividend or distribution payable with respect to the Merger Consideration has
not occurred prior to the surrender of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share, at the appropriate payment date therefor, the amount of dividends or
other distributions with a record date after the Effective Time (but prior to
the surrender of such Stock Certificate) and a payment date subsequent to the
surrender of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share. For purposes of
dividends or other distributions in respect of shares of Parent Common Stock,
all shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued pursuant to the Merger shall
be entitled to dividends pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence as if
such shares of Parent Common Stock were issued and outstanding as of the
Effective Time.

 

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Parent Common Stock shall
be issued in the Merger, no dividend or other distribution, stock split or
interest shall relate to any such fractional share interest and fractional
share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to any rights of
a stockholder of Parent. Each holder of Company Common Stock who would
otherwise be entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking

 



4  account of all Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares delivered by such
holder) shall be entitled to receive, in lieu thereof, an amount in cash
(without interest) equal to such fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
rounding to the nearest ten thousandth of a share that such holder would
otherwise be entitled to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ multiplied by
the Market Price rounded to the nearest whole cent. " _Market Price_ " means
the volume-weighted average price per share of Parent Common Stock for the
five (5) most recent trading days ending on the third full trading day prior
to the Effective Time for sales conducted regular way on the New York Stock
Exchange (" _NYSE_ "), as such volume-weighted average price is calculated on
the VAP screen on the Bloomberg Professional (TM) Service and shown as VWAP
for such period.

 

(g) _Membership Interests of Merger Sub_. The membership interests of Merger
Sub outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding and shall constitute the only outstanding membership interests of
the Surviving Entity.

Section 3.2  _Appraisal Rights._

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares of Company
Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
that are held by any record holder who is entitled to demand and properly
demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects
with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ")
shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to _Section 3.1_, but instead at the Effective Time shall
become the right to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance
with the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL, and at the Effective Time all
Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
canceled and cease to exist. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such
holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the
right to appraisal under Section 262 of the DGCL or a court of competent
jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief
provided by Section 262 of the DGCL, then (i) such shares of Company Common
Stock shall thereupon cease to constitute Appraisal Shares and (ii) the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares
under Section 262 of the DGCL shall be forfeited and cease and if such
forfeiture shall occur following the Effective Time, each such Appraisal Share
shall thereafter be deemed to have been converted into and to have become, as
of the Effective Time, the right to receive, without interest thereon, the
Merger Consideration. The Company shall deliver prompt notice to Parent of any
demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock (provided that the
failure of the Company to deliver such prompt notice shall not constitute a
breach of this Agreement) and the Company shall provide Parent with the
opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the DGCL. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall not, without the prior written consent of Parent, make any
payment with respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or
agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

Section 3.3 _Surrender and Payment._

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall authorize one
or more transfer agent(s) reasonably satisfactory to the Company to act as
agent for the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger
(the " _Exchange Agent_ "). Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or shall cause to be deposited, with the Exchange Agent, for 

 



5  the benefit of the holders of the Company Common Stock, for exchange in
accordance with this _Article III_ through the Exchange Agent, sufficient cash
and Parent Common Stock to make pursuant to this _Article III_ all deliveries
of cash and Parent Common Stock payable in connection with the Merger (the "
_Exchange Fund_ "). The Exchange Agent shall, pursuant to irrevocable
instructions, deliver the Merger Consideration in exchange for surrendered
shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1_ out of the Exchange
Fund. Except as contemplated by _Section 3.3(d)_, the Exchange Fund shall not
be used for any other purpose. 

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange Agent to mail to each holder
of record as of the Effective Time of (i) each Stock Certificate and (ii) each
Book Entry Share, (A) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that
delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Stock Certificates to the Exchange Agent or, in the
case of Book Entry Shares, upon adherence to the procedures set forth in the
letter of transmittal, and shall be in a form reasonably acceptable to the
Company), and (B) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration as provided in _Section 3.1(a)_. Exchange of any Book Entry
Shares shall be effected in accordance with the Exchange Agents customary
procedures with respect to securities represented by book entry. Promptly
after the Effective Time, upon surrender of a Stock Certificate or Book Entry
Share for cancellation to the Exchange Agent or to such other agent or agents
as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of transmittal, duly
executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the
Exchange Agent, the holder of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor (x) one or more shares of
Parent Common Stock (which shall only be in uncertificated book-entry form)
representing, in the aggregate, the whole number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_
(after taking into account all shares of Company Common Stock then held by
such holder) and (y) a check in the amount equal to the aggregate amount of
cash that such holder has the right to receive pursuant to _Section 3.1_ and
this _Article III_ , including cash payable in lieu of any fractional shares
of Parent Common Stock pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and dividends and
other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_, and the Stock Certificate
or Book Entry Share so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. No interest
shall be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration, cash in lieu of
fractional shares or on any unpaid dividends and distributions payable to
holders of Stock Certificates or Book Entry Shares. Parent shall cause the
Exchange Agent to make all payments required pursuant to the preceding
sentence as soon as practicable following the valid surrender of Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
Company Common Stock that is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration payable in respect of such shares
of Company Common Stock may be paid to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the Stock Certificate so surrendered is registered, if such Stock
Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and the Person requesting such payment shall pay any transfer or
other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person other than the
registered holder of such Stock Certificate or establish to the satisfaction
of the Surviving Entity that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.
Until surrendered as contemplated by this _Section 3.3(b)_, each Stock
Certificate and Book Entry Share shall be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the
Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Stock Certificates or Book
Entry Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional shares to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.1(e)_, without any interest thereon.

 



6 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock; Transfer Books_. All
Merger Consideration issued upon the surrender of Stock Certificates and Book
Entry Shares in accordance with the terms of this _Article III_ shall be
deemed to have been issued in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to
the Company Common Stock theretofore represented by such Stock Certificates
or Book Entry Shares, subject, however, to the Surviving Entitys obligation
to pay any dividends or other distributions pursuant to _Section 3.1(e)_ and
cash in lieu of fractional shares pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ or make any
other distributions with a record date prior to the Effective Time that may
have been declared or made by the Company on such shares of Company Common
Stock in accordance with the terms of this Agreement or prior to the date of
this Agreement and which remain unpaid at the Effective Time. Parent shall
deposit with the Exchange Agent, for the benefit of the holders of Company
Common Stock entitled thereto, sufficient cash or immediately available funds
to make the payments contemplated in the preceding sentence. At the Effective
Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall
be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the
Surviving Entity of shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares are presented to the Surviving Entity or
the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged for
the Merger Consideration payable pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ in respect of
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Stock Certificates or
Book Entry Shares, any cash in lieu of fractional shares to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.1(e)_, without any interest thereon.

(d) _Termination of Fund; No Liability_. At any time following twelve (12)
months after the Effective Time, the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to
require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any portion of the Exchange Fund
(including any interest or other income received with respect thereto) that
remains unclaimed by holders of Stock Certificates and Book Entry Shares
(other than Appraisal Shares), and thereafter such holders shall be entitled
to look to the Surviving Entity (subject to abandoned property, escheat or
other similar Laws) only as general creditors thereof to exchange such Stock
Certificates or Book Entry Shares or to pay amounts to which such holder is
entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(a)_ upon due surrender of their Stock
Certificates and Book Entry Shares, without any interest
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, none of Parent, Merger Sub, the
Company or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any
cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law. If any Stock Certificates or Book Entry
Shares shall not have been surrendered immediately prior to such date on which
any payment pursuant to this _Article III_ would otherwise escheat to or
become the property of any Governmental Entity (as defined in _Section
4.3(c)_), the Merger Consideration and other amounts payable under this
_Article III_ in respect of such Stock Certificate or Book Entry Share shall,
to the extent permitted by applicable Law, become the property of the
Surviving Entity, free and clear of all claims or interests of any Person
previously entitled thereto.

 



7 (e) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Stock
Certificates shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent
shall issue to such holder the Merger Consideration payable in respect of the
shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Stock Certificate, any cash
in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which the holders
thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section 3.1(f)_ and any dividends or other
distributions to which the holders thereof are entitled pursuant to _Section
3.1(e)_, in each case, without any interest thereon, in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Stock Certificates, upon the making of an affidavit
of that fact by the holder thereof and, if required by Parent, the posting by
such holder of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct as
indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such
Stock Certificates, with such assurances as the Exchange Agent, in its
discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of the
Merger Consideration, may reasonably require of the holder of such lost,
stolen or destroyed Stock Certificates.

(f) _Withholding Taxes_. Parent and the Surviving Entity shall be entitled to
deduct and withhold, or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from
the consideration otherwise payable to a holder of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement any stock transfer taxes and such amounts as are
required to be withheld or deducted under the Code, or any applicable
provisions of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent that amounts are
so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of Company Common Stock in respect
of which such deduction and withholding were made.

(g)  _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent. Any interest
or other income resulting from such investments shall be paid to the Surviving
Entity pursuant to _Section 3.3(d)_. The parties hereto agree that, for
United States federal income tax reporting purposes, the Surviving Entity
shall be the owner of the Exchange Fund. If for any reason (including losses)
the Exchange Fund is inadequate to pay the amounts to which holders of shares
of Company Common Stock shall be entitled under this _Article III_ , Parent
shall take all steps necessary to promptly, or to enable or cause the
Surviving Entity to promptly, deposit with the Exchange Agent additional
Merger Consideration or other cash sufficient to make all payments required
under this Agreement, and Parent and the Surviving Entity shall in any event
be liable for payment thereof. The Surviving Entity shall pay all charges and
expenses, including those of the Exchange Agent, in connection with the
exchange of shares for the Merger Consideration.

(h)  _Further Assurances_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers of
the Surviving Entity will be authorized to execute and deliver, in the name
and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any deeds, bills of sale,
assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the name and on behalf of
the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things to vest, perfect or
confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving Entity any and all right,
title and interest in, to and under any of the rights, properties or assets
acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving Entity as a result of, or in
connection with, the Merger.

 



8 Section 3.4 _Treatment of Options and other Equity Awards._

 

(a) Each outstanding option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (a "
_Company Option_ ") granted under the Companys 2002 Employee Long-Term
Incentive Plan, the 2002 Director and Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan, the BJ
Services Company 2000 Incentive Plan, the BJ Services Company 2003 Incentive
Plan or the Baker Hughes Incorporated Director Compensation Deferral Plan,
each as amended to date (the " _Company Stock Plans_ "), that is outstanding
and unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be treated as
follows as of the Effective Time. Any Company Option that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the Effective Time, cease
to represent a right to acquire Company Common Stock and shall be converted
into a right to acquire Parent Common Stock (an " _Adjusted Option_ ") which
shall continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions
as applied to such Company Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
(including, without limitation, acceleration of vesting in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement), except that such Adjusted
Option shall be with respect to that number of whole shares of Parent Common
Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) equal to the product of (x)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option
immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the Stock Award
Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Parent Common Stock (rounded
up to the nearest whole cent) equal to the quotient obtained by dividing (a)
the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock of such Company Option by
(b) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio; provided that the exercise price and/or
the number of shares of Parent Common Stock that may be purchased under the
Adjusted Option shall be further adjusted to the extent required to remain
compliant with, or exempt from, the requirements of Section 409A of the Code
and the Treasury Regulations issued thereunder (collectively, " _Section
409A_ "); and provided further, that in the case of Company Options that are
intended to qualify as incentive stock options within the meaning of Section
422 of the Code, the exercise price and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock subject to the Adjusted Option shall be determined in a manner
consistent with the requirements of Section 424 of the Code and the Treasury
Regulations issued thereunder. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Stock Award
Exchange Ratio_ " means the sum of the Stock Exchange Ratio and the Cash
Portion Exchange Ratio. The " _Cash Portion Exchange Ratio_ " means the
quotient obtained by dividing (i) the Cash Portion by (ii) the Market Price.

(b) Immediately prior to the Effective Time, the restrictions on each
restricted share of Company Common Stock (the " _Company Restricted Stock_ ")
granted and then outstanding under the Company Stock Plans shall, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
lapse, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock shall be fully vested
at such time, and each such share of Company Restricted Stock will be treated
at the Effective Time the same as, and have the same rights and be subject to
the same conditions as, a share of Company Common Stock not subject to any
restrictions.

(c) As of the Effective Time, the restrictions on each restricted stock unit
with respect to Company Common Stock (a " _Company Restricted Stock Unit_ ")
granted and then outstanding, whether or not vested, under the Company Stock
Plans shall, without any action on the part of the holder thereof, the
Company, Parent or Merger Sub, be canceled and converted into the right to
receive, as soon as practicable after the Effective Time, the Merger
Consideration based on the total number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Restricted Stock Unit immediately prior to the
Effective Time.

 



9 (d) With respect to any performance unit awards (" _Company Performance Units_
") that provide for settlement in the medium of cash and that are outstanding
as of the Effective Time, such Company Performance Units shall, without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub,
be settled by delivery of an amount of cash as described in the award
agreement applicable to such holder thereof as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time.

 

(e) With respect to any Company Performance Units that provide for settlement
in the medium of Company Common Stock and that are outstanding as of the
Effective Time, such Company Performance Units shall, without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, be canceled
and converted into the right to receive, as soon as practicable after the
Effective Time, the per share Merger Consideration for each of the units
under the Company Performance Units, prorated in the same manner (specified in
the applicable award agreements) as if the Company Performance Units had been
payable in shares of Company Common Stock.

(f) The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement constitute a "change in control" for purposes
of the Company Stock Plans and that the vesting of all Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock and Company Restricted Stock Units that were granted
on or prior to the date of this Agreement and that are outstanding and
unvested as of immediately prior to the Effective Time shall accelerate in
full at the Effective Time in accordance with their terms.

 

(g) Notwithstanding _Section 3.4(a)_ through _Section 3.4(f)_, any Company
Option, Company Restricted Stock Unit, Company Performance Unit or Company
Restricted Stock that is granted after the date hereof shall be treated as
described in this _Section 3.4(g)_. Any award of Company Restricted Stock
Units granted after the date hereof that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not vested, shall, as of the Effective Time,
cease to represent a right to receive Company Common Stock and shall be
converted into a right with respect to a number of whole shares of Parent
Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the
number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such award immediately
prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Stock Award Exchange Ratio,
which right shall (subject to Section 7.3(i)) continue to have, and shall be
subject to, the same terms and conditions as applied to such Company
Restricted Stock Units immediately prior to the Effective Time. Any Company
Option granted after the date hereof that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, whether or not vested or exercisable, shall be treated in
the manner specified in Section 3.4(a), except that there shall be no
acceleration of vesting or exercisability of such Company Option solely as a
result of the consummation of the corporate transactions contemplated hereby.
Any award of Company Performance Units that is granted after the date hereof,
that provides for settlement in the medium of Company Common Stock and that
is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, cease to represent Company Common Stock and shall be converted
into a right with respect to a number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
(rounded down to the nearest whole share) that is equal to the product of (x)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to

 



10  such award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by (y) the
Stock Award Exchange Ratio, which right shall (subject to _Section 7.3(i)_)
continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms and conditions as
applied to such awards immediately prior to the Effective Time, provided that
such awards shall only be subject to time-based vesting after the Effective
Time. Any award of Company Restricted Stock that is granted after the date
hereof that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as
of the Effective Time, be converted into an award of such number of restricted
shares of Parent Common Stock (rounded down to the nearest whole share) that
is equal to the product of (A) the number of shares of Company Restricted
Stock subject to such award immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied
by (B) the Stock Award Exchange Ratio, which award shall (subject to 
_Section 7.3(i)_) continue to have, and shall be subject to, the same terms
and conditions as applied to such award of Company Restricted Stock
immediately prior to the Effective Time.

 

(h) The Surviving Entity and Parent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold,
or cause the Exchange Agent to deduct and withhold, from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this _Section 3.4_ to any holders of Company
Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company Restricted Stock Units or Company
Performance Units (collectively, " _Company Incentive Awards_ ") such amounts
as it may be required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of
such payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax
Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving Entity,
Parent or the Exchange Agent, as the case may be, the withheld amounts shall
be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
holders of such Company Incentive Awards, as applicable, in respect of which
the deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Entity, Parent or the
Exchange Agent, as the case may be.

(i) On or prior to December 31, 2014, the Company shall take such actions as
are necessary to amend the Companys Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "
_ESPP_ ") to provide that if the Company shall not be the surviving
corporation in any merger (or survives only as a subsidiary of another
entity) constituting a Change in Control (as defined in the Companys 2002
Director and Officer Long-Term Incentive Plan and the 2002 Employee Long-Term
Incentive Plan) that occurs prior to the last day of an Offering Period (as
defined in the ESPP), there shall be no purchases of stock of the Company or
of any other entity for such Offering Period and the ESPP option holders
accumulated payroll deductions for such Offering Period shall be returned to
the ESPP option holders without interest.

(j) _Schedule 3.4_ of the Company Disclosure Letter identifies in reasonable
detail the Company Incentive Awards outstanding on the date of this
Agreement. Promptly following request by Parent after the date hereof, the
Company will deliver to Parent a true and complete list of the Company
Incentive Awards on the date of this Agreement, setting forth, as applicable,
(i) the number of shares, or the maximum amount of cash subject to Company
Performance Units settled in cash, originally subject to such awards on a
grant by grant basis, (ii) the number of shares remaining subject to such
awards on a grant by grant basis, (iii) the dates on which such awards were
granted, (iv) the exercise prices applicable to such awards and (v) the
Company Stock Plan under which such awards were granted. 

 



11 (k) Parent shall take all action necessary or appropriate to have available
for issuance under an effective registration statement filed with the United
States Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ") a sufficient number
of shares of Parent Common Stock for delivery upon exercise, settlement or
vesting of the Adjusted Options and the converted Company Performance Units,
Company Restricted Stock Units and Company Restricted Stock.

(l) As of the Effective Time, except as provided in this _Section 3.4_, all
rights under any Company Incentive Award and any provision of the Company
Stock Plans providing for the issuance or grant of any other interest in
respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be canceled. The Company
shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that, as of and after the
Effective Time, except as provided in this Section 3.4, no Person shall have
any rights under the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program or
arrangement with respect to securities of the Company, the Surviving Entity or
any Subsidiary thereof.

ARTICLE IV 

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

 

Except as set forth in (i) the disclosure letter, delivered by Company to
Parent at or prior to the execution and delivery of this Agreement (the "
_Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (each schedule of which corresponds to a
numbered and/or lettered section of this Agreement and of which disclosure
made in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
disclosed for all purposes of this Agreement and all other sections of the
Company Disclosure Letter to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that
such disclosure is responsive), or (ii) the Company SEC Reports (as defined
in  _Section 4.5(a)_) filed with the SEC between December 31, 2013 and the
date of this Agreement (excluding any disclosure set forth in any risk factor
section or forward looking statements section, the " _Specified Company
SEC Disclosure_ "), to the extent that it is reasonably apparent that the
disclosure in the Specified Company SEC Disclosure is responsive to the
matters set forth in this _Article IV_ , the Company represents and warrants
to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

Section 4.1 _Organization; Good Standing and Qualification._

 

(a) The Company and each entity that is a Subsidiary of the Company as of the
date hereof (the " _Company Subsidiaries_ ") is a corporation, limited
liability company, partnership or other entity duly organized and validly
existing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization and has all
requisite entity power and authority to own, operate and lease its
properties and to carry on its business as now conducted.

(b) The Company and each of the Company Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or
licensed, as may be required, and in good standing in each of the
jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character of the property owned, leased or used by it makes such qualification
and/or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified
and/or licensed does not constitute a Company Material Adverse Effect. A "
_Company Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to the Company, any
fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition,
either individually or together with one or more other contemporaneously
existing facts, circumstances, occurrences, events, developments, changes or
conditions that is, or would reasonably be expected to be, materially adverse
to the business or financial condition of the Company and the Company

Section 5.1 _Organization; Good Standing and Qualification._  

(a) Parent and each of the Subsidiaries of Parent (including Merger Sub) as of

(b) Parent and each of the Parent Subsidiaries is duly qualified and/or
licensed, as may be required, and in good standing in each of the
jurisdictions in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character of the property owned, leased or used by it makes such qualification
and/or licensing necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified
and/or licensed does not constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect. A "
_Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means, with respect to the Parent, any
fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition,
either individually or together with one or more other contemporaneously
existing facts, circumstances, occurrences, events, developments, changes or

Subsidiaries considered collectively as a single

 



32  enterprise; provided, however, that any such fact, circumstance, occurrence,
event, development, change or condition (or combination thereof) shall not be
considered in determining whether a Parent Material Adverse Effect has
occurred to the extent it results from (A) a change in Law or GAAP or
interpretations thereof, (B) general economic, market, oilfield services
industry, or political conditions (including acts of terrorism or war or
other force majeure events), (C) any change in Parents stock price, trading
volume or credit rating (unless due to a circumstance which would separately
constitute a Parent Material Adverse Effect), (D) the announcement or

similar catastrophes, any weather related event or any outbreak of illness
or other public health event, or (F) the failure of Parent to meet internal
or analysts expectations, projections or budgets (unless due to a
circumstance which would separately constitute a Parent Material Adverse
Effect); provided, however, that (i) any fact, circumstance, occurrence,
effect, development, change or condition referred to in clauses (A), (B) or
(E) shall be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Parent
Material Adverse Effect has occurred to the extent, but only to the extent,

adversely affects Parent in a disproportionate manner as compared to other
participants in the oilfield services industry.

federal securities laws. Parent has not heretofore agreed to take any such
action, and there are no outstanding contractual obligations of Parent of any
kind to redeem, purchase or otherwise acquire any outstanding shares of

of the Company, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed
(other than to the extent necessary (A) for the absence of a quorum, or (B) to
allow reasonable additional time for the filing and mailing of any
supplemental or amended disclosure which the Board of Parent has determined in
good faith, after consultation with Parents outside counsel and financial
advisors, is necessary under applicable Law and for such supplemental or
amended disclosure to be disseminated and reviewed by Parents stockholders
prior to the Parent Special Meeting; provided that in the event that the
Parent Special Meeting is delayed to a date after the Termination Date as a
result of either (A) or (B) above, then the Termination Date shall be
extended to the fifth Business Day after such date). Except to the extent
permitted by _Section 7.12_, (i) the Proxy/Prospectus shall (x) state that
the Board of Parent has determined that the Parent Proposal is advisable and
in the best interests of Parent and (y) include the recommendation of the
Board of Parent that the Parent Proposal be adopted by the holders of Parent
Common Stock (such recommendation described in this clause (y), the " _Parent
Board Recommendation_ ") and (ii) neither the Board of Parent nor any
committee thereof shall withdraw, amend or modify, or publicly propose or
resolve to withdraw, amend or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the
Parent Board Recommendation.

(e) The Company and Parent shall each use their reasonable best efforts to
cause the Company Special Meeting and the Parent Special Meeting to be held on
the same date.

Section 7.2  _Stock Exchange Listing._

Parent shall use all reasonable best efforts to cause the shares of Parent
Common Stock to be issued in connection with the Merger (including shares
issuable under any Adjusted Options) to be approved for listing on the NYSE at
or prior to the Effective Time, subject to official notice of issuance.

 

Section 7.3 _Employee Benefit Matters._

 

(a) For a period of twelve (12) months following the Closing, Parent shall,
and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries)
to, provide to each employee of the Company or any Company Subsidiary who is
employed immediately prior to the Closing and who remains in the employ of
Parent, the Company or any of its or their Subsidiaries after the Closing
(each such individual, a " _Continuing Employee_ ") (i) a level of base
salary or hourly wages that is no less favorable than the level of base salary
or hourly wages provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing, (ii) cash and equity-based incentive compensation opportunities that
are no less favorable than the cash and equity-based incentive compensation
opportunities provided to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the
Closing and (iii) with respect to employee benefits, (A) treat similarly
situated Continuing Employees on a substantially equivalent basis, taking into
account all relevant factors, including but not limited to duties, geographic
location, tenure, qualifications and abilities, as other employees of Parent
or its Subsidiaries and (B) not discriminate between employee benefits
provided to Continuing Employees and employee benefits provided to other
employees of Parent or its Subsidiaries. 

 



53 (b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall
honor all Company Benefit Plans and compensation arrangements and agreements
in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before the Effective
Time and shall cause any employee benefit plans and compensation arrangements
established, maintained or contributed to by Parent or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company and its Subsidiaries) that cover any of the Continuing
Employees following the Closing (collectively, the " _Parent Plans_ ") to (i)
recognize the pre-Closing service of participating Continuing Employees with
the Company and its Subsidiaries for purposes of vesting and eligibility to
participate, except to the extent such service credit would result in a
duplication of benefits for the same period, (ii) recognize the pre-Closing
service of participating Continuing Employees with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of benefit accrual and amounts of benefits and
contributions (other than for benefit accrual purposes under a defined
benefit pension plan, an arrangement providing statutory required benefits or,
except as required by a collective bargaining agreement as in effect on the
date hereof or by applicable Law, an arrangement that, under applicable Law
or collective bargaining agreement, is exclusively subject to collective
negotiation or bargaining), except to the extent such service credit would
result in a duplication of benefits for the same period, (iii) waive any pre-
existing condition limitations for participating Continuing Employees and
(iv) provide credit to each participating Continuing Employee under the
applicable Parent Plan for amounts paid by such Continuing Employee prior to
the Closing during the year in which the Closing occurs under any analogous
Company Benefit Plan during the same period for purposes of applying
deductibles, co-payments and out-of-pocket maximums as though such amounts had
been paid in accordance with the terms of such Parent Plan; provided that
nothing herein shall limit the right of the Company, Parent or the Surviving
Entity to amend or terminate such plans, arrangements and agreements in
accordance with their terms.

 

(c) Parent shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to credit under any
applicable Parent Plans each Continuing Employee with all vacation and
personal holiday time that such Continuing Employee has accrued but has not
used as of the Closing, provided that any such credited accruals may be used
only during the calendar year in which the Closing occurs.

 

(d) Without limiting the generality of Section 7.3(b), the Company
acknowledges and agrees that all provisions contained in this Agreement with
respect to the Continuing Employees are included for the sole benefit of the
Company, Parent and the Surviving Entity, and that nothing in this Agreement,
whether express or implied, shall create any third party beneficiary or other
rights (i) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any employees,
former employees, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or other benefit
plan or arrangement, or any dependent or beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to
continued employment with the Company, Parent, the Surviving Entity, or any
of their respective Subsidiaries.

(e) Nothing contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as
an amendment or other modification of any Company Benefit Plan or other
employee benefit plan or arrangement, or shall limit the right of Parent, the
Surviving Entity, the Company or any of their Subsidiaries, to amend,
terminate or otherwise modify any such Company Benefit Plan or other employee
benefit plan or arrangement following the Closing in accordance with its
terms. In the event that (i) a party other than the Parent, the Company or any
of their Subsidiaries makes a claim or takes other action to enforce any
provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any Company Benefit Plan or
other employee benefit plan or arrangement, and (ii) such 

 



54  provision is deemed in any judicial proceeding to be an amendment to such
Company Benefit Plan or other employee benefit plan or arrangement even though
not explicitly designated as such in this Agreement then such provision, to
the extent covered by such deemed amendment, shall lapse retroactively and
shall have no amendatory effect.

 

(f) Effective as of a date no later than the day immediately prior to the
Effective Time, unless otherwise directed in writing by Parent, at least ten
(10) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take or
cause to be taken all actions necessary to (i) adopt amendments to all Section
401(k) plans maintained or contributed to by the Company or a
Company Subsidiary (collectively, the " _Company 401(k) Plan_ ") required to
be adopted in accordance with the Code to reflect qualification requirements
that apply as of the date of termination of the Company 401(k) Plan, (ii) take
all necessary action to effect the termination of the Company 401(k) Plan and
shall provide Parent with a copy of the applicable board of directors
resolutions and termination agreements evidencing such terminations and (iii)
ensure that each Continuing Employee is fully vested in his or her account
balance under the Company 401(k) Plan. Following the Effective Time, to the
extent provided under the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan at the time of
termination, Parent shall permit participants in the Company 401(k) Plan who
are employed by Parent or its Subsidiaries to (i) make in-service withdrawals
from the Company 401(k) Plan, and (ii) continue to receive and repay any loans
from the Company 401(k) Plan. Following the Effective Time, Parent shall
permit each participant in the Company 401(k) Plan who terminates employment
with the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries the right to receive a
distribution of such participants interest under the Company 401(k) Plan, in
each case in accordance with the terms of the Company 401(k) Plan. As soon as
practicable following Internal Revenue Service approval of the termination of
the Company 401(k) Plan, Parent or the Surviving Entity shall, with respect
to Continuing Employees who remain actively employed with Parent or the
Surviving Entity (i) provide an election to roll over their interest under the
Company 401(k) Plan, including plan loans, to a tax-qualified defined
contribution plan maintained by Parent or an affiliate of Parent (the "
_Parent DC Plan_ "), (ii) cause the trustee of the Company 401(k) Plan to roll
over the interest which the participant elects to roll over to the Parent DC
Plan, and (iii) cause the Parent DC Plan to accept any such rollovers. The
Continuing Employees shall be eligible to participate in the Parent DC Plan
immediately following the Effective Time.

 

(g) Parent shall not (and shall cause the Parent Subsidiaries not to)
communicate or otherwise meet with any of the employees of the Company and
Company Subsidiaries to discuss the terms and conditions of employment or
employee benefits or compensation matters without reasonable prior notice to
the Company or its designee. Such communications and/or meetings shall be
effectuated solely by human resources representatives of Parent in reasonable
cooperation with the Company, and shall be limited to topics directly related
to the terms and conditions of employment with Parent or a Parent Subsidiary
and employee benefits or compensation matters following the Effective Time.

(h) Without limiting _Section 7.3(g)_, Parent and the Company agree that
for the period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Termination
Date, each of Parent and the Company will not, and will ensure that its
Affiliates (and any person acting on behalf of or in concert with it or any of
its Affiliates) will not, directly or indirectly, solicit for employment or
hire any officer, director, or employee of the other party or any of the other
partys

 



55  Subsidiaries. The restrictions of this _Section 7.3(h)_ shall not prohibit
either party, however, from conducting any general solicitations for
employment, such as any newspaper or Internet help wanted advertisement,
directly or through any agent (including placement and recruiting agencies)
that is not directed at such persons.

 

(i) If, during the twelve (12) month period beginning on the Closing Date, the
employment of any Continuing Employee is terminated as a result of an
Involuntary Termination, (i) Parent shall pay (or shall cause its Affiliate to
pay) such Continuing Employee a lump sum cash severance payment in an amount
equal to the greater of (A) (x) the cash severance payment that would be
payable to such Continuing Employee under the applicable severance plan,
program, agreement or arrangement of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
(each, a " _Company Severance Arrangement_ "), if any, that covers
such Continuing Employee as of immediately prior to the Closing Date, under
the terms of such Company Severance Arrangement as in effect as of immediately
prior to the Closing Date (taking into account service rendered by such
Continuing Employee for Parent and Parents Affiliates after the Effective
Time and disregarding any ability of the Company or its Subsidiaries to
terminate or adversely amend such Company Severance Arrangement) or (y) if
greater, the amount determined in accordance with the formula set forth in
_Schedule 7.3(i)_ of the Company Disclosure Letter or (B) the cash severance
payable to such Continuing Employee under any severance program or arrangement
of Parent or its Affiliate and (ii) the vesting of all then outstanding
equity awards granted by Parent or a Parent Subsidiary, and all Company
Incentive Awards described in Section 3.4(g), held by such Continuing Employee
shall immediately accelerate in full. Such cash severance amount will be paid
on the date that is sixty (60) days following such Continuing Employees
Separation From Service; provided that, if such Continuing Employee is a
Specified Employee, such payment shall be made on the date that is six (6)
months following such Continuing Employees Separation From Service, except to
the extent that such payment may be made prior to such date without incurring
additional taxes or interest under Section 409A.

 

For purposes of this _Section 7.3(i)_, the terms " _Separation From Service_
" and " _Specified Employee_ " have the meanings ascribed to those terms in
Section 409A; the term " _Involuntary Termination_ " shall mean the
termination of a Continuing Employees employment with Parent or its Affiliate
(without a contemporaneous transfer of employment to Parent or its Affiliate)
that occurs during the twelve (12) month period following the Effective Time
and that results from either such Continuing Employees termination of
employment by Parent or its Affiliate other than for Cause (as defined
herein) or a resignation by such Continuing Employee for Good Reason (as
defined herein).

For purposes of this _Section 7.3(i)_, the term " _Cause_ " with respect to
a Continuing Employee has the meaning assigned to it (or to a term of like
import) in the applicable Company Severance Arrangement as in effect as of
immediately prior to the Effective Time, or if such applicable Company
Severance Arrangement that covered such Continuing Employee does not define
"Cause" (or if such Continuing Employee is not covered by a Company Severance
Arrangement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time) then " _Cause_ "
means (i) the willful and continued failure by the Continuing Employee to
substantially perform the Continuing Employees duties with Parent or its
Affiliate (other than any such failure resulting from the Continuing
Employees incapacity due to physical or mental illness) or (ii) the willful
engaging by the Continuing Employee in conduct which is demonstrably and
materially injurious to Parent or its Affiliate, monetarily or otherwise.

 



56 For purposes of this _Section 7.3(i)_, the term " _Good Reason_ "
with respect to a Continuing Employee has the meaning assigned to it (or to a
term of like import) in the applicable Company Severance Arrangement as in
effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time, or if such applicable
Company Severance Arrangement that covered such Continuing Employee does not
define "Good Reason" (or if such Continuing Employee is not covered by a
Company Severance Arrangement as of immediately prior to the Effective Time)
then " _Good Reason_ " means the occurrence (without the Continuing
Employees express written consent) of any one of the following acts by Parent
or its Affiliate, or failures by Parent or its Affiliate to act, unless, in
the case of any act or failure to act described in paragraph (a) below, such
act or failure to act is corrected prior to the effective date of the
Continuing Employees termination for Good Reason:

 

(a) a reduction by Parent or its Affiliate in the Continuing Employees annual
base compensation as in effect on the date hereof or as the same may be
increased from time to time, except for across-the-board salary reductions
similarly affecting all individuals having a similar level of authority and
responsibility with Parent or its Affiliate (as applicable); or

 

(b) the relocation of the Continuing Employees principal place of employment
to a location outside of a 30-mile radius from the Continuing Employees
principal place of employment immediately prior to the Effective Time or
Parents or its Affiliates (including the Companys or its Subsidiarys)
requiring the Continuing Employee to be based anywhere other than such
principal place of employment (or permitted relocation thereof) except for
required travel on Parents or its Affiliates business to an extent
substantially consistent with the Continuing Employees business travel
obligations immediately prior to the Effective Time.

The Continuing Employees continued employment shall not constitute consent
to, or a waiver of any rights with respect to, any act or failure to act
constituting Good Reason hereunder.

Section 7.4  _Section 16 Matters._

No fewer than 18 Business Days prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
prepare and cause to be delivered to Parent a schedule (a) identifying each
individual that, for purposes of Section 16(b) under the Exchange Act, (i) is
an officer or director of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or (ii) will,
at the Effective Time be an officer or director of the Surviving Entity and
who owns Company Common Stock and (b) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock owned by each such individual. Prior to the Effective Time, each of
Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts to cause any
dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of Parent Common Stock
(including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common Stock)
resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act, such efforts to include all steps
required to be taken in accordance with the No-Action Letter dated January 12,
1999, issued by the SEC to Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom LLP.

 



57 Section 7.5 _Certain Tax Matters._

 

(a) This Agreement is intended to constitute a "plan of reorganization" within
the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section 1.368-2(g).

(b) Parent and the Company shall each use its reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code and to obtain the Tax opinions set forth in _Sections
8.2(c)_ and _8.3(c)_.

 

(c) Officers of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall execute and deliver
to Davis Polk and Wardwell LLP, tax counsel for the Company, and Baker Botts
L.L.P., tax counsel for Parent, certificates substantially in the form agreed
to by the parties and such firms at such time or times as may reasonably be
requested by such firms, in connection with such tax counsels respective
delivery of opinions pursuant to _Sections 8.2(c)_ and _8.3(c)_ hereof. Each
of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts
not to take or cause to be taken any action that would cause to be untrue (or
fail to take or cause not to be taken any action which would cause to be
untrue) any of the certifications and representations included in the
certificates described in this _Section 7.5._

 

(d) The Company and Parent shall cooperate in the preparation, execution and
filing of all Tax Returns, questionnaires, applications or other documents
regarding any real property transfer or gains, sales, use, transfer, value
added, stock transfer and stamp taxes, and transfer, recording, registration
and other fees and similar Taxes which become payable in connection with the
Merger that are required or permitted to be filed on or before the Effective
Time. The Surviving Entity shall pay, without deduction from any amount
payable to holders of Company Common Stock and without reimbursement from the
other party, any such Taxes or fees imposed on it by any Governmental Entity,
which becomes payable in connection with the Merger.

(e) Neither Parent nor Company will take (or fail to take) any action which
action (or failure to act) would reasonably be expected to cause the Merger to
fail to qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code.

 

(f) Between the date hereof and the Closing Date, the Company shall prepare
all Tax Returns for any Tax period which are required to be filed on or
before the Closing Date (taking extensions into account) using accounting
methods, principles and positions consistent with those used for prior Tax
periods, unless a change is required by applicable Law or regulation. All such
Tax Returns shall be timely filed and all related Taxes paid on or before the
Closing Date.

Section 7.6 _Reasonable Best Efforts; Filings, etc._

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement, including
the limitations set forth in  _Section 7.6(d)_, each of the parties hereto
shall, and the Company shall cause each of the Company Subsidiaries to, use
its reasonable best efforts (subject to, and in

 



58  accordance with, applicable Law) to take promptly, or to cause to be taken,
all actions, and to do promptly, or to cause to be done, and to assist and to
cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or
advisable under applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby, including (i) the obtaining of
all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, authorizations, expirations or
terminations of waiting periods, clearances, consents and approvals from
Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and
filings and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval
or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental
Entity, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary consents, approvals or waivers
from third parties, (iii) the defending of any lawsuits or other
legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging this
Agreement or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (iv)
the execution and delivery of any additional instruments reasonably necessary
to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby.

(b) Subject to _Section 7.6(c)_ and the other terms and conditions herein
provided and without limiting the foregoing, the Company and Parent shall
(and shall cause their respective Subsidiaries to):

(i) make their respective required filings (and filings considered by Parent
to be advisable after consulting with, and considering in good faith the views
of, the Company) under the HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation and any other
Regulatory Laws (and Parent shall be responsible for all filing fees incident
thereto), which filings shall be made as promptly as Parent deems advisable,
and thereafter shall promptly make any other required submissions under the
HSR Act or other such laws; without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
each party shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond to and comply
promptly with and expeditiously achieve substantial compliance with any
request for information regarding the Merger or any such filings for
any Governmental Entity charged with enforcing, applying, administering, or
investigating any Regulatory Law;

(ii) use their reasonable best efforts to cooperate with one another in (A)
determining which filings are required (or considered by Parent to be
advisable after consulting with, and considering in good faith the views of,
the Company) to be made prior to the Effective Time with, and which consents,
approvals, permits or authorizations are required to be obtained prior to the
Effective Time from, Governmental Entities in connection with the execution
and delivery of this Agreement, and the consummation of the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated hereby and (B) timely making all such filings;

(iii) promptly notify each other of any communication concerning this
Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
to that party from any Governmental Entity, it being understood that
correspondence, filings and communications received from any Governmental
Entity shall be immediately provided to the other party upon receipt, subject
in appropriate cases to appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit
disclosure to outside lawyers and consultants;

 



59 (iv) not participate or agree to participate in any meeting or
substantive discussion (including, without limitation, any discussion
relating to the antitrust merits, any potential remedies, commitments or
undertakings, the timing of any waivers, consents, approvals, permits, orders
or authorizations, and any agreement regarding the timing of consummation of
the Merger) with any Governmental Entity relating to any filings or
investigation concerning this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement unless it consults with the other party and
its representatives in advance and invites the other partys representatives
to attend, subject in appropriate cases to appropriate confidentiality
agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers and consultants, unless
the Governmental Entity prohibits such attendance;

(v) promptly furnish the other party, subject in appropriate cases
to appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside
lawyers and consultants, with draft copies prior to submission to a
Governmental Entity, with reasonable time and opportunity to comment and
consult, of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) that they, their Affiliates or their
respective representatives intend to submit to any Governmental Entity;

 

(vi) promptly furnish the other party, subject in appropriate cases to
appropriate confidentiality agreements to limit disclosure to outside lawyers
and consultants, with such necessary information and reasonable assistance as
such other party and its Affiliates may reasonably request in connection with
their preparation of necessary filings, registrations or submissions of
information to any Governmental Entity, including, without limitation, any
filings necessary or appropriate under the provisions of Regulatory Laws; and

 

(vii) deliver to the other partys outside counsel complete copies of all
documents furnished to any Governmental Entity as part of any filing, subject
to appropriate confidentiality agreements.

(c) Parent shall be entitled to direct the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement in any investigation or litigation
by, or negotiations with, any Governmental Entity or other person relating to
the Merger or regulatory filings under applicable Regulatory Law, subject to
the provisions of _Section 7.6(a)_, _Section 7.6(b)_, _Section 7.6(d)_ and
_Section 7.6(e)_ and provided that Parent shall consult with, and consider in
good faith the views of, the Company throughout the antitrust defense of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement, including by providing the Company
with reasonable opportunity to evaluate, as promptly as practicable, steps to
be taken in pursuit of such defense. The Company shall not make any offer,
acceptance or counter-offer to or otherwise engage in negotiations or
discussions with any Governmental Entity with respect to any proposed
settlement, consent decree, commitment or remedy, or, in the event of
litigation, discovery, admissibility of evidence, timing or scheduling,
except as specifically requested by or agreed with Parent. The Company shall
use its reasonable best efforts to provide full and effective support of
Parent in all material respects in all such investigations, litigation,
negotiations and discussions to the extent requested by Parent.

 



60 (d) Without limiting the foregoing, Parent and Merger Sub shall take all such
action (including any Antitrust Action) as may be necessary to resolve such
objections, if any, that the United States Federal Trade Commission, the
Antitrust Division of the United States Department of Justice, the European
Commission, state antitrust enforcement authorities or competition
authorities of any other nation or other jurisdiction, or any other Person,
may assert under Regulatory Laws with respect to the transactions contemplated
hereby, and to avoid or eliminate, and minimize the impact of, each and every
impediment under Regulatory Laws that may be asserted by any Governmental
Entity with respect to the Merger so as to enable the Closing to occur as soon
as reasonably possible (and in any event no later than the Termination
Date); provided, however, that nothing contained in this Agreement requires
Parent, Merger Sub or the Company to take, or cause to be taken, any Antitrust
Action with respect to any of the assets, businesses or product lines of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
(including the Surviving Entity), or any combination thereof, if such action
would exceed the Detriment Limit. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Antitrust
Action_ " means any action with respect to assets, businesses or product
lines, including a request that they be (x) divested or held separate or (y)
subject to conduct remedies, limitations or other actions, and the "
_Detriment Limit_ " would be exceeded if the assets, businesses or product
lines subject to Antitrust Action in order to obtain actions or nonactions,
waivers, authorizations, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,
clearances, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities under
Regulatory Laws account for more than $7.5 billion of revenue for the twelve
(12) months ended December 31, 2013. If requested by Parent, the Company will
agree to and take any action contemplated by this  _Section 7.6(d)_,
provided that the consummation of any divestiture or the effectiveness of any
other remedy is conditioned on the consummation of the Merger. The parties
hereto agree that the calculation of revenue shall be measured by reference
to the lowest such revenue of Parent or the Company for each such overlapping
asset, business or product line subject to Antitrust Action, regardless of
which asset, business or product line Parent actually selects for such
Antitrust Action. The foregoing agreement in this section is made solely to
facilitate the closing of the Merger and does not constitute a representation
or admission that the Merger, if consummated without any modification, would
violate any Regulatory Laws or that agreeing to any divestitures, hold
separate conditions or other restrictions permitted herein or suggested by any
person or authority acting under any Regulatory Law would not be harmful to
the parties hereto.

 

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
the next sentence, Parent shall have the right, but not the obligation, to
oppose or refuse to consent to, through litigation or otherwise, any request,
attempt or demand by any Governmental Entity or other person for any
divestiture, hold separate condition or any other restriction with respect to
any assets, businesses or product lines of Parent, the Company or any of
their respective Subsidiaries and shall have the obligation to defend any
litigation instituted by a Governmental Entity or other person with respect to
the legality of the Merger under applicable Regulatory Laws. In the event
Parent opposes or refuses to consent to, through litigation or otherwise,
including any appeals, any request, attempt or demand by any Governmental
Entity or other person as provided in the preceding sentence, and (i) such
proceedings conclude prior to the Termination Date with a decree, injunction
or order restricting or prohibiting the Merger or (ii) no decree, order or
injunction has been issued in such proceedings prior to the Termination Date,
then Parent shall take such actions (including Antitrust Actions) in a timely
manner, as are necessary to achieve the clearance by or approval of the
Governmental Entity or other person 

 



61  and satisfaction of the condition set forth in _Section 8.1(b)_
[Antitrust/Competition] and _Section 8.1(c)_ [Injunctions or Restraints]
(with respect to any Regulatory Law) prior to the Termination Date, provided
that Parent shall not be required to take any action that would exceed the
Detriment Limit.

(f) For purposes of this Agreement, " _Regulatory Laws_ " means the Sherman
Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade
Commission Act, as amended, the EC Merger Regulation, and all other federal,
state or foreign statutes, rules, regulations, orders, decrees,
administrative and judicial doctrines and other Applicable Laws, including
without limitation any antitrust, competition or trade regulation laws, that
are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or regulate actions having the
purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint of trade or lessening
competition through merger or acquisition.

 

(g) The parties will cooperate and use their respective reasonable efforts to
identify and comply with any so called "transaction triggered" or
"responsible property transfer" requirements under Environmental Laws that
result from the Merger.

 

Section 7.7 _Stockholder Litigation_.

 

The Company shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in, but not
control, the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the
Company or its directors or officers relating to the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that no such settlement
shall be agreed to without Parents consent (not to be unreasonably
withheld). 

Section 7.8 _Public Statements_.

 

The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall consult with each other prior to
issuing, and provide each other with the opportunity to review and comment
upon, any public announcement, statement or other disclosure with respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby and shall not issue any
such public announcement or statement prior to such consultation, except as
may be required by Law or any listing agreement with a national securities
exchange or trading market; provided that each of the Company and Parent may
make any public statements in response to questions by the press, analysts,
investors or those attending industry conferences or analyst or investor
conference calls, so long as such statements are not inconsistent with
previous statements made jointly by the Company and Parent. In addition, the
Company shall, to the extent reasonably practicable and except for any public
disclosure under _Section 7.11_ or _Section 7.12_, consult with Parent
regarding the form and content of any public disclosure of any material
developments or matters involving the Company, including earnings releases,
reasonably in advance of publication or release. The Company and Parent agree
to issue a joint press release announcing the execution and delivery of this
Agreement.

 

Section 7.9 _Notification of Certain Matters_.

 

The Company agrees to give prompt notice to Parent and Merger Sub, and to use
commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, the occurrence
or failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or failure to
occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be reasonably
likely to cause the failure of any of the 

 



62  conditions set forth in _Section 8.2_; provided, however, that the delivery
of any notice pursuant to this _Section 7.9_ shall not limit or otherwise
affect the remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.
Each of Parent and Merger Sub agrees to give prompt notice to the Company, and
to use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, the
occurrence or failure to occur, or the impending or threatened occurrence or
failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be
reasonably likely to cause the failure of any of the conditions set forth in
_Section 8.3_; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant
to this _Section 7.9_ shall not limit or otherwise affect the remedies
available hereunder to the party receiving such notice.

 

Section 7.10 _Access; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) From the date hereof until the Effective Time and subject to the
requirements of applicable Laws, the Company and Parent shall each (i) give
to the other party, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors, potential
Financing Sources and other consultants and authorized representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours to the offices, properties,
books and records of such party and its Subsidiaries, (ii) furnish to the
other party, its counsel, financial advisors, auditors, potential Financing
Sources, and other consultants and authorized representatives such financial
and operating data and other information as such Persons may reasonably
request, and (iii) instruct its and its Subsidiaries employees, counsel,
financial advisors, auditors and other authorized representatives to cooperate
reasonably with the other party in its investigation of such party and such
partys Subsidiaries (including, but not limited to, in the case of clauses
(i)-(iii), for the purpose of ensuring that the business conducted by the
Company complies with, and does not raise material liability risks under,
applicable Laws, including, without limitation, Anti-Corruption Laws), except
that nothing herein shall require any party to disclose any information that
would cause a risk of a loss of privilege to such party or its Subsidiaries.
Notwithstanding the above, no party nor its representatives shall have the
right to conduct environmental sampling on any of the properties owned or
operated by the other party or its Subsidiaries. Any investigation pursuant to
this  _Section 7.10(a)_ shall be conducted in such manner as not to
interfere unreasonably with the conduct of the business of any party or its
Subsidiaries. The cooperation provisions of this paragraph extend fully to all
overseas business, joint venture, and subsidiary locations. In addition, each
of the Company and Parent agree to use their reasonable best efforts to
facilitate meetings with joint venture partners, agents, representatives,
consultants, customs brokers, and other third parties that the other party or
its counsel determine may be relevant to due diligence. Each of Parent and the
Company shall have the right, in its sole discretion to have a representative
present for investigations, interviews and visits. 

(b) Prior to the mailing of the Proxy/Prospectus to the Companys stockholders
and within one week of the Closing, Parent shall provide the Company a
reasonable opportunity to meet with the executive officers of the Parent to
conduct reasonable due diligence to confirm whether any statement in such
Proxy/Prospectus, in light of the circumstances in which it was made, is
not false or misleading with respect to a material fact or does not omit to
state a material fact necessary to make the statements made in the
Proxy/Prospectus not misleading.

 



63 (c) Each of Parent and the Company shall, until the earlier of the Effective
Time and the eighteen (18) month anniversary of the termination of this
Agreement, hold, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to hold, in confidence, unless compelled to disclose by Law,
all confidential documents and information concerning the other party
furnished or otherwise made available to it or its Affiliates in connection
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including, for the
avoidance of doubt, the Company Disclosure Letter and Parent Disclosure
Letter, as applicable), except to the extent that such information can be
shown to have been (i) previously known on a nonconfidential basis by such
party, (ii) in the public domain through no fault of such party or (iii)
later lawfully acquired by such party from sources other than the other party;
provided that each of Parent and the Company may disclose such information to
its Representatives in connection with the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement so long as such party informs such Persons of the confidential
nature of such information and directs them to treat it confidentially. Each
of Parent and the Company shall satisfy its obligation to hold any such
information in confidence if it exercises the same care with respect to such
information as it would take to preserve the confidentiality of its own
similar information. If this Agreement is terminated, each of Parent and the
Company shall, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its
Representatives to, destroy or deliver to the other party, upon request, all
documents and other materials, and all copies thereof, that it or its
Affiliates obtained, or that were obtained on their behalf, from the other
party in connection with this Agreement and that are subject to such
confidence. " _Law_ " for purposes of this _Section 7.10(c)_ shall include
the rules of any national securities exchange.

 

(d) Nothing in this _Section 7.10_ shall require either party to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of such party would (i) violate any of its respective obligations with respect
to confidentiality or (ii) result in a violation of applicable Law or loss of
privilege. Each party shall use reasonable efforts to make reasonable and
appropriate substitute disclosure arrangements under circumstances in which
the restrictions of the preceding sentence apply.

 

(e) No investigation by and of the parties or their respective Representatives
made pursuant to this _Section 7.10_ shall modify, nullify, amend or
otherwise affect the representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of
the other set forth in this Agreement.

 

Section 7.11 _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.11(b)_, the Company agrees that from and after the
date of this Agreement, it shall (i) immediately cease and terminate, and
cause to be ceased and terminated, all of its and its Representatives
discussions and negotiations with any other Person (other than Parent or its
Affiliates) regarding any Company Alternative Proposal (as
hereinafter defined), (ii) promptly request, and cause to be requested that,
each Person that has received confidential information in connection with a
possible Company Alternative Proposal within the last twelve (12) months
return to the Company or destroy all confidential information heretofore
furnished to such Person by or on behalf of the Company and Company
Subsidiaries and (iii) not grant any waiver or release under or knowingly fail
to enforce any confidentiality, standstill or similar agreement entered into
or amended during the twelve (12) months prior to the date hereof in respect
of a proposed Company Alternative Proposal (such agreement, a " _Company
Standstill Agreement_ ") unless the Board of the Company concludes in good
faith that a failure to take any

 



64  action described in this clause (iii) would reasonably likely be
inconsistent with the directors fiduciary obligations to the Companys
stockholders under applicable Law. From and after the date of this Agreement,
subject to _Section 7.11(b)_ and _Section 9.3(b)_, the Company shall not,
directly or indirectly, nor shall the Company authorize or permit any Company
Subsidiary or any of its or their respective directors, officers, members,
employees, representatives, agents, attorneys, consultants, contractors,
accountants, financial advisors and other advisors (a " _Representative_ ")
to, (i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by
way of furnishing information), or engage in discussions or negotiations
regarding, any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or
announcement of any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any inquiry,
proposal or offer to its stockholders) which constitutes or would be
reasonably expected to lead to a Company Alternative Proposal, (ii) except for
confidentiality agreements entered into pursuant to the proviso to the first
sentence of _Section 7.11(b)_ or a definitive agreement entered into or to
be entered into concurrently with a termination of this Agreement by the
Company pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_, approve or enter into a letter of
intent, memorandum of understanding or other contract with any Person, other
than Parent and Merger Sub, for, constituting or otherwise relating to a
Company Alternative Proposal, (iii) provide or cause to be provided any
information or data relating to the Company or any Company Subsidiary in
connection with, or in response to, any Company Alternative Proposal by any
Person, or (iv) terminate, amend, waive or permit the waiver of any voting
restriction contained in the organizational or governing documents of the
Company, or take any action contemplated by paragraph (a)(1) of Section 203 of
the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company
acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any officer, director or financial
advisor of the Company takes any action that if taken by the Company would be
a breach of this _Section 7.11_, the taking of such action by such officer,
director or financial advisor shall be deemed to constitute a breach of this
_Section 7.11_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.11(a)_, the Company and
its Representatives shall be entitled, prior to obtaining the Required
Company Vote, to furnish information regarding the Company and any Company
Subsidiary to, or engage in discussions or negotiations with, any Person in
response to an unsolicited, bona fide, written third party proposal with
respect to a Company Alternative Proposal that is submitted to the Company by
such Person (for so long as such Company Alternative Proposal has not been
withdrawn) if (i) none of the Company, the Representatives of the Company,
the Company Subsidiaries or the Representatives of the Company Subsidiaries
shall have breached the provisions set forth in this _Section 7.11_ in any
material respect with respect to such Person, and (ii) the Board of the
Company shall have determined, in its good faith judgment, after consultation
with the Companys financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that the
proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal (as hereinafter defined); provided that the Company may not enter
into negotiations or discussions or supply any information in connection with
a Company Alternative Proposal without entering into a confidentiality
agreement, which confidentiality agreement may allow such third party to make
Alternative Proposals to the Company in connection with the negotiations and
discussions permitted by this _Section 7.11(b)_. Parent shall be entitled to
receive an executed copy of any such confidentiality agreement and
notification of the identity of such Person promptly (and in any event within
twenty-four (24) hours) after the Companys entering into such discussions or
negotiations or furnishing information to the Person making such Company
Alternative Proposal or its Representatives. The Company shall promptly
provide or make available to Parent any non-

 



65  public information concerning the Company and any Company Subsidiary that is
provided to the Person making such Company Alternative Proposal or its
Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to
Parent. The Company agrees that it shall notify Parent promptly (and in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt) if any inquiry, contact or
proposal related to a Company Alternative Proposal is received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, the Company, the Company
Subsidiaries, any of its Representatives, or any Representatives of the
Company Subsidiaries, and thereafter shall keep Parent informed in writing,
on a reasonably current basis, of all material developments regarding the
status of any such inquiry, contact or proposal and the status of any such
negotiations or discussions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
prevent the Board of the Company from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the
Exchange Act with respect to a Company Alternative Proposal or from making any
similar disclosure; provided, however, that any disclosure by the Company
that relates to a Company Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be a Company
Change in Recommendation unless the Board of the Company reaffirms the Company
Board Recommendation in such disclosure.

 

(c) Neither the Board of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), or propose to
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval,
recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of the Company or
any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve any Company
Alternative Proposal, (C) fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in
the Proxy/Prospectus or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Company Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii) (A) recommend, adopt or approve,
or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, or allow the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent,
memorandum of understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement,
acquisition agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership
agreement or other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is
intended to or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Company
Alternative Proposal or that would require the Company to abandon, terminate
or fail to consummate the Merger (other than a confidentiality agreement
referred to in _Section 7.11(b)_) (a " _Company Acquisition Agreement_ ") or
(B) resolve, agree or propose to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, if, prior to obtaining the
Required Company Vote, the Board of the Company determines in good faith
(after consultation with its outside counsel and financial advisors) that the
failure to do so would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law, it may (A)
terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section 9.3(b)_ and cause the Company
to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Company
Superior Proposal or (B) make a Company Change in Recommendation in connection
with a Company Superior Proposal, but in the case of (1) Section
7.11(c)(ii)(A), only if such Company Superior Proposal has not resulted from
a breach of its obligations pursuant to this Section 7.11, and (2) Section
7.11(c)(ii)(A) or (B) only if (x) the Company provides written notice to
Parent (a " _Company Notice of Change in Recommendation_ ") advising Parent
that the Board of the Company intends to take such action and specifying the
reasons therefor, including the terms and conditions of such Company Superior
Proposal, the identity of the Person making the Company Superior

 



66  Proposal and copies of all relevant documents relating to such Company
Superior Proposal that the Company has received from the Person or its
representatives that made such proposal and that are the basis of the
proposed action by the Board of the Company, including a copy of the proposed
Company Acquisition Agreement (if any) (it being understood and agreed that
any amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such
Company Superior Proposal shall require a new Company Notice of Change in
Recommendation and compliance with the requirements of this _Section
7.11(c)_); (y) during a period of four (4) Business Days following Parents
receipt of a Company Notice of Change in Recommendation (or, in the event of
a new Company Notice of Change in Recommendation as a result of any such
amendment, an extension of two (2) additional Business Days), if requested by
Parent, the Company and its Representatives shall have negotiated with Parent
and its Representatives in good faith to make such revisions or adjustments
proposed by Parent to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would
enable the Company to proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and
the Merger and not to make such Company Change in Recommendation; and (z) if
applicable, at the end of such applicable 4- or 2-Business Day period, the
Board of the Company, after considering in good faith any such revisions or
adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent, prior
to the expiration of such applicable period, shall have offered in writing in
a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted by the
Company, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisors) that the Company Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Company Superior Proposal and that failure to make such Company
Change in Recommendation would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law.

(d) Other than in connection with a Company Alternative Proposal, the Company
may, at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Required Company Vote,
make a Company Change in Recommendation in response to a Company Intervening
Event (a " _Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation_ ") if the
failure to take such action would likely be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board of the Company to the Companys stockholders under
applicable Law, provided, that: (A) Parent shall have received written notice
from the Company (a " _Company Notice of Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation_ ") of the Companys intention to make a Company Intervening
Event Change in Recommendation at least four (4) Business Days prior to the
taking of such action by the Company, which notice shall specify the
applicable Company Intervening Event in reasonable detail, (B) during such
period and prior to making a Company Intervening Event Change in
Recommendation, if requested by Parent, the Company and its Representatives
shall have negotiated in good faith with Parent and its Representatives
regarding any revisions or adjustments proposed by Parent to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement as would enable the Company to proceed with its
recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and not make such Company
Intervening Event Change in Recommendation and (C) the Company may make a
Company Intervening Event Change in Recommendation only if the Board of the
Company, after considering in good faith any revisions or adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement that Parent shall have, prior to the
expiration of the 4-Business Day period, offered in writing in a manner that
would form a binding contract if accepted by the Company, continues to
determine in good faith that failure to make a Company Intervening Event
Change in Recommendation would likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties to the Companys stockholders under applicable Law. A " _Company
Intervening Event_ " shall mean any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event,
development, change or condition or combination thereof 

 



67  that (i) was not known to the Board of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement (or if known, the consequences or magnitude of which were not known
or reasonably foreseeable) and (ii) does not relate to (A) any Company
Alternative Proposal or (B) clearance of the Merger under the HSR Act, the EC
Merger Regulation or any other Regulatory Law, including any action in
connection therewith taken pursuant to or required to be taken pursuant to
_Section 7.6_; provided, however, that (1) any change in the price or trading
volume of Company Common Stock or Parent Common Stock shall not be taken into
account for purposes of determining whether a Company Intervening Event has
occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any underlying cause thereof
may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Company
Intervening Event has occurred); (2) in no event shall any
fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or
combination thereof that has had or would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the business or financial condition of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries constitute a Company Intervening Event unless such event, fact,
circumstance or development constitutes a Parent Material Adverse Effect; and
(3) the Company or Parent meeting, failing to meet or exceeding projections
shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Company
Intervening Event has occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any
underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether a Company Intervening Event has occurred).

 

(e) As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Company Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide proposal or
offer from any Person or group of Persons other than Parent or any of the
Parent Subsidiaries or any group of which Parent or any of the Parent
Subsidiaries is a member (A) for a merger, reorganization, consolidation,
share exchange, business combination, recapitalization, liquidation,
dissolution or any similar transaction or series of transactions involving the
Company (or any Company Subsidiary or Subsidiaries whose business constitutes
15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of the Company and
the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (B) for the issuance by the
Company of 15% or more of its equity securities or (C) to acquire in any
manner, directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the equity securities or
consolidated total assets of the Company or 15% or more of the aggregate
equity securities of the Company Subsidiaries, in each case other than the
Merger.

 

(ii) " _Company Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Company Alternative
Proposal (A) which provides that 100% of the Companys outstanding equity
securities shall be converted into, exchanged for or otherwise canceled in
exchange for the right to receive consideration that does not constitute 50%
or more of the outstanding equity securities of the acquiring or surviving
entity or its ultimate parent or (B) providing for the sale of all or
substantially all of the Companys assets, in either case on terms which the
Board of the Company determines in its good faith judgment,
after consultation with the Companys outside counsel and financial advisors,
would, if consummated, result in a transaction more favorable from a financial
point of view to the holders of Company Common Stock than the Merger (or any
bona fide written offer or proposal made by Parent in response to such
Company Alternative Proposal or

 



68  otherwise), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such
Alternative Proposal and this Agreement (including any conditions to and
expected timing of consummation thereof, and all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of such Company Alternative Proposal and this Agreement).

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth in this _Section
7.11_ shall not apply to any action taken by or on behalf of the Company in
connection with its obligations under _Section 7.6(d)_.

 

Section 7.12 _No Solicitation by Parent._

 

(a) Subject to _Section 7.12(b)_, Parent agrees that from and after the date
of this Agreement, it shall (i) immediately cease and terminate, and cause to
be ceased and terminated, all of its and its Representatives discussions and
negotiations with any other Person (other than the Company or its Affiliates)
regarding any Parent Alternative Proposal (as hereinafter defined), (ii)
promptly request, and cause to be requested that, each Person that has
received confidential information in connection with a possible Parent
Alternative Proposal within the last twelve (12) months return to Parent
or destroy all confidential information heretofore furnished to such Person
by or on behalf of Parent and its Subsidiaries and (iii) not grant any waiver
or release under or knowingly fail to enforce any confidentiality, standstill
or similar agreement entered into or amended during the twelve (12) months
prior to the date hereof in respect of a proposed Parent Alternative Proposal
(such agreement, a " _Parent Standstill Agreement_ ") the Parent Board
concludes in good faith that a failure to take any action described in this
clause (iii) would reasonably likely be inconsistent with the directors
fiduciary obligations to Parents stockholders under applicable Law. From and
after the date of this Agreement, subject to _Section 7.12(b)_ and _Section
9.4(b)_, Parent shall not, directly or indirectly, nor shall Parent authorize
or permit any of its Subsidiaries or any of its Representatives to, (i)
solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage or facilitate (including by way of
furnishing information), or engage in discussions or negotiations regarding,
any inquiry, proposal or offer, or the making, submission or announcement of
any inquiry, proposal or offer (including any inquiry, proposal or offer to
its stockholders) which constitutes or would be reasonably expected to lead to
a Parent Alternative Proposal, (ii) except for confidentiality agreements
entered into pursuant to the proviso to the first sentence of _Section
7.12(b)_ or a definitive agreement entered into or to be entered into
concurrently with a termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.4(b)_, approve or enter into a letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding or other contract with any Person, other than the Company, for,
constituting or otherwise relating to a Parent Alternative Proposal, (iii)
provide or cause to be provided any information or data relating to Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with, or in response to, any Parent
Alternative Proposal by any Person, or (iv) terminate, amend, waive or permit
the waiver of any voting restriction contained in the organizational or
governing documents of Parent, or take any action contemplated by paragraph
(a)(1) of Section 203 of the DGCL. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, Parent acknowledges and agrees that, in the event any officer,
director or financial advisor of Parent takes any action that if taken by
Parent would be a breach of this _Section 7.12_, the taking of such action by
such officer, director or financial advisor shall be deemed to constitute a
breach of this _Section 7.12_ by Parent. 

 



69 (b) Notwithstanding the provisions of _Section 7.12(a)_, Parent and its
Representatives shall be entitled, prior to obtaining the Required Parent
Vote, to furnish information regarding Parent and its Subsidiaries to, or
engage in discussions or negotiations with, any Person in response to an
unsolicited, bona fide, written third party proposal with respect to a Parent
Alternative Proposal that is submitted to Parent by such Person (for so long
as such Parent Alternative Proposal has not been withdrawn) if (i) none of
Parent, the Representatives of Parent, the Subsidiaries of Parent or the
Representatives of Subsidiaries of the Parent shall have breached the
provisions set forth in this _Section 7.12_ in any material respect with
respect to such Person, and (ii) the Board of Parent shall have
determined, in its good faith judgment, after consultation with Parents
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the proposal constitutes or
is reasonably likely to lead to a Parent Superior Proposal (as hereinafter
defined); provided that Parent may not enter into negotiations or discussions
or supply any information in connection with a Parent Alternative Proposal
without entering into a confidentiality agreement, which confidentiality
agreement may allow such third party to make Alternative Proposals to Parent
in connection with the negotiations and discussions permitted by this _Section
7.12(b)_. The Company shall be entitled to receive an executed copy of any
such confidentiality agreement and notification of the identity of such
Person promptly (and in any event within twenty-four (24) hours) after
Parents entering into such discussions or negotiations or furnishing
information to the Person making such Parent Alternative Proposal or
its Representatives. Parent shall promptly provide or make available to the
Company any non-public information concerning Parent and any Subsidiary of
Parent that is provided to the Person making such Parent Alternative Proposal
or its Representatives which was not previously provided or made available to
the Company. Parent agrees that it shall notify Parent promptly (and in any
event within forty-eight (48) hours of receipt) if any inquiry, contact or
proposal related to a Parent Alternative Proposal is received by, any such
information is requested from, or any such discussions or negotiations are
sought to be initiated or continued with, Parent, the Subsidiaries of Parent,
any of its Representatives, or any Representatives of the Subsidiaries of
Parent, and thereafter shall keep the Company informed in writing, on a
reasonably current basis, of all material developments regarding the status of
any such inquiry, contact or proposal and the status of any such negotiations
or discussions. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Board of
Parent from complying with Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect to a
Parent Alternative Proposal or from making any similar disclosure;
provided, however, that any such disclosure that relates to a Parent
Alternative Proposal shall be deemed to be a Parent Change in Recommendation
unless the Board of Parent reaffirms the Parent Board Recommendation in such
disclosure.

 

(c) Neither the Board of Parent nor any committee thereof shall (i) (A)
withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Company), or
propose to withdraw (or qualify or modify in a manner adverse to the Company),
the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of
Parent or any such committee thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or any
other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, (B) recommend, adopt or
approve, or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve any Parent
Alternative Proposal, (C) fail to include the Parent Board Recommendation in
the Proxy/Prospectus or (D) resolve, propose or agree to do any of the
foregoing (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as a "
_Parent Change in Recommendation_ ") or (ii) (A) recommend, adopt or approve,
or propose publicly to recommend, adopt or approve, or allow Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of

 



70  understanding, agreement in principle, merger agreement, acquisition
agreement, option agreement, joint venture agreement, partnership agreement or
other similar agreement constituting or related to, or that is intended to or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Parent Alternative Proposal or
that would require the Parent to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the
Merger (other than a confidentiality agreement referred to in  _Section
7.12(b)_) (a " _Parent Acquisition Agreement_ ") or (B) resolve, agree or
propose to do any of the foregoing. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, if, prior to obtaining the Required Parent Vote, the Board
of Parent determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside
counsel and financial advisors) that the failure to do so would reasonably
likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to the Parents
stockholders under applicable Law, it may (A) terminate this Agreement
pursuant to _Section 9.4(b)_ and cause Parent to enter into a Parent
Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Parent Superior Proposal or (B) make a
Parent Change in Recommendation in connection with a Parent Superior
Proposal, but in the case of (1) Section 7.12(c)(ii)(A), only if such Parent
Superior Proposal has not resulted from a breach of its obligations pursuant
to this Section 7.12, and (2) Section 7.12(c)(ii)(A) or (B) only if (x)
Parent provides written notice to the Company (a " _Parent Notice of Change in
Recommendation_ ") advising the Company that the Board of Parent intends to
take such action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the terms and
conditions of such Parent Superior Proposal, the identity of the Person making
the Parent Superior Proposal and copies of all relevant documents relating to
such Parent Superior Proposal that Parent has received from the Person or its
representatives that made such proposal and that are the basis of the proposed
action by the Board of Parent, including a copy of the proposed Parent
Acquisition Agreement (if any) (it being understood and agreed that any
amendment to the financial terms or other material terms of such Parent
Superior Proposal shall require a new Parent Notice of Change in
Recommendation and compliance with the requirements of this  _Section
7.12(c)_); (y) during a period of four (4) Business Days following the
Companys receipt of a Parent Notice of Change in Recommendation (or, in the
event of a new Parent Notice of Change in Recommendation as a result of any
such amendment, an extension of two (2) additional Business Days), if
requested by the Company, Parent and its Representatives shall have negotiated
with the Company and its Representatives in good faith to make such revisions
or adjustments proposed by the Company to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed with its recommendation of this
Agreement and the Merger and not to make such Parent Change in Recommendation;
and (z) if applicable, at the end of such applicable 4- or 2-Business Day
period, the Board of Parent, after considering in good faith any such
revisions or adjustments to the terms and conditions of this Agreement that
the Company, prior to the expiration of such applicable period, shall have
offered in writing in a manner that would form a binding contract if accepted
by Parent, continues to determine in good faith (after consultation with its
outside counsel and financial advisors) that the Parent Alternative Proposal
constitutes a Parent Superior Proposal and that failure to make such Parent
Change in Recommendation would reasonably likely be inconsistent with its
fiduciary duties to the Parents stockholders under applicable Law.

 

(d) Other than in connection with a Parent Alternative Proposal, Parent may,
at any time prior to, but not after, obtaining the Required Company Vote,
make a Parent Change in Recommendation in response to a Parent Intervening
Event (a " _Parent Intervening Event Change in Recommendation_ ") if the
failure to take such action would likely be inconsistent with the fiduciary
duties of the Board of Parent to Parents stockholders under applicable Law,
provided, that: (A) the Company shall have received written notice from Parent
(a " _Parent Notice_  

 



71   _of Intervening Event Change in Recommendation_ ") of Parents intention to
make a Parent Intervening Event Change in Recommendation at least four (4)
Business Days prior to the taking of such action by Parent, which notice
shall specify the applicable Parent Intervening Event in reasonable detail,
(B) during such period and prior to making a Parent Intervening Event Change
in Recommendation, if requested by the Company, Parent and its
Representatives shall have negotiated in good faith with the Company and its
Representatives regarding any revisions or adjustments proposed by the Company
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement as would enable Parent to
proceed with its recommendation of this Agreement and the Merger and not make
such Parent Intervening Event Change in Recommendation and (C) Parent may make
a Parent Intervening Event Change in Recommendation only if the Board of
Parent, after considering in good faith any revisions or adjustments to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement that the Company shall have, prior to
the expiration of the 4-Business Day period, offered in writing in a manner
that would form a binding contract if accepted by Parent, continues to
determine in good faith that failure to make a Parent Intervening Event Change
in Recommendation would likely be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties to
Parents stockholders under applicable Law. A " _Parent Intervening Event_ "
shall mean any fact, circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or
condition or combination thereof that (i) was not known to the Board of Parent
as of the date of this Agreement (or if known, the consequences or magnitude
of which were not known or reasonably foreseeable) and (ii) does not relate to
(A) any Parent Alternative Proposal or (B) clearance of the Merger under the
HSR Act, the EC Merger Regulation or any other Regulatory Law, including any
action in connection therewith taken pursuant to or required to be taken
pursuant to Section 7.6; provided, however, that (1) any change in the price
or trading volume of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock shall not be
taken into account for purposes of determining whether a Parent Intervening
Event has occurred (it being acknowledged, however, that any underlying cause
thereof may be taken into account for purposes of determining whether a
Parent Intervening Event has occurred); (2) in no event shall any fact,
circumstance, occurrence, event, development, change or condition or
combination thereof that has had or would reasonably be expected to have an
adverse effect on the business or financial condition of the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries constitute a Parent Intervening Event unless such event,
fact, circumstance or development constitutes a Company Material Adverse
Effect; and (3) Parent or the Company meeting, failing to meet or exceeding
projections shall not be taken into account for purposes of determining
whether a Parent Intervening Event has occurred (it being acknowledged,
however, that any underlying cause thereof may be taken into account for
purposes of determining whether a Parent Intervening Event has occurred).

(e) As used in this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Parent Alternative Proposal_ " shall mean any bona fide proposal or
offer from any Person or group of Persons (A) for a merger, reorganization,
consolidation, share exchange, business combination, recapitalization,
liquidation, dissolution or any similar transaction or series of transactions
involving Parent (or any Parent Subsidiary or Subsidiaries whose business
constitutes 15% or more of the net revenues, net income or assets of Parent
and Parent Subsidiaries, taken as a whole), (B) for the issuance by Parent of
15% or more of its equity securities or (C) to acquire in any manner,
directly or indirectly, 15% or more of the equity securities or consolidated
total assets of Parent or 15% or more of the aggregate equity securities of
the Parent Subsidiaries, in each case other than the Merger.

 



72 (ii) " _Parent Superior Proposal_ " shall mean any Parent Alternative
Proposal (A) which provides that 100% of Parents outstanding equity
securities shall be converted into, exchanged for or otherwise canceled in
exchange for the right to receive consideration that does not constitute 50%
or more of the outstanding equity securities of the acquiring or surviving
entity or its ultimate parent or (B) providing for the sale of all or
substantially all of Parents assets, in either case on terms which the Board
of the Parent determines in its good faith judgment, after consultation with
Parents outside counsel and financial advisors, would, if consummated, result
in a transaction more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders
of Parent Common Stock than the Merger (or any bona fide written offer or
proposal made by the Company in response to such Parent Alternative Proposal
or otherwise), taking into account all the terms and conditions of such Parent
Alternative Proposal and this Agreement (including any conditions to and
expected timing of consummation thereof, and all legal, financial and
regulatory aspects of such Parent Alternative Proposal and this Agreement).

 

(f) For the avoidance of doubt, the restrictions set forth in this _Section
7.12_ shall not apply to any action taken by or on behalf of Parent in
connection with its obligations under _Section 7.6_.

Section 7.13 _Indemnification and Insurance._  

(a) All rights to indemnification existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers and employees of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
(the " _Indemnified Persons_ ") as provided in the organizational and
governing documents of the Company and Company Subsidiaries or under
indemnification agreements between Indemnified Persons and the Company
and Company Subsidiaries, in each case as in effect as of the date of this
Agreement with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Indemnification Obligations_ ") shall survive the Merger and shall continue
in full force and effect as obligations of the Surviving Entity for a period
of not less than six (6) years after the Effective Time unless otherwise
required by Law, provided that all rights to indemnification in respect of any
claim asserted or made during such period shall continue until the final
disposition of such claim. Parent guarantees the full performance of the
Indemnification Obligations by the Surviving Entity.

 

(b) The Company may prior to Closing obtain and fully pay for "tail" insurance
policies for the Persons who, as of the date of this Agreement or as of the
Closing Date, are covered by the Companys existing directors and officers
liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance with respect to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (including in
connection with this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated
hereby); provided, that in no event shall the Company expend an amount
pursuant to this _Section 7.13(b)_ in excess of 300% of the current
annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage in the aggregate
set forth on Schedule 7.13(b) of the Company

 



73  Disclosure Letter. If for any reason the Company does not obtain and fully
pay for such "tail" insurance policies prior to the Closing, Parent or the
Surviving Entity shall maintain director and officer liability insurance
policies from a reputable and financially sound carrier through and including
the date six (6) years after the Effective Time with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that existed or occurred prior to or at the Effective
Time (including in connection with this Agreement or the transactions or
actions contemplated hereby) and such policies shall contain coverage that is
at least as favorable to the Persons covered by such existing policies (a
complete and accurate copy of which has been made available to Parent);
provided, that in no event shall Parent or the Surviving Entity be required to
expend an amount pursuant to this _Section 7.13(b)_ in excess of 300% of
the current annual premium paid by the Company for its existing coverage in
the aggregate and if such comparable coverage cannot be obtained by paying an
aggregate premium equal to or below 300% of the current annual premium, the
Surviving Entity shall only be required to maintain as much coverage as can
be maintained by paying an aggregate premium equal to 300% of such amount.

(c) This  _Section 7.13_ shall survive the consummation of the Merger and is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person
(notwithstanding that such Persons are not parties to this Agreement) and
their respective heirs and legal representatives. The indemnification
provided for herein shall not be deemed exclusive of any other rights to which
an Indemnified Person is entitled, whether pursuant to Law, contract or
otherwise. If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity resulting
from such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all
of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or
the Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall assume the
applicable obligations set forth in this _Section 7.13_.

(d) Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed to or
shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company and Company Subsidiaries or their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents or fiduciaries under any Company Benefit Plan,
it being understood and agreed that the indemnification provided for in this
_Section 7.13_ is not prior to or in substitution for any such claims under
any such policies.

 

Section 7.14 _Dividend Record Dates._

 

The Company shall coordinate with Parent to designate the record dates and
payment dates for the Companys quarterly dividends to coincide with the
record dates and payment dates for Parents quarterly dividends, it being the
intention of the parties that holders of Parent Common Stock and Company
Common Stock shall not receive two dividends, or fail to receive one dividend,
for any single calendar quarter with respect to their Parent Common Stock and
Company Common Stock.

 



74 Section 7.15 _State Takeover Laws._

 

If any "fair price," "moratorium," "control share acquisition," "business
combination" or other takeover statute or similar statute or regulation,
applies to this Agreement and the Merger or the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, each of Parent, Merger Sub and the Company, as
the case may be, shall (a) take all reasonable action to ensure that such
transactions may be consummated as promptly as practicable upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and (b) otherwise act to
eliminate the effects of such takeover statute, Law or regulation.

Section 7.16 _Financing Cooperation._

 

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause the Company Subsidiaries to, use its
and their commercially reasonable efforts to provide such cooperation as may
be reasonably requested by Parent in connection with the arrangement of any
financing to be consummated in connection with the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement (provided that such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the ongoing
operations of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries); provided that until
the Effective Time, the Company shall (i) have no liability or any obligation
under any agreement or document related to the financing and (ii) not be
required to incur any other Liability in connection with the financing unless
simultaneously reimbursed or reasonably satisfactorily indemnified by Parent.

 

(b) Parent shall (i) promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the
Company for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs and expenses
(including reasonable attorneys fees) incurred by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries in connection with providing the assistance contemplated by this
_Section 7.16_ and (ii) indemnify and hold harmless the Company and the
Company Subsidiaries and its and their Representatives from and against any
losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered or incurred in connection
with the Financing or any assistance or activities in connection therewith.

proposed or publicly disclosed prior to, and not withdrawn at least ten (10)
days prior to, the Company Special Meeting and thereafter this Agreement is
terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to _Section 9.2(c)_ [Required

respect thereof pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Company shall
pay to Parent all of the Expenses of Parent and Merger Sub.

of this Agreement and all other matters related to the Merger; provided,
however, that in no event shall Expenses payable hereunder by the Company
exceed $40 million in the aggregate.

 

For purposes of this _Section 9.5_, the term " _Company Alternative Proposal_

(b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of _Section
9.5(a)_ shall be made to Parent promptly following the earlier of the

Company of notice of demand for payment); and in each case such payment shall
be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
details of Parent provided in writing by Parent to the Company for such
purposes. Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (vi) of _Section

Days after delivery to Parent of notice of demand for payment) and shall be
made to the Company concurrently with, and as a condition to the
effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.2(d) _[Required Parent Vote]; any payment required to be made
pursuant to clause (viii) of _Section 9.5(a)_ shall be made to the Company
promptly following termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
_Section 9.2(b)_ [Injunction] (and in any event not later than three (3)
Business Days after delivery to Parent of notice of demand for payment) and
shall be made to the Company concurrently with, and as a condition to the
effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to
_Section 9.2(b)_ [Injunction]; any payment required to be made pursuant
to clause (ix) of _Section 9.5(a)_ shall be made to the Company promptly
following termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to _Section
9.2(a)_ [Termination Date] or _9.3(a)_ [Breach/Failure to Perform] (and in
any event not later than three (3) Business Days after delivery to Parent of
notice of demand for payment) and shall be made to the Company currently with,
and as a condition to the effectiveness of, the termination of this Agreement
by Parent pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_ [Termination Date]; and, in each
case, such payment shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the account details of the Company provided in writing by the Company
to Parent for such purposes. In circumstances where this _Section 9.5_
requires a reimbursement of Expenses, the Company shall reimburse Parent and
Merger Sub for such Expenses on the later of (i) the day that is three (3)
Business Days after the date of termination of this Agreement and (ii) the
day that is three (3) Business Days after the delivery of documentation of
such Expenses, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account
details of the Company provided in writing by the Company to Parent for such
purposes or the account details of Parent provided in writing by Parent to the
Company for such purposes, as applicable.

 

(c) In the event that the Company or Parent, as the case may be, shall fail to
pay the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Antitrust
Termination Fee, as applicable, and/or Expenses required pursuant to this
_Section 9.5_ when due, such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may be, shall
accrue interest for the period commencing on the date such fee
and/or Expenses, as the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the
rate of interest

 



82  publicly announced by JPMorgan Chase Bank. N.A., in the City of New York
from time to time during such period, as such banks Prime Lending Rate. In
addition, if either party shall fail to pay such fee and/or Expenses, as the
case may be, when due, such party shall also pay to the other party all of
such other partys costs and expenses (including attorneys fees) in
connection with efforts to collect such fee and/or Expenses, as the case may
be.

(d) Parent and the Company acknowledge that the fees, Expense reimbursement
and the other provisions of this  _Section 9.5_ are an integral part of this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these
agreements, Parent and the Company would not enter into this Agreement. Each
of the parties hereto acknowledges that none of the Company Termination Fee,
the Parent Termination Fee or the Antitrust Termination Fee is a penalty, but
rather a reasonable amount that will compensate Parent and Merger Sub, or the
Company, as the case may be, for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, which amount would otherwise be impossible to calculate
with precision. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement,
the parties agree that in circumstances where payment of the Company
Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the Antitrust Termination Fee
is required hereunder, upon such payment, the payment of any such Company
Termination Fee, Parent Termination Fee or Antitrust Termination Fee in
accordance with this _Section 9.5_, shall be the exclusive remedy of the
Parent and Merger Sub or the Company, as the case may be, for (i) any loss
suffered as a result of the failure of the Merger to be consummated and (ii)
any other losses, damages, obligations or liabilities suffered as a result of
or under this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby. Upon
payment of the Company Termination Fee, the Parent Termination Fee or the
Antitrust Termination Fee in accordance with this _Section 9.5_, none of the
Company or Parent or any of their respective stockholders, partners, members,
directors, Affiliates, officers or agents, as the case may be, shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(e) If this Agreement is terminated in accordance with _Sections 9.1_ through
_9.4_ , this Agreement shall forthwith become null and void and, except as
set forth in this _Section 9.5_, there shall be no liability or obligation on
the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or their respective Affiliates or
Representatives, provided that (i) _Sections 4.10_ ,  _5.9_ , _7.3(h)_ ,
_7.10(c)_ and _9.5_ will survive termination hereof and (ii) no party shall be
relieved from any liabilities or damages (which the parties acknowledge and
agree may include, in addition to reimbursement of expenses and out-of-pocket
costs, and to the extent proven, other damages suffered by the other party
calculated based on loss suffered by such other partys stockholders (taking
into consideration all relevant matters and equitable considerations), which
shall be deemed in such event to be damages of such other party and not of
such other partys stockholders themselves and may only be pursued by such
other party through actions expressly approved by its board of directors) as
a result of any willful and material breach by any party of any of such
partys representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements set forth
in this Agreement. For purposes of this Section 9.5(e), "willful and material
breach" shall mean a material breach that is a consequence of an act or a
failure to take such act by the breaching party with the knowledge that the
taking of such act (or the failure to take such act) would cause a
material breach of this Agreement.

 



83 Section 9.6 _Amendment._

 

(a) This Agreement may be amended by the parties hereto, at any time before or
after approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby by
action by or on behalf of the respective Boards of Directors of the parties
hereto or the stockholders of the Company; provided, however, that after any
such approval by the stockholders of the Company, no amendment shall be made
without the further approval of such stockholders except as permitted by Law.
This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure Letter and the Parent
Disclosure Letter) may not be amended except by an instrument in writing
signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, this _Section
9.6(b)_ and _Sections 9.5(d)_ , _10.4(a)(ii)_ , _10.4(c)_ and _10.6(b)(i)_
may not be amended, supplemented, waived or otherwise modified in a manner
adverse to the Financing Sources without the prior written consent of the
Financing Sources that are party to a commitment letter or similar agreement
with Parent.

Section 9.7 _Waiver._

 

Any failure of any of the parties to comply with any obligation,
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or condition herein may
be waived at any time prior to the Effective Time by any of the parties
entitled to the benefit thereof only by a written instrument signed by each
such party granting such waiver, but such waiver or failure to insist upon
strict compliance with such obligation, representation, warranty, covenant,
agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of or estoppel with
respect to, any subsequent or other failure.

When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, Section, Schedule,
Disclosure Letter, Annex or Exhibit, such reference shall be to an Article,
Section, Schedule, Disclosure Letter, Annex or Exhibit to this Agreement

Section 10.4 _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Specific Performance._

(a) (i) THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO ANY CHOICE OR
CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISION OR RULE (WHETHER OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE OR ANY
OTHER JURISDICTION) THAT WOULD CAUSE THE APPLICATION OF THE LAWS OF ANY
JURISDICTION OTHER THAN THE STATE OF DELAWARE. (ii) NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING
TO THE CONTRARY IN THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY (ON BEHALF OF ITSELF AND EACH
OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES) AND EACH OF THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO AGREES THAT ANY
CLAIM, CONTROVERSY OR DISPUTE OF ANY KIND OR NATURE (WHETHER BASED UPON
CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE) AGAINST ANY AGENT, ARRANGER, LENDER OR OTHER
ENTITY THAT HAS COMMITTED TO PROVIDE OR ARRANGE ANY FINANCING TO BE
CONSUMMATED BY PARENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER, OR ANY OF SUCH PERSONS
AFFILIATES OR ITS OR THEIR RESPECTIVE OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, EMPLOYEES,
PARTNERS, TRUSTEES, SHAREHOLDERS, CONTROLLING PERSONS, AGENTS OR
REPRESENTATIVES (A " _FINANCING SOURCE_ ") THAT IS IN ANY WAY RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE MERGER, INCLUDING ANY DISPUTE ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING IN
ANY WAY TO ANY FINANCING TO BE CONSUMMATED BY PARENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE
MERGER, SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF
THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF LAW PRINCIPLES (OTHER
THAN SECTIONS 5-1401 AND 5-1402 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW);
PROVIDED THAT (1) THE INTERPRETATION OF THE DEFINITION OF COMPANY MATERIAL
ADVERSE EFFECT AND WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT
HAS OCCURRED, (2) THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCURACY OF ANY MERGER AGREEMENT
REPRESENTATIONS (AS DEFINED IN ANY COMMITMENT LETTER RELATED TO SUCH
FINANCING) AND WHETHER AS A RESULT OF ANY INACCURACY THEREOF PARENT, MERGER
SUB OR THEIR RESPECTIVE AFFILIATES HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THEIR
RESPECTIVE OBLIGATIONS UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, OR TO DECLINE TO CONSUMMATE THE
MERGER PURSUANT TO THIS AGREEMENT AND (3) THE DETERMINATION OF WHETHER THE
MERGER HAS BEEN CONSUMMATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS AGREEMENT, IN EACH CASE,
SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED SOLELY IN ACCORDANCE WITH,
THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO CONFLICTS OF LAWS
PRINCIPLES THAT WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE LAW OF ANY OTHER
STATE.

(b) Each of the parties hereto (i) consents to submit itself to the personal
jurisdiction of the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (the "
_Chancery Court_ ") or, if, but only if, the Chancery Court lacks subject
matter jurisdiction, any federal court located in the State of Delaware with
respect to any dispute arising out of, relating to or in connection with this

 



87  Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii)
agrees that it will not attempt to deny or defeat such personal jurisdiction
by motion or other request for leave from any such court, (iii) agrees that
it will not bring any action arising out of, relating to or in connection with
this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in
any court other than the courts of the State of Delaware, as described above,
and (iv) waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related
to or arising out of this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated
hereby. Nothing in this _Section 10.4_ shall prevent any party from bringing
an action or proceeding in any jurisdiction to enforce any judgment of the
Chancery Court or any federal court located in the State of Delaware, as
applicable. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub hereby agrees that
service of any process, summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to
the respective addresses set forth in _Section 10.1_ shall be effective
service of process for any suit or proceeding in connection with this
Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby.

(c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Company (on behalf of
itself and its Subsidiaries) and each of the other parties hereto (i) agrees
that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-
claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in
equity, whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, against any Financing
Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or the Merger, including any
dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any financing obtained by
Parent in connection with the Merger or the performance thereof or the
transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the
Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, located in the
Borough of Manhattan, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction
is vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and (ii) waives
any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to such
financing or arising out of any action, proceeding or counterclaim against
any Financing Source.

(d) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the event that
any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with
their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in
the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any
covenant or obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party
shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it
whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to (a) a decree or order
of specific performance to enforce the observance and performance of such
covenant or obligation, and (b) an injunction restraining such breach or
threatened breach. In circumstances where Parent and the Company are obligated
to consummate the Merger and the Merger has not been consummated (other than
as a result of the other partys refusal to close in violation of this
Agreement) each of Parent and the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees
that the other party and its stockholders shall have suffered irreparable
harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party
and its stockholders, and that such other party on behalf of itself and its
stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parents or the
Companys, as the case may be, obligation to consummate the Merger.

 



88 Section 10.5 _Counterparts; Facsimile Transmission of Signatures._

 

This Agreement may be executed in any number of counterparts and by different
parties hereto in separate counterparts, and delivered by means of electronic
mail transmission or otherwise, each of which when so executed and delivered
shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

 

Section 10.6 _Assignment; No Third Party Beneficiaries._

 

(a) This Agreement and all of the provisions hereto shall be binding upon and
inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns, but neither this Agreement nor
any of the rights, interests or obligations set forth herein shall be assigned
by any party hereto without the prior written consent of the other
parties hereto and any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void.

(b) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed as giving any Person, other
than the parties hereto and their heirs, successors, legal representatives and
permitted assigns, any right, remedy or claim under or in respect of this
Agreement or any provision hereof, except that (i) the Financing
Sources shall be express third party beneficiaries of this _Section
10.6(b)(i)_ and _Sections 9.5(d)_ , _9.6(b)_ , _10.4(a)(ii)_ and _10.4(c)_
only, and each of such Sections shall expressly inure to the benefit of such
Financing Sources and such Financing Sources shall be entitled to rely on and
enforce the provisions of such Sections, and (ii) after the Effective Time,
each Indemnified Person is intended to be a third party beneficiary of
_Section 7.13_ and may specifically enforce its terms.

Section 10.7 _Expenses._

 

Except as otherwise specifically provided herein, each party shall bear its
own expenses in connection with this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 10.8 _Severability._

 

If any provision of this Agreement shall be held to be illegal, invalid or
unenforceable under any applicable Law, then such contravention or invalidity
shall not invalidate the entire Agreement. Such provision shall be deemed to
be modified to the extent necessary to render it legal, valid and enforceable,
and if no such modification shall render it legal, valid and enforceable,
then this Agreement shall be construed as if not containing the provision
held to be invalid, and the rights and obligations of the parties shall be
construed and enforced accordingly.

 

Section 10.9 _Entire Agreement._

 

This Agreement (including the annexes, exhibits and letters hereto)
constitutes the entire agreement, and supersede all other prior
agreements and understandings (both written and oral), among the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

 



89 IN WITNESS WHEREOF, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company have caused this
Agreement to be executed as of the date first written above.
