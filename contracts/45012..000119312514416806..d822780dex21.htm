Subsidiaries) and each of the other parties hereto (i)&nbsp;agrees that it will not bring or support any action, cause of action, claim, cross-claim or third-party claim of any kind or description, whether in law or in equity, whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, against any Financing Sources in any way relating to this Agreement or the Merger, including any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to any financing obtained by Parent in connection with the Merger or the performance
thereof or the transactions contemplated thereby, in any forum other than exclusively in the Supreme Court of the State of New York, County of New York, located in the Borough of Manhattan, or, if under applicable Law exclusive jurisdiction is
vested in the federal courts, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (and appellate courts thereof), and (ii)&nbsp;waives any right to trial by jury with respect to any action related to such financing or arising out
of any action, proceeding or counterclaim against any Financing Source. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:8%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">(d) The parties agree that irreparable damage would occur in the
event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached. Each party agrees that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by any other party of any covenant or
obligation contained in this Agreement, the non-breaching party shall be entitled (in addition to any other remedy that may be available to it whether in law or equity, including monetary damages) to (a)&nbsp;a decree or order of specific
performance to enforce the observance and performance of such covenant or obligation, and (b)&nbsp;an injunction restraining such breach or threatened breach. In circumstances where Parent and the Company are obligated to consummate the Merger and
the Merger has not been consummated (other than as a result of the other party&#146;s refusal to close in violation of this Agreement) each of Parent and the Company expressly acknowledges and agrees that the other party and its stockholders shall
have suffered irreparable harm, that monetary damages will be inadequate to compensate such other party and its stockholders, and that such other party on behalf of itself and its stockholders shall be entitled to enforce specifically Parent&#146;s
or the Company&#146;s, as the case may be, obligation to consummate the Merger. </P>
