This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 14, 2020 (the "

the Company have approved the business combination between the Company and
Parent on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

 

WHEREAS, in furtherance thereof, the Board of Directors of each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company have approved this Agreement and the merger of
Merger Sub with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ ") so that the Company
continues as the surviving corporation in the Merger (sometimes referred to in
such capacity as the " _Surviving Corporation_ "), upon the terms of and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with
the provisions of the Nevada Business Corporation Act (the " _NCA_ ");

 

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Parent has determined to recommend to
its shareholders the approval of this Agreement and the Merger;

 

WHEREAS, Parent, as the sole stockholder of Merger Sub, has adopted and

Shares_ " and, together with the Parent Common Shares, the " _Parent Shares_
") in connection with this Agreement (the " _Parent Share Issuance_ ");

 

WHEREAS, for United States federal income tax purposes, it is intended that
the Merger shall (i) qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of
Section 368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_
") and (ii) to not result in gain being recognized under Section 367(a)(1) of
the Code (other than for any stockholder that would be a "five-percent

that does not enter into a five-year gain recognition agreement in the form
provided in United States Regulations Section 1.367(a)-8(c)) (the " _Intended
Tax Treatment_ "), and this Agreement is intended to be, and is adopted as, a
"plan of reorganization" for purposes of Sections 354 and 361 of the Code; and

agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe certain
conditions to the Merger.

 

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the respective

which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

Agreement_ ") with the Secretary of State of the State of Nevada (the "
_Nevada Secretary of State_ ") and shall make all other filings or recordings
required under the NCA required to effect the Merger. The Merger shall become
effective at such time as the Nevada Merger Agreement is duly filed with the
Nevada Secretary of State, or at such subsequent date or time as the Company
and Parent shall agree and specify in the Nevada Merger Agreement. The date
and time at which the Merger becomes effective as set forth in the Nevada

1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the
effects set forth in this Agreement and in the applicable provisions of the
NCA. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at
the Effective Time, all the rights, properties, privileges, powers and
franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving
Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and Merger
Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Corporation in the same manner as if the Surviving Corporation had itself

_Organizational Documents_ ") shall be amended and restated in their entirety
to be in forms that are mutually agreed upon by Parent and the Company in

1.8 _Tax Consequences_. It is intended by the parties hereto that the Merger
shall qualify for the Intended Tax Treatment for all relevant Tax purposes and
the parties shall not take any position inconsistent therewith in any Tax
filing or proceeding. In the event the parties determine that the Merger may
not qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the
Code, they will cooperate in restructuring the transaction, to the extent
reasonably possible, to cause the Merger to so qualify.

**ARTICLE II** 
 **Effects of the Merger; Exchange of Certificates**

 

2.1 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the holders of any
shares of common stock, no par value, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_
") or the holders of any shares of preferred stock of the Company (" _Company
Preferred Stock_ " and, together with the Company Common Stock, the " _Company
Stock_ "):

 

(a) _Company Stock_. Every share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be
converted into and represent the right to receive 1/3rd of one fully paid and
nonassessable Parent Common Share (the " _Common Exchange Ratio_ ") upon
surrender of the Common Certificate or Uncertificated Common Shares which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented such share of Company
Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a
lost, stolen or destroyed Common Certificate, Section 2.2(i)). Each share of
Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall automatically be converted into and represent the right
to receive 1/3rd of one fully paid and nonassessable Parent Preferred Share
(the " _Preferred Exchange Ratio_ " and, together with the Common Exchange
Ratio, the " _Exchange Ratios_ " and each, an " _Exchange Ratio_ ") upon
surrender of the Preferred Certificate or Uncertificated Preferred Shares in
the manner provided in Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or
destroyed Preferred Certificate, Section 2.2(i)). The Parent Common Shares and
Parent Preferred Shares to be issued to holders of Company Common Stock and
holders of Company Preferred Stock, respectively, pursuant to this Agreement,
together with any cash to be paid to such holders in lieu of fractional shares
pursuant to Section 2.1(e), are referred to as the " _Merger Consideration_ ".
As a result of the Merger, at the Effective Time, each holder of a Common
Certificate or a Preferred Certificate, as the case may be, shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, _except_ the right to receive the
applicable Merger Consideration payable in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such Common Certificate or the shares of Company
Preferred Stock represented by such Preferred Certificate, as the case may be,
immediately prior to the Effective Time, any cash in lieu of fractional shares
payable pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and any dividends or other distributions
payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d), all to be issued or paid, without
interest, in consideration therefor upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with Section 2.2(b) (or, in the case of a lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, Section 2.2(i)).

 

(b) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding share of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of Merger Sub shall be cancelled upon
consummation of the Merger.

 

(c) _Company Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, all issued and outstanding
options to purchase Company Common Stock (" _Company Options_ ") whether
vested or unvested in accordance with their terms shall terminate as provided
in Section 6.10.

 

(d) _Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, and in accordance with the
terms of each warrant to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (" _Company
Warrants_ ") that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall issue a replacement warrant to each holder
thereof providing that such replacement warrant shall be exercisable for a
number of Parent Common Shares equal to the product of 1/3 the aggregate
number of shares of Company Common Stock issuable in respect of such Company
Warrant immediately prior to the Effective Time multiplied by the Exchange
Ratio (the " _Replacement Warrants_ "). Each Replacement Warrant shall contain
appropriate provision such that the provisions of each Company Warrant
(including the exercise period and the exercise price and provision for
adjustment of the exercise price) shall thereafter be maintained in each such
Replacement Warrant as nearly equivalent as may be practicable in relation to
such Company Warrant except that the exercise price shall be multiplied by 3
to reflect the Exchange Ratio. From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall
comply with all of the terms and conditions set forth in each such Replacement
Warrant, including the obligation to issue the Parent Common Shares
contemplated thereby upon exercise thereof. Set forth on Schedule 3.3 is a
schedule of all outstanding Company Warrants.

 

 

3 (e) _Fractional Shares_. No fraction of a Parent Common Share or a Parent
Preferred Share will be issued by virtue of the Merger, but in lieu thereof,
any fraction of a Parent Common Share shares of Company Common Stock or
Company Preferred Stock, respectively, that would otherwise have been issued
to a holder (after aggregating all fractional Parent Common Shares that
otherwise would be received by such holder) or a fraction of a Parent
Preferred Share (after aggregating all fractional Parent Preferred Shares that
otherwise would be received by such holder), respectively, that would
otherwise have been issued to a holder shall be cancelled without payment,
interest or any other compensation of any kind.

 

(f) _Adjustments to Exchange Ratio_. Notwithstanding any provision of this
Article II to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in
Section 5.1), the Exchange Ratios shall be adjusted to reflect fully the
appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into Parent
Common Share or Company Common Stock), reorganization, recapitalization,
reclassification or other like change with respect to Parent Shares or Company
Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and prior to the
Effective Time.

 

2.2 _Exchange of Shares and Certificates_.

 

(a) _Exchange Agent_. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall appoint an
exchange agent (the " _Exchange Agent_ ") for the purpose of exchanging for
the Merger Consideration (i) certificates representing shares of Company
Common Stock (the " _Common Certificates_ "), (ii) uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock (the " _Uncertificated Common Shares_ "), (iii)
certificates representing shares of Company Preferred Stock (the " _Preferred
Certificates_ " and, together with the Common Certificates, the "
_Certificates_ "), and (iv) uncertificated shares of Company Preferred Stock
(the " _Uncertificated Preferred Shares_ " and, together with the
Uncertificated Common Shares, the " _Uncertificated Shares_ "). As of the
Effective Time, Parent shall deposit with the Exchange Agent the aggregate
Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the Certificates and
Uncertificated Shares (the " _Exchange Fund_ "). Promptly after the Effective
Time, Parent shall send, or shall cause the Exchange Agent to send, to each
record holder of shares of Company Stock at the Effective Time a letter of
transmittal and instructions (which shall specify that the delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title shall pass, only upon proper delivery of
the Certificates or transfer of the Uncertificated Shares to the Exchange
Agent) for use in such exchange.

 

(b) _Exchange Procedures_. Each holder of shares of Company Stock that have
been converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration shall be
entitled to receive the Merger Consideration in respect of such Company Stock
represented by a Certificate or Uncertificated Share, upon (i) surrender to
the Exchange Agent of the applicable Certificate, together with a duly
completed and validly executed letter of transmittal and such other documents
as may reasonably be requested by the Exchange Agent, or (ii) receipt of an
"agent\'s message" by the Exchange Agent (or such other evidence, if any, of
transfer as the Exchange Agent may reasonably request) in the case of a book-
entry transfer of the applicable Uncertificated Shares. Until so surrendered
or transferred, as the case may be, each such Certificate or Uncertificated
Share shall represent after the Effective Time for all purposes only the right
to receive such Merger Consideration. No interest shall be paid or accrued on
any amount payable upon the surrender or transfer of any such Certificate or
Uncertificated Share.

 

(c) _Unregistered Holder_. If any portion of the Merger Consideration is to be
paid to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered
Certificate or the transferred Uncertificated Share is registered, it shall be
a condition to such payment that (i) either such Certificate shall be properly
endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer or such
Uncertificated Share shall be properly transferred and (ii) the Person
requesting such payment shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer or other
Tax required as a result of such payment to a Person other than the registered
holder of such Certificate or Uncertificated Share or establish to the
satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not
payable.

 

 

4 (d) _Distributions with Respect to Unexchanged Shares_. No dividends or other
distributions with respect to a Parent Share with a record date after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificate or
non-transferred Uncertificated Shares with respect to the right to receive
Parent Common Shares or Parent Preferred Shares, as the case may be,
represented thereby, and no cash payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be
paid to any such holder pursuant to Section 2.1(e), until (i) such Certificate
has been surrendered, or (ii) such Uncertificated Share has, in each case,
been transferred in accordance with this Article II. Subject to all applicable
laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies or guidelines
promulgated, or judgments, decisions or orders entered by any federal, state,
provincial, local or foreign government, any court, administrative, regulatory
or other governmental agency, commission or authority or any non-governmental
self-regulatory agency, commission or authority (" _Governmental Entity_ ")
(all such laws, statutes, orders, rules, regulations, policies, guidelines,
judgments, decisions and orders, collectively, " _Laws_ " or " _Law_ "),
following surrender of any such Certificate or transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, there shall be paid to the recordholder thereof, without interest, (i)
promptly after such surrender and transfer, the number of whole Parent Common
Shares or Parent Preferred Shares, as the case may be, issuable in exchange
therefor pursuant to this Article II, together with any cash payable in lieu
of a fractional Parent Common Share or Parent Preferred Share, as the case may
be, to which such holder is entitled pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and the amount
of dividends or other distributions with a record date after the Effective
Time theretofore paid with respect to such whole Parent Common Shares or
Parent Preferred Shares, as the case may be, and (ii) at the appropriate
payment date, the amount of dividends or other distributions with a record
date after the Effective Time and prior to the date of such surrender and a
payment date subsequent to the date of such surrender payable with respect to
such whole Parent Common Shares or Parent Preferred Shares, as the case may
be.

 

(e) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock_. All Parent Shares issued
upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates, or transfer of Uncertificated
Shares, in accordance with the terms of this Article II and any cash paid
pursuant to Section 2.1(e) or Section 2.2(d) shall be deemed to have been
issued (and paid) in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares
of Company Common Stock or shares of Company Preferred Stock, as the case may
be, previously represented by such Certificates or Uncertificated Shares. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed
and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Stock which were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented or Uncertificated Shares are transferred to
the Surviving Corporation or the Exchange Agent for any reason, they shall be
canceled and exchanged as provided in this Article II.

 

(f) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares
one year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand,
and any holders of Certificates or Uncertificated Shares who have not
theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to Parent
for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, and any dividends or
distributions pursuant to Section 2.2(d).

 

(g) _Escheat; No Liability_. None of Parent, Merger Sub, Surviving Corporation
or the Exchange Agent shall be liable to any Person in respect of any Parent
Shares (or dividends or distributions with respect thereto) or cash from the
Exchange Fund delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have
been surrendered or Uncertificated Shares shall not have been transferred
immediately prior to the date on which any Parent Share, any cash in lieu of
fractional Parent Shares or any dividends or distributions with respect to a
Parent Share issuable in respect of such Certificate or Uncertificated Shares
would escheat to or otherwise become the property of any Governmental Entity,
any such shares, cash, dividends or distributions in respect of such
Certificate or Uncertificated Shares shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and

deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Code,
or any provision of federal, state, local or foreign Tax law. To the extent
that amounts are so withheld by Parent or the Exchange Agent and paid over to

take all reasonable steps to reduce the rate of withholding Tax as provided
under relevant Tax Law and practice. The parties shall cooperate reasonably in
completing and filing documents required under the provisions of any

such Parent Preferred Shares, as the case may be, as may be required pursuant
to Section 2.1(a), cash for fractional shares pursuant to Section 2.1(e) and
any dividends or distributions payable pursuant to Section 2.2(d); _provided_
, _however_ , that Parent may, in its reasonable discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate to deliver an agreement of indemnification in form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent, or a bond in such sum as Parent may
reasonably direct as indemnity, against any claim that may be made against
Parent or the Exchange Agent in respect of the Certificate or Certificates
alleged to have been lost, stolen or destroyed.

 

(j) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash
included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;

payable to former shareholders of the Company after the Effective Time
pursuant to this Article II. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investment shall become a part of the Exchange Fund and any amounts in excess
of the amounts payable pursuant to this Article II shall promptly be paid to

3.21 _Internal Controls_. The Company maintains "disclosure controls and
procedures", as such terms are defined under Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that
are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our
Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the SEC\'s rules and forms, and that such
information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including the
Company\'s Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer, as
appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. The
Company acknowledges that any controls and procedures can provide only
reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company
has carried out an evaluation as required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the
supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our
Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of
the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedure as of
December 31, 2018 (such date, the " _Evaluation Date_ "). Based upon their
evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer
concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company\'s disclosure controls
and procedures were not effective. The Company\'s management has used the
framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated
Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the
Treadway Commission (2013 framework), known as COSO, to evaluate the
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of
our evaluation, the Company identified a material weakness in our controls
related to segregation of duties and other immaterial weaknesses in several
areas of data management and documentation. The Company\'s management is
composed of a small number of professionals resulting in a situation where
limitations on segregation of duties exist. Accordingly, as a result of the
material weakness identified above, the Company has concluded that the control
deficiencies result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement
of the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented on a timely
basis by the Company\'s internal controls. The Company continues to employ and
refine a structure in which critical accounting policies, issues and estimates
are identified, and together with other complex areas, are subject to multiple
reviews by executives. In addition, the Company evaluates and assesses its
internal controls and procedures regarding its financial reporting, utilizing
standards incorporating applicable portions of the Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board\'s 2009 Guidance for Smaller Public Companies in Auditing
Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting as necessary on an on-going basis.
Since the Evaluation Date, there have been no significant changes in the
Company\'s internal controls (as such term is defined in Item 308 of
Regulation S-K) or, to the Company\'s Knowledge, in other factors that could
significantly affect the Company\'s internal controls. The Company maintains
and will continue to maintain a standard system of accounting established and
administered in accordance with GAAP and the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act.

conflicts with the intellectual property rights of any third party; and (iii)

businesses as currently conducted does not infringe, violate or otherwise
conflict with the intellectual property rights of any third party.

Proposal, _provided that_ (A) prior to furnishing any such nonpublic
information, it receives from such Person or group an executed confidentiality
agreement containing customary terms (the " _CA_ "); and (B) contemporaneously
with furnishing any such nonpublic information to such person or group, it
furnishes such nonpublic information to Parent (to the extent such nonpublic
information has not been previously furnished to Parent); and

Superior Proposal; provided, however, in no event shall such party enter into
any definitive agreement to effect such Superior Proposal.

 

5.4 _Board of Directors Recommendation_.

 

(a) In response to (i) the receipt of an Alternative Transaction Proposal
which is determined by the Board of Directors of the Company to be a Superior
Proposal or (ii) any material event, development, circumstance, occurrence or
change in circumstances or facts (including any material change in probability
or magnitude of circumstances), not related to an Alternative Transaction
Proposal, and that first occurred following the execution of this Agreement
that was neither known to nor reasonably foreseeable by the Company as of or
prior to the date hereof, that materially improves the financial condition or
results of operations of the Company (excluding the fact that the Company
meets or exceeds any internal or published projections, forecasts or estimates
of its revenue, earnings or other financial performance or results of
operations for any period ending on or after the date hereof, or changes after
the date of this Agreement in the market price or trading volume of the
Company Common Stock or any credit rating of the Company) (an " _Intervening
Event_ "), such Board of Directors may, after fully complying with Section
5.4(b) (A) withhold, withdraw or qualify (or amend or modify in a manner
adverse to Parent) or publicly propose to withhold, withdraw or qualify (or
amend or modify in a manner adverse to Parent), the approval, recommendation
or declaration of advisability by such Board of Directors or any committee
thereof of this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated
by this Agreement, or (B) recommend, adopt or approve, or publicly propose to
recommend, adopt or approve, any Superior Proposal (any of the foregoing
actions, whether by a Board of Directors or a committee thereof, a " _Change
of Recommendation_ "), if the Board of Directors of the Company has concluded
in good faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in
light of such Superior Proposal or Intervening Event, as applicable, the
failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change of Recommendation is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law.

 

 

27 (b) Prior to announcing any Change of Recommendation pursuant to Section
5.4(a), the Company shall, to the extent applicable, (A) provide to Parent
three Business Days\' prior written notice which shall (x) state expressly
that it intends to effect a Change of Recommendation, and (y) in connection
with a Change of Recommendation resulting from receipt of a Superior Proposal,
describe any modifications to the terms and conditions of the Superior
Proposal and the identity of the Person or group making the Superior Proposal
from the description of such terms and conditions and such Person contained in
the notice required under Section 5.3(d), or in the case of an Intervening
Event written information describing the Intervening Event in reasonable
detail and shall keep Parent reasonably informed of material events with
respect to such Intervening Event, (B) make available to Parent all materials
and information made available to the Person or group making the Superior
Proposal in connection with such Superior Proposal or the materials provided
to the Board of Directors in connection with its evaluation of an Intervening
Event and (C) during the three Business Day period commencing upon receipt of
the notice described in Section 5.4(b) (A), if requested by Parent, engage in
good faith negotiations to amend this Agreement in such a manner that (i) the
Alternative Transaction Proposal which was determined to be a Superior
Proposal no longer is a Superior Proposal, and if there is any material
revision to the terms of the Alternative Transaction Proposal which was
determined to be a Superior Proposal, including, any revision in price, the
notice period shall be extended, if applicable, to provide for an additional
three Business Day period subsequent to the time the Company notifies Parent
of any such material revision (it being understood that there may be multiple
extensions) or (ii) the failure of the Board of Directors to effect a Change
in Recommendation in response to an Intervening Event would no longer be
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its fiduciary obligations to the
shareholders of the Company under applicable Law.

 

(c) If the Board of Directors of the Company has effected a Change of
Recommendation, the Company, as applicable, shall promptly notify Parent in
writing of such Change in Recommendation, including the specific subparagraph,
but not more than one subparagraph, of Section 5.4 in reliance upon which such
Change in Recommendation is made.

Company and the holders of the Company Common Stock as may be reasonably
requested in connection with any such action. Each party shall cooperate and

any amendment or supplement to the Form S-4, the Parent\'s Proxy Statement or
any filing with the SEC incorporated by reference in the Form S-4, prior to

of the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that each party shall be deemed
to have consented to the inclusion in the Form S-4, or any filing with the SEC
incorporated by reference in the Form S-4 of any information, language or

Company or Parent, or any of their respective affiliates, officers or
directors, should be discovered by the Company or Parent which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to either of the Form S-4 or the Proxy
Statement, so that any of such documents would not include any misstatement of
a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other parties hereto and an appropriate amendment or supplement,
including, where appropriate, a filing pursuant to Rules 165 and 425 of the
Securities Act, describing such information shall promptly be filed with the
SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the shareholders of
the Company or Parent.

financial records, officers, employees, business plans, budget and
projections, customers, suppliers and other information of the Company, and
the work papers of its independent accountants, and otherwise provide such
assistance as may be reasonably requested by such party in order that the
other party has a reasonable opportunity to make such investigation and
evaluation as it reasonably desires to make of the business and affairs of the
other party.

 

(b) Each of Parent and the Company will hold, and will cause its respective
officers, directors, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and
other representatives and affiliates to hold, any nonpublic information

reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or
cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing,
all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in
the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, including commercially reasonable efforts to

6.4 _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, and shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to, indemnify, defend and hold harmless, and shall itself
indemnify, defend and hold harmless as if it were the Surviving Corporation,
in each case, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, the present
and former officers, directors and agents (each an " _Indemnified Party_ ") of
the Company against all losses, claims, damages, fines, penalties and
liability in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the
Effective Time (including but not limited to acts or omissions occurring in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby)
including amounts paid in settlement or compromise with the approval of Parent
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Parent and
Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation and indemnification for acts
or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time now existing in favor of
the Indemnified Parties, as provided in the NCA and the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation will contain provisions
with respect to exculpation, indemnification and the advancement of expenses
that are at least as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained
in the Company Organizational Documents as in effect on the date hereof, which
provisions will not, _except_ as required by Law, be amended or modified until
expiration of the applicable statute of limitations in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of the Indemnified Parties. Without
limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, in the event that any
Indemnified Party becomes involved in any actual or threatened action, suit,
claim, proceeding or investigation covered by this Section 6.4 after the
Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, promptly advance to such Indemnified
Party his or her legal or other expenses (including the cost of any
investigation and preparation incurred in connection therewith), subject to

amounts so advanced in the event of a non-appealable determination of a court
of competent jurisdiction that such Indemnified Party is not entitled thereto.
For at least six years after the Effective Time, Parent will cause the
Surviving Corporation to, and Surviving Corporation will, without any lapse in
coverage, provide officers\' and directors\' liability insurance in respect of
acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time covering each officer
and director or any of its agents in an amount agreeable to the Company\'s
officers and directors; _provided_ , that, the Surviving Corporation shall not
be obligated to expend annual premiums during such period in excess of 200% of
the per annum rate of the aggregate annual premium currently paid by the
Parent for such insurance on the date of this Agreement, _provided_ that if
the annual premium for such insurance shall exceed such 200% in any year, the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain a policy with the greatest
coverage available for a cost not exceeding such amount; _provided further_ ,
that in the event Parent shall, directly or indirectly, sell all or
substantially all of the assets or capital stock of the Surviving Corporation,
prior to such sale, Parent shall either assume such obligation or cause a
subsidiary of Parent having a net worth substantially equivalent to, or in
excess of the net worth of, the Surviving Corporation immediately prior to
such sale, to assume such obligation. Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation to reimburse all expenses, including reasonable attorney\'s fees,
incurred by any Person to enforce the obligations of Parent and Surviving
Corporation under this Section 6.4.

Merger, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public
statement prior to such consultation, except as such party may reasonably
conclude may be required by applicable Law, court process or by obligations
pursuant to any listing agreement with any national securities exchange or
national securities quotation system. Parent and the Company agree that the
initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement shall be in a form agreed to by the parties.

 

6.7 _Listing and NASDAQ Approval_. As soon as possible prior to the Closing,
Parent shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain NASDAQ approval
in respect of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to cause the
Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement and the Parent Common
Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Parent Preferred Shares issuable
pursuant to this Agreement to be approved for listing on the NASDAQ. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, Parent shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any required security holder approval in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
listing of the Parent Common Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement and
the Parent Common Shares issuable upon the conversion of the Parent Preferred
Shares issuable pursuant to this Agreement.

 

6.8 _Tax-Free Reorganization Treatment_. The Company and the Parent agree that
it is the intent of the parties that the Merger be structured as a tax-free
reorganization. Accordingly, both parties agree to coordinate a review of the
tax-free nature of the Merger promptly upon execution of this agreement.

the Merger.

reasonably satisfactory to the recipient and customary in scope and substance
for consents delivered by independent public accountants in connection with
registration statements on Form S-4 under the Securities Act.

 

 

31 6.12 _Affiliate Legends_. Schedule 6.13 to this Agreement sets forth a list of

regarding any change in the identity of its Rule 145 Affiliates prior to the
Closing Date. Parent shall be entitled to issue appropriate stop transfer
instructions to the transfer agent for the Parent Common Shares.

to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of the
occurrence, or failure to occur, of any event, which is in the Company\'s

any of the Company Disclosure Schedules s, as the case may be, from and after
the date hereof. Parent shall give the Company prompt written notice of any
material correction to any of the Parent Filings, as the case may be, from and

by Article II or Article III by each individual who is subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the Company, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

6.15 _State Takeover Laws_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall not
take any action to render inapplicable, or to exempt any third Person from,
any state takeover law or state law that purports to limit or restrict
business combinations or the ability to acquire or vote shares of capital
stock unless (i) required to do so by order of a court of competent
jurisdiction or (ii) the Company\'s Board of Directors has concluded in good
faith, after receipt of advice of its outside legal counsel, that, in light of
a Superior Proposal with respect to it, the failure to take such action is
reasonably likely to result in a breach of its Board of Directors\' fiduciary
obligations to its shareholders under applicable Law. The Company and its
directors shall take all action necessary to waive the application of any
shareholder rights plan or similar device or arrangement, commonly or
colloquially known as a " _poison pill_ " or " _anti-takeover_ " plan or any
similar plan, device or arrangement that the Company has adopted or

the purposes and intent of this Agreement at or after the Effective Time, then
the Company, Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective officers
and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper deeds, assignments,
instruments and assurances and do all other things reasonably necessary to
consummate the Merger and to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement.

the Parent of any litigation brought by any shareholder of the Company against
the Company, any of its subsidiaries and/or any of their respective directors
relating to the Merger and this Agreement. The Company shall give the Parent

parties contained in this Agreement or in any document delivered pursuant to

insist on strict compliance with an obligation, covenant, agreement or
condition shall not operate as a waiver of, or estoppel with respect to, any
subsequent or other failure.

of the parties and delivered to the other parties.

(including the CA, the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure

the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings,
both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
this Agreement and (b) _except for_ the provisions of Section 6.4 (which are
intended to benefit the Indemnified Parties) is not intended to confer upon
any Person _other than_ the parties hereto any rights or remedies.

accordance with, the laws of the State of Nevada, regardless of the laws that
might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflict of laws
thereof.

 

9.8 _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or

policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall

accomplished without materially affecting the economic benefits anticipated by
the parties to this Agreement. Upon such determination that any term or other
provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties
hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the parties as closely as possible to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law in an acceptable manner to the end that the
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

9.12 _Failure or Indulgence Not a Waiver; Remedies Cumulative_. No failure or
delay on the part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder
shall impair such right or be construed to be a waiver of, or acquiescence in,
any breach of any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any
single or partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or of any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or remedies
otherwise available.

injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically
the terms and provisions of this Agreement in any federal or state court
located in the State of Delaware, this being in addition to any other remedy
to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
