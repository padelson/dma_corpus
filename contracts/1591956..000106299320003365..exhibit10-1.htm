The Company acknowledges that any controls and procedures can provide only reasonable assurances of achieving the desired control objectives. The Company has carried out an evaluation as required by Rule 13a-15(d) under the supervision of and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedure as of December 31, 2018 (such date, the "<u>Evaluation Date</u>"). Based upon their evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Principal Accounting Officer concluded that, as of the Evaluation Date, the Company's disclosure controls and procedures were not effective. The Company's management has used the framework set forth in the report entitled Internal Control-Integrated Framework published by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), known as COSO, to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. As a result of our evaluation, the Company identified a material weakness in our controls related to segregation of duties and other immaterial weaknesses in several areas of data management and documentation. The Company's management is composed of a small number of professionals resulting in a situation where limitations on segregation of duties exist. Accordingly, as a result of the material weakness identified above, the Company has concluded that the control deficiencies result in a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements may not be prevented on a timely basis by the Company's internal controls. The Company continues to employ and refine a structure in which critical accounting policies, issues and estimates are identified, and together with other complex areas, are subject to multiple reviews by executives. In addition, the Company evaluates and assesses its internal controls and procedures regarding its financial reporting, utilizing standards incorporating applicable portions of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board's 2009 Guidance for Smaller Public Companies in Auditing Internal Controls Over Financial Reporting as necessary on an on-going basis.&#160; Since the Evaluation Date, there have been no significant changes in the Company's internal controls (as such term is defined in Item 308 of Regulation S-K) or, to the Company's Knowledge, in other factors that could significantly affect the Company's internal controls.&#160; The Company maintains and will continue to maintain a standard system of accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP and the applicable requirements of the Exchange Act.</p>
