Section 3.1 Conversion of Securities. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company
or their respective shareholders, the following shall occur:

  


 

  

(a) Conversion Generally. Each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than any shares of
Company Common Stock to be cancelled pursuant to Section 3.1(b)) shall be
converted, subject to Section 3.1(d), into the right to receive $72.00 in
cash, payable to the holder thereof, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall cease to be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
retired and shall cease to exist, and each Certificate which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares shall thereafter represent
only the right to receive the Merger Consideration therefor.

  


 

  

(b) Cancellation of Certain Shares. Each share of Company Common Stock held by
Parent, Merger Sub, any other Subsidiary of Parent, any Company Subsidiary or
the Company (or in the treasury of the Company) immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be cancelled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof and no payment shall be made with respect thereto.

  


 

  

(c) Merger Sub. Each share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
shall be converted into and be exchanged for one newly and validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation.

  


 

  

(d) Change in Shares. If between the date of this Agreement and the Effective
Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed
into a different number of shares or a different class, solely by reason of
any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split,
reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or any other similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be correspondingly adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

recapitalization, split, reverse split, combination or exchange of shares or
any other similar transaction and to provide to the holders of Company Common
Stock the same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such
action; provided that nothing in this Section 3.1(d) shall be construed to
permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that is
prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 3.2 Exchange of Certificates.

  


 

  

(a) Paying Agent. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, or shall cause to be
deposited, with a bank or trust company designated by Parent and reasonably
satisfactory to the Company (the "Paying Agent"), for the benefit of the
holders of shares of Company Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with
this Article III, through the Paying Agent, cash in U.S. dollars in an amount
sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger Consideration payable in
connection with the Merger (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the
"Exchange Fund") payable pursuant to Section 3.1 in exchange for outstanding
shares of Company Common Stock. Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to deliver
the Merger Consideration contemplated to be paid pursuant to Section 3.1 out
of the Exchange Fund. The Exchange Fund shall be invested by the Paying Agent
as directed by Parent; provided that no such investment or losses thereon
shall affect the Merger Consideration payable to the holders of Company Common
Stock. If the Exchange Fund is insufficient to pay the aggregate Merger
Consideration payable in connection with the Merger when any payment thereof
is required, Parent shall promptly deposit or cause to be deposited additional
funds in the amount of such insufficiency with the Paying Agent for payment in
accordance with the terms hereof. Any net profit resulting from, or interest
or income produced by, such investments shall be payable to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable
pursuant to Section 3.1 shall be promptly returned to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent, in each case as directed by Parent. The Exchange Fund
shall not be used for any other purpose.

  


 

  

(b) Exchange Procedures. Promptly after the Effective Time (but not later than
five (5) Business Days thereafter), Parent shall mail, or cause the Paying
Agent to mail, to each holder of record of a certificate or certificates which
immediately prior to the Effective Time represented outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock (the "Certificates," it being understood that any
references herein to "Certificates" shall be deemed to include references to
book-entry account statements relating to the ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock) and whose shares of Company Common Stock have been converted
into the right to receive Merger Consideration pursuant to Section 3.1 (i) a
letter of transmittal in customary form (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to Certificates held
in book-entry form) and with such other provisions as Parent may determine and
the Company may reasonably agree (which shall specify that delivery of any
Certificate shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificate
shall pass, only upon the proper delivery of such Certificate to the Paying
Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the
Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent together with such letter of
transmittal, properly completed and duly executed, and such other customary
documents

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

as may be reasonably required pursuant to such instructions (or, if such
Certificate is held in book-entry or other uncertificated form, upon the
confirmation of a book-entry transfer of the surrender of such Certificate),
the holder of such Certificate shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor the Merger Consideration which such holder has the right to receive
in respect of the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be cancelled.
No interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration payable to
holders of Certificates. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of
Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, the Merger Consideration may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Common Stock is presented to
the Paying Agent accompanied by all documents reasonably required to evidence
and effect such transfer and by customary evidence that any applicable stock
transfer Taxes have been paid. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective
Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger
Consideration.

  


 

  

(c) No Further Rights in Company Common Stock. All Merger Consideration paid
in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to have been issued in
full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares of Company Common
Stock.

  

  

(d) Termination of Exchange Fund. Any portion of the Exchange Fund which
remains undistributed to the holders of Company Common Stock for six (6)
months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent (as directed by Parent) upon demand, and any holders of
shares of Company Common Stock who have not theretofore complied with this
Article III shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation or Parent
(as applicable) with respect to any payment of the Merger Consideration in
respect of such shares, without any interest thereon.

  


 

  

(e) No Liability. None of Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation or
any of their Affiliates shall be liable to any holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any cash from the Exchange Fund duly delivered to a public
official pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the
related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any
Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, become the property of Parent, free and clear of
all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  


 

  

(f) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond, in such reasonable
and customary amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim that
may be made against it with respect to such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate, Parent shall cause the Paying Agent to issue in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration without any
interest thereon.

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

(g) No Further Dividends. No dividends or other distributions with respect to
capital stock of the Surviving Corporation with a record date on or after the
Effective Time shall be paid to the holder of any unsurrendered Certificates.

  


 

  

(h) Withholding. Parent, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation,
the Paying Agent and their respective Affiliates shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold or cause to be deducted and withheld from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as Parent, Merger
Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent or their
respective Affiliates are required to deduct and withhold under the Code, or
any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law, with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so deducted or withheld, such
deducted or withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such deduction
and withholding was made.

  


 

  

Section 3.3 Dissenters' Rights. Dissenters' rights under Chapter 23 of the
TBCA shall not be available to the Company Shareholders in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, including the Merger.

  


 

  

Section 3.4 Stock Transfer Books. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed (after giving effect to the items
contemplated by Section 3.1) and thereafter, there shall be no further
registration of transfers of shares of Company Common Stock theretofore
outstanding on the records of the Company. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any rights with respect to
such shares of Company Common Stock except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement or by Law.

  


 

  

Section 3.5 Company Options and Stock-Based Awards.

  


 

  

(a) Cashout of Company Options. Except to the extent otherwise elected by the
holder pursuant to Section 3.5(b), at the Effective Time, each Company Option,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior the Effective Time shall become fully vested and shall be converted
automatically into the right to receive from the Surviving Corporation at the
Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product of (i) the total number
of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Option and (ii) the
Merger Consideration (reduced by the exercise price applicable to such Company
Option), subject to applicable income and employment withholding Taxes;
provided that if the exercise price per share of any such Company Option is
equal to or greater than the per share Merger Consideration, such Company
Option shall be cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect
thereof. Promptly following the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
deliver written notice to each holder of a Company Option informing such
holder of the effect of the Merger on the Company Options.

  


 

  

(b) Elective Rollover of Company Options. The Company shall permit each holder
of a Company Option, whether vested or unvested, to elect in writing, no later
than five (5) Business Days prior to the Effective Time, with respect to all
or a portion of such Company Option (each such Company Option or portion for
which such an election is

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

16  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

made, a "Rollover Option"), to have such Rollover Option (i) fully vest and
become exercisable and (ii) be converted into an option to acquire a number of
Parent American Depositary Shares equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest number of whole shares) of (A) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Rollover Option immediately prior to the Effective Time
and (B) the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share (rounded up
to the nearest whole cent) equal to (1) the exercise price per share of such
Rollover Option immediately prior to the Effective Time, divided by (2) the
Option Exchange Ratio; provided that the exercise price and the number of
Parent American Depositary Shares purchasable pursuant to the Rollover Options
(as converted) shall be subject to such adjustments as reasonably agreed to by
Parent and the Company are necessary for the foregoing conversion to satisfy
the requirements of Sections 409A, and to the extent applicable, Section 422
and 424, of the Code and applicable regulations thereunder; provided, further,
that if the exercise price per share of any such Rollover Option is equal to
or greater than the Merger Consideration, such Rollover Option shall be
cancelled without any cash payment being made in respect thereof. Except as
specifically provided above, following the Effective Time each Rollover Option
shall continue to be governed by the same terms and conditions as set forth in
the applicable Company Stock Plan and any agreements thereunder as were
applicable immediately prior to the Effective Time. In addition to the
foregoing, Parent shall assume the Company Stock Plans, and the number and
kind of shares available for issuance under the Company Stock Plans shall be
converted into Parent American Depositary Shares in accordance with the
provisions of each applicable Company Stock Plan.

  


 

  

(c) Company Restricted Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of Company
Restricted Stock, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately
prior thereto shall become fully vested and all restrictions thereon shall
lapse and shall be converted automatically into the right to receive from the
Surviving Corporation at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the
Merger Consideration, subject to applicable income and employment withholding
Taxes.

  


 

  

(d) Other Company Stock-Based Awards. At the Effective Time, each other
Company Stock-Based Award that is not otherwise described in this Section 3.5,
whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding and, if applicable,
unexercised immediately prior the Effective Time shall become fully vested and
shall be converted automatically into the right to receive from the Surviving
Corporation at the Effective Time an amount in cash equal to the product of
(i) the total number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company
Stock-Based Award and (ii) the Merger Consideration (reduced, if applicable,
by an exercise or base price applicable to such Company Stock-Based Award),
subject to applicable income and employment withholding Taxes; provided that
with respect to any unvested Company Stock-Based Award subject to performance-
based vesting conditions ("Performance Awards"), such Performance Awards shall
vest based upon the Company's achievement of the applicable performance
metrics to which such Performance Awards are subject as of the Closing Date,
the extent of such vesting to be determined in accordance with the applicable
grant agreement for each such Performance Award, and any unvested Performance
Awards that do not so vest shall be cancelled and forfeited for no
consideration.

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

17  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(e) Miscellaneous. All amounts payable under this Section 3.5 shall be reduced
by amounts as are required to be withheld or deducted under the Code or any
provision of U.S. state, local or foreign Tax Law with respect to the making
of such payment. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or deducted, such
withheld or deducted amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of whom such
withholding or deduction was made.

  


 

  

ARTICLE IV 
 

  

REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY

  


 

  

With respect to any Section of this Article IV, except (i) as expressly
disclosed in the reports and statements (excluding any exhibits thereto) and
other documents filed or furnished with the SEC by the Company pursuant to the
Exchange Act (other than any disclosures contained or referenced therein under
the captions "Risk Factors" or "Caution Regarding Forward-Looking
Statements"), in each case on or after December 31, 2010 and prior to the date
of this Agreement (the "Recent SEC Reports") (it being understood, however,
that any matter disclosed in any Recent SEC Report shall not be deemed to be
disclosed in Section 4.2 (Capitalization) and Section 4.7(b) (Financial
Statements) of the Company Disclosure Schedule unless it is also expressly set
forth in Section 4.2 and Section 4.7(b) of the Company Disclosure Schedule,
respectively) or (ii) as set forth in the Company Disclosure Schedule, the
Company represents and warrants to Parent and Merger Sub as follows:

  


 

  

Section 4.1 Organization and Qualification. The Company is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the State
of Tennessee. Each Subsidiary of the Company (each, a "Company Subsidiary") is
duly organized, and is validly existing and, where such concept is recognized,
in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, except to the extent the failure of any such
Company Subsidiary to be in good standing would not, individually or in the
aggregate, have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially
impair or materially delay the ability of the Company to consummate the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Section 4.1 of the Company
Disclosure Schedule contains a true, correct and complete list of all of the
Company Subsidiaries, the ownership interest of the Company in each Company
Subsidiary, and the ownership interest of any other Person or Persons in each
Company Subsidiary, in each case as of the date hereof. Each of the Company
and each Company Subsidiary has the requisite corporate or similar power and
authority to own, lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on
its business as presently conducted, except where the failure to have such
power or authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially impair or materially delay the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and each Company Subsidiary is duly qualified or
licensed to do business, and is in good standing, where such concept is
applicable, in each jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned,
leased or operated by it or the nature of its business makes such
qualification, licensing or good standing necessary, except for such failures
to be so qualified, licensed or in good standing that, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Company Material Adverse Effect or prevent,
materially impair or materially delay the ability of the Company to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Company has made
available to Parent complete and correct copies of the charter and bylaws (or
similar

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

18  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

organizational documents) of the Company and each Company Subsidiary, each as
amended to date, and each as so delivered is in full force and effect. As of
any date following the date hereof, notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary and notwithstanding anything set forth in the Company
Disclosure Schedule, neither the Company nor any of its "significant
subsidiaries" (as defined in Rule 1-02(w) of Regulation S-X under the Exchange
Act) has filed for bankruptcy or filed for reorganization under the U.S.
federal bankruptcy laws or similar state or federal law, become insolvent or
become subject to conservatorship or receivership.

  


 

  

Section 4.2 Capitalization.

  


 

  

(a) The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 250,000,000 shares
of Company Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares of preferred stock, par value
$0.10 per share, of which 300,000 shares have been designated as Series A
Participating Cumulative Preferred Stock (collectively, the "Company Preferred
Stock"). As of January 19, 2012 (the "Measurement Date"), there were (i)
51,747,123 shares of Company Common Stock (other than treasury shares) issued
and outstanding, (ii) no shares of Company Common Stock held in the treasury
of the Company, (iii) 3,663,380 shares of Company Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of outstanding Company Options, (iv) a maximum of 144,072 shares
issuable pursuant to Company Stock-Based Awards, (v) no shares of Company
Common Stock owned by any Company Subsidiary and (vi) no shares of Company
Preferred Stock issued and outstanding. All of the outstanding shares of
capital stock of the Company are, and all such shares that may be issued prior
to the Effective Time will be, when issued, duly authorized, validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable and free from preemptive rights. All shares of
Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise or settlement of Company Options,
Company Restricted Stock or Company Stock-Based Awards have been duly reserved
for issuance by the Company, and upon any issuance of such shares in
accordance with the terms of the applicable Company Stock Plan, will be duly
authorized, validly issued and fully paid and nonassessable.

  


 

  

(b) Except as set forth in Section 4.2(a), there are no options, warrants or
other rights, agreements or commitments to which the Company or any Company
Subsidiary is a party or by which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is
bound relating to the issued or unissued Equity Interests of the Company, or
securities convertible into or exchangeable for such Equity Interests, or
obligating the Company to issue or sell any shares of its capital stock or
other Equity Interests, or securities convertible into or exchangeable for
such capital stock of, or other Equity Interests in, the Company. Except as
set forth in Section 4.2(a), there are no outstanding contractual obligations
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary affecting the voting rights of or
requiring the repurchase, redemption, issuance, creation or disposition of any
Equity Interests in the Company. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(b) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule, since the Measurement Date, the Company has not
issued any shares of its capital stock, or securities convertible into or
exchangeable for such capital stock or any other Equity Interests in the
Company, except for issuances pursuant to the exercise or settlement of
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company Stock-Based Awards
outstanding on the Measurement Date in accordance with the terms of such
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company Stock-Based Awards

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

19  

  

 

 

 

  

  

as of such date. There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes or other
indebtedness of the Company having the right to vote (or convertible into, or
exchangeable for, securities having the right to vote) on any matter on which
the Company Shareholders may vote.

  


 

  

(c) Each outstanding share of capital stock or other Equity Interest of each
Company Subsidiary is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid,
nonassessable and free of preemptive rights and is held, directly or
indirectly, by the Company or another Company Subsidiary free and clear of all
Liens. Except as set forth in Section 4.2(c) of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, there are no subscriptions, options, warrants, rights, calls,
contracts or other commitments, understandings, restrictions or arrangements
relating to the issuance, acquisition, redemption, repurchase or sale of any
Equity Interest or other ownership interests of any Company Subsidiary,
including any right of conversion or exchange under any outstanding security,
instrument or agreement.

  


 

  

(d) Section 4.2(d) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the name,
jurisdiction of organization and the Company's (or the Company Subsidiary's)
percentage ownership of any and all Persons in which the Company or any
Company Subsidiary owns, or has the right or obligation to acquire any, Equity
Interests (other than any Company Subsidiary) (collectively, the
"Investments"). All of the Investments are owned by the Company or by a
Company Subsidiary free and clear of all Liens. Except for the capital stock
and other ownership interests of the Company Subsidiaries and the Investments,
the Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any capital stock or other
voting or equity securities or interests in any Person that is material to the
business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

  


 

  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of the Company Subsidiaries has entered into
any commitment or agreement to contribute capital, loan money or otherwise
make additional investments in any other Person, other than any such
commitment or agreement in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice with respect to wholly-owned Company Subsidiaries. There are no
shareholder agreements, voting trusts, proxies or other agreements or
understandings to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a party or by
which it is bound relating to the voting or registration of any shares of
capital stock of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or preemptive rights
with respect thereto.

  


 

  

Section 4.3 Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness.

  


 

  

(a) The Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to enter into
this Agreement and, subject to obtaining the Company Shareholder Approval, to
perform its obligations hereunder. The execution and delivery of this
Agreement by the Company and the consummation by the Company of the
transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and no other corporate proceedings on the part of
the Company and no shareholder votes are necessary to authorize this Agreement
or to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby other than the delivery
and filing of the Articles of Merger as required by the TBCA and the Company
Shareholder Approval. This Agreement has been duly executed

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

20  

  

 

 

 

  

  

and delivered by the Company and, assuming this Agreement is a valid and
binding obligation of Parent and Merger Sub, this Agreement constitutes a
legal, valid and binding obligation of the Company, enforceable against the
Company in accordance with its terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency
(including all Laws relating to fraudulent transfers), reorganization,
moratorium and similar Laws of general applicability relating to or affecting
creditors' rights (the "Bankruptcy Exception").

  


 

  

(b) The affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding on the record date of the Company Shareholders'
Meeting, voting together as a single class (the "Company Shareholder
Approval"), is the only vote of the holders of any class or series of the
Company's capital stock necessary to approve this Agreement and the Merger.

  


 

  

(c) The Company Board has received the opinion of Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc. (the "Company Financial Advisor") to the effect that, as of the date
hereof, and subject to the assumptions, limitations, qualifications and
conditions set forth therein, the Merger Consideration is fair, from a
financial point of view, to the holders of Company Common Stock and, as of the
date of this Agreement, such opinion has not been withdrawn, revoked or
modified. The Company will furnish a complete and correct copy of such opinion
to Parent promptly (and in any event within two (2) days) after receipt
thereof by the Company for informational purposes only.

unanimously (i) determined that each of this Agreement and the Merger is

Section 4.4 No Conflict; Required Filings and Consents.

  


 

  

(a) The execution and delivery by the Company of this Agreement do not, and
the performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not,
(i) assuming the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, conflict with or
violate any provision of the Company Charter or the Company Bylaws or any
equivalent organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary, (ii) assuming
that all consents, approvals and authorizations described in Section 4.4(b)
will have been obtained prior to the Effective Time and all filings and
notifications described in Section 4.4(b) will have been made and any waiting

which any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary is bound
or affected, or (iii) require any consent or approval under, result in any
breach of or any loss of any benefit under, or constitute a default (or an
event which with notice or lapse of time or both would become a default)
under, or give to others any right of termination, vesting,

Lien on any property or asset of the Company or any Company Subsidiary
pursuant to, any Contract to which the Company or any Company Subsidiary is a
party or by which any of their respective properties or assets are bound,
except, with respect to clauses (ii) and (iii), for matters that, individually
or in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company
Material Adverse Effect or prevent, materially impair or materially delay the
ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

  


 

  

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Company do not, and
the performance by the Company of this Agreement and the consummation by the
Company of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby will not,

notification to, any Governmental Entity, except (i) for any consent,
approval, authorization, filing or notification required under the Exchange

delay the ability of the Company to consummate the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement.

Section 4.7 SEC Filings; Financial Statements.

  


 

  

(a) Company SEC Filings. The Company has timely filed or furnished all forms,
reports and other documents required to be filed or furnished by it under the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, since January 1, 2010
(collectively, the "Company SEC Filings"). Each Company SEC Filing (i) as of
its date, complied in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the
case may be, and (ii) did not, at the time it was filed, contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. No
Company Subsidiary is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the
Exchange Act. The Company has made available to Parent true, correct and
complete copies of all material correspondence between the SEC, on the one
hand, and the Company and any of the Company Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
occurring since January 1, 2010 and prior to the date hereof. As of the date
hereof, there are no outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters
from the SEC staff with respect to any of the Company SEC Filings. To the
Knowledge of the Company, as of the date hereof, none of the Company SEC
Filings is the subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding SEC comment or
outstanding SEC investigation.

  


 

  

(b) Financial Statements. Each of the consolidated financial statements
(including, in each case, any notes thereto) contained in or incorporated by
reference into the Company SEC Filings (collectively, the "Company Financial
Statements") was prepared in accordance with GAAP applied (except as may be
indicated in the notes thereto and, in the case of unaudited quarterly
financial statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q under the Exchange Act) on a
consistent basis during the periods indicated (except as may be indicated in
the notes thereto), and each presented fairly, in all material respects, the
consolidated financial position of the Company as of the respective dates
thereof and the consolidated results of operations and cash flows of the
Company for the respective periods indicated therein (subject, in the case of
unaudited statements, to

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

23  

  

 

 

 

  

  

normal year-end adjustments). The accounting books and records of Company and
its Subsidiaries have been maintained in all material respects in accordance
with GAAP.

  


 

  

 

(c) Internal Controls.

 

  


 

  

(i) The Company and the Company Subsidiaries have established and maintained a
system of internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act). Such internal controls are sufficient to provide
reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company's financial
reporting and the preparation of Company financial statements for external
purposes in accordance with GAAP. Since January 1, 2010, the Company's
principal executive officer and its principal financial officer have disclosed
to the Company's auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (A) all
significant deficiencies and material weaknesses in the design or operation of
internal controls over financial reporting that are reasonably likely to
adversely affect the Company's ability to record, process, summarize and
report financial information and (B) any fraud, whether or not material, that
involves management or other employees who have significant responsibility for
the Company's internal controls. The Company has made available to Parent all
such disclosures made by management to the Company's auditors and audit
committee since January 1, 2010.

  


 

  

(ii) The Company has established and maintains disclosure controls and
procedures (as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act),
and such disclosure controls and procedures are designed to ensure that
material information relating to the Company required to be included in
reports filed under the Exchange Act, including its consolidated Subsidiaries,
is made known to the Company's principal executive officer and its principal
financial officer as appropriate to allow timely disclosure under the Exchange
Act.

  


 

  

(iii) Since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, neither the Company nor
any Company Subsidiary has made any prohibited loans to any executive officer
of the Company (as defined in Rule 3b-7 under the Exchange Act) or director of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary. There are no outstanding loans or other

any Company Subsidiary (whether current, former or retired) or their
beneficiaries, or (ii) with respect to which the Company, any Company
Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate has any obligation on behalf of any such
employee, officer, director or other service provider or beneficiary (each a
"Company Plan," and collectively, the "Company Plans").

  


 

  

(b) The Company has made available to Parent: (i) copies of all material

Section 3(37) of ERISA (each, a "Multiemployer Plan"), no such liability has
been asserted, and, to the Knowledge of the Company, there are no facts or
circumstances that could result in any such partial or complete withdrawal or

Company, any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate made, or was required

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

not been waived has occurred; (B) no material liability or contingent
liability (including liability pursuant to Section 4069 of ERISA) under Title
IV of ERISA has been or is reasonably expected to be incurred by the Company,
any Company Subsidiary or any ERISA Affiliate; and (C) the Pension Benefit
Guaranty Corporation has not instituted proceedings to terminate any such plan
and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists that presents a risk
that such proceedings will be instituted or which would constitute grounds
under Section 4042 of ERISA for the termination of, or the appointment of a
trustee to administer, such plan.

  


 

  

(e) Each Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the Code has
received a determination or opinion letter from the IRS upon which it may rely
regarding its qualified status under the Code for all statutory and regulatory
changes with respect to plan qualification requirements for which the IRS will
issue such a letter or has applied to the IRS for such a letter within the
applicable remedial amendment period or such period has not expired and, to
the Knowledge of the Company, nothing has occurred with respect to any such
plan, whether by action or by failure to act, that caused or could reasonably
be expected to cause (i) the IRS to seek to disqualify such plan, (ii) any
such letter to be revoked or (iii) the imposition of any material penalty or
Tax liability.

  


 

  

(f) No proceeding, audit or investigation that, individually or in the
aggregate, would reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse
Effect, has been asserted, instituted or, to the Knowledge of the Company, is
threatened or anticipated against any of the Company Plans (other than non
material routine claims for benefits and appeals of such claims), any trustee
or fiduciary thereof, or any of the assets of any trust of any of the Company
Plans. Except as would not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, each Company Plan complies
in form and has been maintained and operated in accordance with the terms of
the documents governing such plan and applicable Law, including ERISA and the
Code. No non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section
4975 of the Code and Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred or is reasonably
expected to occur with respect to the Company Plans. No Company Plan is under,
and neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has received any notice of,
an audit or investigation by the IRS, Department of Labor or any other
Governmental Entity, and no such completed audit, if any, has resulted in the
imposition of any material Tax or penalty.

  


 

  

(g) To the Knowledge of the Company, except as set forth on Section 4.11(a) of
the Company Disclosure Schedule, each Company Plan may be amended or
terminated without material liability (other than for benefits accrued through
the date of such action).

  


 

  

(h) Other than payments pursuant to the acceleration of the vesting of the
Company Options, Company Restricted Stock and the Company Stock-Based Awards,
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement alone
(including the Merger), or in combination with any other event including a
termination of any employee, officer, director, or other service provider of
the Company or any Company Subsidiary, will not give rise to any material
liability under any Company Plan, including liability for severance pay,
unemployment compensation, termination pay or withdrawal

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

27  

  

 

 

 

  

  

liability, or accelerate the time of payment or vesting or increase the amount
of compensation or benefits due to any employee, officer, director or other
service provider of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (whether current,
former or retired) or their beneficiaries.

  


 

  

(i) Neither the Company nor any Company Subsidiary has any indemnity or gross-
up obligation on or after the Effective Time for any Taxes imposed under
Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

  


 

  

(j) None of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, any employee or officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary, has
made any promises or commitments, whether legally binding or not, to create
any additional material Company Plan, or to modify any existing Company Plan
in a manner that would increase materially the expense of maintaining such
plan above the level of expense incurred in respect thereof for the most
recent fiscal year ended prior to the date hereof.

  


 

  

(k) Except for matters that, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect, (i) any
individual who performs services for the Company or any Company Subsidiary and
who is not treated as an employee for federal income Tax purposes by the
Company or any Company Subsidiary is not an employee under applicable Law and
is not an employee for any purpose (including Tax withholding purposes or
Company Plan purposes), and (ii) each employee of the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries has been properly classified as "exempt" or "non exempt" under
applicable Law.

market value of Company Common Stock on a date no earlier than the date of the
corporate action authorizing the grant if such Company Option, (ii) no Company
Option has had its exercise date or grant date delayed or "back dated," and
(iii) all Company Options have been issued in compliance with all applicable
Laws and properly accounted for in all material respects in accordance with
GAAP. Section 4.11(l) of the Company Disclosure Schedule sets forth the
weighted average exercise price of all outstanding Company Options as of the
Measurement Date. Promptly after the date hereof, the Company shall provide
Parent with a complete and accurate list, as of the date of this Agreement,

number of shares of Company Common Stock issued to date under such Company
Stock Plan, the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to
outstanding Company Options, Company Restricted Stock or Company Stock-Based
Awards and other equity awards and the number of shares of Company Common
Stock reserved for future issuance under such Company Stock Plan, and (B) all

Section 6.2 Proxy Statement; Company Shareholders' Meeting.

  


 

  

(a) Promptly following the date hereof, the Company shall prepare a proxy
statement, letter to shareholders, notice of meeting and form of proxy that
will be provided to the Company Shareholders in connection with the
solicitation of proxies for use at the Company Shareholders' Meeting, and any
schedules required to be filed with the SEC in connection therewith
(collectively, as amended or supplemented, the "Proxy Statement"). The Company
shall cause the Proxy Statement to be filed with the SEC as soon as
practicable after the date hereof, and in any event no later than fifteen (15)
Business Days after the date hereof. The Company and Parent, as the case may
be, shall furnish all information concerning the Company or Parent and Merger
Sub as the other Party may reasonably request in connection with the
preparation and filing with the SEC of the Proxy Statement. The Company shall
use reasonable best efforts to cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the
SEC and disseminated to the Company Shareholders as promptly as practicable
following the filing thereof with the SEC. The Company shall provide Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Proxy Statement and, except as required under applicable Law, all other
materials used in connection with the Company Shareholders' Meeting that (i)
constitute "proxy materials" or "solicitation materials" as those terms are
used in Rules 14a-1 through 14a-17 promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii)
are otherwise used for the "solicitation" of "proxies" as those terms are
defined in Rule 14a-1 promulgated under the Exchange Act, in each case prior
to the filing thereof with the SEC or the dissemination thereof to Company
Shareholders. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after it receives
notice thereof, of any request by the SEC or its staff for an amendment or
revisions to the Proxy Statement, or comments thereon and responses thereto,
or requests by the SEC or its staff for additional information in connection
therewith. If at any time prior to the Company Shareholders' Meeting, any
information relating to the Company or Parent, or any of their respective
directors, officers or Affiliates, should be discovered by the Company or
Parent which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, the Party that discovers such information shall promptly
notify the other Party and an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement describing such information shall be promptly prepared and filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the Company Shareholders. The Company shall cause the Proxy Statement to
comply as to form and substance in all material respects with the applicable
requirements of the Exchange Act and the NYSE.

  


 

  

(b) Subject to the terms of Section 6.4(d), the Company shall include in the
Proxy Statement the Company Board Recommendation.

  


 

  

(c) As promptly as practicable following the date on which the Proxy Statement
is cleared by the SEC for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, the Company shall, in accordance with applicable Law and the Company
Charter, establish a record date for, call, give notice of, convene and hold a
meeting of

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

45  

  

 

 

 

  

  

the Company Shareholders (the "Company Shareholders' Meeting") for the purpose
of voting upon the approval of this Agreement in accordance with the TBCA. The
Company shall solicit from the Company Shareholders proxies in favor of the
Company Shareholder Approval in compliance with all applicable Laws.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement but subject to the
TBCA, the Company's obligation to establish a record date for, call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Shareholders' Meeting pursuant to this
Section 6.2(c) shall not be limited, or otherwise affected, by the
commencement, disclosure, announcement or submission to the Company of any
Acquisition Proposal, and the Company shall not change the record date for the
Company Shareholders' Meeting or postpone or adjourn the Company Shareholders'
Meeting without the prior written consent of Parent; provided that the Company
shall be permitted, without Parent's prior consent, to adjourn, delay or
postpone convening the Company Shareholders' Meeting if in the good faith
judgment of the Company Board the failure to adjourn, delay or postpone the
Company Shareholders' Meeting would not allow sufficient time under applicable
Law for the distribution of any required or appropriate supplement or
amendment to the Proxy Statement; provided, further, that any such
adjournment, delay or postponement shall be for the minimum time reasonably
necessary to permit such distribution. Except as Parent shall have otherwise
consented to in writing in advance, (i) the Company Shareholder Approval and
(ii) an advisory vote on compensation payable to executive officers of the
Company in connection with the Merger shall be the only matters (other than
procedural matters) which the Company shall propose to be acted on by the
Company Shareholders at the Company Shareholders' Meeting. During the last ten
(10) Business Days prior to the date of the Company Shareholders' Meeting, the
Company shall, upon the reasonable request of Parent, notify Parent of the
then -current aggregate tally of the proxies received by the Company or its
Representatives with respect to the Company Shareholder Approval.

  

  

Section 6.3 Access to Information; Confidentiality.

  


 

  

(a) Access to Information. Subject to Section 6.3(b), from the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall instruct each
Company Subsidiary and each of its and their respective Representatives
(collectively, "Company Representatives") to, (i) provide to Parent and Merger
Sub and each of their respective Representatives (collectively, "Parent
Representatives") reasonable access at reasonable times during normal business
hours, upon prior notice, to the officers, employees, agents, properties,
offices and other facilities of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries and
to the books and records thereof and (ii) furnish or cause to be furnished as
promptly as reasonably practicable after request therefor such information
concerning the business, properties, Contracts, assets liabilities and
personnel of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries as Parent, Merger Sub or
any Parent Representative may reasonably request; provided that until the
Effective Time, the Company shall not be required to provide access to or
furnish any information if doing so would violate applicable Law, or where
such access to information would involve the waiver of an attorney-client
privilege so long as the Company has taken all reasonable steps to permit
inspection of or to disclose such information on a basis that does not
compromise the Company's or any Company Subsidiary's privilege with respect
thereto; provided, further, that such access and

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

46  

  

 

 

 

  

  

information shall be disclosed or granted, as applicable, to external counsel
to Parent to the extent required for the purpose of complying with applicable
Law, including Antitrust Laws.

  


 

  

(b) Confidentiality and Restrictions. With respect to the information
disclosed pursuant to Section 6.3(a), the Parties shall comply with, and shall
cause their respective Representatives to comply with, all of their respective
obligations under the NDA or any similar agreement entered into between the
Company and any Person to whom the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Company Representative provides information pursuant to this Section 6.3.

  


 

  

Section 6.4 No Solicitation of Transactions.

  


 

  

(a) At all times during the period commencing with the execution and delivery
of this Agreement and continuing until the earlier to occur of the termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1 and the Effective Time, the Company
shall not, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries not to and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives not to:

  


 

  

(i) initiate, solicit, propose, knowingly encourage (including by providing
information) or take any action to knowingly facilitate the making of any
proposal or offer that constitutes, or would reasonably be expected to lead
to, an Acquisition Proposal;

  


 

  

(ii) engage in any discussions or negotiations regarding, or provide any
information concerning the Company or any Company Subsidiary to any Person
relating to, any Acquisition Proposal or any proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal;

  


 

  

(iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or
confidentiality agreement or Takeover Provisions for the purpose of allowing
any Person to make an Acquisition Proposal; or

  


 

  

 

(iv) resolve or agree to do any of the foregoing.

 

  


 

  

The Company shall, shall cause the Company Subsidiaries and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Company Representatives to, immediately
cease all discussions and negotiations with any Person that may be ongoing
with respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or any proposal or offer that would
reasonably be expected to lead to an Acquisition Proposal, and deliver a
written notice to each such Person to the effect that the Company is ending
all discussions and negotiations with such Person with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal or any such proposal or offer, effective on the date
hereof, and the notice shall also request such Person to promptly return or
destroy all confidential information concerning the Company and the Company
Subsidiaries.

  


 

  

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in Section 6.4(a) or
anything else in this Agreement, at any time prior to the Company Shareholder
Approval

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

47  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

having been obtained, the Company, the Company Subsidiaries and the Company
Representatives may, subject to compliance with this Section 6.4(b):

  


 

  

(i) provide information in response to a request therefor to a Person who has
made an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal after the date of
this Agreement (which Acquisition Proposal does not arise out of or result
from any breach of this Section 6.4) if and only if, prior to providing such
information, the Company has received from the Person so requesting such
information an executed Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement; provided that
the Company shall promptly make available to Parent any material non-public
information concerning the Company and the Company Subsidiaries that is
provided to any Person making such Acquisition Proposal that was not
previously made available to Parent or the Parent Representatives;

  


 

  

(ii) engage or participate in any discussions or negotiations with any Person
who has made such an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal;

  


 

  

(iii) grant any waiver, amendment or release under any standstill or
confidentiality agreement or Takeover Provision with respect to an unsolicited
bona fide written Acquisition Proposal; or

  


 

  

 

(iv) resolve to do any of the foregoing;

  

  

provided that prior to taking any action described in Section 6.4(b)(i) ,
Section 6.4(b)(ii), Section 6.4(b)(iii) or Section 6.4(b)(iv), (A) the Company
Board shall have determined in good faith, after consultation with outside
legal counsel, that failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to
be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties under applicable Law, and
(B) the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, based on the
information then available and after consultation with its financial advisor
and outside legal counsel, that such Acquisition Proposal either constitutes a
Superior Proposal or is reasonably likely to result in a Superior Proposal.

 

  


 

  

(c) Except as expressly provided by Section 6.4(d), at any time after the date
hereof, neither the Company Board nor any committee thereof shall:

  


 

  

(i) (A) withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify (or publicly resolve to
withhold, withdraw, qualify or modify), in any manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the Company Board Recommendation with respect to the Merger, (B)
adopt, approve or recommend an Acquisition Proposal, (C) fail to publicly
reaffirm the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days after
Parent so requests in writing (provided that Parent shall make such request on
no more than two occasions in addition to any such request made by Parent in
connection with the announcement or commencement of an Acquisition Proposal or
any material change thereto), (D) fail to recommend, in a
Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule 14D-9, against any
Acquisition Proposal subject to Regulation 14D under the Exchange Act within
ten (10) Business Days after the commencement of such Acquisition Proposal,
(E)

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

48  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

fail to include the Company Board Recommendation in the Proxy Statement or (F)
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding or similar
document or Contract relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than any
Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section
6.4(b)) (any action described in clauses (A) through (F), a "Company Adverse
Recommendation Change"); or

  


 

  

(ii) cause or permit the Company or any Company Subsidiary to enter into any
acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar definitive agreement
relating to any Acquisition Proposal (other than any Acceptable
Confidentiality Agreement entered into in accordance with Section 6.4(b)) (an
"Alternative Acquisition Agreement").

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement, at
any time prior to the Company Shareholder Approval having been obtained:

  


 

  

(i) if the Company has received a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal from
any Person that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board concludes in good
faith constitutes a Superior Proposal, (x) the Company Board may effect a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to such Superior Proposal,
or (y) the Company Board may authorize the Company to terminate this Agreement
to enter into an Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal, in either case if and only if:

  


 

  

(A) the Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with its
financial advisor and outside legal counsel, that failure to do so would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law;

  


 

  

(B) the Company shall have complied in all material respects with its
obligations under this Section 6.4;

  


 

  

(C) the Company shall have provided prior written notice (a "Determination
Notice") to Parent at least three (3) Business Days in advance (the "Notice
Period"), to the effect that the Company Board has received a bona fide
written Acquisition Proposal that is not withdrawn and that the Company Board
has concluded in good faith constitutes a Superior Proposal and, absent any
revision to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company Board has
resolved to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change and/or to terminate
this Agreement pursuant to this Section 6.4(d)(i), which notice shall specify
the identity of the Person making the Superior Proposal and the material terms
and conditions thereof, and shall include copies of all relevant documents
relating to such Superior Proposal;

  


 

  

(D) prior to effecting such Company Adverse Recommendation Change or
termination, the Company shall, and shall cause its financial

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

and legal advisors to, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent and the
Parent Representatives in good faith (if Parent desires to negotiate) to make
such adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that such
Acquisition Proposal would cease to constitute a Superior Proposal; provided
that in the event of any material revisions during the Notice Period to the
Acquisition Proposal that the Company Board has determined to be a Superior
Proposal, the Company shall be required to deliver a new Determination Notice
to Parent and to comply with the requirements of this Section 6.4 (including
Section 6.4(d)) with respect to such new Determination Notice and the revised
Superior Proposal contemplated thereby, and a new Notice Period of three (3)
Business Days shall commence upon the delivery of such new Determination
Notice; and

  


 

  

(E) in the case of any action contemplated by clause (y) of this Section
6.4(d)(i), the Company shall have validly terminated this Agreement in
accordance with Section 8.1(c)(ii), including the payment of the Company
Termination Fee in accordance with Section 8.2(b)(i); or

  

  

(ii) other than in connection with an Acquisition Proposal, the Company Board
may take any action prohibited by clauses (A), (C) or (E) of Section 6.4(c)(i)
("Intervening Event Change of Recommendation") in response to an Intervening
Event if the Company Board shall have determined in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that failure to take such action would be
reasonably likely to be inconsistent with the directors' fiduciary duties
under applicable Law, if and only if:

  


 

  

(A) the Company shall have provided a Determination Notice to Parent for at
least the Notice Period to the effect that the Company Board has determined to
effect an Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, which notice shall
specify the Intervening Event in reasonable detail;

  


 

  

(B) prior to effecting such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation, the
Company shall, during the Notice Period, negotiate with Parent in good faith
(if Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement in such a manner that such Intervening Event no
longer necessitates such Intervening Event Change of Recommendation; and

  


 

  

(C) at or following the end of such Notice Period, the Company Board
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside legal counsel,
that such Intervening Event continues to necessitate an Intervening Event
Change of Recommendation (in each case taking into account any revisions to
this Agreement made or proposed in writing by Parent).

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  


 

  

  

None of the Company, the Company Board or any committee of the Company Board
shall enter into any agreement with any Person to limit or not to give prior
notice to Parent of its intention to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation
Change or an Intervening Event of Recommendation, or to terminate this
Agreement in light of a Superior Proposal.

  


 

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Section 6.4 shall be deemed to prohibit the
Company or the Company Board from (i) complying with its disclosure
obligations under U.S. federal or state Law with regard to an Acquisition
Proposal, including taking and disclosing to its shareholders a position
contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A
promulgated under the Exchange Act (or any similar communication to
shareholders), provided that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and
listen" communication or similar communication of the type contemplated by
Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change unless the Company Board expressly publicly reaffirms
the Company Board Recommendation within five (5) Business Days following any
request by Parent, or (ii) making any "stop, look and listen" communication or
similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act.

  


 

  

(f) The Company agrees that it will promptly (and, in any event, within 48
hours) notify Parent if any proposals or offers with respect to an Acquisition
Proposal are received by, any non-public information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company or any Company Representative with respect to an Acquisition Proposal
indicating, in connection with such notice, the identity of the Person or
group of Persons making such offer or proposal and the material terms and
conditions of any proposals or offers (including, if applicable, copies of any
written requests, proposals or offers, including proposed agreements) and
thereafter shall keep Parent reasonably informed, on a reasonably prompt
basis, of the status and material terms of any such proposals or offers
(including any material amendments thereto) and the status of any such
discussions or negotiations. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Company shall provide to Parent, as soon as practicable and in any event
within 48 hours after receipt or delivery thereof, copies of all draft
agreements (and any other written material to the extent such material
contains any financial terms, conditions or other material terms relating to
any Acquisition Proposal) sent by or provided to the Company or any Company
Representative in connection with any Acquisition Proposal.

  


 

  

(g) No Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Intervening Event Change of
Recommendation shall change the approval of the Company Board for purposes of
causing any Takeover Provision to be inapplicable to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 6.5 Reasonable Best Efforts.

  


 

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including Section
6.4, Parent and the Company shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary,

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

proper or advisable on its part under this Agreement and applicable Laws to
cause the conditions set forth in Article VII to be satisfied and to
consummate and make effective the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated hereby as soon as practicable, including preparing and filing as
promptly as practicable all documentation to effect all necessary notices,

consents, approvals, registrations, authorizations, waivers, Permits and
Orders necessary or advisable to be obtained from any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger or any of the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In furtherance and not in
limitation of the foregoing, each Party agrees to (i) make an appropriate
filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as soon as reasonably
practicable after the date of this Agreement, (ii) make all necessary
notifications, filings or registrations necessary to obtain the other Required
Antitrust Approvals as soon as reasonably practicable after the date of this
Agreement, (iii) supply as promptly as reasonably practicable any additional
information and documentary material that may be requested pursuant to the HSR
Act or any other Required Antitrust Approvals and (iv) use its reasonable best
efforts to take or cause to be taken all other actions necessary, proper or
advisable consistent with this Section 6.5 to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods, or receipt of required
authorizations, as applicable, under the HSR Act or other Antitrust Laws as
soon as practicable. Without limiting the foregoing, the Parties shall request
and shall use reasonable best efforts to obtain early termination of the
waiting period under the HSR Act.

  


 

  

(b) Each of Parent and the Company shall, upon request by the other, furnish
the other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and shareholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any statement, filing, notice or
application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Subject to applicable Laws relating to the exchange of information,
Parent and the Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the
extent practicable each will consult with the other on and consider in good
faith the views of the other in connection with, all of the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries and Representatives, that appears in any filing made
with, or written materials submitted to, any Third Party and/or any
Governmental Entity in connection with the Merger and the other transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. In exercising the foregoing rights, each of
the Company and Parent shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable.

  


 

  

(c) Subject to applicable Laws and the instructions of any Governmental
Entity, the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the
status of matters relating to the completion of the transactions contemplated
hereby, including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notices or
other communications received by Parent or any Parent Representative, or the
Company or any Company Subsidiary or Company Representative, as the case may
be, from any Third Party and/or any Governmental Entity with respect to the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby this Agreement. Neither
the Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any of its

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

other Representatives to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with the other Party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other Party the opportunity to attend and
participate thereat.

  


 

  

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the Parties
contained in Section 6.5(a) through Section 6.5(c), if any objections are
asserted with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby under any Law or
if any Action is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) by the FTC, the
DOJ or any other applicable Governmental Entity or any private party
challenging any of the transactions contemplated hereby as violative of any
Law or which would otherwise prevent, materially impede or materially delay
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, each of the Company
and Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to contest, resist and
resolve any such objections or Actions, and to have vacated, lifted, reversed
or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is
in effect and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement so as to permit consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

  

  

(e) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary but subject to
Section 6.5(f), the obligations of Parent under this Section 6.5 shall include
Parent, as a condition to obtaining any and all expirations of waiting periods
under the HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law or consents, clearances, or
approvals from any Governmental Entity necessary to consummate the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated hereby: (i) selling, divesting, or
otherwise conveying particular assets, categories, portions or parts of assets
or businesses of Parent and its Affiliates; (ii) agreeing to sell, divest, or
otherwise convey any particular asset, category, portion or part of an asset
or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries contemporaneously with or
subsequent to the Effective Time; (iii) permitting the Company to sell,
divest, or otherwise convey any of the particular assets, categories, portions
or parts of assets or business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior
to the Effective Time; (iv) licensing, holding separate or entering into
arrangements, commitments, or restrictions with respect to its respective
assets or the assets of the Company or the conduct of business arrangements of
the Parent or the Company or terminating any and all existing relationships,
contractual rights or obligations; and (v) effectuating any other change or
restructuring of Parent or the Company, in each case so as to enable the
Effective Time to occur prior to the End Date (for the avoidance of doubt, as
the End Date may be extended pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(i)).

  


 

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement
(including Section 6.5(e)), the Parties hereby agree and acknowledge that
nothing in this Section 6.5 (including the "reasonable best efforts" standard
set forth in Section 6.5(a) or 6.5(d)) shall require, or be construed to
require, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates to take or agree to
take any of the actions contemplated by clauses (i) through (v) of Section
6.5(e) if such actions, individually or in the aggregate, are reasonably
likely to have a material and adverse impact on the business, financial
condition or results

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries (including, after the Effective
Time, the Company and the Company Subsidiaries), taken as a whole.

  


 

  

Section 6.6 Notices of Certain Events. From and after the date of this
Agreement until the Effective Time, each of the Company and Parent shall
promptly notify the other orally and in writing of (a) any change, event,
circumstance or occurrence within such Party's Knowledge that, individually or
in the aggregate, would reasonably be expected to cause any condition to the
obligations of any Party to effect the Merger not to be satisfied, (b) any
Action commenced or, to any Party's Knowledge, threatened against, such Party
or any of its Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with, arising from or
otherwise relating to the Merger (the "Transaction Litigation"), or (c) to
such Party's Knowledge, the failure of such Party to comply with or satisfy
any covenant, condition or agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it
pursuant to this Agreement which, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in any condition to the obligations of any
Party to effect the Merger not to be satisfied; provided that the delivery of
any notice pursuant to this Section 6.6 shall not cure any breach of any
representation or warranty requiring disclosure of such matter prior to the
date of this Agreement or otherwise limit or affect the remedies available
hereunder to any Party.

  


 

  

Section 6.7 Transaction Litigation. The Company and Parent shall give each
other the opportunity to participate in the defense, settlement and/or
prosecution of any Transaction Litigation; provided that neither the Company
nor any Company Subsidiary or Company Representative shall compromise, settle,
come to an arrangement regarding or agree to compromise, settle or come to an
arrangement regarding any Transaction Litigation or consent to the same unless
Parent shall have consented in writing (such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed); provided, further, that after receipt of
the Company Shareholder Approval, the Company shall cooperate with Parent with
respect to, and, if requested by Parent, use its reasonable best efforts to
defend or to settle, any unresolved Transaction Litigation in accordance with

Section 6.8 Publicity.

  


 

  

(a) The initial press release regarding the execution of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby shall be a joint press release by the
Company and Parent in a mutually agreed upon form and thereafter the Company
and Parent each shall consult with the other prior to issuing any press
releases or otherwise making public announcements (including conference calls
with investors and analysts) with respect to the Merger or any other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. No Party shall issue any such
press release or make any such public announcement prior to such consultation,
except (i) to the extent the disclosing Party determines based on advice of
counsel it is required to do so by applicable Law or any listing agreement
with a stock exchange, in which case such Party shall use reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other Party before issuing any such release or
making any such public announcement or (ii) for any disclosure made pursuant
to Section 6.4, which, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, shall not be subject to the requirements of this Section 6.8(a).

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  


 

  

  

(b) Upon Parent's request, (i) the Company and Parent shall promptly prepare a
mutually acceptable joint written presentation to Institutional Shareholder
Services recommending this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
including the Merger, (ii) the Company shall request a meeting with

recommendation of the approval of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders
and (iii) the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain such
recommendation.

  


 

  

Section 6.9 Employee Matters.

  


 

  

(a) For a period of no less than twelve (12) months following the Effective
Time, Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to each Continuing Employee
(i) compensation and employee benefits (other than severance benefits or
benefits pursuant to a defined benefit pension plan) that are substantially
comparable in the aggregate to such compensation and employee benefits
provided by the Company and Company Subsidiaries to such employee immediately
prior to the Effective Time and (ii) severance benefits in an aggregate amount
that is not less than the aggregate amount of the severance benefits to which
such employee would be entitled pursuant to the terms of the severance
arrangement that covers such employee as of immediately prior to the Effective
Time; provided that this clause (ii) shall not apply to any Continuing
Employee who is party to a Termination Protection Agreement with the Company
or who is a participant in the Company's Change in Control Severance Plan. The
preceding sentence shall not preclude Parent or its Subsidiaries at any time
following the Effective Time from terminating the employment of any Continuing
Employee for any reason (or no reason).

  


 

  

(b) Each Continuing Employee shall be given credit for all service with the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries and their respective predecessors under
any employee benefit plan of Parent or its Affiliates in which such Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate, including any such plans providing
vacation, sick pay, severance and retirement benefits maintained by Parent or
its Affiliates in which such Continuing Employees participate for purposes of
eligibility, vesting and entitlement to benefits, including for severance
benefits and vacation entitlement (but not for accrual of pension benefits),
to the extent past service was recognized for such Continuing Employees under
the comparable Company Plans immediately prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 6.9(b) shall be
construed to require crediting of service that would result in (i) duplication
of benefits, (ii) service credit for benefit accruals under a defined benefit
pension plan, or (iii) service credit under a newly established plan for which
prior service is not taken into account for employees of Parent and its
Subsidiaries generally.

  


 

  

(c) In the event of any change in the welfare benefits provided to Continuing
Employees following the Effective Time, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause (i) the waiver of all limitations as to pre-
existing conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with respect to
participation and coverage requirements applicable to the Continuing Employees
under any such welfare benefit plans to the extent that such conditions,
exclusions or waiting periods would not apply in the absence of such change,

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

55  

  

 

 

 

  

  

and (ii) for the plan year in which the Effective Time occurs, the crediting
of each Continuing Employee with any co-payments and deductibles paid prior to
any such change in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements after such change.

  


 

  

(d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.9 to the contrary, nothing
contained herein, whether express or implied, shall be treated as an amendment
or other modification of any employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving
Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates, or shall
limit the right of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to amend, terminate or otherwise modify
any employee benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of
their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates following the Effective Time. If
(i) a party other than the Parties hereto makes a claim or takes other action
to enforce any provision in this Agreement as an amendment to any employee
benefit plan of Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Subsidiaries or Affiliates, and (ii) such provision is deemed to be an
amendment to such employee benefit plan even though not explicitly designated
as such in this Agreement, then, solely with respect to such employee benefit
plan, such provision shall lapse retroactively and shall have no amendatory
effect with respect thereto.

  


 

  

(e) The Parties acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this
Section 6.9 are included for the sole benefit of the Parties hereto, and that
nothing in this Agreement, whether express or implied, shall create any third
party beneficiary or other rights (i) in any other Person, including any
employees or former employees of the Company, any Company Subsidiary or any
Affiliate of the Company, any Continuing Employee, or any dependent or
beneficiary thereof, or (ii) to continued employment with Parent or any of its
Affiliates.

  


 

  

Section 6.10 Resignation of Directors. At the Closing, except as otherwise may
be agreed by Parent, the Company shall deliver to Parent the resignation of
all members of the Company Board who are in office immediately prior to the
Effective Time, which resignations shall be effective at the Effective Time.

  


 

  

Section 6.11 Indemnification of Directors and Officers.

  


 

  

(a) Parent and Merger Sub agree that all rights to exculpation,
indemnification and advancement of expenses existing in favor of the current
or former directors and officers of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
and each Person who served as a director, officer, member, trustee or
fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, pension
or other employee benefit plan or enterprise at the request of the Company
(the "Indemnified Parties") as provided in their respective charters or bylaws
or other organizational documents or under any indemnification, employment or
other similar agreements between any Indemnified Party and the Company or any
Company Subsidiary, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement,
shall survive the Merger and continue in full force and effect in accordance
with their respective terms to the extent permitted by applicable Law. For a
period of six (6) years after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
charter, bylaws and other organizational documents of the

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

Surviving Corporation and the Company Subsidiaries to contain provisions no
less favorable with respect to exculpation and indemnification of and
advancement of expenses to Indemnified Parties than are set forth as of the
date of this Agreement in the charter, bylaws and other organizational
documents of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries to the extent permitted
by applicable Law.

  


 

  

(b) The Surviving Corporation shall, and Parent shall cause the Surviving
Corporation (including by providing funding to the extent the Surviving
Corporation does not have sufficient funds), to the fullest extent permitted
under applicable Law, to indemnify and hold harmless (and advance funds in
respect of each of the foregoing) each Indemnified Party against any costs or
expenses (including advancing attorneys' fees and expenses in advance of the
final disposition of any Action to each Indemnified Party to the fullest
extent permitted by Law), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or
threatened Action by reason of the fact that such Person was a director or
officer of the Company or any Company Subsidiary or anything done or not done
by such Person in such capacity, whether before or after the Effective Time
(including acts or omissions in connection with such Persons serving as an
officer, director or other fiduciary in any entity if such service was at the
request of the Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the
Surviving Corporation shall control the defense of any such Action, and the
Indemnified Party shall cooperate with (but not control) Parent and the
Surviving Corporation in such defense. Neither Parent nor the Surviving
Corporation shall settle any such Action without the prior written consent of
the Indemnified Party unless the Surviving Corporation assumes full
responsibility for such settlement, the settlement grants the Indemnified
Party a complete release in respect of the potential liability relating to the
claims underlying such Action and such settlement does not contain any
admission detrimental to the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party shall
not settle any such Action without the prior written consent of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation unless such settlement does not provide for monetary
damages, the terms of such settlement are not in any way detrimental to Parent
or the Surviving Corporation and such settlement does not contain any
admission detrimental to Parent or the Surviving Corporation. In the event of
any payment under this Section 6.11(b), the Surviving Corporation shall be
subrogated to the extent of such payment to all rights of recovery of the
Indemnified Party with respect to any insurance covering any such liability
(including the insurance set forth in Section 6.11(c)).

  


 

  

(c) From the Effective Time through the sixth (6th) anniversary of the
Effective Time (such period, the "Tail Period"), Parent shall, or shall cause
the Surviving Corporation to, maintain in effect the Company's current
directors' and officers' liability insurance covering each officer and
director currently covered by the Company's directors' and officers' liability
insurance policy for acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time
with respect to any matter claimed against such person by reason of him or her
serving in such capacity on terms with respect to such coverage and amounts no
less favorable in the aggregate than those of such policy in effect on the
date of this Agreement; provided, that in no event shall the aggregate costs
of such insurance policies exceed in any one year during the Tail Period 250%
of the current aggregate annual premiums paid by the Company for such purpose
(which aggregate annual premiums

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

with respect to such period are hereby represented and warranted by the
Company to be in the amount set forth in Section 6.11(c) of the Company
Disclosure Schedule), it being understood that Parent or the Surviving
Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such coverage, with
respect to each year during the Tail Period, as may be obtained for such 250%
annual amount; provided, further, that Parent or the Surviving Corporation may
(i) substitute therefor policies of any reputable insurance company or (ii)
satisfy its obligation under this Section 6.11(c) by causing the Company to
obtain prepaid (or "tail") directors' and officers' liability insurance
policy, in each case, the material terms of which, including coverage and
amount, are no less favorable in the aggregate to such directors and officers
than the insurance coverage otherwise required under this Section 6.11(c).

  


 

  

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys'
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in successfully enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this Section 6.11.

  


 

  

(e) The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive the consummation of the
Merger and are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by,
each of the Indemnified Parties, their respective heirs and representatives.

  


 

  

(f) In the event Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person
and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of
such Person set forth in this Section 6.11.

  


 

  

Section 6.12 Takeover Provisions. Parent, the Company and their respective
Boards of Directors shall take all reasonable action necessary to ensure that
no Takeover Provision is or becomes applicable to this Agreement or the
Merger, and if any Takeover Provision becomes applicable to this Agreement or
the Merger, Parent, the Company and their respective Boards of Directors shall
take all action necessary to ensure that the Merger may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise to minimize the effect of such Takeover Provision on this Agreement
or the Merger.

  


 

  

Section 6.13 Section 16 Matters. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may reasonably be necessary and permitted to
cause the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including any
dispositions of shares of Company Common Stock (including Company Restricted
Stock and Company Stock-Based Awards) and other derivative securities with
respect to such shares of Company Common Stock) by each individual who is or
will be subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange
Act with respect to the Company and the conversion of Company Options as
contemplated by Section 3.5, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act.

  


 

  

Section 6.14 Stock Exchange Delisting; Exchange Act Deregistration. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable
best efforts to

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

58  

  

 

 

 

  

  

take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done all
things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under applicable
Law (including the rules and regulations of the NYSE) to cause the delisting
of the Company Common Stock from the NYSE and the deregistration of the
Company Common Stock and other securities of the Company, as applicable, under
the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after the Effective Time.

  


 

  

Section 6.15 Non-USRPHC Certificate. On the Closing Date, the Company shall
provide to Parent (a) a certification for the Company, signed under penalties
of perjury by the Company and dated not more than thirty (30) days prior to
the Closing Date, that satisfies the requirements of Treasury Regulations
Sections 1.897-2(h) and 1.1445-2(c)(3) and confirms that the Company is not,
nor has it been within five (5) years of the date of the certification, a
"United States real property holding corporation" as defined in Section 897 of
the Code and (b) proof reasonably satisfactory to Parent that the Company has
provided notice of such certification to the IRS in accordance with the
provisions of Treasury Regulations Section 1.897-2(h)(2).

  


 

  

Section 6.16 Environmental Matters. The Company shall, prior to the Closing,
use reasonable best efforts to take all actions necessary to comply with any
applicable "transaction-triggered" or "responsible property transfer"
Environmental Laws, including the New Jersey Industrial Site Recovery Act, as
amended by the Site Remediation Reform Act, and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, in each case to the extent required to permit the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

the Surviving Corporation's Electrical segment shall become a new Global
Business Unit within the Parent Group's Low Voltage Products Division and (d)
Thomas and Betts Corporation's corporate name and individual product brands

breach or inaccuracy from the Company; provided that the Company shall not
have the right to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(i)

representation, warranty, covenant or agreement of the Company contained in
this Agreement; or

  


 

  

(ii) if (A) the Company Board has authorized the Company to enter into an
Alternative Acquisition Agreement with respect to a Superior Proposal, (B) the
Company has complied in all material respects with Section 6.4 and (C)

(30) calendar days after the Company receives written notice of such breach
from Parent; provided that Parent shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(d)(i) if, at the time of such

commenced or disclosed and not unconditionally withdrawn, and (C) at any time
after the date hereof and prior to the expiration of the twelfth (12th) month
after the termination of this Agreement, (1) an Acquisition Proposal is
consummated, (2) the Company enters into any definitive agreement related to
an Acquisition Proposal that is subsequently consummated or (3) the Company
Board shall have recommended an Acquisition Proposal to the Company
Shareholders that is subsequently consummated, then, in each case, the Company
shall, on the date such Acquisition Proposal is consummated, pay the Company
Termination Fee to Parent by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more
accounts designated by Parent; provided that for purposes of this Section
8.2(b)(iii), all percentages in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall
be replaced with 50%.

  


 

  

(iv) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company be obligated to
pay, or cause to be paid, the Company Termination Fee on more than one
occasion. Parent shall have right to assign the right to receive the Company
Termination Fee to one or more Persons in its sole discretion.

  


 

  

 

(c) Expense Reimbursement.

 

  


 

  

(i) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to
Section 8.1(d)(i) under circumstances in which a Company Termination Fee is
not payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b), then the Company shall, following
receipt of an invoice therefor, promptly (and in any event within five (5)
Business Days) pay all of Parent's reasonable and documented out-of-pocket
fees and expenses (including reasonable legal fees and expenses) actually
incurred by Parent and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this
Agreement in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(the "Parent Expenses"), which amount shall in no event exceed $20,000,000 in
the aggregate, by wire transfer of same day funds to one or more accounts
designated by Parent; provided that the

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

64  

  

 

 

 

  

  

existence of circumstances which could require the Company Termination Fee to
become subsequently payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b) shall
not relieve the Company of its obligations to pay the Parent Expenses pursuant
to this Section 8.2(c); provided, further, that the payment by the Company of
Parent Expenses pursuant to this Section 8.2(c) shall not relieve the Company
of any subsequent obligation to pay the Company Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 8.2(b).

  


 

  

(ii) In the event that a Company Termination Fee is payable by the Company to
Parent pursuant to Section 8.2(b), a portion of such Company Termination Fee
equal to the amount of Parent Expenses (less the amount of any Parent Expenses
previously paid by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(c)(i), if any) shall be
allocated as reimbursement of Parent Expenses. For the avoidance of doubt, in
no event shall any such allocation reduce or increase the amount of any
Company Termination Fee payable by the Company pursuant to Section 8.2(b).

  

  

(iii) In the event the Company pays the Parent Expenses pursuant to Section
8.2(c)(i), the amount of such Parent Expenses actually paid shall be credited
against any Company Termination Fee payable by the Company pursuant to Section
8.2(b).

  


 

  

(d) Acknowledgement. Each Party acknowledges that (i) the agreements contained
in this Section 8.2 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated in
this Agreement, (ii) the damages resulting from termination of this Agreement
under circumstances where any amount is payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or
Section 8.2(c) are uncertain and incapable of accurate calculation and,
therefore, the amounts payable pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c)
are not a penalty but rather constitute liquidated damages in a reasonable
amount that will compensate Parent for the efforts and resources expended and
opportunities foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on
this Agreement and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and (iii) without the agreements contained in this
Section 8.2, Parent would not have entered into this Agreement. Subject to the
final proviso of the first sentence of Section 8.2(a), in the event the
Company Termination Fee is paid pursuant to Section 8.2(b), Parent's right to
receive payment of the Company Termination Fee shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy of Parent and its Affiliates and Representatives against the Company
and its Affiliates and Representatives under this Agreement or arising out of
or related to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, and upon
payment of such amount, none of the Company or any of its Affiliates or
Representatives shall have any liability or obligation relating to or arising
out of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, in each case
whether based on contract, tort or strict liability, by the enforcement of any
assessment, by any legal or equitable proceeding, by virtue of any applicable
Laws or otherwise. If the Company fails to promptly pay any amount due
pursuant to Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c) and, in order to obtain such
payment, Parent commences a suit that results in a judgment against the
Company for an amount set forth in Section 8.2(b) or Section 8.2(c) or any
portion thereof, the Company shall pay to Parent all costs and expenses
(including attorneys'

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

fees) incurred by Parent and its Affiliates in connection with such suit,
together with interest on such amount at the prime rate as published in the
Wall Street Journal in effect on the date such payment was required to be made
through the date of payment.

  


 

  

Section 8.3 Extension; Waiver. At any time prior to the Effective Time, the
Parties may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and subject to Section
8.4, (i) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or
other acts of the other Parties, (ii) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto or (iii) waive compliance with any of the agreements or
conditions contained herein; provided that after the Company Shareholder
Approval has been obtained, there shall be made no waiver that by Law
(including the applicable rules and regulations of any stock exchange)
requires further approval by the Company Shareholders without the further
approval of such shareholders. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in a written
instrument signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to assert
any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall not constitute a
waiver of those rights.

  


 

  

Section 8.4 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended by the Parties by action
taken by or on behalf of their respective Boards of Directors at any time
prior to the Effective Time, whether before or after the Company Shareholder
Approval having been obtained, if required by applicable Law; provided that
after the Company Shareholder Approval has been obtained, there shall be made
no amendment that by Law (including the applicable rules and regulations of
any stock exchange) requires further approval by the Company Shareholders
without the further approval of such shareholders. This Agreement may not be
amended except by an instrument in writing signed by Parent and the Company.

Section 9.4 Severability. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is
invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced by any rule of Law or public
policy, all other conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall
nevertheless remain in full force and effect so long as the economic or legal
substance of the transactions contemplated hereby is not affected in any
manner materially adverse to any Party. Upon such determination that any term
or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the
Parties shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible to the end that
transactions contemplated hereby are fulfilled to the greatest extent
possible.

  


 

  

Section 9.5 Entire Agreement. This Agreement (together with the Exhibits, the
Company Disclosure Schedule and the other documents delivered pursuant hereto)
and the NDA constitute the entire agreement of the Parties and supersede all
prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, among the Parties,
or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof.

  


 

  

Section 9.6 Specific Performance. The Parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof, and, accordingly, that the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement
or to enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions hereof,
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity. Each Party hereby waives (a) any defense to any action for specific
performance based on the argument that a remedy at law would be adequate, and
(b) any requirement under any Law to post a bond or other security as a
prerequisite to obtaining equitable relief.

  


 

  

Section 9.7 Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  


 

  

(a) This Agreement and all claims or causes of action (whether in contract,
tort or otherwise) that may be based upon, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution or performance of this Agreement
(including any claim or cause of action based upon, arising out of or related
to any representation or warranty made in or in connection with this Agreement
or as an inducement to enter into this Agreement), shall be construed,
performed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of Delaware
without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict of laws to the
extent such principles or rules would require or permit the application of the
Laws of another jurisdiction, except with respect to matters relating to the
Merger that are mandatorily subject to the requirements of the TBCA and
matters relating to fiduciary duties of the Company Board, which shall be
governed by Tennessee Law.

  


 

  

(b) Any Action against, arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby shall be brought solely and exclusively in
the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware; provided that if (and only
after) such court determines that it lacks subject matter jurisdiction over
any such legal Action, such legal Action shall be brought in the Federal
courts of the United States located in the State of Delaware. Each of the
Parties agrees that a final judgment (subject to any appeals therefrom) in any
such Action shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by Law. Each Party hereby
irrevocably

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

68  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in respect of any legal
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby, and hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, to the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any
objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any
Action arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby in any such court in accordance with the provisions of
this Section 9.7. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, the defense of an
inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or proceeding in any such
court. Each of the Parties hereby irrevocably and unconditionally consents to
service of process in the manner provided for notices in Section 9.2 (Notices)
in any Action relating to this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will limit
or otherwise affect the right of any Party to serve process in any other
manner permitted by Law.

  


 

  

(c) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE
UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES,
AND THEREFORE EACH SUCH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES
ANY RIGHT SUCH PARTY MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LITIGATION
DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY, INCLUDING ANY CONTROVERSY INVOLVING ANY
MEMBER OF THE PARENT GROUP UNDER ANY THIS AGREEMENT. EACH PARTY CERTIFIES AND
ACKNOWLEDGES THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY
HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN
THE EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER, (ii) EACH PARTY
UNDERSTANDS AND HAS CONSIDERED THE IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) EACH
PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY AND (iv) EACH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO
ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND
CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS SECTION 9.7(C).

  


 

  

Section 9.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in Section 6.11
(Indemnification of Directors and Officers) and, following the Effective Time,
the right of the Company's stockholders to receive the Merger Consideration in
respect of shares of Company Common Stock pursuant to Section 3.1 (Conversion
of Securities), each Party hereby agrees that its respective representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Agreement are solely for the
benefit of the other Parties, in accordance with and subject to the terms of
this Agreement, and this Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer
upon any Person other than the Parties any rights or remedies hereunder,
including the right to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth
in this Agreement. The Parties further agree that the rights of third party
beneficiaries under Section 6.11 (Indemnification of Directors and Officers)
shall not arise unless and until the Effective Time occurs.

  


 

  

Section 9.9 Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned by any of the Parties
(whether by operation of Law or otherwise) without the prior written consent
of the other Parties; provided that prior to the Closing, Parent and Merger
Sub may assign this Agreement to any wholly-owned Subsidiary of Parent. No
assignment by any Party shall relieve such Party of any of its obligations

  


 

  


 

  

 

 

 

  

 

69  

  

 

 

 

  


 

  

  

hereunder. Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement will be binding upon,
inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the Parties and their respective
successors and permitted assigns.

  


 

  

Section 9.10 Obligations of Parent and the Company. Whenever this Agreement
requires a Subsidiary of Parent to take any action, such requirement shall be
deemed to include an undertaking on the part of Parent to cause such
Subsidiary to take such action. Whenever this Agreement requires a Company
Subsidiary to take any action, such requirement shall be deemed to include an
undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Company Subsidiary to
take such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving
Corporation to cause such Company Subsidiary to take such action.

  


 

  

Section 9.11 Independence of Agreements, Covenants, Representations and
Warranties. All agreements and covenants hereunder shall be given independent
effect so that if a certain action or condition constitutes a default under a
certain agreement or covenant, the fact that such action or condition is
permitted by another agreement or covenant shall not affect the occurrence of
such default. In addition, all representations and warranties hereunder shall
be given independent effect so that if a particular representation or warranty
proves to be incorrect or is breached, the fact that another representation or
warranty concerning the same or similar subject matter is correct or is not
breached will not affect the incorrectness of or a breach of a representation
and warranty hereunder.

  


 

  

Section 9.12 Mutual Drafting. Each Party has participated in the drafting of
this Agreement, which each Party acknowledges is the result of extensive
negotiations between the Parties.

  


 

  

Section 9.13 Headings . The headings contained in this Agreement are for
reference purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or
interpretation of this Agreement.

  


 

  

Section 9.14 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or more
counterparts, and by the different Parties in separate counterparts, each of
which when executed shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

  


 

  

Section 9.15 Delivery by Facsimile or E-mail. This Agreement, and any
amendments hereto, waivers hereof or consents or notifications hereunder, to
the extent signed and delivered by means of a facsimile machine or by e-mail
with facsimile or scan attachment, shall be treated in all manner and respects
as an original contract and shall be considered to have the same binding legal
effects as if it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person.
At the request of any Party, each other Party shall re-execute original forms
thereof and deliver them to all other Parties. No Party shall raise the use of
a facsimile machine or e-mail to deliver a signature or the fact that any
signature or Contract was transmitted or communicated through the use of
facsimile machine or by e-mail with facsimile or scan attachment as a defense
to the formation of a contract, and each such Party forever waives any such
defense.
