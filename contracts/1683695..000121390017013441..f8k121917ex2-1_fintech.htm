") shall prepare or cause to be prepared, at Parent's expense, and deliver to
the Stockholder Representative, together with related supporting calculations
and work papers and back-up materials relating thereto (in the case of work

Representative), a written statement setting forth in reasonable detail
Parent's calculation of the Equity Value, together with (i) a consolidated

(c) During the 45-day period immediately following the Stockholder
Representative's receipt of the Final Closing Statement, the Stockholder
Representative and its representatives (including its financial advisors,
accountants and consultants) will be permitted to review, during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, Parent's books and records
and the working papers related to the preparation of the Final Closing
Statement. The Final Closing Statement (including the determinations included
therein) will become final, binding and conclusive upon Parent, the Surviving
Entity and the Stockholder Representative (a) on the 45th day following the
Stockholder Representative's receipt thereof, unless the Stockholder
Representative delivers to Parent Representative prior to such 45th day
written notice of the Stockholder Representative's disagreement (a " _Dispute
Notice_ ") with any amount or determination set forth in the Final Closing
Statement or (b) on such earlier date as the Stockholder Representative
notifies the Parent Representative in writing that it does not dispute the
Final Closing Statement. Any Dispute Notice will specify in reasonable detail
the nature and dollar amount of any disagreement so asserted (collectively,
the " _Disputed Items_ "). If the Stockholder Representative timely delivers
a Dispute Notice to the Parent Representative, then the determination of the
Equity Value, Closing Cash, Closing Net Working Capital, Closing
Indebtedness, and Closing Reimbursable Transaction Expenses will
become final, binding and conclusive upon Parent, the Surviving Entity and
the Stockholder Representative on the first to occur of (x) the date on which
the Parent Representative and the Stockholder Representative resolve in
writing all differences they have with respect to the Disputed Items or (y)
the date on which all of the Disputed Items that are not resolved by the
Parent Representative and the Stockholder Representative in writing are
finally resolved in writing by the Accounting Firm in accordance with
_Section 2.8(d)_. The Stockholder Representative shall be deemed to have
agreed with any amounts and items contained in the Final Closing Statement to
the extent such amounts and items are not raised in the Dispute Notice.

  



  

(d) During the 30 days following delivery of a Dispute Notice, the Parent
Representative and the Stockholder Representative will seek in good faith
to resolve in writing any differences that they have with respect to all of
the Disputed Items. Unless otherwise agreed by the Parent Representative and
the Stockholder Representative, any such discussions related thereto shall be
governed by Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and any applicable
similar state rule. If the Parent Representative and the Stockholder
Representative do not reach agreement on all of the Disputed Items during
such 30-day period (or such longer period as they shall mutually agree),
then at the end of such 30-day (or such longer period as they shall mutually
agree) period the Parent Representative and the Stockholder Representative
will submit all unresolved Disputed Items (collectively, the " _Unresolved
Items_ ") to the Accounting Firm to review and resolve such matters. The
parties shall instruct the Accounting Firm (i) not to assign a value to any
item in dispute greater than the greatest value or lower than the lowest
value assigned by the Parent Representative or the
Stockholder Representative, and (ii) to make a final determination (the "
_Final Determination_ ") not later than 30 calendar days following submission
of the Unresolved Items to the Accounting Firm. The Final Determination will
be final, binding and conclusive on Parent, the Parent Representative, the
Company and the Stockholder Representative with respect to the Unresolved
Items effective as of the date the Accounting Firm's written determination is
received by the Parent Representative and the Stockholder Representative. The
Accounting Firm's determination shall not be subject to review or appeal,
absent a showing of fraud or manifest error. The costs, fees and
disbursements of the Accounting Firm shall be paid by the Surviving Entity.

(e) Upon the determination, in accordance with _Sections 2.8(b)_ , _(c)_
and _(d)_ above, of the Final Closing Statement and any Final Determination
made, the Equity Value shall be recalculated using the amounts so determined
pursuant to _Sections 2.8(c)_ and _2.8(d_ ) above in lieu of the amounts
used in the Estimated Closing Statement, and the Cash Merger Consideration
will be adjusted by any difference between the Estimated Equity Value and the
final Equity Value so determined in accordance with this paragraph (e) (the "
_Final Adjustment_ "). If the final Equity Value is greater than the
Estimated Equity Value, then (i) Parent shall pay or cause to be paid the
amount of such excess to the Stockholder Representative or its designees and
(ii) Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly deliver a joint
written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release all of the funds in the
Adjustment Escrow Account to the Stockholder Representative or its designees.
If the final Equity Value is less than the Estimated Equity Value (the amount
of such difference, the " _Return Amount_ "), then Parent and the Stockholder
Representative shall promptly deliver a joint written instruction to the
Escrow Agent to release to Parent from the Adjustment Escrow Account the
lesser of (x) the Return Amount, and (y) the Adjustment Escrow Amount, it
being understood and agreed that Parent's sole recourse with respect to the
Return Amount shall be the funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account. If any
funds remain in the Adjustment Escrow Account after releasing the Return
Amount to Parent, Parent and the Stockholder Representative shall promptly
deliver a joint written instruction to the Escrow Agent to release such
remaining funds in the Adjustment Escrow Account to the Stockholder
Representative or its designees. Any payment required under this paragraph (e)
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds within three
(3) Business Days after the determination of the Final Adjustment pursuant to
this paragraph (e).

  



  

(f) Concurrent with the Closing, Parent will deliver $2,000,000 (such amount,
the " _Adjustment Escrow Amount_ ") in immediately available funds into an
escrow account (the " _Adjustment Escrow Account_ "), such account to be
established and maintained by the Escrow Agent pursuant to the terms and
conditions of an escrow agreement substantially in the form of _Annex E_
attached hereto, to be entered into on the Closing Date by Parent, the
Stockholder Representative and the Escrow Agent (the " _Escrow Agreement_ ").
All fees, costs and expenses of the Escrow Agent will be borne by the
Surviving Entity.

  



  

Section 2.9 _Withholding Rights_. Each of Parent or Merger Sub 1 or anyone
acting on their behalf shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the
payment of any Merger Consideration payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person such amounts as are required to be deducted and withheld with respect
to the making of any such payment under any applicable tax Law. Any sum which
is withheld as permitted by this _Section 2.9_ shall be remitted to the
appropriate Governmental Authority and Parent shall provide the Stockholder
Representative with all appropriate or required reports showing such
withholding. As of the date hereof, Parent is not aware of any such
withholding obligation. Upon becoming aware of any such withholding
obligation, Parent shall promptly provide Stockholder Representative with
written notice (which notice shall describe the basis for such deduction or
withholding), and shall provide the Stockholder Representative with a
reasonable opportunity to provide such forms, certificates or other evidence,
and reasonably cooperate with the Stockholder Representative, to eliminate or
reduce any such required deduction or withholding. Subject to the foregoing,
to the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid to the proper Governmental
Authority pursuant to any applicable tax Law, such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to such Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made.

  



  

Section 2.10 _Adjustments_. Without limiting the other provisions of this
Agreement, if at any time during the period between the date of this
Agreement and the First Merger Effective Time, any change in the outstanding
shares of capital stock of Parent shall occur, including by reason of any
reclassification, recapitalization, stock split (including reverse stock
split) or combination, exchange or readjustment of shares, or any stock
dividend or distribution paid in stock, the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock to be issued as Common Stock Merger Consideration shall be
appropriately adjusted to reflect such change.

  



  

Section 2.11 _Taking of Necessary Action; Further Action_. If at any time
after the First Merger Effective Time or the Second Merger Effective Time any
further action is reasonably necessary or desirable to carry out the purposes
of this Agreement and to vest the Surviving Entity with full right, title and
possession to all assets, property, rights, privileges, powers and franchises
of the Company or any of the Merger Subs, the officers and managers of the
Surviving Entity will be fully authorized in the name of the Company or any
of the Merger Subs, as the case may be, to take and shall take any and all
such lawful and necessary action.

Authority necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

timing and content of all public announcements regarding any aspect of this
Agreement, the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated hereby, whether

Law. Notwithstanding the foregoing, each party shall use its reasonable best
efforts to consult with the other parties prior to any such announcement to

Regulation FD promulgated under the Exchange Act, to employees.

  



  

Section 6.5 _Stockholder Consent_. The Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to obtain, as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date

as payments to any Person with respect to such consents, waivers, approvals
and notices shall be borne by the party seeking such consents, waivers,
approvals or notices. In the event the Closing does not occur, any such costs
shall be borne by the Person incurring such costs.

Section 6.7 _Director and Officer Indemnification_.

  



  

(a) During the period from and after the date hereof until the Second Merger
Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Surviving Entity to ensure, and
the Surviving Entity immediately following the Second Merger Effective Time
shall ensure, that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses,
and limitation of liability now existing in favor of any individual who, at or
prior to the Second Merger Effective Time, was a director, officer, employee
or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who, at the request of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer,
member, trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise
(collectively, with such individual's heirs, executors or administrators, the
" _Indemnified Persons_ ") solely to the extent provided in the respective
governing documents and indemnification or similar agreements to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party or bound, shall survive
the Mergers and shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six
(6) years from the Second Merger Effective Time and indemnification or
similar agreements and the provisions with respect to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, and limitations on liability set forth in such
governing documents shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in
any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Indemnified Persons
thereunder; _provided_ , that in the event any claim or claims are asserted or
made within such six (6) year period, all rights to indemnification,
advancement of expenses, and limitation of liability in respect of any such
claim or claims shall continue until final disposition of any and all such
claims. Neither Parent nor the Surviving Entity shall settle, compromise or
consent to the entry of judgment in any Legal Proceeding or threatened Legal
Proceeding involving or potentially involving one or more Indemnified Persons
without obtaining (i) an express, complete and unconditional release for any
such Indemnified Person (and their respective directors, officers, employees
and Representatives) or (ii) written consent from any such Indemnified
Person.

  



  

(b) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall obtain, in consultation with
Parent, and pay for a "tail" officers' and directors' liability insurance
policy with a claims period of six (6) years from the Second Merger Effective
Time with at least the same coverage and amount and containing terms and
conditions that are, in the aggregate, not less advantageous to the directors
and officers of the Company as the Company's existing policies with respect
to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred before or at
the Second Merger Effective Time (including in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement) (the " _D andO Tail Policy_").
Parent shall bear the cost of the DandO Tail Policy as a Reimbursable
Transaction Expense, _provided_ , that Parent shall not be responsible for an
amount in excess of 300% of the annual premium currently paid by the Company
for its existing officers' and directors' liability insurance policy. During
the term of the DandO Tail Policy, Parent shall not (and shall cause the
Surviving Entity not to) take any action following the Closing to cause the
DandO Tail Policy to be cancelled or any provision therein to be amended or
waived.

  



  

(c) From and after the Second Merger Effective Time, Parent shall cause the
Surviving Entity to, and the Surviving Entity shall, indemnify, defend and
hold harmless, as set forth as of the date hereof in the organizational
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries and to the fullest extent
permitted under applicable Law, all Indemnified Persons with respect to all
acts and omissions arising out of such individuals' services as officers,
directors, employees or agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or as
trustees or fiduciaries of any plan for the benefit of employees of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, occurring at or prior to the Second
Merger Effective Time, including the execution of, and the transactions
contemplated by, this Agreement. Without limitation of the foregoing, in the
event that any such Indemnified Person is or becomes involved, in any
capacity, in any action, proceeding or investigation in connection with any
matter for which indemnification is available pursuant to the foregoing
sentence, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Surviving Entity, from and after the Second Merger Effective Time, shall
pay, as incurred, such Indemnified Person's legal and other expenses
(including the cost of any investigation and preparation) incurred in
connection therewith, within thirty (30) days after any request for
advancement (including attorneys' fees which may be incurred by any
Indemnified Person in enforcing this _Section 6.7_ ), subject to receipt of an
undertaking from such Indemnified Person to repay such advancement if such
Indemnified Person is ultimately determined to not be entitled to
indemnification hereunder.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, the obligations of Parent
and the Surviving Entity contained in this _Section 6.7_ shall be
binding upon the successors and assigns of Parent and the Surviving Entity.
In the event Parent or the Surviving Entity, or any of their respective
successors or assigns, (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person,
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties or assets to any
Person, then, and in each case, proper provision shall be made so that the
successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the case may be,
honor the indemnification and other obligations set forth in this  _Section
6.7_.

  



  

(e) This _Section 6.7_ shall survive the consummation of the Mergers, is
intended to benefit, and shall be enforceable by each Indemnified Person and
their respective successors, heirs and representatives, and shall not be
amended in any manner that is adverse to an Indemnified Person without the
prior written consent of the Stockholder Representative.

  



  

Section 6.8 _Proxy Statement; Parent Stockholders ' Meeting_.

  



  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable after the date of this Agreement,
Parent shall, in consultation with the Company, prepare and file a
registration statement pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act ("
_Registration Statement_ "), including a proxy statement of Parent, on Form
S-4 with the SEC (as such filing is amended or supplemented, the " _Proxy
Statement_ ") for the purposes of (i) registering the Common Stock Merger
Consideration under the Securities Act, (ii) providing Parent's
stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of Parent Common
Stock in connection with the Mergers and (iii) soliciting proxies from
Parent's stockholders to obtain the requisite approval of the transactions
contemplated hereby and the other matters to be voted on at a meeting of the
holders of Parent Common Stock to be called and held for such purpose (the "
_Parent Stockholders ' Meeting_"). As promptly as reasonably practicable
after the execution of this Agreement, Parent shall, in consultation with the
Company, prepare and file any other filings required under, and in accordance
with, the Exchange Act, the Securities Act, the applicable NASDAQ listing
rules or any other Laws relating to the transactions contemplated hereby
(collectively, the " _Other Filings_ "). Parent shall notify the Company
promptly upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other Governmental Authority for
amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing or for
additional information. As promptly as practicable after receipt thereof,
Parent shall provide the Company and its counsel with copies of all written
correspondence between Parent or any of its representatives, on the one hand,
and the SEC, or its staff or other government officials, on the other hand,
with respect to the Proxy Statement or any Other Filing. Parent shall permit
the Company and its counsel to review the Proxy Statement and any exhibits,
amendments or supplements thereto and shall consult with the Company and its
advisors, in good faith, concerning any comments from the SEC with respect
thereto, and shall reasonably consider and take into account the reasonable
suggestions, comments or opinions of the Company and its advisors, and shall
not file the Proxy Statement or any exhibits, amendments or supplements
thereto or any response letters to any comments from the SEC without the
prior written consent of the Company, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed; _provided,_ _however_ , that Parent
shall be permitted to make such filing or response in the absence of such
consent if the basis of the Company's failure to consent is the Company's
unwillingness to permit the inclusion in such filing or response of
information that, based on the advice of outside counsel to Parent, is
required by the SEC and United States securities Laws to be included therein.
Whenever any event occurs which would reasonably be expected to result in the
Proxy Statement containing any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitting to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
made, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, Parent or the Company, as the case may be, shall promptly inform
the other party of such occurrence and cooperate in filing with the SEC or its
staff or any other government officials, and/or mailing to stockholders of
Parent, an amendment or supplement to the Proxy Statement.

(b) The Proxy Statement will be sent to the stockholders of Parent as soon as
practicable following its approval by the SEC (but in any event, within
five (5) Business Days following such approval) for the purpose of soliciting
proxies from holders of Parent Common Stock to vote at the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting in favor of: (i) the adoption of this Agreement and the
approval of the Mergers and other transactions contemplated hereby; (ii) an
amendment to Parent's certificate of incorporation and bylaws in a form
reasonably satisfactory to Parent and the Company to increase the authorized
number of shares of Parent Common Stock, change the name of Parent to
"Intermex Wire Transfer, Inc.", and such other changes as agreed by Parent and
the Company (the " _Parent Charter and Bylaws Amendment_ "); (iii) approval
as required by the applicable NASDAQ listing rules of the issuance and sale
of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued as Common Stock Merger
Consideration; (iv) approval of the Parent equity compensation plan in the
form attached hereto as _Annex F_ , which provides for 8.5% of the outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock (on a fully diluted basis and without taking
into account any warrants of Parent) after giving effect to the transactions
contemplated hereby to be reserved for issuance (as adjusted based upon the
final determination of the assumptions set forth in _Section 5.11_  of the
Parent Disclosure Schedules prior to the Closing) (the " _Parent Equity
Compensation Plan_ "), (v) approval of any matters as agreed by Parent and
the Company and (vi) the adjournment of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting (the
matters described in clauses (i) through (vi), shall be referred to as the "
_Voting Matters_ " and approval of the Voting Matters by the stockholders of
Parent at the Parent Stockholders' Meeting or any postponement or adjournment
thereof shall be referred to as the " _Parent Stockholder Approval_").

  



  

(c) The Company shall provide Parent, as promptly as reasonably practicable,
with such information concerning the Company Entities as may be necessary for
the information concerning the Company Entities in the Proxy Statement and the
Other Filings to comply with all applicable provisions of and rules under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the DGCL in connection with the
preparation, filing and distribution of the Proxy Statement, the solicitation
of proxies thereunder, the calling and holding of the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting and the preparation and filing of the Other Filings.
The information relating to the Company Entities furnished by or on behalf of
the Company Entities for inclusion in the Proxy Statement will not, as of the
date of mailing of the Proxy Statement to the holders of Parent Common Stock
or at the time of the Parent Stockholders' Meeting, contain any statement
which, at such time and in light of the circumstances under which it is made,
is false or misleading with respect to any material fact, or omit to state
any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not false or misleading. Without limiting the
foregoing, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to ensure that the
Proxy Statement does not, as of the date on which it is distributed to the
holders of Parent Common Stock, and as of the date of the Parent
Stockholders' Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or
omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (
_provided_ that Parent shall not be responsible for the accuracy or
completeness of any information relating to the Company or any other
information furnished in writing by any Company Entity for inclusion in the
Proxy Statement).

Section 9.3 _Annexes, Exhibits and Schedules_. All annexes, exhibits and
schedules attached hereto, the Parent Disclosure Schedules, and the Company
Disclosure Schedules are hereby incorporated in and made a part of this
Agreement as if set forth in full herein.

  



  

Section 9.4 _Computation of Time_. Whenever the last day for the exercise of
any privilege or the discharge or any duty hereunder shall fall upon a day
that is not a Business Day, the party having such privilege or duty may
exercise such privilege or discharge such duty on the next succeeding day
which is a Business Day.

  



  

Section 9.5 _Expenses_. Regardless of whether the transactions provided for
in this Agreement are consummated, except as otherwise provided herein, each
party hereto shall pay its own expenses incident to this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated herein; _provided_ , that Parent shall pay at the
Closing (and Parent shall be solely responsible for) all Reimbursable
Transaction Expenses. All necessary Tax Returns and other documentation with
respect to all Transfer Taxes, fees and charges shall be filed by the party
required by Law to file them.

  



  

Section 9.6 _Governing Law_. This Agreement, the rights and duties of the
parties hereto, and any disputes (whether in contract, tort or statute)
arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement will be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the Laws of the State of
Delaware, without giving effect to its principles or rules of conflict
of laws to the extent such principles or rules would require or permit the
application of the Laws of another jurisdiction. The parties irrevocably and
unconditionally submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or, if such court does not have
jurisdiction, the Delaware state courts located in Wilmington, Delaware, in
any action arising out of or relating to this Agreement. The parties
irrevocably agree that all such claims shall be heard and determined in
such a Delaware federal or state court, and that such jurisdiction of such
courts with respect thereto will be exclusive. Each party hereby waives, and
agrees not to assert, as a defense in any action, suit or proceeding arising
out of or relating to this Agreement that it is not subject to such
jurisdiction, or that such action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is
not maintainable in such courts or that the venue thereof may not be
appropriate or that this Agreement may not be enforced in or by such
courts. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of any such
dispute and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with
any such action, suit or proceeding in the manner provided in _Section 9.1_
or in such other manner as may be permitted by Law, will be valid and
sufficient service thereof.

  



  

Section 9.7 _Assignment; Successors and Assigns; No Third Party Rights_.
Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement may not, without the
prior written consent of the other parties hereto, be assigned by operation of
Law or otherwise, and any attempted assignment shall be null and void.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to
the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective heirs, successors,
permitted assigns and legal representatives, and nothing herein, express or
implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or
equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by
reason of this Agreement; _provided_ , that the Indemnified Persons who are
not otherwise party to this Agreement shall be third party beneficiaries of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Parent and/or the Merger Subs
may assign this Agreement without the consent of any Person to any lender (or
agent therefor) to Parent or the Merger Subs or their subsidiaries or
Affiliates thereof as security for obligations to such lender (or lenders) in
respect of any financing agreements or arrangements entered into by Parent or
the Merger Subs or their subsidiaries and affiliates with such lenders or to
an acquirer of all or substantially all of the assets or business of Parent or
the Merger Subs in any form of transaction, which assignment shall not
relieve Parent or any Merger Sub of its obligations hereunder.

Section 9.8 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts for the convenience of the parties hereto, each of which shall
be deemed an original and all of which together will constitute one and the
same instrument. Delivery of an executed counterpart of a signature page to
this Agreement by facsimile or portable document format shall be effective
as delivery of a mutually executed counterpart to this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.9 _Titles and Headings_. The titles, captions and table of contents
in this Agreement are for reference purposes only, and shall not in any way
define, limit, extend or describe the scope of this Agreement or otherwise
affect the meaning or interpretation of this Agreement.

  



  

Section 9.10 _Entire Agreement_. Except as otherwise contemplated herein,
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements constitute the entire agreement
with respect to the subject matter contained herein and therein, and supersede
all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, with respect
to such subject matter. In the event of any inconsistency between the
statements in the body of this Agreement and those in the Ancillary
Agreements, the exhibits, annexes, schedules, the Parent Disclosure
Schedules and the Company Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception
expressly set forth as such in the Parent Disclosure Schedules or the Company
Disclosure Schedules, as applicable), the statements in the body of this
Agreement shall control.

  



  

Section 9.11 _Severability_. The invalidity of any portion hereof shall not
affect the validity, force or effect of the remaining portions hereof. If it
is ever held that any restriction hereunder is too broad to permit enforcement
of such restriction to its fullest extent, such restriction shall be enforced
to the maximum extent permitted by Law.

  



  

Section 9.12 _Specific Performance_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur if any provision of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with the terms hereof and it is accordingly agreed that the parties
will be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of
this Agreement in any court specified in _Section 9.6_ , in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction, specific
performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the basis that
(x) any party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of specific
performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity; for
the avoidance of doubt, the parties may argue that no breach has occurred.
Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish
or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition
to obtain any remedy referred to in this _Section 9.12_ , and each party
irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing
or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

  



  

Section 9.13 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. To the extent not prohibited by
applicable law that cannot be waived, each of the parties hereto irrevocably
waives any right it may have to trial by jury in respect of any litigation
based on, arising out of, under or in connection with this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements or any course of conduct, course of dealing, verbal or
written statement or action of any party hereto or thereto, in each case,
whether now existing or hereafter arising, and whether in contract, tort,
statute, equity or otherwise. Each party hereby further agrees and consents
that any such litigation shall be decided by court trial without a jury and
that the parties to this Agreement may file a copy of this Agreement with any
court as written evidence of the consent of the parties to the waiver of
their right to trial by jury.

  



  

Section 9.14 _Failure or Indulgence not Waiver_. No failure or delay on the
part of any party hereto in the exercise of any right hereunder shall impair
such right or be construed to be waiver of, or acquiescence in, any breach of
any representation, warranty or agreement herein, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any such right preclude any other or further
exercise thereof or any other right. All rights and remedies existing under
this Agreement are cumulative to, and not exclusive of, any rights or
remedies otherwise available.

  



  

Section 9.15 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended, at any time prior
to the First Merger Effective Time, by an instrument in writing signed on
behalf of Parent, the Merger Subs and the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that after the Parent Stockholder Approval is obtained, there shall be no
amendment or waiver that, pursuant to applicable Law, requires
further approval of the stockholders of Parent, without the receipt of such
further approvals.

ARTICLE IV

  



  

 _INDEMNIFICATION_

  



  

4.1 _Right to Indemnification_. The Company shall indemnify any person who
was or is party or is threatened to be made a party to any threatened,
pending or completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (a "proceeding"), by reason of the fact that
such person is or was a director or officer of the Company or a constituent
corporation absorbed in a consolidation or merger, or is or was serving at
the request of the Company or a constituent corporation absorbed in a
consolidation or merger, as a director or officer of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, or is or was a
director or officer of the Company serving at its request as an administrator,
trustee or other fiduciary of one or more of the employee benefit plans of
the Company or other enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys\'
fees), liability and loss actually and reasonably incurred or suffered by
such person in connection with such proceeding, whether or not the indemnified

proceeding by or in the right of the Company, except to the extent that such
indemnification is prohibited by applicable law.

  



  

4.2 _Advance of Expenses_. Expenses incurred by a director or officer of the
Company in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of

indemnification or advance of expenses under this Article IV is permissible,
the board of directors by a majority vote of a quorum consisting of directors
not parties to such proceeding may, and on request of any person seeking
indemnification or advance of expenses shall be required to, determine in each
case whether the applicable standards in any applicable statute have been
met, or such determination shall be made by independent legal counsel if such
quorum is not obtainable, or, even if obtainable, a majority vote of a quorum
of disinterested directors so directs, provided that, if there has been a
change in control of the Company between the time of the action or failure to
act giving rise to the claim for indemnification or advance of expenses and
the time such claim is made, at the option of the person seeking
indemnification or advance of expenses, the permissibility of indemnification
or advance of expenses shall be determined by independent legal counsel. The
reasonable expenses of any director or officer in prosecuting a successful
claim for indemnification, and the fees and expenses of any special legal
counsel engaged to determine permissibility of indemnification or advance of
expenses, shall be borne by the Company.

  



  

4.4 _Contractual Obligation_. The obligations of the Company to indemnify a
director or officer under this Article IV, including the duty to advance
expenses, shall be considered a contract between the Company and such director
or officer, and no modification or repeal of any provision of this Article IV
shall affect, to the detriment of the director or officer, such obligations of
the Company in connection with a claim based on any act or failure to act
occurring before such modification or repeal.

  



  

   

 | -4-| 
---|---|--- 

 

    



  

4.5 _Indemnification Not Exclusive; Inuring of Benefit_. The indemnification
and advance of expenses provided by this Article IV shall not be deemed
exclusive of any other right to which one indemnified may be entitled under
any statute, provision of the certificate of incorporation, these bylaws,

was serving at the request of the Company as an officer, director, principal,
member,  employee or agent of another corporation, partnership, joint
venture, limited liability  company, trust or other enterprise; _provided_
that no Indemnified Person shall  be indemnified for any expenses,
liabilities and losses suffered that are attributable  to such Indemnified
Person's gross negligence, willful misconduct or knowing violation  of law.
Expenses, including attorneys' fees, incurred by any such Indemnified Person 
in defending a proceeding shall be paid by the Company in advance of the final
disposition  of such proceeding, including any appeal therefrom, upon receipt

shall have been selected with reasonable care. Notwithstanding any of the
foregoing  to the contrary, the provisions of this paragraph shall not be
construed so as to relieve  (or attempt to relieve) any person of any
liability (i) for conduct which is grossly  negligent, reckless, or
intentionally wrongful or criminally unlawful, provided that  such person had
no reasonable cause to believe that his or its conduct was unlawful,  or (ii)
to the extent (but only to the extent) that such liability may not be
waived,  modified, or limited under applicable law.

Section 2.   _Registration Rights._

  



  

2.1. _Demand Registrations._

  



  

(a) (i) At any time that a Shelf Registration Statement provided
for in _Section 2.1(e)_ is not available for use by the Holders following
such Shelf Registration Statement being declared effective by the SEC (a "
_Demand Registration Period_ "), subject to this _Section 2.1(a)_ and
_Sections 2.1(b)_ and _2.3_ , at any time and from time to time during
such Demand Registration Period, (i) each SPC Investor, and (ii) following
the fifteen (15) month anniversary of the date hereof, each Founder Investor,
shall have the right to require the Company to effect one or more registration
statements under the Securities Act covering all or any part (subject to the
Minimum Threshold) of its and its Affiliates' Registrable Securities by
delivering a written request therefor to the Company specifying the number of
Registrable Securities to be included in such registration and the intended
method of distribution thereof. Any such request by any SPC Investor or
Founder Investor pursuant to this _Section 2.1(a)(i) _is referred to herein
as a " _Demand Registration Request_ ," and the registration so requested is
referred to herein as a " _Demand Registration_ " (with respect to any Demand
Registration, the SPC Investor(s) or Founder Investor(s) making such demand
for registration being referred to as the " _Initiating Holders_ "). Subject
to  _Section 2.1(b)_ , the SPC Investors and Founder Investors shall be
entitled to request (and the Company shall be required to effect) an
unlimited number of Demand Registrations. The Company shall give written
notice (the " _Demand Exercise Notice_ ") of such Demand Registration Request
to each of the Holders of record of Registrable Securities, as promptly as
practicable, but no later than five (5) Business Days prior to the filing of
any registration statement under the Securities Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Company may delay any Demand Exercise Notice until after filing
a registration statement, so long as all recipients of such notice have the
same amount of time to determine whether to participate in an offering as they
would have had if such notice had not been so delayed.

  



  

(ii) The Company, subject to _Sections 2.3_ and _2.6_ , shall include in a
Demand Registration (x) the Registrable Securities of the Initiating Holders
and (y) the Registrable Securities of any other Holder of Registrable
Securities which shall have made a written request to the Company for
inclusion in such registration pursuant to _Section 2.2_ (which request shall
specify the maximum number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed
of by such Participating Holder) within five (5) days following the receipt
of any such Demand Exercise Notice.

  



  

(iii) The Company shall, as expeditiously as possible, but subject to
_Section 2.1(b)_, use its reasonable best efforts to (x) file or
confidentially submit with the SEC (no later than (A) sixty (60) days from the
Company's receipt of the applicable Demand Registration Request if the Demand
Registration is on Form S-1 or similar long-form registration and or (B)
thirty (30) days from the Company's receipt of the applicable Demand
Registration Request if the Demand Registration is on Form S-3 or any similar
short-form registration), (y) cause to be declared effective as soon as
reasonably practicable such registration statement under the Securities Act
that includes the Registrable Securities which the Company has been so
requested to register, for distribution in accordance with the intended
method of distribution, including a distribution to, and resale by, the
members or partners of a Holder (a " _Partner Distribution_ ") and (z) if
requested by the Initiating Holders, obtain acceleration of the effective
date of the registration statement relating to such registration.

  



  

(iv) [Reserved.]

  



  

   

 | 6| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in _Section 2.1(a)_,
the Demand Registration rights granted in _Section 2.1(a) _are subject to
the following limitations: (i) the Company shall not be required to cause a
registration statement filed pursuant to _Section 2.1(a)_ to be declared
effective within a period of ninety (90) days after the effective date of any
other registration statement of the Company filed pursuant to the Securities
Act (other than a Form S-4, Form S-8 or a comparable form or an
equivalent registration form then in effect); (ii) the Company shall not be
required to effect more than three (3) Demand Registrations on Form S-1 or
any similar long-form registration statement at the request of each of the SPC
Investors and the Founder Investors (it being understood that if a single
Demand Registration Request is delivered by more than one SPC Investor or
Founder Investor, as applicable, the registration requested by such Demand
Registration Request shall constitute only one Demand Registration); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that the SPC Investors and the Founder Investors
shall be entitled to request an unlimited number of Demand Registrations on
Form S-3 or any similar short-form registration; (iii) each registration in
respect of a Demand Registration Request made by any Initiating Holder must
include, in the aggregate, Registrable Securities having an aggregate market
value of at least the lesser of (a) the Minimum Threshold (based on the
Registrable Securities included in such registration by all Holders
participating in such registration) and (b) the market value of the Initiating
Holder's remaining Registrable Securities, _provided_ that such market value
is at least $5.0 million; and (iv) if the Board, in its good faith
judgment, determines that any registration of Registrable Securities should
not be made or continued because it would materially and adversely interfere
with any existing or potential financing, acquisition, corporate
reorganization, merger, share exchange or other transaction or event
involving the Company or any of its subsidiaries or would otherwise result in
the public disclosure of information that the Board in good faith has a bona
fide business purpose for keeping confidential (a " _Valid Business Reason_
"), then (x) the Company may postpone filing or confidentially submitting a
registration statement relating to a Demand Registration Request until five
(5) Business Days after such Valid Business Reason no longer exists, but in no
event for more than forty five (45) days after the date the Board determines
a Valid Business Reason exists or (y) if a registration statement has
been filed or confidentially submitted relating to a Demand Registration
Request, if the Valid Business Reason has not resulted in whole or in part
from actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Company (other than actions
taken or omitted with the consent of the Initiating Holder (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed)), the Company may, to the extent determined
in the good faith judgment of the Board to be reasonably necessary to avoid
interference with any of the transactions described above, suspend use of or,
if required by the SEC, cause such registration statement to be withdrawn and
its effectiveness terminated or may postpone amending or supplementing such
registration statement until five (5) Business Days after such Valid Business
Reason no longer exists, but in no event for more than forty five (45) days
after the date the Board determines a Valid Business Reason exists (such
period of postponement or withdrawal under this clause (iv), the "
_Postponement Period_ "). The Company shall give written notice to the
Initiating Holders and any other Holders that have requested registration
pursuant to _Section 2.2_ of its determination to postpone or suspend use of
or withdraw a registration statement and of the fact that the Valid Business
Reason for such postponement or suspension or withdrawal no longer exists, in
each case, promptly after the occurrence thereof; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company shall not be entitled to more than two (2) Postponement
Periods during any twelve (12) month period.

  



  

If the Company shall give any notice of postponement or suspension or
withdrawal of any registration statement pursuant to clause (b)(iv) above,
the Company shall not, during the Postponement Period, register any Common
Stock, other than pursuant to a registration statement on Form S-4 or S-8 (or
an equivalent registration form then in effect). Each Holder of Registrable
Securities agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company that the
Company has determined to suspend use of, withdraw, terminate or
postpone amending or supplementing any registration statement pursuant to
clause (b)(iv) above, such Holder will discontinue its disposition of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration statement. If the Company
shall have suspended use of, withdrawn or terminated a registration statement
filed under _Section 2.1(a)(i)_ (whether pursuant to clause (b)(iv) above or
as a result of any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of
the SEC or any other governmental agency or court), the Company shall not be
considered to have effected a Demand Registration for the purposes of this
Agreement until the Company shall have permitted use of such suspended
registration statement or filed a new registration statement covering the
Registrable Securities covered by the withdrawn or terminated registration
statement and such registration statement shall have been declared effective
and shall not have been withdrawn. If the Company shall give any notice of
suspension, withdrawal or postponement of a registration statement, the
Company shall, not later than five (5) Business Days after the Valid Business
Reason that caused such suspension, withdrawal or postponement no longer
exists (but, with respect to a suspension, withdrawal or postponement pursuant
to clause (b)(iv) above, in no event later than forty five (45) days after
the date of the suspension, postponement or withdrawal), as applicable,
permit use of such suspended registration statement or use its reasonable
best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of the
Registrable Securities covered by the withdrawn or postponed registration
statement in accordance with this _Section 2.1 _(unless the Initiating
Holders shall have withdrawn such request, in which case the Company shall not
be considered to have effected a Demand Registration for the purposes of this
Agreement and such request shall not count as a Demand Registration
Request under this Agreement), and following such permission or such
effectiveness such registration shall no longer be deemed to be
suspended, withdrawn or postponed pursuant to clause (iv) of _Section
2.1(b)_ above.

(d) In connection with any Demand Registration, the Initiating Holder
shall have the right to designate the lead managing underwriter (any lead
managing underwriter for the purposes of this Agreement, the " _Manager_ ") in
connection with any underwritten offering pursuant to such registration and
each other managing underwriter for any such underwritten offering; _provided_
 that in each case, each such underwriter is reasonably satisfactory to the
Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  



  

(e) No Demand Registration shall be deemed to have occurred for
purposes of _Section 2.1(a)_ (i) if the registration statement relating
thereto (x) does not become effective, (y) is not maintained effective for a
period of at least one hundred eighty (180) days after the effective date
thereof or such shorter period during which all Registrable Securities
included in such Registration Statement have actually been sold ( _provided_
, _however_ , that such period shall be extended for a period of time equal
to the period any Holder of Registrable Securities refrains from selling any
securities included in such Registration Statement at the request of the
Company or an underwriter of the Company), or (z) is subject to a stop
order, injunction, or similar order or requirement of the SEC during such
period, (ii) for each Initiating Holder, if less than seventy five percent
(75%) of the Registrable Securities requested by such Initiating Holder to be
included in such Demand Registration are not so included pursuant to _Section
2.3_, (iii) if the method of disposition is a firm commitment
underwritten public offering and less than seventy five percent (75%) of the
applicable Registrable Securities have not been sold pursuant thereto
(excluding any Registrable Securities included for sale in the underwriters'
overallotment option) or (iv) if the conditions to closing specified in any
underwriting agreement, purchase agreement or similar agreement entered into
in connection with the registration relating to such request are not
satisfied (other than as a result of a default or breach thereunder by such
Initiating Holder(s) or its Affiliates or are otherwise waived by such
Initiating Holder(s)).

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(f) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the Closing of
the Merger and upon request from the SPC Investors, the Company shall (x)
prepare and file with (or confidentially submit to) the SEC a shelf
registration statement under Rule 415 of the Securities Act (such
registration statement, a " _Shelf Registration Statement_ ") that covers all
Registrable Securities then held by the Holders for an offering to be made on
a delayed or continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415 under the Securities Act
or any successor rule thereto in accordance with the methods of distribution
elected by the SPC Investors and set forth in the Shelf Registration
Statement as permitted by this Agreement; _provided_ that if the Company is
not eligible to use a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-3 or any
successor form, it shall prepare and file with (or confidentially submit to)
the SEC a Shelf Registration Statement on Form S-1 or any successor form, use
commercially reasonable best efforts and act in good faith to cause the Shelf
Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as soon as
practicable thereafter and file or confidentially submit any amendments or
supplements to such Shelf Registration Statement as may be necessary to keep
such Shelf Registration Statement effective and to comply with the provisions
of the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all Registrable
Securities subject thereto for a period ending on the earlier of three (3)
years after the effective date of such Shelf Registration Statement and the
date on which all the Registrable Securities subject thereto are no longer
Registrable Securities. The SPC Investors shall have the unlimited right at
any time and from time to time to elect to sell pursuant to an
underwritten offering Registrable Securities available for sale pursuant to
such registration statement. The SPC Investors shall make such election by
delivering to the Company a written request (a " _Shelf Underwriting Request_
") for such underwritten offering specifying the number of Registrable
Securities that the SPC Investors desire to sell pursuant to such underwritten
offering (the " _Shelf Underwriting_ "). As promptly as practicable, but no
later than two (2) Business Days after receipt of a Shelf Underwriting
Request, the Company shall give written notice (the " _Shelf Underwriting
Notice_ ") of such Shelf Underwriting Request to the Holders of record of
other Registrable Securities registered on such Shelf Registration Statement
(" _Shelf Registrable Securities_ "). The Company, subject to _Sections 2.3_
and _2.6_ , shall include in such Shelf Underwriting (x) the Registrable
Securities of the SPC Investors and (y) the Shelf Registrable Securities of
any other Holder of Shelf Registrable Securities which shall have made a
written request to the Company for inclusion in such Shelf Underwriting
(which request shall specify the maximum number of Shelf Registrable
Securities intended to be disposed of by such Holder) within five (5) days
after the receipt of the Shelf Underwriting Notice. The Company shall, as
expeditiously as possible (and in any event within fifteen (15) Business Days
after the receipt of a Shelf Underwriting Request), but subject to _Section
2.1(b)_, use its reasonable best efforts to effect such Shelf Underwriting.
The Company shall, at the request of any SPC Investor or any other Holder of
Registrable Securities registered on such Shelf Registration Statement, file
any prospectus supplement or, if the applicable Shelf Registration Statement
is an automatic shelf registration statement, any post-effective amendments
and otherwise take any action necessary to include therein all disclosure and
language deemed necessary or advisable by the SPC Investors or any other
Holder of Shelf Registrable Securities to effect such Shelf Underwriting. Once
a Shelf Registration Statement has been declared effective, the SPC Investors
may request, and the Company shall be required to facilitate, subject to
_Section 2.1(b)_ , an unlimited number of Shelf Underwritings with respect to
such Shelf Registration Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
in this _Section 2.1(e)_, each Shelf Underwriting must include, in the
aggregate, Registrable Securities having an aggregate market value of at
least the lesser of (a) the Minimum Threshold (based on the Registrable
Securities included in such Shelf Underwriting by all Holders participating
in such Shelf Underwriting) and (b) the market value of the
Initiating Holder's remaining Registrable Securities, _provided_ that such
market value is at least $5.0 million. In connection with any Shelf
Underwriting (including an Underwritten Block Trade), the SPC Investors shall
have the right to designate the Manager and each other managing underwriter
in connection with any such Shelf Underwriting or Underwritten Block Trade;
_provided_  that in each case, each such underwriter is reasonably
satisfactory to the Company, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

  



  

   

 | 9| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(g) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a SPC Investor wishes to engage
in an underwritten block trade or similar transaction or other transaction
with a 2-day or less marketing period (collectively, " _Underwritten Block
Trade_ ") off of a Shelf Registration Statement (either through filing an
automatic shelf registration statement or through a take-down from an
already effective Shelf Registration Statement), then notwithstanding the
foregoing time periods, such SPC Investor only needs to notify the Company of
the Underwritten Block Trade two (2) Business Days prior to the day such
offering is to commence and the Company shall notify any Minority Investor
that owns 1% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock (each, a "
_Significant Minority Investor_ ") on the same day and such Significant
Minority Investors must elect whether or not to participate by the
next Business Day (i.e., one (1) Business Day prior to the day such offering
is to commence), and the Company shall as expeditiously as possible, but
subject to _Section 2.1(b)_ , use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate
such Shelf Underwriting (which may close as early as two (2) Business Days
after the date it commences); _provided_ , _however_ , that the SPC
Investor requesting such Underwritten Block Trade shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to work with the Company and the underwriters prior to
making such request in order to facilitate preparation of the registration
statement, prospectus and other offering documentation related to the
Underwritten Block Trade. In the event an SPC Investor requests such an
Underwritten Block Trade, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
_Section 2.1_ or in _Section 2.2_ , any other Holder who does not constitute a
Significant Minority Investor shall have no right to notice of or to
participate in such Underwritten Block Trade at any time.

  



  

(h) Any Initiating Holder may withdraw or revoke a Demand Registration
Request delivered by such Initiating Holder at any time prior to the
effectiveness of such Demand Registration by giving written notice to the
Company of such withdrawal or revocation and such Demand Registration shall
have no further force or effect and such request shall not count as a Demand
Registration Request under this Agreement.

  



  

2.2.   _Piggyback Registrations._

  



  

(a) If the Company proposes or is required (pursuant to _Section 2.1_
or otherwise) to register any of its equity securities for its own account or
for the account of any other shareholder under the Securities Act (other than
pursuant to registrations on Form S-4 or Form S-8 or any similar successor
forms thereto), the Company shall give written notice (the "
_Piggyback Notice_ ") of its intention to do so to each of the Holders of
record of Registrable Securities, at least five (5) Business Days prior to
the filing of any registration statement under the Securities Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may delay any Piggyback Notice
until after filing a registration statement, so long as all recipients of such
notice have the same amount of time to determine whether to participate in an
offering as they would have had if such notice had not been so delayed. Upon
the written request of any such Holder, made within five (5) days following
the receipt of any such Piggyback Notice (which request shall specify the
maximum number of Registrable Securities intended to be disposed of by such
Holder and the intended method of distribution thereof), the Company shall,
subject to _Sections 2.2(c)_ , _2.3_ and _2.6_ hereof, use its reasonable
best efforts to cause all such Registrable Securities, the Holders of which
have so requested the registration thereof, to be registered under the
Securities Act with the securities which the Company at the time proposes to
register to permit the sale or other disposition by the Holders (in
accordance with the intended method of distribution thereof) of the
Registrable Securities to be so registered, including, if necessary, by
filing with the SEC a post-effective amendment or a supplement to the
registration statement filed by the Company or the prospectus related
thereto. There is no limitation on the number of such piggyback
registrations which the Company is obligated to effect pursuant to the
preceding sentence. No registration of Registrable Securities effected under
this _Section 2.2(a)_ shall relieve the Company of its obligations to effect
Demand Registrations under _Section 2.1 _hereof.

  



  

   

 | 10| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) The Company, subject to _Sections 2.3_ and _2.6_ , may elect to
include in any registration statement filed pursuant to _Section 2.1_ , (i)
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock or shares of Common Stock held
by the Company as treasury shares and (ii) any other shares of Common Stock
which are requested to be included in such registration pursuant to the
exercise of piggyback registration rights granted by the Company after the
date hereof and which are not inconsistent with the rights granted in, or
otherwise conflict with the terms of, this Agreement (" _Additional Piggyback
Rights_ ");  _provided_ , _however_ , that, with respect to any underwritten
offering, including an Underwritten Block Trade, such inclusion shall be
permitted only to the extent that it is pursuant to, and subject to, the terms
of the underwriting agreement or arrangements, if any, entered into by the
Initiating Holders or the Majority Participating Holders in such underwritten
offering.

  



  

(c) Other than in connection with a Demand Registration or a Shelf
Underwriting, at any time after giving a Piggyback Notice and prior to the
effective date of the registration statement filed in connection with such
registration, if the Company shall determine for any reason not to register
or to delay registration of such equity securities, the Company may, at its
election, give written notice of such determination to all Holders of record
of Registrable Securities and (x) in the case of a determination not
to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Securities in connection with such abandoned registration, without prejudice,
however, to the rights of Holders under _Section 2.1_, and (y) in the case of
a determination to delay such registration of its equity securities, shall be
permitted to delay the registration of such Registrable Securities for the
same period as the delay in registering such other equity securities.

  



  

(d) Any Holder shall have the right to withdraw its request for
inclusion of its Registrable Securities in any registration
statement pursuant to this _Section 2.2_ by giving written notice to the
Company of its request to withdraw; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that such
request must be made in writing prior to the earlier of the execution by such
Holder of the underwriting agreement or the execution by such Holder of the
custody agreement with respect to such registration or as otherwise
required by the underwriters.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding _Section 2.2(a)_ , if the SPC Investors wish to
engage in an Underwritten Block Trade off of a Shelf Registration Statement
(either through filing an automatic shelf registration statement or through a
take-down from an already existing Shelf Registration Statement), then
notwithstanding the foregoing time periods, such SPC Investors only need to
notify the Company of the Underwritten Block Trade two (2) Business Days
prior to the day such offering is to commence and the Company shall
notify the Significant Minority Investors on the same day and such
Significant Minority Investors must elect whether or not to participate by
the next Business Day (i.e., one (1) Business Day prior to the day such
offering is to commence), and the Company shall as expeditiously as possible
use its reasonable best efforts to facilitate such Shelf Underwriting (which
may close as early as two (2) Business Days after the date it commences);
_provided_ , _however_ , that the SPC Investors requesting such
Underwritten Block Trade shall use commercially reasonable efforts to work
with the Company and the underwriters prior to making such request in order
to facilitate preparation of the registration statement, prospectus and other
offering documentation related to the Underwritten Block Trade. In the event
a SPC Investor requests such an Underwritten Block Trade, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in  _Section 2.1_ or in this _Section 2.2_ , any
other Holder who does not constitute a Significant Minority Investor
shall have no right to notice of or to participate in such Underwritten Block
Trade at any time.

employee stockholder of the Company will be entitled to include
Registrable Securities in an underwritten offering requested by the

2.4. _Registration Procedures_. If and whenever the Company is
required by the provisions of this Agreement to effect or cause the
registration of and/or participate in any offering or sale of any Registrable
Securities under the Securities Act as provided in this Agreement (or use
reasonable best efforts to accomplish the same), the Company shall, as
expeditiously as possible:

  



  

(a) prepare and file all filings with the SEC and FINRA required for
the consummation of the offering, including preparing and filing with the SEC
a registration statement on an appropriate registration form of the SEC for
the disposition of such Registrable Securities in accordance with the
intended method of disposition thereof (including a Partner Distribution),
which registration form (i) shall be selected by the Company (except as
provided for in a Demand Registration Request) and (ii) shall, in the case of
a shelf registration, be available for the sale of the Registrable Securities
by the selling Holders thereof and such registration statement shall comply
as to form in all material respects with the requirements of the applicable
registration form and include all financial statements required by the SEC to
be filed therewith, and the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such registration statement to become effective and remain continuously
effective for such period as required by this Agreement ( _provided_ , 
_however_ , that as far in advance as reasonably practicable before filing a
registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements
thereto, or comparable statements under securities or state "blue sky" laws of
any jurisdiction, or any free writing prospectus related thereto, the Company
will furnish to the Holders participating in the planned offering and to the
Manager, if any, copies of all such documents proposed to be filed (including
all exhibits thereto), which documents will be subject to their reasonable
review and reasonable comment and the Company shall not file any registration
statement or amendment thereto, any prospectus or supplement thereto or any
free writing prospectus related thereto to which the Initiating Holders, the
Majority Participating Holders or the underwriters, if any, shall reasonably
object); _provided_ , however, that, notwithstanding the foregoing, in no
event shall the Company be required to file any document with the SEC which in
the view of the Company or its counsel contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make any statement therein not misleading;

  



  

(b) (i) prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and supplements
to such registration statement and the prospectus used in

reports as may be necessary to keep such registration statement continuously

provisions of the Securities Act with respect to the sale or other
disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such registration
statement, and any prospectus so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule
424 under the Securities Act, in accordance with the intended methods of
disposition by the seller or sellers thereof set forth in such registration
statement and (ii) provide notice to such sellers of Registrable Securities
and the Manager, if any, of the Company's reasonable determination that a
post-effective amendment to a registration statement would be appropriate;

underwriter, if any, of the securities covered by such registration statement
such number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and
supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits), the prospectus

and any summary prospectus) and any other prospectus filed under Rule 424
under the Securities Act, each free writing prospectus utilized in connection
therewith, in each case, in conformity with the requirements of the
Securities Act, and other documents, as such seller and underwriter
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the public sale or other
disposition of the Registrable Securities owned by such seller (the Company
hereby consenting to the use in accordance with all applicable laws of each
such registration statement (or amendment or post-effective amendment
thereto) and each such prospectus (or preliminary prospectus or supplement
thereto) or free writing prospectus by each such Participating Holder and the
underwriters, if any, in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement or prospectus);

  



  

   

 | 15| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify the
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement under such
other securities or state "blue sky" laws of such jurisdictions as any sellers
of Registrable Securities or any managing underwriter, if any, shall
reasonably request in writing, and do any and all other acts and things which
may be reasonably necessary or advisable to enable such sellers or
underwriter, if any, to consummate the disposition of the Registrable
Securities in such jurisdictions (including keeping such registration or
qualification in effect for so long as such registration statement remains in
effect), except that in no event shall the Company be required to qualify to
do business as a foreign corporation in any jurisdiction where it would not,
but for the requirements of this paragraph (d), be required to be so
qualified, to subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction or to
consent to general service of process in any such jurisdiction;

  



  

(e) promptly notify each Participating Holder and each managing
underwriter, if any: (i) when the registration statement, any pre-
effective amendment, the prospectus or any prospectus supplement related
thereto, any post-effective amendment to the registration statement or any
free writing prospectus has been filed with the SEC and, with respect to the
registration statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has
become effective; (ii) of any request by the SEC or state securities authority
for amendments or supplements to the registration statement or the prospectus
related thereto or for additional information; (iii) of the issuance by the
SEC of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the
receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to the suspension of
the qualification of any Registrable Securities for sale under the securities
or state "blue sky" laws of any jurisdiction or the initiation of any
proceeding for such purpose; (v) of the existence of any fact of which the
Company becomes aware which results in the registration statement or any
amendment thereto, the prospectus related thereto or any supplement thereto,
any document incorporated therein by reference, any free writing prospectus
or the information conveyed at the time of sale to any purchaser containing an
untrue statement of a material fact or omitting to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statement therein not
misleading; and (vi) if at any time the representations and warranties
contemplated by any underwriting agreement, securities sale agreement, or
other similar agreement, relating to the offering shall cease to be true and
correct in all material respects (unless otherwise qualified by materiality
in which case such representations and warranties shall cease to be true
and correct in all respects); and, if the notification relates to an event
described in clause (v), unless the Company has declared that a Postponement
Period exists, the Company shall promptly prepare and furnish to each such
seller and each underwriter, if any, a reasonable number of copies of a
prospectus supplemented or amended so that, as thereafter delivered to the
purchasers of such Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not include
an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading;

  



  

(f) comply (and continue to comply) with all applicable rules and
regulations of the SEC (including maintaining disclosure controls and
procedures (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e)) and internal control
over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f)) in
accordance with the Exchange Act), and make generally available to its
security holders (including by way of filings with the SEC), as soon as
reasonably practicable after the effective date of the registration statement

least twelve (12) consecutive months beginning with the first day of the
Company's first calendar quarter after the effective date of the registration
statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder;

then permitted under the rules of such exchange, or (B) if no similar
securities are then so listed, use its reasonable best efforts to either
cause all such Registrable Securities to be listed on a national
securities exchange or to secure designation of all such Registrable
Securities as a Nasdaq National Market "national market system security"
within the meaning of Rule 11Aa2-1 of the Exchange Act or, failing that,
secure Nasdaq National Market authorization for such shares and, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, take all actions that may be
required by the Company as the issuer of such Registrable Securities in order
to facilitate the managing underwriter's arranging for the registration of at
least two market makers as such with respect to such shares with FINRA, and
(ii) comply (and continue to comply) with the requirements of any self-
regulatory organization applicable to the Company, including all corporate

customarily covered by such opinions and "comfort" letters (including, in the
case of such "comfort" letter, events subsequent to the date of such financial
statements) delivered to underwriters in underwritten public offerings, which
opinions and letters shall be dated the dates such opinions and "comfort"

event shall the Company be required to file or confidentially submit any
document with the SEC which in the view of the Company or its counsel

results or ranges of results) if required for purposes of marketing the
offering in the view of the managing underwriter;

  



  

(t) take no direct or indirect action prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act; _provided_ , _however_ , that to the extent that any
prohibition is applicable to the Company, the Company will use its reasonable
best efforts to make any such prohibition inapplicable;

  



  

(u) use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Registrable
Securities covered by the applicable registration statement to be

Securities;

  



  

(v) take all such other commercially reasonable actions as are

is retained in accordance with the Securities Act to the extent required
thereby and, when taken together with the related prospectus, prospectus
supplement and related documents, will not contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state a material fact necessary to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading;

  



  

   

 | 19| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(x) in connection with any underwritten offering, if at any time the
information conveyed to a purchaser at the time of sale includes any untrue
statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, promptly file with the SEC such
amendments or supplements to such information as may be necessary so that the
statements as so amended or supplemented will not, in the light of the
circumstances, be misleading;

  



  

(y) to the extent required by the rules and regulations of FINRA,
retain a Qualified Independent Underwriter acceptable to the
managing underwriter; and

  



  

(z) use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the managing
underwriters, Participating Holders, any indemnitee of the Company and their
respective counsel in connection with the preparation and filing of any
applications, notices, registrations and responses to requests for additional

which the shares of Common Stock are listed.

  



  

To the extent the Company is a WKSI at the time any Demand Registration
Request is submitted to the Company, the Company shall file an automatic
shelf registration statement (as defined in Rule 405 under the Securities Act)
(an " _automatic shelf registration statement_ ") on Form S-3 which covers
those Registrable Securities which are requested to be registered. The
Company shall not take any action that would result in it not remaining a
WKSI or would result in it becoming an ineligible issuer (as defined in Rule
405 under the Securities Act) during the period during which such automatic
shelf registration statement is required to remain effective. If the Company
does not pay the filing fee covering the Registrable Securities at the time
the automatic shelf registration statement is filed, the Company agrees to
pay such fee at such time or times as the Registrable Securities are to be
sold in compliance with the SEC rules. If the automatic shelf registration
statement has been outstanding for at least three (3) years, at or prior to
the end of the third year the Company shall refile a new automatic shelf
registration statement covering the Registrable Securities. If at any time
when the Company is required to re-evaluate its WKSI status the Company
determines that it is not a WKSI, the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to refile the shelf registration statement on Form S-3 and, if such
form is not available, Form S-1 and keep such registration statement effective
during the period which such registration statement is required to be kept
effective.

  



  

If the Company files any shelf registration statement for the benefit of the
holders of any of its securities other than the Holders, and the Holders do
not request that their Registrable Securities be included in such Shelf
Registration Statement, the Company agrees that it shall include in such
registration statement such disclosures as may be required by Rule 430B under
the Securities Act (referring to the unnamed selling security holders in a
generic manner by identifying the initial offering of the securities to the
Holders) in order to ensure that the Holders may be added to such shelf
registration statement at a later time through the filing of a prospectus
supplement rather than a post-effective amendment.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

The Company may require as a condition precedent to the Company's obligations
under this _Section 2.4_ that each Participating Holder as to which any
registration is being effected (i) furnish the Company such information
regarding such seller and the distribution of such securities as the Company
may from time to time reasonably request (including as required under state
securities laws), provided that such information is necessary for the Company
to consummate such registration and shall be used only in connection with
such registration and (ii) provide any underwriters participating in the
distribution of such securities such information as the underwriters may
request and execute and deliver any agreements, certificates or other
documents as the underwriters may request.

  



  

Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees that upon receipt of any notice
from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind described in
clause (v) of paragraph (e) of this _Section 2.4_, such Holder will
discontinue such Holder's disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the registration statement covering such Registrable Securities until such
Holder's receipt of the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by paragraph (e) of this _Section 2.4 _and, if so directed by
the Company, will deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all
copies, other than permanent file copies, then in such Holder's possession of
the prospectus covering such Registrable Securities that was in effect at the
time of receipt of such notice. In the event the Company shall give any such
notice, the applicable period mentioned in paragraph (b) of this _Section
2.4_ shall be extended by the number of days during such period from and
including the date of the giving of such notice to and including the date
when each Participating Holder covered by such registration statement shall
have received the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus
contemplated by paragraph (e) of this _Section 2.4_.

  



  

The Company agrees not to file or make any amendment to any registration
statement with respect to any Registrable Securities, or any amendment of or
supplement to the prospectus, or any free writing prospectus, which amendment
refers to any Holder covered thereby by name, or otherwise identifies such
Holder, without the consent of such Holder, such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, unless such disclosure is required by law,
in which case the Company shall provide written notice to such Holders no
less than five (5) Business Days prior to the filing.

  



  

To the extent that any of the SPC Investors, Minority Investors or Additional
Investors is or may be deemed to be an "underwriter" of Registrable
Securities pursuant to any SEC comments or policies, the Company agrees that
(1) the indemnification and contribution provisions contained in _Section
2.9_ shall be applicable for the benefit of the SPC Investors, Minority
Investors and Additional Investors, as applicable, in their role as an
underwriter or deemed underwriter in addition to their capacity as a Holder
and (2) the SPC Investors, Minority Investors and any Additional Investors, as
applicable, shall be entitled to conduct the due diligence which an
underwriter would normally conduct in connection with an offering of
securities registered under the Securities Act, including receipt of
customary opinions and comfort letters addressed to the SPC Investors,
Minority Investors and Additional Investors, as applicable.

2.5. _Registration Expenses._

  



  

(a) The Company shall pay all Expenses with respect to any
registration or offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to _Section
2_, whether or not a registration statement becomes effective or the offering
is consummated.

  



  

(b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the provisions of this
_Section 2.5_ shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to cause these
expense provisions to comply with state "blue sky" laws of each state in which
the offering is made and (y) in connection with any underwritten offering
hereunder, each Participating Holder shall pay all underwriting discounts and
commissions and any transfer taxes, if any, attributable to the sale of such
Registrable Securities, pro rata with respect to payments of discounts and
commissions in accordance with the number of shares sold in the offering by
such Participating Holder.

  



  

2.6. _Certain Limitations on Registration Rights_. In the case of
any registration under Section 2.1 involving an underwritten offering, or, in
the case of a registration under Section 2.2, if the Company has determined to
enter into an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, all securities
to be included in such underwritten offering shall be subject to such
underwriting agreement and no Person may participate in such underwritten
offering unless such Person (i) agrees to sell such Person's securities on
the basis provided therein and completes and executes all reasonable
questionnaires, and other documents (including custody agreements and powers
of attorney) which must be executed in connection therewith; provided,
however, that all such documents shall be consistent with the provisions
hereof and (ii) provides such other information to the Company or the
underwriter as may be necessary to register such Person's securities.

  



  

2.7. _Limitations on Sale or Distribution of Other Securities._

  



  

(a) Each director and officer listed as a signatory to this Agreement
and each Holder of 1% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock and Common
Stock Equivalents agrees (whether or not such Holder can participate in any
such offering), to the extent requested by a managing underwriter, if any, of
any underwritten public offering pursuant to a registration or offering
effected pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (including any Shelf Underwriting
pursuant to _Section 2.1(e)_ ) or _Section 2.2_ (including any offering
effected by the Company for its own account and any offering in which one or
more Holders is selling Common Stock pursuant to the exercise of piggyback
rights under _Section 2.2_ hereof), not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose
of, including any sale pursuant to Rule 144, any Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents (other than as part of such underwritten public offering) during
the time period reasonably requested by the managing underwriter, not to
exceed the period from seven days prior to the pricing date of such offering
until (A) ninety (90) days after the pricing date of the first such offering
and (B) seventy-five (75) days after the pricing date of any subsequent such
offering or, in each case, such shorter period as the managing underwriter,
the Company or any executive officer or director of the Company shall agree
to; _provided_ that the time period may be longer than ninety (90) days or
seventy-five (75) days, as applicable, if required by the managing
underwriter, as long as all Holders, directors and officers are subject to
the same lock-up). The Company agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each holder of 1% or more of the then-outstanding Common Stock and
Common Stock Equivalents, purchased or otherwise acquired from the Company
(other than in a public offering) at any time after the date of this Agreement
to agree, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause each of its
officers, directors and beneficial holders of 5% or more of the Common
Stock to agree, not to sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of, including any
sale pursuant to Rule 144, any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents
(other than as part of such underwritten public offering) during the period
referred to in the first sentence of this clause (a). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, none of the provisions or restrictions set forth in this _Section
2.7(a) _ shall in any way limit the SPC Investors or any of their Affiliates
from engaging in any brokerage, investment advisory, financial advisory,
anti-raid advisory, principaling, merger advisory, financing, asset
management, trading, market making, arbitrage, investment activity and other
similar activities conducted in the ordinary course of their business.

(b) The Company hereby agrees that, in connection with an offering
pursuant to _Section 2.1_ (including any Shelf Underwriting pursuant to
_Section 2.1(e)_ ) or _2.2_ , the Company shall not sell, transfer, or
otherwise dispose of, any Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalent (other than
as part of such underwritten public offering, a registration on Form S-4 or
Form S-8 or any successor or similar form which is (x) then in effect or (y)
shall become effective upon the conversion, exchange or exercise of any then
outstanding Common Stock Equivalent), until a period from seven days prior to
the pricing date of such offering until (A) ninety (90) days after the
pricing date of the first such offering and (B) seventy-five (75) days after
the pricing date of any subsequent such offering or, in each case, such
shorter period as the managing underwriter, the Company or any executive
officer or director of the Company shall agree to; _provided_ that the time
period may be longer than ninety (90) days or seventy-five (75) days, as
applicable, if required by the managing underwriter, as long as all Holders,
directors and officers are subject to the same lock-up; and the Company shall
(i) so provide in any registration rights agreements hereafter entered into
with respect to any of its securities and (ii) use its reasonable best
efforts to cause each holder of 1% or more of the then-outstanding
Common Stock and Common Stock Equivalents, purchased or otherwise acquired
from the Company (other than in a public offering) at any time after the date
of this Agreement to so agree, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each of its officers, directors and beneficial holders of 5% or more of
the Common Stock to so agree.

  



  

2.8. _No Required Sale_. Nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed
to create an independent obligation on the part of any Holder to sell any
Registrable Securities pursuant to any effective registration statement. A
Holder is not required to include any of its Registrable Securities in any
registration statement, is not required to sell any of its Registrable
Securities which are included in any effective registration statement, and
may sell any of its Registrable Securities in any manner in compliance with
applicable law (subject to the restrictions set forth in the Shareholders
Agreement) even if such shares are already included on an
effective registration statement.

  



  

2.9. _Indemnification._

  



  

(a) In the event of any registration or offer and sale of any
securities of the Company under the Securities Act pursuant to this  _Section
2_, the Company will (without limitation as to time), and hereby agrees to,
and hereby does, indemnify and hold harmless, to the fullest extent permitted
by law, each Participating Holder, its directors, officers, employees,
stockholders, members, general and limited partners, agents, affiliates,
representatives, successors and assigns (and the directors,
officers, employees, stockholders, members, general and limited partners,
agents, affiliates, representatives, successors and assigns thereof), each
other Person who participates as a seller (and its directors, officers,
employees, stockholders, members, general and limited partners, agents,
affiliates, representatives, successors and assigns), underwriter or Qualified
Independent Underwriter, if any, in the offering or sale of such securities,
each officer, director, employee, stockholder, managing director, agent,
affiliate, representative, successor, assign or partner of such underwriter
or Qualified Independent Underwriter, and each other Person, if any, who
controls (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20
of the Exchange Act) such seller or any such underwriter or Qualified
Independent Underwriter and each director, officer, employee, stockholder,
managing director, agent, affiliate, representative, successor, assign or
partner of such controlling Person, from and against any and all
losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, actions or
proceedings (whether commenced or threatened) and expenses
(including reasonable fees of counsel and any amounts paid in any settlement
effected with the Company's consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed) to which each such indemnified party may become subject
under the Securities Act or otherwise in respect thereof (collectively, "
_Claims_ "), insofar as such Claims arise out of, are based upon, relate
to or are in connection with (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact contained in any registration statement under
which such securities were registered under the Securities Act or the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, (ii) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
any preliminary, final or summary prospectus or any amendment or
supplement thereto, together with the documents incorporated by reference
therein, or any free writing prospectus utilized in connection therewith, or
the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to
be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in
the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or
(iii) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact in
the information conveyed by the Company or any underwriter to any purchaser
at the time of the sale to such purchaser, or the omission or alleged omission
to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or (iv) any
violation by the Company of any federal, state or common law rule or
regulation applicable to the Company and relating to any action required of
or inaction by the Company in connection with any such offering of
Registrable Securities, and the Company will reimburse any such indemnified
party for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such Claim as such
expenses are incurred; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Company shall not
be liable to any such indemnified party in any such case to the extent such
Claim arises out of or is based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material
fact made in such registration statement or amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or in any such prospectus or any preliminary, final or summary
prospectus or free writing prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such
indemnified party specifically for use therein. Such indemnity and
reimbursement of expenses shall remain in full force and effect regardless of
any investigation made by or on behalf of such indemnified party and shall
survive the transfer of such securities by such seller.

---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(b) Each Participating Holder (and, if the Company requires as a
condition to including any Registrable Securities in any
registration statement filed in accordance with _Section 2.1_ or _2.2_ , any
underwriter and Qualified Independent Underwriter, if any) shall, severally
and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the
same extent as set forth in paragraph (a) of this _Section 2.9_) to the
extent permitted by law the Company, its officers and its directors, each
Person controlling the Company within the meaning of the Securities Act and
all other prospective sellers and their directors, officers, stockholders,
fiduciaries, managing directors, agents, affiliates, representatives,
successors, assigns or general and limited partners and respective
controlling Persons with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of any material fact in, or omission or alleged omission of any
material fact from, such registration statement, any preliminary, final or
summary prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
or any free writing prospectus utilized in connection therewith, if such
statement or alleged statement or omission or alleged omission was made in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company or its representatives by or on behalf of such Participating Holder or
underwriter or Qualified Independent Underwriter, if any, specifically for
use therein, and each such Participating Holder, underwriter or Qualified
Independent Underwriter, if any, shall reimburse such indemnified party for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with investigating or defending any such Claim as such expenses are
incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the aggregate amount which any such
Participating Holder shall be required to pay pursuant to this _Section
2.9_ (including pursuant to indemnity, contribution or otherwise) shall in no
case be greater than the amount of the net proceeds received by such
Participating Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to
the registration statement giving rise to such Claim; _provided_ , _further_
, that such Participating Holder shall not be liable in any such case to the
extent that prior to the filing or confidential submission of any such
registration statement or prospectus or amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, or any free writing prospectus utilized in connection
therewith, such Participating Holder has furnished in writing to the Company
information expressly for use in such registration statement or prospectus or
any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or free writing prospectus which
corrected or made not misleading information previously furnished to the
Company. The Company and each Participating Holder hereby acknowledge and
agree that, unless otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by
such Participating Holders to the contrary, for all purposes of this
Agreement, the only information furnished or to be furnished to the Company
for use in any such registration statement, preliminary, final or summary
prospectus or amendment or supplement thereto, or any free writing
prospectus, are statements specifically relating to (i) the beneficial
ownership of shares of Common Stock by such Participating Holder and its
Affiliates as disclosed in the section of such document entitled "Selling
Stockholders" or "Principal and Selling Stockholders" and (ii) the name and
address of such Participating Holder. If any additional information about
such Holder or the plan of distribution (other than for an underwritten
offering) is required by law to be disclosed in any such document, then such
Holder shall not unreasonably withhold its agreement referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence. Such indemnity and reimbursement of expenses
shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by
or on behalf of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of such
securities by such Holder.

  



  

(c) Indemnification similar to that specified in the preceding
paragraphs (a) and (b) of this _Section 2.9_ (with
appropriate modifications) shall be given by the Company and each
Participating Holder with respect to any required registration or
other qualification of securities under any applicable securities and state
"blue sky" laws.

  



  

   

 | 24| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(d) Any Person entitled to indemnification under this Agreement shall
notify promptly the indemnifying party in writing of the commencement of any
action or proceeding with respect to which a claim for indemnification may be
made pursuant to this _Section 2.9_, but the failure of any indemnified
party to provide such notice shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its
obligations under the preceding paragraphs of this _Section 2.9_, except to
the extent the indemnifying party is materially and actually prejudiced
thereby and shall not relieve the indemnifying party from any liability which
it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this _Section 2_.
In case any action or proceeding is brought against an indemnified party
and such indemnified party shall have notified the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof (as required above), the indemnifying party shall be
entitled to participate therein and, unless in the reasonable opinion of
outside counsel to the indemnified party a conflict of interest between such
indemnified and indemnifying parties exists in respect of such Claim, to
assume the defense thereof jointly with any other indemnifying party
similarly notified, to the extent that it chooses, with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party that it so chooses, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party for any
legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in
connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable costs of
investigation; _provided_ , _however_ , that (i) if the indemnifying party
fails to take reasonable steps necessary to defend diligently the action or
proceeding within twenty (20) days after receiving notice from such
indemnified party that the indemnified party believes it has failed to do so;
or (ii) if such indemnified party who is a defendant in any action or
proceeding which is also brought against the indemnifying party reasonably
shall have concluded that there may be one or more legal or equitable defenses
available to such indemnified party which are not available to the
indemnifying party or which may conflict with or be different from those
available to another indemnified party with respect to such Claim; or (iii)
if representation of both parties by the same counsel is otherwise
inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct, then, in
any such case, the indemnified party shall have the right to assume
or continue its own defense as set forth above (but with no more than one
firm of counsel for all indemnified parties in each jurisdiction, except to
the extent any indemnified party or parties reasonably shall have made a
conclusion described in clause (ii) or (iii) above) and the indemnifying
party shall be liable for any expenses therefor. No indemnifying party shall
be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written
consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), but if
settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff,
such indemnifying party agrees to indemnify each indemnified party from and
against any loss, claim, damage, liability or expense by reason of such
settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall, without the written
consent of the indemnified party, effect the settlement or compromise of, or
consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to, any pending or
threatened action or claim in respect of which indemnification or
contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the indemnified party is
an actual or potential party to such action or claim) unless such settlement,
compromise or judgment (A) includes an unconditional release of the
indemnified party from all liability arising out of such action or claim and
(B) does not include a statement as to or an admission of fault or
culpability, by or on behalf of any indemnified party.

  



  

   

 | 25| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(e) If for any reason the foregoing indemnity is unavailable,
unenforceable or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under
_Sections 2.9(a)_ , _(b)_ or _(c)_ , then each applicable indemnifying party
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable to such indemnified party as a
result of any Claim in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the indemnifying party, on the one hand, and the
indemnified party, on the other hand, with respect to such Claim.
The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the indemnifying party or the indemnified party and the parties'
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct
or prevent such untrue statement or omission. If, however, the allocation
provided in the second preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable law,
then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
such indemnified party in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect not
only such relative faults but also the relative benefits of the indemnifying
party and the indemnified party as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if any contribution pursuant to this _Section 2.9(e_) were to be
determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which
does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in the
preceding sentences of this _Section 2.9(e)_. The amount paid or payable in
respect of any Claim shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such indemnified party in connection with
investigating or defending any such Claim. No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. Notwithstanding anything in this _Section
2.9(e)_ to the contrary, no indemnifying party (other than the Company) shall
be required pursuant to this _Section 2.9(e)_ to contribute any amount
greater than the amount of the net proceeds received by such indemnifying
party from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration
statement giving rise to such Claim, less the amount of any indemnification
payment made by such indemnifying party pursuant to _Sections 2.9(b)_ and
_(c)_. In addition, no Holder of Registrable Securities or any Affiliate
thereof shall be required to pay any amount under this _Section 2.9(e)_
unless such Person or entity would have been required to pay an amount
pursuant to Section _2.9(b)_ if it had been applicable in accordance with its
terms.

  



  

(f) The indemnity and contribution agreements contained herein shall
be in addition to any other rights to indemnification or contribution which
any indemnified party may have pursuant to law or contract and shall remain
operative and in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made
or omitted by or on behalf of any indemnified party and shall survive the
transfer of the Registrable Securities by any such party.

  



  

(g) The indemnification and contribution required by this _Section
2.9_ shall be made by periodic payments of the amount thereof during the
course of the investigation or defense, as and when bills are received or
expense, loss, damage or liability is incurred.

  



  

2.10. _Limitations on Registration of Other Securities;
Representation_. From and after the date of this Agreement, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of the SPC Investors (not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed), enter into any agreement with any holder
or prospective holder of any securities of the Company giving such holder or
prospective holder any registration rights the terms of which are (i) more
favorable taken as a whole than the registration rights granted to the Holders
hereunder or (ii) on parity with the registration rights granted to the
Holders hereunder.

  



  

   

 | 26| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.11. _No Inconsistent Agreements_. The Company shall not hereafter
enter into any agreement with respect to its securities that is
inconsistent in any material respects with the rights granted to the Holders
in this Agreement.

  



  

2.12.   _Partner Distributions_. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the Company shall, at the request of any Holder
(including to effect a Partner Distribution) pursuant to Section 2.1 or
Section 2.2, file any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendments, or
include in the initial registration statement any disclosure or language, or
include in any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment any
disclosure or language, and otherwise take any action, deemed necessary or
advisable by such Holder or its counsel (including to effect such Partner
Distribution).

  



  

Section 3.   _Underwritten Offerings._

  



  

3.1. _Requested Underwritten Offerings_. If requested by the
underwriters for any underwritten offering pursuant to a registration
requested under Section 2.1, the Company shall enter into a customary
underwriting agreement with the underwriters. Such underwriting agreement
shall (i) be satisfactory in form and substance to the Initiating Holders and
the Majority Participating Holders, (ii) contain terms not inconsistent with
the provisions of this Agreement and (iii) contain such representations
and warranties by, and such other agreements on the part of, the Company and
such other terms as are generally prevailing in agreements of that type,
including indemnities and contribution agreements on substantially the same
terms as those contained herein or as otherwise customary for the lead
underwriter. Every Participating Holder shall be a party to such underwriting
agreement. Each Participating Holder shall not be required to make any
representations or warranties to or agreements with the Company or
the underwriters other than customary representations of a selling
shareholder, including representations, warranties or agreements regarding
its ownership of and title to the Registrable Securities, any written
information specifically provided by such Participating Holder for inclusion
in the registration statement and its intended method of distribution; and any
liability of such Participating Holder to any underwriter or other Person
under such underwriting agreement for indemnity, contribution or otherwise
shall in no case be greater than the amount of the net proceeds received by
such Participating Holder upon the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to
such registration statement and in no event shall relate to anything other
than information about such Holder specifically provided by such Holder for
use in the registration statement and prospectus.

  



  

3.2. _Piggyback Underwritten Offerings_. In the case of a
registration pursuant to Section 2.2, if the Company shall have determined to
enter into an underwriting agreement in connection therewith, all of the
Participating Holders' Registrable Securities to be included in such
registration shall be subject to such underwriting agreement. Each such
Participating Holder shall not be required to make any representations or
warranties to or agreements with the Company or the underwriters other
than customary representations of a selling shareholder, including
representations, warranties or agreements regarding its ownership of and
title to the Registrable Securities, any written information specifically
provided by such Participating Holder for inclusion in the registration
statement and its intended method of distribution; and any liability of such
Participating Holder to any underwriter or other Person under such
underwriting agreement shall in no case be greater than the amount of the net
proceeds received by such Participating Holder upon the sale of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement and in no event
shall relate to anything other than information about such Holder
specifically provided by such Holder for use in the registration
statement and prospectus.

Section 4.   _General._

  



  

  

4.1. _Adjustments Affecting Registrable Securities_. The provisions
of this Agreement shall apply, to the full extent set forth herein with
respect to the Registrable Securities, to any and all shares of capital stock
of the Company, any successor or assign of the Company (whether by merger,
share exchange, consolidation, sale of assets or otherwise) or any Subsidiary
or parent company of the Company which may be issued in respect of, in
exchange for or in substitution of, Registrable Securities and shall be
appropriately adjusted for any stock dividends, splits, reverse splits,
combinations, recapitalizations and the like occurring after the date hereof.

  



  

4.2. _Rule 144 and Rule 144A_. If the Company shall have filed a
registration statement pursuant to the requirements of Section 12 of the
Exchange Act or a registration statement pursuant to the requirements of the
Securities Act in respect of the Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents,
the Company covenants that (i) so long as it remains subject to the reporting
provisions of the Exchange Act, it will timely file the reports required to
be filed by it under the Securities Act or the Exchange Act (including, but
not limited to, the reports under Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act
referred to in subparagraph (c)(1)(i) of Rule 144 under the Securities Act,
as such Rule may be amended ("Rule 144")) or, if the Company is not required
to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder, make publicly
available other information so long as necessary to permit sales by such
Holder under Rule 144, Rule 144A under the Securities Act, as such Rule may be
amended ("Rule 144A"), or any similar rules or regulations hereafter adopted
by the SEC, and (ii) it will take such further action as any Holder
may reasonably request, all to the extent required from time to time to
enable such Holder to sell Registrable Securities without registration under
the Securities Act within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (A)
Rule 144, (B) Rule 144A, (C) Regulation S under the Securities Act or (D) any
similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. Upon the request of
any Holder of Registrable Securities, the Company will promptly deliver to
such Holder a written statement as to whether it has complied with such
requirements.

  



  

4.3. _Nominees for Beneficial Owners._ If Registrable Securities are
held by a nominee for the beneficial owner thereof, the beneficial
owner thereof may, at its option, be treated as the Holder of such
Registrable Securities for purposes of any request or other action by any
Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities pursuant to this Agreement (or any
determination of any number or percentage of shares constituting Registrable
Securities held by any Holder or Holders of Registrable Securities
contemplated by this Agreement); provided, however, that the Company shall
have received evidence reasonably satisfactory to it of such beneficial
ownership.

  



  

4.4. _Amendments and Waivers_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
no modification, amendment or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall
be effective against the Company or any Holder unless such modification,
amendment or waiver is approved in writing by the Company and the Holders
holding a majority of the Registrable Securities then held by all Holders;
provided that notwithstanding the foregoing, any amendment hereto or waiver
hereof that adversely affects one Holder, solely in its capacity as a Holder
of Registrable Securities, in a manner that is materially different from the
other Holders (in such capacity) shall require the consent of the Holder so
affected. No waiver of any of the provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
to or shall constitute a waiver of any other provision hereof (whether or not
similar). No failure or delay on the part of any party in exercising any
right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof or of
any other or future exercise of any such right, power or privilege.

given or delivered under or by reason of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (i) if
personally delivered, on the date of delivery, (ii) if delivered by express
courier service of national standing (with charges prepaid), on the Business
Day following the date of delivery to such courier service, (iii) if

4.6. _Successors and Assigns_. Except as otherwise provided herein,
this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the parties hereto and the respective successors, permitted
assigns, heirs and personal representatives of the parties hereto, whether so
expressed or not. This Agreement may not be assigned by the Company without
the prior written consent of the SPC Investors, Founder Investors and the
Intermex Investors. No Holder shall have the right to assign all or part of
its or his rights and obligations under this Agreement to any Person, unless
(i) such transferee duly executes and delivers to the Company a Joinder
Agreement and (ii) with respect to Holders that are also party to the
Shareholders Agreement, such assignment is made in connection with the
transfer of Registrable Securities to a Permitted Transferee (as defined in
the Shareholders Agreement) in accordance with and made in compliance with
the Shareholders Agreement. Upon any such assignment, such assignee shall
have and be able to exercise and enforce all rights of the assigning Holder
which are assigned to it and, to the extent such rights are assigned, any
reference to the assigning Holder shall be treated as a reference to the
assignee. If any Holder shall acquire additional Registrable Securities, such
Registrable Securities shall be subject to all of the terms, and entitled to
all the benefits, of this Agreement. Additional Persons may become parties to
this Agreement as "Minority Investors" with the consent of the Company and
the SPC Investors (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), by executing
and delivering to the Company the Joinder Agreement.

  



  

4.7.   _Termination_.

  



  

(a) The obligations of the Company and a Holder under this Agreement,
in each case solely with respect to such Holder, will terminate upon the
earliest date on which:

  



  

(i) such Holder no longer holds any Registrable Securities; or

  



  

   

 | 30| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

(ii) such Holder no longer beneficially owns at least 1% of the then
outstanding Common Stock or Common Stock Equivalents, and such Holder
(notwithstanding any beneficial ownership of Common Stock or Common Stock
Equivalents by such Holder) is not an Affiliate of the Company.

  



  

(b) This Agreement shall terminate on the date that is seven (7) years
from date hereof.

  



  

(c) Notwithstanding clauses (a) and (b) above, _Section 2.5_ ,
_Section 2.9_ , _Section 4.9_ and _Section 4.13_  shall survive termination
of this Agreement.

  



  

4.8. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement and the other documents
referred to herein or delivered pursuant hereto which form part hereof
constitute the entire agreement and understanding between the parties hereto
and supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the
subject matter hereof.

  



  

4.9. _Governing Law; Jurisdiction; WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL._

  



  

(a) This Agreement will be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the
principles of conflict of laws thereof.

  



  

(b) Any suit, action or proceeding seeking to enforce any provision
of, or based on any matter arising out of or in connection with, this
Agreement may be brought against any of the parties in the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware or any Delaware state court
located in Wilmington, Delaware, and each of the parties hereby consents to
the exclusive jurisdiction of such court (and of the appropriate appellate
courts) in any such suit, action or proceeding and waives any objection to
venue laid therein. Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be
served on any party anywhere in the world, whether within or without the
jurisdiction of any such court. EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT
OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THIS AGREEMENT.

  



  

4.10. _Interpretation; Construction._

  



  

(a) The table of contents and headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and
shall not be deemed to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof.
Where a reference in this Agreement is made to a Section, such reference
shall be to a Section of this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."

  



  

(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting
this Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 31| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.11. _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed and delivered in any
number of separate counterparts (including by facsimile or electronic
mail), each of which shall be an original, but all of which together shall
constitute one and the same agreement.

  



  

4.12. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the
application of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity or
unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision, or
the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.

  



  

4.13. _Specific Enforcement_. It is agreed and understood that monetary
damages would not adequately compensate an injured party for the breach of
this Agreement by any party hereto and, accordingly, that this Agreement shall
be specifically enforceable, in addition to any other remedy to which such
injured party is entitled at law or in equity, and that any breach of this
Agreement shall be the proper subject of a temporary or permanent injunction
or restraining order. Further, each party hereto waives any claim or defense
that there is an adequate remedy at law for such breach or threatened breach
or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any
reason at law or equity and agrees that a party's rights would be materially
and adversely affected if the obligations of the other parties under this
Agreement were not carried out in accordance with the terms and
conditions hereof. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required
to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with
or as a condition to obtain any remedy referred to in this Section 4.13, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

  



  

4.14.   _Further Assurances_. Each party hereto shall do and perform or
cause to be done and performed all such further acts and things and shall
execute and deliver all such other agreements, certificates, instruments, and
documents as any other party hereto reasonably may request in order to carry
out the intent and accomplish the purposes of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

  



  

   

 | 32| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

4.15.   _Confidentiality_. Each Holder agrees that any non-public
information which they may receive relating to the Company and its
Subsidiaries (the "Confidential Information") will be held strictly
confidential and will not be disclosed by it to any Person without the
express written permission of the Company; provided, however, that the
Confidential Information may be disclosed (i) in the event of any compulsory
legal process or compliance with any applicable law, subpoena or other legal
process, as required by an administrative requirement, order, decree or the
rules of any relevant stock exchange or in connection with any filings that
the Holder may be required to make with any regulatory authority; provided,
however, that in the event of compulsory legal process, unless prohibited by
applicable law or that process, each Holder agrees (A) to give the SPC
Investors and the Company prompt notice thereof and to cooperate with the
Company and the SPC Investors in securing a protective order in the event of
compulsory disclosure and (B) that any disclosure made pursuant to public
filings will be subject to the prior reasonable review of the Company and the
SPC Investors, (ii) to any foreign or domestic governmental or quasi-
governmental regulatory authority, including any stock exchange or other
self-regulatory organization having jurisdiction over such party, (iii) to
each Holder's or its Affiliate's, officers, directors, employees, partners,
accountants, lawyers and other professional advisors for use relating solely
to management of the investment or administrative purposes with respect to
such Holder and (iv) to a proposed transferee of securities of the Company
held by a Holder; provided, however, that the Holder informs the proposed
transferee of the confidential nature of the information and the proposed
transferee agrees in writing to comply with the restrictions in this Section
4.15 and delivers a copy of such writing to the Company.

  



  

4.16.   _Opt-Out Requests_. Each Holder shall have the right, at any time
and from time to time (including after receiving information regarding any
potential public offering), to elect to not receive any notice that the
Company or any other Holders otherwise are required to deliver pursuant to
this Agreement by delivering to the Company a written statement signed by such
Holder that it does not want to receive any notices hereunder (an "Opt-Out
Request"); in which case and notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement the Company and other Holders shall not be required to, and shall
not, deliver any notice or other information required to be provided to
Holders hereunder to the extent that the Company or such other Holders
reasonably expect would result in a Holder acquiring material non-public
information within the meaning of Regulation FD promulgated under the
Exchange Act. An Opt-Out Request may state a date on which it expires or, if
no such date is specified, shall remain in effect indefinitely. A Holder who
previously has given the Company an Opt-Out Request may revoke such
request at any time, and there shall be no limit on the ability of a Holder
to issue and revoke subsequent Opt-Out Requests; provided that each Holder
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to minimize the administrative
burden on the Company arising in connection with any such Opt-Out Requests.

  



  

4.17.   _Founders Registration Rights Agreement._ The Founder Investors
hereby agree that upon execution of this Agreement by such Founder Investors,
the Founders Registration Rights Agreement shall be automatically terminated
and superseded in its entirety by this Agreement.

conditions of the Agreement [that are applicable to, and assignable under the
Agreement by, the Transferring Holder,] in the same manner as if the New

and binding agreement of the New Holder, enforceable against the New Holder
in accordance with its terms.

  



  

3.2. _No Conflict_. The New Holder is not under any obligation or
restriction, nor shall it assume any such obligation or restriction, that

number of counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and
the same amendatory instrument.

NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and of the promises and
covenants contained herein, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

AGREEMENT

  



  

1\. _Definitions_. Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have
the respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2\. _Agreement to Vote_. During the term of this Agreement, each Voting Party
shall vote or cause to be voted all securities of the Company that may be
voted in the election of the Company's directors registered in the name of, or
beneficially owned (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange
Act, including by the exercise or conversion of any security exercisable or
convertible for shares of Common Stock, but excluding shares of stock
underlying unexercised options or warrants) (" _Beneficially Owned_ " or "

securities of the Company acquired and held in such capacity subsequent to the
date hereof (hereinafter referred to as the " _Voting Shares_ "), in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, whether at a regular or
special meeting of the Company's stockholders or any class or series of the
Company's stockholders or by written consent (unless such vote would be
inconsistent with such Voting Party's fiduciary duties under applicable law).

  



  

3. _Election of Boards of Directors_.

  



  

a. _Voting_. During the term of this Agreement, to the extent permitted by
the Company's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation, as it may be
amended, supplemented or restated from time to time (the " _Charter_ "), each
Voting Party shall vote (or consent pursuant to an action by written consent
of Company stockholders) all Voting Shares held by such Voting Party in
such manner as may be necessary to elect and/or maintain in office as members
of the Board the following persons:

  



  

i. Eight (8) persons (the " _Designees_ " and each a " _Designee_ ")
designated by the Intermex Representative (as defined herein), of which at
least three (3) of the Designees must qualify as an "independent director"
under the Exchange Act and the rules of Nasdaq (an " _Independent Director_
"); _provided_ _,_ _however_ _, _that if at any time during the term of this
Agreement: (a) the Intermex Holders collectively Beneficially Own less than
10% of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, then the Intermex
Representative shall have the right to designate only one Designee, and (b)
the Intermex Holders collectively Beneficially Own less than 5% of the

have no right to designate any person for election or re-election to the
Board; and

Designee is not appointed or elected to the Board because of such person's
death, disability, disqualification, withdrawal as a nominee or for other
reasons is unavailable or unable to be a director nominee, the Intermex
Representative shall be entitled to designate another Designee (and the
Company and the Voting Parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
ensure that such directorship for which the original designee was designated
shall not be filled pending such successor designation).

at any time during the term of this Agreement the Founding Shareholders

c. _Procedures; Rights_. Subject to the limitations set forth in Section
3(a) hereof and unless otherwise provided for pursuant to this Section 3(c),
the Intermex Representative shall designate the Designees as set forth in the
Form S-4 Registration Statement, dated as of [_________], for the duration of
this Agreement (the " _Registration Statement_ "). To the extent that the
Intermex Representative wishes to designate a Designee other than the Designee
so designated in the Registration Statement, the Intermex Representative
shall notify the Company in writing (a " _Designee Notice_ ") of the person or
persons that are to be a Designee(s) in accordance with this Section 3(c).
All Designee Notices shall be provided (i) in the case of an annual meeting
of Company stockholders, not later than the close of business on the 90th day
before the anniversary date of the immediately preceding annual meeting of
Company stockholders; _provided_ , _however_ , that in the event that
the annual meeting is called for a date that is not within 45 days before or
after such anniversary date, a Designee Notice shall be timely delivered if
received not later than the later of (x) the close of business on the 90th day
before the meeting or (y) the close of business on the 10th day following the
day on which public announcement of the date of the annual meeting was first
made by the Company; and (ii) in the case of a special meeting of Company
stockholders called for the purpose of electing directors, not later than the
close of business on the 10th day following the day on which public
announcement of the date of the special meeting is first made by the Company
(as applicable, the " _Designation Date_ "). The Intermex Representative
shall provide a copy of such Designee Notice to all other parties hereto at
the respective addresses set forth on _Annex A_ or at such other address as a
party may specify in writing. Annually with respect each Designee, the
Intermex Representative must provide the following information prior to the
Designation Date: (A) the name, age, business address and residence address
of the person, (B) the principal occupation or employment of the Designee, (C)
the class or series and number of shares of capital stock of the Company that
are Beneficially Owned or owned of record by the Designee and (D) any other
information relating to the Designee that would be required to be disclosed in
a proxy statement or other filings required to be made in connection with
solicitations of proxies for election of directors pursuant to Section 14 of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder;
_provided_ , _however_ , that the Company shall provide notice to the
Intermex Representative of any failure to provide the information required
under this sentence, and the Intermex Representative shall have 10 days upon
receipt of notice of such deficiency to cure such failure. So long as a
Designee is designated in accordance with the procedures and requirements set
forth in Sections 3(a) and 3(c), the Company shall use its reasonable best
efforts to ensure that (x) such Designee is included in the Board's slate of
nominees to the stockholders for the applicable election of directors and (y)
such Designee is included in the proxy statement prepared by the management
of the Company in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the
applicable meeting of the stockholders of the Company called with respect to
the election of the members of the Board, and at every adjournment or
postponement thereof, and on any applicable action or approval by written
consent of the stockholders of the Company or the Board with respect to the
election of members of the Board.

d. _Obligations; Vacancies; Removal_. The obligations of the Voting Parties
pursuant to this Section 3 shall include any stockholder vote to amend the
Charter and bylaws of the Company as required to effect the intent of this
Agreement. Each of the Company and the Voting Parties shall not take any
actions that would affect the provisions of this Agreement and the intention
of the parties with respect to the composition of the Board as herein stated.
In the event any director elected pursuant to the terms hereof ceases to
serve as a member of the Board, each of the Company and the Voting Parties,
in their capacity as Company stockholders, shall take all such action as is
reasonable and necessary to promptly cause the election or appointment of such
other substitute person to the Board as may be designated on the terms
provided herein, including, with respect to the Voting Parties, voting shares
of capital stock of the Company as to which the Voting Parties have
Beneficial Ownership and, with respect to the Intermex Holders, directing the
Designees serving on the board to support a substitute person as designated on
the terms provided herein. For the avoidance of doubt, if a Designee ceases
to serve as a member of the Board prior to the expiration of such Designee's
term, then the Intermex Representative shall be entitled to designate a
director nominee as such Designee's successor in accordance with this
Agreement (regardless of the Intermex Holders' Beneficial Ownership in the
Company at the time of such vacancy), it being understood that any such
designee shall serve the remainder of the term of the director whom such
designee replaces (unless duly removed in accordance with the Charter). Upon
the written request of the Intermex Representative to remove its
Designee, each Voting Party shall vote or cause to be voted his, her or its
Voting Shares for the removal of such director. No reduction in the
Beneficial Ownership of outstanding shares of Common Stock of the Intermex
Holders shall shorten the term of any Designee serving as a director. Nothing
in this Section 3(d) will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict an
officer or director from exercising his or her fiduciary duties as an officer
or director to the Company or its stockholders.

  



  

4. _Lock-Up_.

  



  

a. From the date hereof until the earliest to occur of (x) such time that the

(including pursuant to Rule 144 or by means of a private placement), (ii)

or in part, any of the economic consequences of ownership of any of the Voting

particular Voting Party, (ii) in the event of a liquidation, merger, stock
exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of the Company's
stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of Common Stock for
cash, securities or other property, (iii) in the event of a

the surviving entity that results in the directors and officers of the
Company ceasing to comprise a majority of the Company's board of directors (in
the case of directors) or management (in the case of officers) of the
surviving entity, or (iv) pursuant to a registered offering conducted in
accordance with the Registration Rights Agreement (each Transfer identified

Section 4 are fair and reasonable and in the best interests of the Voting

This Voting Agreement (this " _Agreement_ ") is made as of December 19, 2017
by and among FinTech Acquisition Corp. II, a Delaware corporation (the "
_Company_ "), Intermex Holdings II, Inc., a Delaware corporation (" _Intermex_
"), and the undersigned stockholders of the Company (collectively, the "
_Company Stockholders_ " or the " _Voting Parties_ ", and each, a " _Company
Stockholder_ " or a " _Voting Party_ ").

  



  

WHEREAS, concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, the Company,

subsidiary of the Company (" _Merger Sub 1_ "), FinTech II Merger Sub 2 LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company and direct wholly owned subsidiary of
the Company (" _Merger Sub 2_ "), Intermex, and SPC Intermex Representative
LLC, a Delaware limited liability company, have entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (as the same may be amended from time to time, the " _Merger
Agreement_ "), pursuant to which Merger Sub 1 will be merged (the " _First
Merger_ ") with and into Intermex with Intermex continuing as the initial
surviving entity, immediately following which the initial surviving
entity will be merged (the " _Second Merger_ ," and together with the First
Merger, the " _Mergers_ ") with and into Merger Sub 2, with Merger Sub 2
continuing as the surviving entity and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the
Company; and

  



  

WHEREAS, as a condition to its willingness to enter into the Merger
Agreement, Intermex has required that the Company Stockholders execute and
deliver this Agreement.

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and for other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt, sufficiency and adequacy of which are
hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto agree as follows:

  



  

1.   _Definitions_. As used herein the term " _Voting Shares_ " shall mean all securities of the Company beneficially owned (as such term is defined in Rule 13d-3 under the Exchange Act, including by the exercise or conversion of any security exercisable or convertible for shares of Company Common Stock (as defined herein), but excluding shares of stock underlying unexercised options or warrants) (" _Beneficially Owned_ " or " _Beneficial Ownership_ ") by any Voting Party, including any and all securities of the Company acquired and held in such capacity subsequent to the date hereof (the " _Company Voting Shares_ "). Capitalized terms used and not defined herein shall have the respective meanings assigned to them in the Merger Agreement.

  



  

2.   _Representations and Warranties of the Voting Parties_. Each Voting Party on its own behalf hereby represents and warrants to the other parties hereto, severally and not jointly, with respect to such Voting Party and such Voting Party's ownership of its Voting Shares set forth on _Annex A_ as follows:

under any "community property" or other laws for the execution and delivery of
this Agreement or the performance of Voting Party's obligations
hereunder. If Voting Party is a trust, no consent of any beneficiary is
required for the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the
performance of Voting Party's obligations hereunder.

  



  

c. _N_ _o Conflicts_. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
compliance with the terms hereof, will (A) if such Voting Party is a legal
entity, conflict with or violate any provision of the organizational documents

bond, mortgage, indenture, lease or other agreement, instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, license, judgment, order, notice, decree, statute,
law, ordinance, rule or regulation applicable to Voting Party or to
Voting Party's property or assets, except, in the case of clause (B), that

Mergers or that would reasonably be expected to prevent Voting Party from
fulfilling its obligations under this Agreement.

  



  

d.   _Ownership of Shares_. Voting Party Beneficially Owns its Voting
Shares free and clear of all Encumbrances. Except pursuant hereto and

a.  Each Voting Party shall during the term of this Agreement vote or

proposal or offer from any Person (other than Intermex or any of its

"), (2) the issuance or acquisition of shares of capital stock or other equity
securities of any Company Entity, or (3) the sale, lease, exchange or other
disposition of any significant portion of any Company Entity's properties or
assets; (B) any action, proposal, transaction or agreement which would
reasonably be expected to result in a breach of any covenant,
representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of the
Company or the Merger Subs under the Merger Agreement; and (C) any
action, proposal, transaction or agreement that would reasonably be expected
to impede, interfere with, delay, discourage, adversely affect or inhibit the
timely consummation of the Mergers or the fulfillment of the Company's or the
Merger Subs' conditions under the Merger Agreement or change in any manner
the voting rights of any class of shares of the Company (including any
amendments to the Company's certificate of incorporation or bylaws other than
in connection with the Mergers).

  



  

b.  The Voting Parties hereby authorize the Company, the Merger Subs and
Intermex to publish and disclose in any announcement or disclosure required
by the SEC and in the Proxy Statement and filings with any Governmental
Authority whose consent, approval, authorization or waiver is required to
consummate the Mergers, each Voting Party's identity and ownership of the
Voting Shares and the nature of each Voting Party's obligations under this
Agreement.

  

 ‌

  

4.   _No Voting Trusts or Other Arrangement_. Each Voting Party shall not, and shall not permit any entity under Voting Party's control to, deposit any Voting Shares in a voting trust, grant any proxies with respect to the Voting Shares or subject any of the Voting Shares to any arrangement with respect to the voting of the Voting Shares or otherwise in respect of the Voting Shares other than in accordance with this Agreement or the Merger Agreement. Each Voting Party hereby revokes any and all previous proxies and attorneys in fact with respect to the Voting Shares.

  



  

5.   _Transfer and Encumbrance_. Each Voting Party, during the term of this Agreement, shall not, directly or indirectly, transfer, sell, offer, exchange, assign, pledge or otherwise dispose of or encumber (" _Transfer_ ") any of his, her or its Voting Shares or enter into any contract, option or other agreement with respect to, or consent to, a Transfer of, any of his, her or its Voting Shares or Voting Party's voting or economic interest therein. Any attempted Transfer of Voting Shares or any interest therein in violation of this Section 5 shall be null and void. This Section 5 shall not prohibit a Transfer of Voting Shares by any Voting Party to (a) any other Voting Party or (b) with the prior written approval of Intermex, any other Person; _provided_ , _however_ , that a Transfer referred to in clause (b) of this sentence shall be permitted only if, as a precondition to such Transfer, the transferee agrees in a writing, reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company and Intermex, to be bound by all of the terms of this Agreement.

  



  

6.   _Appraisal and Dissenters ' Rights_. Each Voting Party hereby waives, and agrees not to assert or perfect, any rights of appraisal or rights to dissent from the Mergers that such Voting Party may have by virtue of ownership of Company Common Stock.

Each Voting Party acknowledges and agrees that he, she or it shall not acquire any additional equity securities of the Company after the date hereof if as a result of such acquisition, such Voting Party would Beneficially Own more than 9.9% of the equity securities of the Company, after giving effect to the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

8.   _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the earliest to occur of (i) the Second Merger Effective Time and (ii) the date on which the Merger Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms. Upon termination of this Agreement, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and have no effect and no party hereto shall have any further obligations or liabilities under this Agreement, except that (x) the provisions of Sections 8, 10, 12, and 13 shall survive termination and (y) nothing herein shall relieve any party from liability for any breach of this Agreement prior to such termination.

  



  

9.   _No Agreement as Director or Officer_. Voting Party is signing this Agreement solely in his, her or its capacity as a stockholder of the Company. No Voting Party makes any agreement or understanding in this Agreement in such Voting Party's capacity as a director or officer of the Company or any of its subsidiaries (if Voting Party holds such office). Nothing in this Agreement will limit or affect any actions or omissions taken by a Voting Party in his, her or its capacity as a director or officer of the Company, and no actions or omissions taken in any Voting Party's capacity as a director or officer shall be deemed a breach of this Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement will be construed to prohibit, limit or restrict a Voting Party from exercising his or her fiduciary duties as an officer or director to the Company or its stockholders, as applicable.

  



  

10. _Specific Enforcement_. It is agreed and understood that monetary damages would not adequately compensate an injured party for the breach of this Agreement by any party hereto and, accordingly, that this Agreement shall be specifically enforceable, in addition to any other remedy to which such injured party is entitled at law or in equity, and that any breach of this Agreement shall be the proper subject of a temporary or permanent injunction or restraining order. Further, each party hereto waives any claim or defense that there is an adequate remedy at law for such breach or threatened breach or an award of specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law or equity and agrees that a party's rights would be materially and adversely affected if the obligations of the other parties under this Agreement were not carried out in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtain any remedy referred to in this Section 10, and each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

  



  

11. _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement supersedes all prior agreements, written or oral, between the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. Any provision of this Agreement may be amended or waived if, but only if, such amendment or waiver is in writing and is signed, in the case of an amendment, by each party to this Agreement, or, in the case of a waiver, by the party against whom the waiver is to be effective. No waiver of any provisions hereof by either party shall be deemed a waiver of any other provisions hereof by such party, nor shall any such waiver be deemed a continuing waiver of any provision hereof by such party.

  



  

12. _Notices_. All notices, requests, claims, demands, and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given (a) when delivered by hand (with written confirmation of receipt), (b) when received by the addressee if sent by a nationally recognized overnight courier (receipt requested), (c) on the date sent by facsimile or e-mail of a PDF document (with confirmation of transmission) if sent during normal business hours of the recipient, and on the next Business Day if sent after normal business hours of the recipient, or (d) on the third day after the date mailed, by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid. Such communications must be sent to the respective parties at the addresses set forth on _Annex A_ (or at such other address for a party as shall be specified in a notice given in accordance with this Section 12).

13. _Miscellaneous_.

  



  

a.  This Agreement, the rights and duties of the parties hereto, and any
disputes (whether in contract, tort or statute) shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
Delaware without giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or
rule (whether of the State of Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would
cause the application of Laws of any jurisdiction other than those of the
State of Delaware.

  



  

b.  Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns shall be

court does not have subject matter jurisdiction over such action or
proceeding, in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware.
Each of the parties hereto agrees that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in
Section 12 or in such other manner as may be permitted by applicable Laws,
will be valid and sufficient service thereof. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court or tribunal other than the
aforesaid courts. Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and
agrees not to assert, by way of motion, as a defense, counterclaim or
otherwise, in any action or proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the

AGREEMENT

  



  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and the mutual promises
herein made, and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto, intending to
be legally bound, agree as follows:

  



  

Section 1. Escrow.

  



  

1.1 _Appointment; Cash Placed in Escrow_. Parent and Stockholder
Representative hereby appoint the Escrow Agent as their escrow agent for
the purposes set forth herein, and the Escrow Agent hereby accepts such
appointment and agrees to act as escrow agent in accordance with the terms
and conditions set forth herein. At the Closing, Parent shall deposit or cause
to be deposited with the Escrow Agent the Adjustment Escrow Amount to be held
in escrow in accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

   



 



    



  

1.2 _Adjustment Escrow Fund; Adjustment Escrow Account_.

  



  

(a) The Escrow Agent will issue its written confirmation of the receipt of
the Adjustment Escrow Amount and, upon delivery, shall hold the Adjustment
Escrow Amount, together with all products and investment proceeds thereof,
including all interest, dividends, gains and other income (collectively, the
" _Adjustment Escrow Earnings_ ") earned with respect thereto
(collectively, the " _Adjustment Escrow Fund_ "), and the Escrow Agent shall
hold the Adjustment Escrow Fund in an account established with the Escrow
Agent, subject to the terms of Section 3 below (the " _Adjustment Escrow
Account_ ").

  



  

(b) For greater certainty, all Adjustment Escrow Earnings shall be retained
by the Escrow Agent and reinvested in the Adjustment Escrow Fund and shall
become part of the Adjustment Escrow Fund; and shall be disbursed as part of
the Adjustment Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms and conditions of
this Agreement.

  



  

1.3 _Investments_. Unless otherwise jointly instructed in writing by the
Stockholder Representative and the Parent, the Escrow Agent shall invest and
reinvest the Adjustment Escrow Fund in a "noninterest-bearing deposit account"
insured by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (" _FDIC_ ") to the
applicable limits. The Adjustment Escrow Fund shall at all times
remain available for distribution in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

  



  

1.4 _Tax Matters_. Parent and Stockholder Representative agree that for tax
reporting purposes, all Adjustment Escrow Earnings shall, as of the end of
each calendar year and to the extent required by the Internal Revenue Service,
be reported as having been earned by Parent, whether or not such income was
distributed during such calendar year. Parent shall timely file all tax
returns and pay all taxes due with respect to Adjustment Escrow Earnings.

  



  

1.5 _Trust Fund_. The Adjustment Escrow Fund shall be held in trust and
shall not be subject to any lien, attachment, trustee process or any other
judicial process of any creditor of the Parent or Stockholder Representative.
The Escrow Agent shall hold and safeguard the Adjustment Escrow Fund until
the Termination Date (as defined in _Section 5_ ) or earlier distribution in
accordance with this Agreement.

  



  

Section 2. Release of Adjustment Escrow Fund.

  



  

The parties shall act in accordance with, and the Escrow Agent shall hold and
release the Adjustment Escrow Fund as provided in, this  _Section 2_ as
follows:

  



  

2.1 _General_. As promptly as practicable (but in any event within three (3)
Business Days) after receiving either (a) joint written instructions from the
Parent and the Stockholder Representative (" _Joint Instructions_ ") or (b) an
order issued by a court of competent jurisdiction (a " _Court Order_ ")
relating to the release of the Adjustment Escrow Fund, the Escrow Agent shall
release or cause to be released the Adjustment Escrow Earnings in the amounts,
to the Persons and in the manner set forth in such Joint Instructions or
Court Order.

  



  

2.2 _Method of Payment_. All payments of any part of the Adjustment Escrow
Fund shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an
account designated in advance as set forth in the Joint Instructions or Court
Order, as applicable.

  



  

   

 | 2| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

2.3 _Call Back Authorized Individuals_. In the event Joint Instructions are
delivered to the Escrow Agent, whether in writing, by telecopier, e-mail or
otherwise, the Escrow Agent is authorized to seek confirmation of such
instruction by telephone call back to the person or persons designated in
_Exhibits A-1_ and or _A-2_ annexed hereto (the " _Call Back Authorized
Individuals_ "), and the Escrow Agent may rely upon the confirmations of
anyone purporting to be a Call Back Authorized Individual. To assure
accuracy of the instructions it receives, the Escrow Agent may record such
call backs. If the Escrow Agent is unable to verify the instructions, or is
not satisfied with the verification it receives, it will not execute the
instruction until all such issues have been resolved. The persons and
telephone numbers for call backs may be changed only in writing actually
received and acknowledged by the Escrow Agent.

  



  

Section 3. _Fees and Expenses_. The Escrow Agent shall be entitled to
receive, from time to time, fees in accordance with  _Schedule 1_. In
accordance with _Schedule 1_ , the Escrow Agent will also be entitled to
reimbursement for reasonable and documented out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by the Escrow Agent in the performance of its duties hereunder and the
execution and delivery of this Agreement so long as Parent and the
Stockholder Representative consent in writing to the incurrence of
such expense. Parent shall be solely responsible for the fees and expenses of
the Escrow Agent hereunder.

  



  

Section 4. _Limitation of Escrow Agent 's Liability_.

  



  

4.1 _Duties and Limitation of Liability_. The Escrow Agent undertakes to
perform such duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement only and
shall have no duty under any other agreement or document, and no implied
covenants or obligations shall be read into this Agreement against the Escrow
Agent. The Escrow Agent shall incur no liability with respect to any action
taken by it or for any inaction on its part in reliance upon any notice,
direction, instruction, consent, statement or other document believed by it
in good faith to be genuine and duly authorized, nor for any other action or
inaction except for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct. In all
questions arising under this Agreement and/or its interpretation hereof in
conjunction with the Merger Agreement, the Escrow Agent may rely on the
advice of counsel, and for anything done, omitted or suffered in good faith by
the Escrow Agent based upon such advice the Escrow Agent shall not be liable
to anyone. In no event shall the Escrow Agent be liable for incidental,
punitive or consequential damages.

  



  

4.2 _Indemnity_. Parent, on the one hand, and Stockholder Representative
(solely on behalf of the Company's stockholder and in its capacity as the
Stockholder Representative, not in its individual capacity), on the other
hand, hereby agree that the Parent and Stockholder Representative will
jointly and severally indemnify the Escrow Agent and its officers, directors,
employees and agents for, and hold it and them harmless against, any loss,
liability or expense (including attorney fees) (" _Losses_ ") incurred in
connection with the Escrow Agent's carrying out its duties hereunder, except
for Losses arising out of or in connection with gross negligence or willful
misconduct on the part of the Escrow Agent (or its officers, directors,
employees or agents). This right of indemnification shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the resignation of the Escrow Agent.

  



  

   

 | 3| 
---|---|--- 

 



    



  

Section 5. _Termination_. This Agreement shall terminate upon the release by
the Escrow Agent of all amounts held in the Adjustment Escrow Account in
accordance with _Section 2_ (the date of such release being referred to as the
" _Termination Date_ ").

  



  

Section 6. _Successor Escrow Agent_. In the event the Escrow Agent becomes
unavailable or unwilling to continue as escrow agent under this Agreement,
the Escrow Agent may resign and be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder by giving its written resignation to the parties to this Agreement.
Such resignation shall take effect not less than 30 days after it is given to
all the other parties hereto. In such event, the Parent and the Stockholder
Representative may jointly appoint a successor Escrow Agent. If the Parent
and the Stockholder Representative fail to appoint a successor Escrow Agent
within 15 days after receiving the Escrow Agent's written resignation, the
Escrow Agent shall have the right to apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Escrow Agent. The successor
Escrow Agent shall execute and deliver to the Escrow Agent an
instrument accepting such appointment, and the successor Escrow Agent shall,
without further acts, be vested with all the estates, property rights, powers
and duties of the predecessor Escrow Agent as if originally named as Escrow
Agent herein. The Escrow Agent shall act in accordance with written
instructions from the Parent and Stockholder Representative as to the transfer
of the Adjustment Escrow Fund to a successor Escrow Agent.

  



  

Section 7. _Representative_. Unless and until the Parent and Escrow Agent
shall have received written notice of the appointment of a successor
Stockholder Representative, each of the Parent and Escrow Agent shall be
entitled to rely on the power and authority of Stockholder Representative to
act on behalf of the Company's stockholder.

8.1 _Attorneys ' Fees_. In any action at law or suit in equity to enforce or
interpret this Agreement or the rights of any of the parties hereunder, the

Important information about opening a new account

  



  

 _To help the government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering
activities, Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain,
verify, and record information that identifies each person (individual,
corporation, partnership, trust, estate or other entity recognized as a legal
person) for whom we open an account._

 _What this means for you: Before we open an account, we will ask for your
name, address, date of birth (for individuals), TIN/EIN or other information
that will allow us to identify you or your company. For individuals, this
could mean identifying documents such as a driver 's license. For a
corporation, partnership, trust, estate or other entity recognized as a legal
person, this could mean identifying documents such as a Certificate of
Formation from the issuing state agency_.

shall have the sole authority to (i) determine the Participants to whom
Grants shall be made under the Plan, (ii) determine the type, size and terms
of the Grants to be made to each Participant, (iii) determine the time when
the Grants will be made and the duration of any applicable exercise
or restriction period, including the criteria for exercisability and the

Grant, subject to the provisions of Section 20, (v) adopt guidelines separate
from the Plan that set forth the specific terms and conditions for Grants
under the Plan, and (vi) deal with any other matters arising under the Plan.

  



  

(b) The Administrator shall have full power and express discretionary
authority to administer and interpret the Plan, to make
factual determinations and to adopt or amend such rules, regulations,
agreements and instruments for implementing the Plan and for the conduct of
its business as it deems necessary or advisable, in its sole discretion. The
Administrator's interpretations of the Plan and all determinations made by
the Administrator pursuant to the powers vested in it hereunder shall be
conclusive and binding on all persons having any interest in the Plan or in
any awards granted hereunder. All powers of the Administrator shall be
executed in its sole discretion, in the best interest of the Company, not as a
fiduciary, and in keeping with the objectives of the Plan and need not be
uniform as to similarly situated individuals.

  



  

(c) The Administrator, in its discretion, may delegate to one or more
officers of the Company all or part of the Administrator's authority and
duties with respect to grants and awards to individuals who are not subject to
the reporting and other provisions of Section 16 of the Exchange Act. The
Administrator may revoke or amend the terms of a delegation at any time but
such action shall not invalidate any prior actions of the Administrator's
delegate or delegates that were consistent with the terms of the Plan and the
Administrator's prior delegation. Any delegation by the Administrator pursuant
to this Section shall be subject to such conditions and limitations as may be
determined by the Administrator and shall be subject to and limited
by applicable law or regulation, including without limitation the rules and
regulations of the New York Stock Exchange or such other securities exchange
on which the Stock is then listed.

   4.| _Grants_ 
---|--- 
  



  

Grants under the Plan may consist of Options, SARs, Stock Units, Performance
Shares, Stock Awards, Dividend Equivalents and Other Stock-Based Awards. All
Grants shall be subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and to
such other terms and conditions consistent with the Plan as the Administrator
deems appropriate and as are specified in writing by the Administrator in
separate guidelines or to the individual in the Grant Instrument or an
amendment to the guidelines or Grant Instrument. The Administrator shall
approve the form and provisions of each Grant Instrument. All Grants shall be
made conditional upon the Participant's acknowledgment, in writing or by
acceptance of the Grant, that all decisions and determinations of the
Administrator shall be final and binding on the Participant, his or her
beneficiaries, and any other person having or claiming an interest under such
Grant. Grants under a particular Section of the Plan need not be uniform as
among the Participants.

  



   5.| _Shares  of Stock Subject to the Plan_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Shares Authorized_. The total aggregate number of shares of Stock
that may be issued or transferred under the Plan is [
]1 shares, subject to adjustment as described below. The shares may be
authorized but unissued shares of Stock or reacquired shares of Stock,
including shares purchased by the Company on the open market for purposes of
the Plan. Grants paid in cash shall not count against the foregoing share
limits.

  



  

(b) _Share Counting_. For administrative purposes, when the Administrator
makes a Grant payable in Stock, the Administrator shall reserve shares of
Stock equal to the maximum number of shares of Stock that may be payable under
the Grant. If and to the extent Options or SARs granted under the Plan
terminate, expire, or are canceled, forfeited, exchanged or surrendered
without having been exercised or if any Stock Awards, Stock Units,
Performance Shares, Dividend Equivalents or Other Stock-Based Awards are
forfeited or terminated, or otherwise are not paid in full, the shares
subject to such Grants which have not been issued shall again be available
for purposes of the Plan. Shares of Stock withheld in payment of the Option
Price of an Option or withheld for purposes of satisfying the Employer's
minimum tax withholding obligations with respect to Grants under the Plan
shall not be available for re-issuance or transfer under the Plan. Upon the
exercise of an Option through the withholding of shares or upon the
exercise of a SAR, then both for purposes of calculating the number of shares
of Stock remaining available for issuance under the Plan and the number of
shares of Stock remaining available for exercise under the Option or SAR, the
number of such shares shall be reduced by the gross number of shares for
which the Option or SAR is exercised. To the extent that any Grants are paid
in cash and not shares of Stock, such Grants shall not count against the
share limits in subsection (a) above. For the avoidance of doubt, if shares
of Stock are repurchased on the open market with the proceeds of the exercise
price of Options, such shares may not again be made available for issuance
under the Plan.

  



  

(c) _Individual Limits_. All Grants under the Plan, other than Dividend
Equivalents, shall be expressed in shares of Stock. The maximum aggregate
number of shares of Stock with respect to which all Grants, other than
Dividend Equivalents, may be made under the Plan to any individual during any
calendar year shall be [ ] shares, subject to adjustment as
described below. A Participant may not accrue Dividend Equivalents during any
calendar year in excess of $[ ]. The individual limits
described in this subsection (c) shall apply without regard to whether the
Grants are to be paid in Stock or in cash. All cash payments (other than
Dividend Equivalents) shall equal the Fair Market Value of the shares of
Stock to which the cash payment relates.

  



  

  



  

1Shares authorized for issuance to include 8.5% of the fully diluted equity
of the Company (without taking into account any warrants of the Company), of
which 8% will be reserved for grants to management only (6% to be provided in
options granted to management at closing, and the remaining 2% to management
post-closing). Of the 6% of options granted to management at closing, 3% shall
be issued to Robert Lisy and the remaining 3% shall be allocated to the
management team as determined by Robert Lisy with the approval of the
Compensation Committee of the Board.

  



  

   

4

 



    



  

(d) _Adjustments_. If there is any change in the number or kind of shares
of Stock outstanding (i) by reason of a stock dividend, spinoff,
recapitalization, stock split, or combination or exchange of shares, (ii) by
reason of a merger, reorganization or consolidation, (iii) by reason of a
reclassification or change in par value, or (iv) by reason of any other
extraordinary or unusual event affecting the outstanding Stock as a class
without the Company's receipt of consideration, or if the value of
outstanding shares of Stock is substantially reduced as a result of a spinoff
or the Company's payment of an extraordinary dividend or distribution, the
maximum number of shares of Stock available for issuance under the Plan, the
maximum number of shares of Stock for which any individual may receive
pursuant to Grants in any year, the number of shares covered by outstanding
Grants, the kind of shares to be issued or transferred under the Plan, and
the price per share or the applicable market value of such Grants shall be
equitably adjusted by the Administrator, in such manner as the Administrator
deems appropriate, to reflect any increase or decrease in the number of, or
change in the kind or value of, issued shares of Stock to preclude, to the
extent practicable, the enlargement or dilution of rights and benefits under
such Grants; provided, however, that any fractional shares resulting from
such adjustment shall be eliminated. In addition, in the event of a Change of
Control of the Company, the provisions of Section 18 of the Plan shall apply.
Any adjustments to outstanding Grants shall be consistent with section 409A or
424 of the Code, to the extent applicable. Any adjustments determined by the
Administrator shall be final, binding and conclusive.

  



   6.| _Eligibility  for Participation_ 
---|--- 
  



  

Any employee of the Company or an Affiliate of the Company, any member of the
Board and any individual who provides services to the Company or an Affiliate
of the Company is eligible to participate in this Plan if the Administrator,
in its sole discretion, determines that such person has contributed
significantly or can be expected to contribute significantly to the profits or
growth of the Company or an Affiliate of the Company. Grants will be made
only to persons who are employees, directors, consultants or advisors of the
Company for purposes of Form S-8 registration under the Securities Act of
1933, as amended. Options and SARs may be granted only to persons who perform
direct services to the Company on the date of grant, as determined under
section 409A of the Code.

  



   7.| _Options_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _General Requirements_. The Administrator may grant Options to a
Participant upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems
appropriate under this Section 7.

  



  

(b) _Number of Shares_. The Administrator shall determine the number of
shares of Stock that will be subject to each Grant of Options to
Participants.

  



  

(c) _Type of Option and Price_.

  



   | (i)| The  Administrator may grant Incentive Stock Options or
Nonqualified Stock Options or any  combination of Incentive Stock Options and
Nonqualified Stock Options. Incentive Stock  Options may be granted only to
employees of the Company or its Subsidiaries. No Option  that is intended to
be an Incentive Stock Option shall be invalid for failure to qualify  as an
Incentive Stock Option. Nonqualified Stock Options may be granted to any
Participant. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| The  Option Price shall be determined by the Administrator and
may be equal to or greater  than the Fair Market Value of the shares of Stock
subject to the Grant on the Date of  Grant; provided, however, that an
Incentive Stock Option may not be granted to any person  who, at the Date of
Grant, owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total combined 
voting power of all classes of stock of the Company or any Subsidiary, unless
the Option  Price is not less than 110% of the Fair Market Value on the Date
of Grant. 
---|---|--- 
  | | 
     

(d) _Option Term_. The Administrator shall determine the term of each
Option. The term of an Option shall not exceed ten years from the Date of
Grant. However, an Incentive Stock Option that is granted to an Employee who,
at the Date of Grant, owns stock possessing more than 10 percent of the total
combined voting power of all classes of stock of the Company, or any
Subsidiary, may not have a term that exceeds five years from the Date of
Grant.

  



  

   

5

 



    



  

(e) _Exercisability of Options._ Options shall become exercisable in
accordance with such terms and conditions as may be determined by the
Administrator and specified in the Grant Instrument. The Administrator may
accelerate the exercisability of any or all outstanding Options at any time
for any reason.

  



  

(f) _Termination of Employment or Service_. Except as provided in the
Grant Instrument, an Option may only be exercised while the Participant is
employed by, or providing service to, the Company, an Affiliate or another
entity as designated in the Grant Instrument. The Administrator shall specify
in the Grant Instrument under what circumstances and during what time periods
a Participant may exercise an Option after termination of employment or
service.

  



  

(g) _Exercise of Options_. A Participant may exercise an Option that has
become exercisable, in whole or in part, by delivering a notice of exercise
to the Company or its designated agent. The Participant shall pay the Option
Price and any withholding taxes for the Option (i) in cash or by certified
check, (ii) with the approval of the Administrator, by withholding shares of
Stock subject to the Option, by delivering shares of Stock owned by the
Participant or by attestation (on a form prescribed by the Administrator) to
ownership of shares of Stock (in each case, such shares of Stock shall have an
aggregate Fair Market Value on the date of exercise equal to the Option
Price), (iii) in cash, on the [T+3] settlement date that occurs after
the exercise date specified in the notice of exercise, provided that the
Participant exercises the Option through an irrevocable agreement with a
registered broker and the payment is made in accordance with procedures
permitted by Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board and such procedures do
not violate applicable law, or (iv) by such other method as the Administrator
may approve, to the extent permitted by applicable law. Shares of Stock used
to exercise an Option shall have been held by the Participant for the
requisite period of time to avoid adverse accounting consequences to the
Company with respect to the Option. Payment for the shares pursuant to the
Option, and any required withholding taxes, must be received by the time
specified by the Administrator depending on the type of payment being made.

  



  

(h) _Limits on Incentive Stock Options_. Each Incentive Stock Option
shall provide that if the aggregate Fair Market Value on the Date of Grant
with respect to which Incentive Stock Options are exercisable for the first
time by a Participant during any calendar year, under the Plan or any other
stock option plan of the Company or a Parent or Subsidiary, exceeds $100,000,
then the Option, as to the excess, shall be treated as a Nonqualified Stock
Option.

  



   8.| _SARs_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _General Requirements_. The Administrator may grant SARs to any
Participant, upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems
appropriate under this Section 8\. Each SAR shall represent the right of the
Participant to receive, upon settlement of the SAR, shares of Stock or cash
equal to the amount by which the Fair Market Value of a share of Stock on the
date of exercise of the SAR exceeds the base amount of the SAR as described
below in Section 8(c).

  



  

(b) _Terms of SARs_. The Administrator shall determine the terms and
conditions of SARs and may grant SARs separately from or in tandem with any
Option (for all or a portion of the applicable Option). Tandem SARs may be
granted either at the time the Option is granted or any time thereafter while
the Option remains outstanding; provided, however, that in the case of an
Incentive Stock Option, SARs may be granted only at the time of the grant of
the Incentive Stock Option. The Administrator will determine the number of
SARs to be granted, the base amount, the vesting and other restrictions
applicable to SARs and the period during which SARs will remain exercisable.
The term of SARs shall not exceed ten years from the Date of Grant.

  



  

(c) _Base Amount_. The Administrator shall establish the base amount of
the SAR at the time the SAR is granted. The base amount shall not be less

(d) _Payment With Respect to SARs_. The Administrator shall determine
whether the appreciation in an SAR shall be paid in the form of cash, in
Stock, or in a combination of the two, in such proportion as the Administrator
deems appropriate. For purposes of calculating the number of shares of Stock
to be received, Stock shall be valued at its Fair Market Value on the date of
exercise of the SAR. If shares of Stock are to be received upon exercise of
an SAR, cash shall be delivered in lieu of any fractional share.

  



  

(e) _Requirement of Employment or Service_. The Administrator shall
determine in the Grant Instrument under what circumstances a Participant may
retain SARs after termination of the Participant's employment or service, and
the circumstances under which SARs may be forfeited.

  



   9.| _Stock  Units_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _General Requirements_. The Administrator may grant Stock Units to a
Participant, upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator deems
appropriate under this Section 9\. Each Stock Unit shall represent the right
of the Participant to receive a share of Stock or an amount based on the
value of a share of Stock. All Stock Units shall be credited to accounts on
the Company's records for purposes of the Plan.

  



  

(b) _Terms of Stock Units_. The Administrator may grant Stock Units that
are payable if specified performance goals or other conditions are met, or
under other circumstances. Stock Units may be paid at the end of a specified
period, or payment may be deferred to a date authorized by the Administrator.
The Administrator shall determine the number of Stock Units to be granted and
the requirements applicable to such Stock Units.

  



  

(c) _Payment With Respect to Stock Units_. Payment with respect to Stock
Units shall be made in cash, in Stock, or in a combination of the two, as
determined by the Administrator. The Grant Instrument shall specify the
maximum number of shares that shall be paid under the Stock Units.

  



  

(d) _Requirement of Employment or Service_. The Administrator shall

---|--- 
  



  

(a) _General Requirements_. The Administrator may grant Performance
Shares to a Participant, upon such terms and conditions as the Administrator
deems appropriate under this Section 10\. Each Performance Share shall
represent the right of the Participant to receive a share of Stock or an
amount based on the value of a share of Stock, if specified performance goals
are met. All Performance Shares shall be credited to accounts on the
Company's records for purposes of the Plan.

  



  

(b) _Terms of Performance Shares_. The Administrator shall establish the
performance goals and other conditions for payment of Performance Shares.
Performance Shares may be paid at the end of a specified performance or other

granted and the requirements applicable to such Performance Shares.

  



  

(c) _Payment With Respect to Performance Shares_. Payment with respect to
Performance Shares shall be made in cash, in Stock, or in a combination of
the two, as determined by the Administrator. The Administrator may establish
in the Grant Instrument a target amount to be paid under a Performance Share
based on achievement of the performance goals.

  



  

(d) _Requirement of Employment or Service_. The Administrator shall
determine in the Grant Instrument under what circumstances a Participant may
retain Performance Shares after termination of the Participant's employment or

   11.| _Stock  Awards_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _General Requirements_. The Administrator may issue or transfer
shares of Stock to a Participant under a Stock Award, upon such terms and
conditions as the Administrator deems appropriate under this Section 11\.
Shares of Stock issued or transferred pursuant to Stock Awards may be issued
or transferred for cash consideration or for no cash consideration, and
subject to restrictions or no restrictions, as determined by the
Administrator. The Administrator may establish conditions under which
restrictions on Stock Awards shall lapse over a period of time or according
to such other criteria as the Administrator deems appropriate,
including restrictions based upon the achievement of specific performance
goals.

  



  

(b) _Number of Shares_. The Administrator shall determine the number of
shares of Stock to be issued or transferred pursuant to a Stock Award and any
restrictions applicable to such shares.

  



  

(c) _Requirement of Employment or Service_. The Administrator shall
determine in the Grant Instrument under what circumstances a Participant may
retain Stock Awards after termination of the Participant's employment or
service, and the circumstances under which Stock Awards may be forfeited.

  



  

(d) _Restrictions on Transfer_. While Stock Awards are subject to
restrictions, a Participant may not sell, assign, transfer, pledge or
otherwise dispose of the shares of a Stock Award except upon death as
described in Section 17\. Each certificate, or electronic book entry
equivalent, for a share of a Stock Award shall contain a legend giving
appropriate notice of the restrictions in the Grant. The Participant shall be
entitled to have the legend removed when all restrictions on such shares have
lapsed. The Administrator may retain possession of any stock certificates for
Stock Awards until all restrictions on such shares have lapsed.

  



  

(e) _Right to Vote and to Receive Dividends_. The Administrator shall
determine to what extent, and under what conditions, the Participant shall
have the right to vote shares of Stock Awards and to receive any dividends or
other distributions paid on such shares during the restriction period. The
Administrator may determine that a Participant's entitlement to dividends or
other distributions with respect to a Stock Award shall be subject to
achievement of performance goals or other conditions.

  



   12.| _Dividend  Equivalents_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _General Requirements_. When the Administrator makes a Grant under
the Plan, other than an Option or SAR, the Administrator may grant Dividend
Equivalents in connection with such Grants, under such terms and conditions as
the Administrator deems appropriate under this Section 12\. Dividend
Equivalents may be paid to Participants currently or may be deferred, as
determined by the Administrator. All Dividend Equivalents that are not paid
currently shall be credited to accounts on the Company's records for purposes
of the Plan. Dividend Equivalents may be accrued as a cash obligation, or may
be converted to Stock Units for the Participant, as determined by the
Administrator. Unless otherwise specified in the Grant Instrument, deferred
Dividend Equivalents will not accrue interest. The Administrator may provide
that Dividend Equivalents shall be payable based on the achievement
of specific performance goals. Dividend Equivalents may accrue on unearned
performance awards but shall not be payable unless and until such performance
metrics are met.

  



  

(b) _Payment with Respect to Dividend Equivalents_. Dividend Equivalents
may be payable in cash or shares of Stock or in a combination of the two, as
determined by the Administrator.

  



   13.| _Other  Stock-Based Awards_ 
---|--- 
  



  

The Administrator may grant other awards that are cash-based or based on,
measured by or payable in Stock to Participants, on such terms and conditions
as the Administrator deems appropriate under this Section 13\. Other Stock-
Based Awards may be granted subject to achievement of performance goals or
other conditions and may be payable in Stock or cash, or in a combination of
the two, as determined by the Administrator in the Grant Instrument.

  



  

   

8

 



    



   14.| _Qualified  Performance-Based Compensation_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Designation as Qualified Performance-Based Compensation_. The
Administrator may determine that Stock Units, Performance Shares, Stock
Awards, Dividend Equivalents or Other Stock-Based Awards granted to an
Employee shall be considered "qualified performance-based compensation" under
section 162(m) of the Code. The provisions of this Section 14 shall apply
to any such Grants that are to be considered "qualified performance-based
compensation" under section 162(m) of the Code. To the extent that Grants of
Stock Units, Performance Shares, Stock Awards, Dividend Equivalents or Other
Stock-Based Awards designated as "qualified performance-based compensation"
under section 162(m) of the Code are made, no such Grant may be made as an
alternative to another Grant that is not designated as "qualified performance
based compensation" but instead must be separate and apart from all other
Grants made.

  



  

(b) _Performance Goals_. When Stock Units, Performance Shares, Stock
Awards, Dividend Equivalents or Other Stock-Based Awards that are to be
considered "qualified performance-based compensation" are granted, the
Administrator shall establish in writing (i) the objective performance goals
that must be met, (ii) the period during which performance will be
measured, (iii) the maximum amounts that may be paid if the performance goals
are met, and (iv) any other conditions that the Administrator deems
appropriate and consistent with the Plan and the requirements of section
162(m) of the Code for "qualified performance-based compensation." The
performance goals shall satisfy the requirements for "qualified performance-
based compensation," including the requirement that the achievement of the
goals be substantially uncertain at the time they are established and that
the performance goals be established in such a way that a third party with
knowledge of the relevant facts could determine whether and to what extent
the performance goals have been met. The Administrator shall not have
discretion to increase the amount of compensation that is payable upon
achievement of the designated performance goals, but the Administrator may
reduce the amount of compensation that is payable upon achievement of the
designated performance goals.

  



  

(c) _Criteria Used for Objective Performance Goals_. The Administrator
shall use objectively determinable performance goals based on one or more of
the following criteria: Stock price, earnings per share of Stock, net
earnings, operating earnings, return on assets, stockholder return, return on
equity, growth in assets, unit volume, sales, market share, or strategic
business criteria consisting of one or more objectives based on meeting
specific revenue goals, market penetration goals, geographic business
expansion goals, cost targets or goals relating to acquisitions or
divestitures. The performance goals may relate to the Participant's business
unit or the performance of the Company, a Subsidiary, or the Company and its
Subsidiaries as a whole, or any combination of the foregoing. Performance
goals need not be uniform as among Participants.

  



  

(d) _Timing of Establishment of Goals_. The Administrator shall establish
the performance goals in writing either before the beginning of the
performance period or during a period ending no later than the earlier of (i)
90 days after the beginning of the performance period or (ii) the date on
which 25% of the performance period has been completed, or such other date as
may be required or permitted under applicable regulations under section 162(m)
of the Code.

  



  

(e) _Certification of Results_. The Administrator shall certify and
announce the results for the performance period to all Participants after the
Company announces the Company's financial results for the performance period.
The Administrator shall determine the amount, if any, to be paid pursuant to
each Grant based on the achievement of the performance goals and the terms of
each Grant Instrument.

  



  

(f) _Death, Disability or Other Circumstances_. The Administrator may
provide in the Grant Instrument that Grants shall be payable, in whole or in
part, in the event of the Participant's death or disability, a Change of
Control or under other circumstances consistent with the Treasury regulations
and rulings under section 162(m) of the Code.

  



   15.| _Deferrals_ 
---|--- 
  



  

The Administrator may permit or require a Participant to defer receipt of the
payment of cash or the delivery of shares of Stock that would otherwise be
due to the Participant in connection with any Grant. The Administrator shall
establish rules and procedures for such deferrals. Any deferrals under the
Plan shall be intended to comply with the requirements of section 409A of the
Code, and any corresponding regulations and guidance.

  



  

   

9

 



    



   16.| _Withholding  of Taxes_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Required Withholding_. All Grants under the Plan shall be subject to
applicable federal (including FICA), state and local tax withholding
requirements. The Employer may require that the Participant or other person
receiving or exercising Grants pay to the Employer the amount of any federal,
state or local taxes that the Employer is required to withhold with respect to
such Grants, or the Employer may deduct from other wages paid by the Employer
the amount of any withholding taxes due with respect to such Grants.

  



  

(b) _Election to Withhold Shares_. If the Administrator so permits, a
Participant may elect to satisfy the Employer's tax withholding obligation
with respect to Grants paid in Stock by having shares withheld, at the time
such Grants become taxable, up to an amount that does not exceed the minimum
applicable withholding tax rate for federal (including FICA), state and
local tax liabilities. In addition, with respect to any required tax
withholding amount that exceeds the minimum applicable withholding tax rate,
the Administrator may permit a Participant to satisfy such tax withholding
obligation with respect to such excess amount by providing that the
Participant may elect to deliver to the Company shares of Stock owned by the
Participant that have been held by the Participant for the requisite period
of time to avoid adverse accounting consequences to the Company. The
elections described in this subsection (b) must be in a form and manner
prescribed by the Administrator and may be subject to the prior approval of
the Administrator.

  



   17.| _Transferability  of Grants_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _In General_. Except as provided in this Section 17, only the
Participant may exercise rights under a Grant during the Participant's
lifetime. A Participant may not transfer those rights except by will or by the
laws of descent and distribution, or, with respect to Grants other than
Incentive Stock Options, if permitted in any specific case by the
Administrator, pursuant to a domestic relations order. When a Participant
dies, the Successor Participant may exercise such rights in accordance
with the terms of the Plan. A Successor Participant must furnish proof
satisfactory to the Company of his or her right to receive the Grant under
the Participant's will or under the applicable laws of descent and
distribution.

  



  

(b) _Transfer of Nonqualified Stock Options_. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Administrator may provide in a Grant Instrument that a
Participant may transfer Nonqualified Stock Options to family members of the
Participant, one or more trusts in which family members of the Participant
have more than 50% of the beneficial interest, foundations in which family
members of the Participant (or the Participant) control the management of
assets, or any other entity in which family members of the Participant (or
the Participant) own more than 50% of the voting interests, consistent with
applicable securities laws, according to such terms as the Administrator may
determine; provided that the Participant receives no consideration for the
transfer of a Nonqualified Stock Option and the transferred Nonqualified
Stock Option shall continue to be subject to the same terms and conditions as
were applicable to the Nonqualified Stock Option immediately before the
transfer.

  



   18.| _Consequences  of a Change of Control_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Assumption of Grants_. Upon a Change of Control where the Company is
not the surviving corporation (or survives only as a subsidiary of another
corporation), unless the Administrator determines otherwise, all outstanding
Options and SARs that are not exercised shall be assumed by, or replaced with
comparable options or rights by, the surviving corporation (or a parent
or subsidiary of the surviving corporation), and other outstanding Grants
shall be converted to similar grants of the surviving corporation (or a
parent or subsidiary of the surviving corporation).

  



  

   

10

 



    



  

(b) _Other Alternatives_. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of
a Change of Control, the Administrator may take any of the following actions
with respect to any or all outstanding Grants: the Administrator may (i)
determine that outstanding Options and SARs shall accelerate and become
exercisable, in whole or in part, upon the Change of Control or upon such
other event as the Administrator determines, (ii) determine that the
restrictions and conditions on outstanding Stock Awards shall lapse, in whole
or in part, upon the Change of Control or upon such other event as the
Administrator determines, (iii) determine that Participants holding Stock
Units, Performance Shares, Dividend Equivalents, and Other Stock-Based Awards
shall receive a payment in settlement of such Stock Units, Performance
Shares, Dividend Equivalents, and Other Stock-Based Awards in an
amount determined by the Administrator, (iv) require that Participants
surrender their outstanding Options and SARs in exchange for a payment by the
Company, in cash or Stock, as determined by the Administrator, in an amount
equal to the amount by which the then Fair Market Value of the shares of
Stock subject to the Participant's unexercised Options and SARs exceeds
the Option Price of the Options or the base amount of SARs, as applicable, or
(v) after giving Participants an opportunity to exercise their outstanding
Options and SARs, terminate any or all unexercised Options and SARs at such
time as the Administrator deems appropriate. Such surrender, termination or
settlement shall take place as of the date of the Change of Control or
such other date as the Administrator may specify. The Administrator shall
have no obligation to take any of the foregoing actions, and, in the absence
of any such actions, outstanding Grants shall continue in effect according to
their terms (subject to any assumption pursuant to subsection (a)).

  



  

(c) _Administrator_. The Administrator making the determinations under
this Section 18 following a Change of Control must be comprised of the same
members as those constituting the Administrator immediately before the Change
of Control.

  



   19.| _Requirements  for Issuance of Shares_ 
---|--- 
  



  

No shares of Stock shall be issued or transferred in connection with any
Grant hereunder unless and until all legal requirements applicable to the
issuance of such Stock have been complied with to the satisfaction of the
Administrator. The Administrator shall have the right to condition any Grant
made to any Participant hereunder on such Participant's undertaking in writing
to comply with such restrictions on his or her subsequent disposition of such
shares of Stock as the Administrator shall deem necessary or advisable, and
certificates representing such shares may be legended to reflect any such
restrictions. Certificates representing shares of Stock issued or transferred
under the Plan will be subject to such stop-transfer orders and other
restrictions as may be required by applicable laws, regulations and
interpretations, including any requirement that a legend be placed thereon.

  



   20.| _Amendment  and Termination of the Plan_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Amendment_. The Board may amend or terminate the Plan at any time;
provided, however, that the Board shall not amend the Plan without approval
of the stockholders of the Company if such approval is required in order to
comply with the Code, applicable laws and stock exchange requirements, or as
required by Section 21(b) below. No amendment or termination of this Plan
shall, without the consent of the Participant, impair any rights or
obligations under any Grant previously made to the Participant, unless such
right has been reserved in the Plan or the Grant Instrument, or except as
provided in Section 21(b) below.

  



  

(b) _No Repricing Without Stockholder Approval_. Except in connection
with a corporate transaction involving the Company (including, without
limitation, any stock dividend, stock split, extraordinary cash dividend,
recapitalization, reorganization, merger, consolidation, split-up, spin-off,
combination, or exchange of shares), the terms of outstanding awards may not
be amended to reduce the exercise price of outstanding Options or SARs or
cancel outstanding Options or SARs in exchange for cash, other awards or
Options or SARs with an exercise price that is less than the exercise price
of the original Options or SARs without stockholder approval.

  



  

(c) _Stockholder Approval for "Qualified Performance-Based
Compensation_." If Stock Units, Performance Shares, Stock Awards, Dividend
Equivalents or Other Stock-Based Awards are granted as "qualified performance-
based compensation" under Section 14 above, the Plan must be reapproved by
the Company's stockholders no later than the first stockholders meeting that
occurs in the fifth year following the year in which the stockholders
previously approved the provisions of Section 14, if additional Grants are to
be made under Section 14 and if required by section 162(m) of the Code or the
regulations thereunder.

  



  

(d) _Termination of Plan_. The Plan shall terminate on the day
immediately preceding the tenth anniversary of its Effective Date, which is [
, 2028], unless the Plan is terminated earlier by the Board or is extended by
the Board with the approval of the stockholders. The termination of the Plan
shall not impair the power and authority of the Administrator with respect to
an outstanding Grant.

  



  

   

11

 



    



   21.| _Miscellaneous_ 
---|--- 
  



  

(a) _Grants in Connection with Corporate Transactions and Otherwise_.
Nothing contained in this Plan shall be construed to (i) limit the right of
the Administrator to make Grants under this Plan in connection with the
acquisition, by purchase, lease, merger, consolidation or otherwise, of the
business or assets of any corporation, firm or association, including Grants
to employees thereof who become Employees, or for other proper corporate
purposes, or (ii) limit the right of the Company to grant stock options or
make other awards outside of this Plan. Without limiting the foregoing, the
Administrator may make a Grant to an employee of another corporation who
becomes an Employee by reason of a corporate merger, consolidation,
acquisition of stock or property, reorganization or liquidation involving the
Company in substitution for a grant made by such corporation. The terms and
conditions of the substitute Grants may vary from the terms and conditions
required by the Plan and from those of the substituted stock incentives. The
Administrator shall prescribe the provisions of the substitute Grants.

  



  

(b) _Compliance with Law_.

  



   | (i)| The  Plan, the exercise of Options or SARs and the obligations
of the Company to issue or  transfer shares of Stock under Grants shall be
subject to all applicable laws and to  approvals by any governmental or
regulatory agency as may be required. With respect to  persons subject to
section 16 of the Exchange Act, it is the intent of the Company that  the
Plan and all transactions under the Plan comply with all applicable provisions
of  Rule 16b-3 or its successors under the Exchange Act. In addition, it is
the intent of  the Company that the Plan and applicable Grants comply with
the applicable provisions  of sections 162(m), 409A and 422 of the Code. To
the extent that any legal requirement  of section 16 of the Exchange Act or
sections 162(m), 409A or 422 of the Code as set  forth in the Plan ceases to
be required under section 16 of the Exchange Act or sections  162(m), 409A or
422 of the Code, that Plan provision shall cease to apply. The Administrator 
may revoke any Grant if it is contrary to law or modify a Grant to bring it
into compliance  with any valid and mandatory government regulation. The
Administrator may also adopt  rules regarding the withholding of taxes on
payments to Participants. The Administrator  may, in its sole discretion,
agree to limit its authority under this Section. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (ii)| The  Plan is intended to comply with the requirements of
section 409A of the Code, to the  extent applicable. Each Grant shall be
construed and administered such that the Grant  either (A) qualifies for an
exemption from the requirements of section 409A of the  Code or (B) satisfies
the requirements of section 409A of the Code. If a Grant is  subject to
section 409A of the Code, (I) distributions shall only be made in a manner 
and upon an event permitted under section 409A of the Code, (II) payments to
be made  upon a termination of employment shall only be made upon a
"separation from service"  under section 409A of the Code, (III) unless the
Grant specifies otherwise, each installment  payment shall be treated as a
separate payment for purposes of section 409A of the Code,  and (IV) in no
event shall a Participant, directly or indirectly, designate the calendar 
year in which a distribution is made except in accordance with section 409A of
the Code. 
---|---|--- 
  



   | (iii)| Any  Grant that is subject to section 409A of the Code and
that is to be distributed to a  Key Employee (as defined below) upon
separation from service shall be administered so  that any distribution with
respect to such Grant shall be postponed for six months following  the date
of the Participant's separation from service, if required by section 409A  of
the Code. If a distribution is delayed pursuant to section 409A of the Code,
the distribution  shall be paid within 15 days after the end of the six-month
period. If the Participant  dies during such six-month period, any postponed
amounts shall be paid within 90 days  of the Participant's death. The
determination of Key Employees, including the number  and identity of persons
considered Key Employees and the identification date, shall be  made by the
Administrator or its delegate in accordance with section 416(i) of the Code 
and the "specified employee" requirements of section 409A of the Code. 
---|---|--- 
  



   

12

 



    



  

(c) _Enforceability_. The Plan shall be binding upon and enforceable
against the Company and its successors and assigns.

  



  

(d) _Funding of the Plan; Limitation on Rights_. This Plan shall be
unfunded. Neither the Company nor any other Employer shall be required to
establish any special or separate fund or to make any other segregation of
assets to assure the payment of any Grants under this Plan. Nothing contained
in the Plan and no action taken pursuant hereto shall create or be construed
to create a fiduciary relationship between the Company or any other Employer
and any Participant or any other person. No Participant or any other person
shall under any circumstances acquire any property interest in any specific
assets of the Company or any other Employer. To the extent that any person
acquires a right to receive payment from the Company hereunder, such right
shall be no greater than the right of any unsecured general creditor of the
Company.

  



  

(e) _Rights of Participants_. Nothing in this Plan shall entitle any
Participant or other person to any claim or right to receive a Grant under
this Plan. Neither this Plan nor any action taken hereunder shall be construed
as giving any individual any rights to be retained by or in the employment or
service of the Employer.

  



  

(f) _No Fractional Shares_. No fractional shares of Stock shall be
issued or delivered pursuant to the Plan or any Grant. The Administrator
shall determine whether cash, other awards or other property shall be issued
or paid in lieu of such fractional shares or whether such fractional shares
or any rights thereto shall be forfeited or otherwise eliminated.

  



  

(g) _Clawback Policies_. All Grants under the Plan are subject to the
applicable provisions of the Company's clawback or recoupment policy approved
by the Board, if any, as such policy may be in effect from time to time.

  



  

(h) _Governing Law_. The validity, construction, interpretation and
effect of the Plan and Grant Instruments issued under the Plan shall
be governed and construed by and determined in accordance with the laws of
the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the conflict of laws
provisions thereof.
