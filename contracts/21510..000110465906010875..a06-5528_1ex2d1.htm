referred to as the " **Surviving Corporation**."

time, date and location as the parties hereto agree in writing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that if all the conditions set forth in Article VI shall not have
been satisfied or waived on such second business day, then the Closing shall
take place on the first business day on which all such conditions shall have
been satisfied or waived. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to
herein as the " **Closing Date**."

  



  

## 1.3 _Effect of the Merger_. At the Effective Time, the effect of the
Merger shall be as provided in this Agreement and the applicable provisions

subject thereto, at the Effective Time all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Merger Sub shall vest in the
Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company
and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.

  



  

1.4 _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws_. At the Effective Time, the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended
and restated to read the same as the Certificate of Incorporation of Merger
Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until thereafter
amended in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Certificate
of Incorporation; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that at the Effective Time,
Article I of the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation
shall be amended and restated in its entirety to read as follows: "The name
of the corporation is Excel Technology, Inc." and, to the extent necessary,
the Certificate of Incorporation shall be amended so as to comply with
Section 5.10(a). At the Effective Time, the Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation shall be amended and restated to read the same as the Bylaws of
Merger Sub, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, until
thereafter amended

  



        
   

  



  

in accordance with Delaware Law and as provided in such Bylaws; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that at the Effective Time, the Bylaws shall be amended, to the
extent necessary, so as to comply with Section 5.10(a).

  



  

1.5 _Directors and Officers_. The initial directors of the Surviving
Corporation shall be the directors of Merger Sub immediately prior to the
Effective Time, until their respective successors are duly elected or
appointed and qualified. The initial officers of the Surviving Corporation
shall be the officers of Merger Sub immediately prior to the Effective Time,
until their respective successors are duly appointed.

  



  

1.6 _Effect on Capital Stock_. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, at the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without
any action on the part of Parent, Merger Sub, the Company or the holders of
any shares of capital stock of the Company, the following shall occur:

  



  

### (a) _Company Common Stock_. Each share of the Common Stock, par value
$0.001 per share, of the Company (" **Company Common Stock** ") issued
and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any
shares of Company Common Stock to be canceled pursuant to Section 1.6(c)
and any Dissenting Shares, will be canceled and extinguished and
automatically converted (subject to Section 1.6(f)) into the right to receive
$30.00 in cash, without interest (as may be adjusted, the " **Per Share
Amount** " and the sum of the Per Share Amounts, the " **Merger
Consideration** "), upon surrender of the certificate representing such share
of Company Common Stock in the manner provided in Section 1.7 (or in the case
of a lost, stolen or destroyed certificate, upon delivery of an affidavit
(and bond, if required) in the manner provided in Section 1.9).

  

### 

  

### (b) _Repurchase Rights_. If any shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time are unvested or are
subject to a repurchase option, risk of forfeiture or other condition under
any applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other agreement with
the Company (" **Company** **Restricted Stock** "), then the portion of
the Merger Consideration payable in exchange for such shares of Company
Common Stock will also be unvested and subject to the same repurchase option,
risk of forfeiture or other condition. The Company shall take all action
that may be necessary to ensure that, from and after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation is entitled to exercise any such repurchase option or
other right set forth in any such restricted stock purchase agreement or
other agreement.  The portion of the Merger Consideration payable upon
conversion of the Company Restricted Stock shall be withheld and paid by the
Merger Sub to such holder in accordance with the vesting and other provisions
set forth in the applicable restricted stock purchase agreement or other
agreement.

  



        
   

  



  

### (c) _Cancellation of Treasury and Parent Owned Stock_.  Each share of
Company Common Stock held by the Company or Parent or any direct or indirect
wholly-owned Subsidiary of the Company or of Parent immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be canceled and extinguished without any conversion
thereof.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Capital Stock of Merger Sub_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.001, of Merger Sub (the " **Merger Sub Common Stock** ") issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall evidence ownership
of such shares of capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

  

### 

  

### (e) _Stock Options_. At the Effective Time, no outstanding Company
Options will be assumed by Parent, and unless otherwise exercised by the
holder thereof or purchased by the Company under Section 5.17, any
outstanding Company Options shall terminate on the Effective Time
in accordance with their terms.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Adjustments to Per Share Amount_. The Per Share Amount shall be
adjusted to reflect fully the appropriate effect of any stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend (including any dividend or distribution of
securities convertible into Company Common Stock), reorganization,
recapitalization, reclassification or other like change with respect to
Company Common Stock having a record date on or after the date hereof and
prior to the Effective Time.

  

### 

  

1.7 _Surrender of Certificates_.

  



  

### (a) _Payment Agent_. Parent shall select an institution to act as the
payment agent (the " **Payment Agent** ") for the Merger.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Parent to Provide Cash_. On or before the Effective Time, Parent
shall make available to the Payment Agent for exchange in accordance with
this Article I, the Merger Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section
1.6(a) in exchange for the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock. Any
cash deposited with the Payment Agent shall hereinafter be referred to as the
" **Exchange Fund**."

  



  

### (c) _Exchange Procedures_. As promptly as reasonably practicable after
the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Payment Agent to mail to each
holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a certificate or certificates
(the " **Certificates** ") which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented outstanding shares of Company Common Stock whose shares were
converted into the right to receive a portion of the Merger Consideration
pursuant to Section 1.6(a): (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to
the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Payment Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent may reasonably specify) and

  



        
   

  



  

### (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates
in exchange for a portion of the Merger Consideration.  Upon surrender of
Certificates for cancellation to the Payment Agent or to such other agent or
agents as may be appointed by Parent, together with such letter of
transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto and such other documents as may reasonably be
required by the Payment Agent, the holder of record of such Certificates
shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the portion of the
Merger Consideration (after taking into account all Certificates surrendered
by such holder of record) to which such holder is entitled pursuant to
Section 1.6(a), and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from
and after the Effective Time, for all corporate purposes, to evidence the
ownership of the portion of the Merger Consideration for which such shares of
Company Common Stock shall have been so converted.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Required Withholding_. Each of the Payment Agent and the Surviving
Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from any consideration
payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder or
former holder of Company Common Stock such amounts as may be required to be
deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax law or under any other applicable Legal
Requirement. To the extent such amounts are so deducted or withheld, the
amount of such consideration shall be treated for all purposes under this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person to whom such consideration would
otherwise have been paid.

  

### 

  

### (e) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Section 1.7, neither the Payment Agent, the Surviving Corporation nor any
party hereto shall be liable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
for any amount paid to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar law.

  

### 

  

### (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Payment Agent shall invest the
cash included in the Exchange Fund as directed by Parent on a daily basis;
_provided_ that no such investment or loss thereon shall affect the amounts
payable to Company stockholders pursuant to this Article I. Any interest and
other income resulting from such investment shall become a part of the
Exchange Fund, and any amounts in excess of the amounts payable to Company
stockholders pursuant to this Article I shall promptly be paid to Parent.

  

### 

  

### (g) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange Fund
which remains undistributed to the holders of Certificates nine (9)
months after the Effective Time shall, at the request of Parent or the
Surviving Corporation, be delivered to the Surviving Corporation or Parent or
otherwise according to the instruction of the Surviving Corporation or
Parent, and any holders of the Certificates who have not surrendered such
Certificates in compliance with this

  



        
   

  



  

### Section 1.7 shall after such delivery to Surviving Corporation look only
to Parent or the Surviving Corporation for the portion of the Merger
Consideration deliverable pursuant to Section 1.6(a) with respect to the
shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented thereby.  If any
Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to two (2) years after the
Effective Time (or immediately prior to such time as such amounts would
otherwise escheat to or become property of any Governmental Entity), any such
portion of the Exchange Fund remaining unclaimed by holders of shares
of Company Common Stock immediately prior to such time shall, to the
extent permitted by law, become the property of Parent free and clear of any
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

### 

  

1.8 _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock_. The
Merger Consideration paid upon the surrender for exchange of shares of
Company Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof shall be deemed to
have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to such shares
of Company Common Stock, and there shall be no further registration of
transfers on the records of the Surviving Corporation of shares of Company
Common Stock which were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving
Corporation for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article I.

  



  

1.9 _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event any Certificates
shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Payment Agent shall deliver
in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificates, upon the making
of an affidavit of that fact by the holder thereof, the portion of the
Merger Consideration to which the holder thereof would have been entitled
upon the delivery of such Certificate; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent
or the Payment Agent may, in their sole discretion and as a condition
precedent to the issuance thereof, require the owner of such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificates to deliver a bond in such sum as it may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against Parent, the
Company or the Payment Agent with respect to the Certificates alleged to have
been lost, stolen or destroyed.

  



  

1.10 _Dissenting Shares_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock which are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by stockholders
properly exercising appraisal rights (the " **Dissenting Shares** ")
available under Section 262 (" **Section 262**") of Delaware Law shall not
be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the portion of
the Merger Consideration for which such shares of Company Common Stock
would otherwise have been entitled, unless and until such holders shall have
failed to perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost their rights
to appraisal under Section 262. If any such holder shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right to appraisal,
such holders shares of Company Common Stock shall thereupon be

  



        
   

  



  

converted into and be exchangeable only for the right to receive, as of the
Effective Time, the portion of the Merger Consideration to which such holder
would have been entitled pursuant to this Article I for such shares of
Company Common Stock. The Company shall give Parent and Merger Sub (a)
prompt notice of any written demands for appraisal of any shares of Company
Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments
served pursuant to Delaware Law and received by the Company relating to
rights to be paid the "fair value" of Dissenting Shares, as provided in
Section 262 and (b) the opportunity to participate in, and after the Closing,
direct all negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for appraisal
under Section 262.  The Company shall not, except with the prior written
consent of Parent, voluntarily make or agree to make any payment with respect
to any demands for appraisals, or offer to settle or settle any such demands
or approve any withdrawals of any such demands.

  



  

1.11 _Further Action_. At and after the Effective Time, the officers and
directors of Parent and the Surviving Corporation will be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company and Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in
the name and on behalf of Company and Merger Sub, any other actions and
things to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets acquired or to be acquired by the Surviving
Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

forms, statements and other documents (including those that the Company may
file subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as the "
**Company**   **SEC Reports**." As of their respective dates, the Company

material respects with the

  



        
   

  



  

### requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "
**Securities Act** "), or the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and the rules
and regulations of the SEC thereunder applicable to such Company SEC Reports
and (ii) did not at the time they were filed (or if amended or superseded by
a filing prior to the date of this Agreement then on the date of such filing)
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. None of the Companys Subsidiaries is required to file
any forms, reports or other documents with the SEC. The Company has previously
furnished to Parent a complete and correct copy of any amendments or
modifications, which have not yet been filed with the SEC but which are
required to be filed, to agreements, documents or other instruments which
previously had been filed by Company with the SEC pursuant to the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act.

complied as to form in all material respects with the published rules
and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto, (ii) was prepared
in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles ("
**GAAP** ") applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved

interim financial statements, as may be permitted by the SEC on Form 10-Q,
8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of the Company operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated. The Company does not intend to correct or restate, nor is there
any basis for any correction or restatement of, any aspect of the Company
Financials. The balance sheet of the Company contained in the Company SEC
Reports as of September 30, 2005 is hereinafter referred to as the "
**Company Balance Sheet**." Except as disclosed in the Company Financials,
since the date of the Company Balance Sheet, neither the Company nor any of
its Subsidiaries has any liabilities (absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise) of a nature required to be disclosed on a consolidated balance
sheet or in the related notes to the consolidated financial statement
prepared in accordance with GAAP which are, individually or in the aggregate,
material to the business, results of operations or financial condition of the
Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

  

### 

  

### (c) _Disclosure Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15
under the Exchange Act).  Such disclosure controls and procedures are
designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company,

executive officer and its principal financial officer by others within those
entities. To the knowledge of the Company,

  



        
   

  



  

### based on its evaluation of the Companys disclosure controls and
procedures as of the end of the Companys most recently completed fiscal
quarter, such disclosure controls and procedures are currently effective in

financial officer to material information required to be included in the
Companys periodic and current reports required under the Exchange Act.

  

### 

  

### (d) _Internal Control Over Financial Reporting_.  The Company has
established and maintains a system of internal control over financial
reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act). Based on its
evaluation of its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of
the Companys most recently completed fiscal quarter, such internal control
over financial reporting is sufficient to provide reasonable assurance
regarding the reliability of the Companys financial reporting and the
preparation of the Companys financial statements for external purposes in
accordance with GAAP. Based on its most recent evaluation of internal
control over financial reporting and, to the knowledge of the Company, since
such evaluation, there are not any significant deficiencies or material
weaknesses known to the Company in the design or operation of internal
control over financial reporting which could reasonably be expected to
adversely affect in a material respect the Companys ability to record,
process, summarize and report financial information or any material fraud
known to the Company that involves management or other employees who have a
significant role in internal control over financial reporting. The Company has
furnished to Parent disclosures regarding material weaknesses, significant

the Company Stockholder Approval. Parent shall provide promptly to the
Company such information concerning Parent as, in the reasonable judgment of
Parent, the Company or their respective counsel, may be required or
appropriate for inclusion in the Proxy Statement, or in any amendments or
supplements thereto. At the earliest practicable time following the later of
(i) receipt and resolution of SEC comments thereon, or (ii) the expiration of
the 10-day waiting period provided in Rule 14a-6(a) promulgated under
the Exchange Act, the Company shall file definitive proxy materials with the

Company will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause all documents that
it is responsible for filing with the SEC or other regulatory authorities in
connection with the Merger (or as required or appropriate to facilitate the
Merger) to comply in all material respects with all applicable Legal
Requirements.  Prior to filing the preliminary proxy materials, definitive
proxy materials or any other filing with the SEC, any other Governmental
Entity or other regulatory authorities, the Company shall provide Parent
(which term shall in all instances in this Section 5.1 also include Parents
counsel) with reasonable opportunity to review and comment on each such
filing in advance and the Company shall in good faith consider including in
such filings all comments reasonably proposed by Parent.  The Company will
notify Parent promptly of the receipt of any comments from the SEC or its
staff (or of notice of the SECs intent to review the Proxy Statement) and of
any request by the SEC or its staff or any other government or regulatory
officials for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement or any other
filing or for additional/supplemental information, and will supply Parent
with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, or its staff or any
other government or regulatory officials, on the other hand, with respect to
the Proxy Statement or any such other filing.  The Company and its outside
counsel shall permit Parent to participate in all communications with the SEC
and its staff (including all meetings and telephone conferences) relating to

contrary contained in this Agreement, the Company may adjourn or postpone
the Stockholders Meeting to the extent necessary to ensure that any
necessary supplement or amendment to the Proxy Statement is provided to its
stockholders in advance of a vote on the Merger and this Agreement or if, as
of the time for which the Stockholders Meeting is originally scheduled (as
set forth in the Proxy Statement), there are insufficient shares of Company

#### (iv) The Board of Directors of the Company has concluded in good faith,

obligations to the stockholders of the Company under applicable law;

#### (v) The Company shall not have breached any of the provisions set forth
in Section 5.2 or this Section 5.3;

Section 5.3(d)(vi), the Board of Directors of the Company does not conclude
in good faith (after consultation with its outside legal counsel and its

required to expend in excess of 200% of the annual premium currently paid by
the Company for such coverage and which is set forth on Schedule 5.10 of the
Company Disclosure Letter (and to the extent annual premium would exceed 200%
of the annual premium currently paid by the Company for such coverage,
the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall use all reasonable efforts to cause

exercise price per share for each share of Company Common Stock subject to
such Company Options, multiplied by the number of shares issuable upon
exercise in full of such Company Options, such that there shall be no
outstanding Company Options as of the effectiveness of the Merger. The Company
shall make all appropriate withholding as may be required in accordance with
applicable laws and regulations for such purchase.

  



  

5.18 _Company Fairness Opinion_. As soon as practicable following the date
hereof, the Company shall deliver to Parent and its legal counsel a copy of

account in determining whether there has been or is reasonably likely to be a
Material Adverse Effect on any Person), (D) any failure by such Person to
meet revenue or earnings projections (it being understood that the facts
or circumstances giving rise to or contributing to such failure may be taken
into account in determining whether there has been or is reasonably likely to
be a Material Adverse Effect on any Person), (E) any Effect that results
from changes affecting any of the industries in which such Person operates
generally or the United States economy generally (which changes in each case
do not disproportionately affect such Person in any material respect), or (F)
any Effect that results from changes affecting general worldwide economic
or capital market conditions (which changes in each case do not
disproportionately affect such Person in any material respect).

  

### 

  

### (d) For purposes of this Agreement, the term " **Person** " shall mean
any individual, corporation (including any non-profit corporation), general
partnership, limited partnership, limited liability partnership,
joint venture, estate, trust, company (including any limited liability
company or joint stock company), firm or other enterprise, association,

8.4 _Counterparts_.  This Agreement may be executed in two or more
counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and the same agreement and
shall become effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each
of the parties and delivered to the other party, it being understood that all
parties need not sign the same counterpart.

  



  

8.5 _Entire Agreement; Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement and
the documents and instruments and other agreements among the parties hereto
as contemplated by or referred to herein, including the Company Disclosure
Letter and the Parent Disclosure Letter, (i) constitute the entire
agreement among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersede all prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral,
among the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, it being
understood that the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect until the Closing and shall survive any termination of this
Agreement and (ii) are not intended, whether express or implied, to confer
upon any other Person any legal or equitable rights, benefits or remedies
hereunder, except as specifically provided, following the Effective Time, in
Section 5.10.

  



  

8.6 _Severability_.  In the event that any provision of this Agreement or the
application thereof, becomes or is declared by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of this
Agreement will continue in full force and effect and the application of such
provision to other Persons or circumstances will be interpreted so as
reasonably to effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties
further agree to replace such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that will achieve, to the
greatest extent possible, the economic, business and other purposes of such
void or unenforceable provision.

  



  

8.7 _Other Remedies; Specific Performance_.

  



  

### (a) _Other Remedies_. Except as otherwise provided herein, any and all
remedies herein expressly conferred upon a party will be deemed cumulative
with and not exclusive of any other remedy conferred hereby, or by law or
equity upon such party, and the exercise by a party of any one remedy will
not preclude the exercise of any other remedy. The parties hereto agree that
irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached.

  

### 

  

### (b) _Specific Performance_. It is accordingly agreed that the parties
shall be entitled to seek an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof in
any court of the United States or any state having jurisdiction, this being
in addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in
equity, and each party hereby waives any requirement to post a bond in
connection with any such proceeding.

  



        
   

  



  

8.8 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware, regardless of the laws
that might otherwise govern under applicable principles of conflicts of law
thereof.

  



  

8.9 _Rules of Construction_. The parties hereto agree that they have
been represented by counsel during the negotiation and execution of this
Agreement and, therefore, waive the application of any law, regulation,
holding or rule of construction providing that ambiguities in an agreement or
other document will be construed against the party drafting such agreement or
document.

  



  

8.10 _Assignment_.  No party may assign either this Agreement or any of its
rights, interests, or obligations hereunder without the prior written
approval of the other parties. Any purported assignment in violation of this
Section 8.10 shall be void. Subject to the preceding sentence, this Agreement
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

  



  

8.11 _Waiver of Jury Trial_. EACH OF PARENT, MERGER SUB AND THE COMPANY
HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY ACTION,
PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR OTHERWISE)
ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE ACTIONS OF PARENT, MERGER
SUB OR THE COMPANY IN THE NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND
ENFORCEMENT HEREOF.
