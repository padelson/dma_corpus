AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

 

This AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, dated as of July 10, 2011 (this
"Agreement"), is among LONZA GROUP LTD., a company organized under the laws of
Switzerland ("Parent"), LG ACQUISITION CORP., a Virginia corporation and an
indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent ("Merger Sub"), and ARCH CHEMICALS,
INC., a Virginia corporation (the "Company"). Certain terms used in this
Agreement are used as defined in Section 9.11.

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Directors of Parent, the Company and Merger
Sub have approved the acquisition of the Company by Parent on the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, including the plan of
merger in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "Plan of Merger");

  

  

WHEREAS, it is proposed that pursuant to this Agreement, and subject to the
terms and conditions set forth herein, Parent will cause Merger Sub to make a
tender offer (as it may be amended from time to time as permitted by this
Agreement, the "Offer") to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common
stock, par value $1.00 per share, of the Company (the "Company Common Stock")
at a price per share of $47.20, net to the seller in cash (such amount, or any
other amount per share of Company Common Stock paid pursuant to the Offer in
accordance with this Agreement, the "Offer Price"), on the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

  

  

WHEREAS, following the consummation of the Offer, Merger Sub will merge (the
"Merger") with and into the Company in accordance with the Virginia Stock
Corporation Act of the Commonwealth of Virginia (the "VSCA") and the Plan of
Merger, with the Company surviving the merger as an indirect wholly owned
subsidiary of Parent;

  

  

WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of the Company, by a unanimous vote of the
directors present, has (i) determined that this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, are advisable and in
the best interest of the Company and its shareholders, (ii) adopted this
Agreement and the Plan of Merger and approved the transactions contemplated
hereby, including the Offer and the Merger, in accordance with the
requirements of the VSCA and (iii) subject to the terms and conditions set
forth herein, resolved to recommend acceptance of the Offer and, if necessary,
approval of this Agreement and the Plan of Merger by the Company's
shareholders; and

  

  

WHEREAS, the respective Boards of Parent and Merger Sub have adopted, approved
and declared advisable this Agreement providing for the Offer and the Merger
in accordance with the VSCA and the Plan of Merger, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants
and agreements contained in this Agreement, and intending to be legally bound
hereby, Parent, Merger Sub and the Company hereby agree as follows:

  

  

ARTICLE I 
 

  

  

The Offer

  

  

SECTION 1.1. The Offer.

  

  

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable, and in any event within five (5)
Business Days of the date of this Agreement, Merger Sub shall, and Parent
shall cause Merger Sub to, commence (within the meaning of Rule 14d-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the "Exchange Act")) an offer to purchase
all outstanding shares of Company Common Stock at the Offer Price. The
obligations of Merger Sub, and of Parent to cause Merger Sub, to accept for
payment and pay for any shares of Company Common Stock tendered pursuant to
the Offer shall be subject only to the satisfaction or waiver by Merger Sub of
the conditions set forth in Annex A hereto (the "Offer Conditions"). Merger
Sub expressly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to waive any Offer
Condition in whole or in part, at any time or from time to time, or to modify
the terms or conditions of the Offer, except that, without the written consent
of the Company, Merger Sub shall not, and Parent shall not permit Merger Sub
to, (i) reduce the Offer Price, (ii) change the form of consideration payable
in the Offer, (iii) reduce the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to the Offer, (iv) waive or change the Minimum Condition or the
Termination Condition (each as defined in Annex A), (v) add to the Offer
Conditions, (vi) terminate, or extend or otherwise amend or modify the
expiration date of the Offer except as required or permitted by Section 1.1(b)
or (vii) amend, modify or supplement any Offer Condition or any term of the
Offer set forth in this Agreement in a manner adverse to the holders of
Company Common Stock. The Company agrees that no Company Common Stock held by
the Company, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries will be
tendered in the Offer; provided that the Company shall be permitted to tender
Company Common Stock held or beneficially owned by the Company pursuant to or
in respect of a Company Plan or a trust that relates to obligations pursuant
to a Company Plan.

  

  

(b) The Offer shall expire on the date that is twenty (20) Business Days after
the commencement of the Offer (determined using Rule 14d-1(g)(3) of the
Exchange Act); provided, however, that, subject to the provisions of Article
VIII, if at any scheduled expiration date of the Offer, the Offer Conditions
shall not have been satisfied or waived, Merger Sub shall, and Parent shall
cause Merger Sub to, extend the Offer for one or more consecutive increments,
each lasting until the earliest to occur of (i) a date that is no more than
five (5) Business Days after such previously scheduled expiration date (or
such other period of time to which the Company may consent in writing) or (ii)
nine (9) months from the date hereof (the "Walk-Away Date"); provided further,
that Merger Sub may (and shall where fewer than 90% of the total shares of
Company Common Stock then outstanding have been accepted for payment in the
Offer or are to be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the Top-Up Option
immediately following the Acceptance Time) provide a subsequent offering
period (a "Subsequent Offering Period") after the expiration of the Offer, in
accordance with Rule 14d-11 under the Exchange Act. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, without the consent of the Company, Merger Sub shall have the right
to extend the Offer for any period required by any rule, regulation,
interpretation or position of the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission (the "SEC") or its staff applicable to the Offer.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Subject to the terms of the Offer and this Agreement and the satisfaction,
or waiver by Merger Sub, of all of the Offer Conditions, Merger Sub shall, and
Parent shall cause Merger Sub to, (i) accept for payment all shares of Company
Common Stock validly tendered and not validly withdrawn pursuant to the Offer
promptly after the expiration date thereof (as the same may be extended or
required to be extended, the "Expiration Date") and pay for such shares as
soon as practicable (and, in any event, no more than three (3) Business Days)
after the Expiration Date or (ii) in the case of any shares of Company Common
Stock tendered during any Subsequent Offering Period, accept for payment and
pay for all such shares of Company Common Stock validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn as soon as practicable (and, in any event, no more than
three (3) Business Days) following the valid tender thereof. The Offer may not
be terminated prior to its expiration date (as such expiration date may be
extended and re-extended in accordance with Section 1.1(b)), unless this
Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with Section 8.1. Nothing
contained in this Section 1.1(c) shall affect any termination rights set forth
in Section 8.1.

  

  

SECTION 1.2. Offer Documents. As promptly as reasonably practicable on the
date of commencement of the Offer, Parent and Merger Sub shall (a) file a
Schedule TO (together with all amendments and supplements thereto, the
"Schedule TO") with respect to the Offer, which shall contain or shall
incorporate by reference an offer to purchase (the "Offer to Purchase") and
forms of the related letter of transmittal and form of summary advertisement
(the Schedule TO, the Offer to Purchase and such other documents, together
with all amendments, supplements and exhibits thereto, the "Offer Documents")
and (b) cause the Offer Documents to be disseminated to the Company's
shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by applicable federal
securities Laws. The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (but
in no event later than three (3) Business Days after the date of this
Agreement) supply Parent and Merger Sub in writing, for inclusion in the Offer
Documents, all information concerning the Company required under the Exchange
Act to be included in the Offer Documents. Each of Parent, Merger Sub and the
Company agrees promptly to correct any information provided by them for use in
the Offer Documents if and to the extent that such information shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and each of Parent and
Merger Sub further agrees to take all steps necessary to cause the Offer
Documents as so corrected to be filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to
the Company's shareholders, in each case as and to the extent required by
applicable federal securities Laws. The Company and its counsel shall be given
a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on the Offer Documents and any
amendments thereto (including the proposed final version thereof) prior to the
filing thereof with the SEC and Parent and Merger Sub shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel. In addition, Parent and Merger Sub
agree to provide the Company and its counsel any comments, whether written or
oral, that Parent or Merger Sub may receive from the SEC or its staff with
respect to the Offer Documents promptly after the receipt of such comments,
and any written or oral responses thereto. The Company and its counsel shall
be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon such responses
(including the proposed final version thereof) and Parent shall give due
consideration to all reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested
thereto by the Company and its counsel.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

 

 

  

  

  

 

 

SECTION 1.3. Offer Funds. Parent shall provide or cause to be provided to
Merger Sub on a timely basis the funds necessary to purchase any shares of
Company Common Stock that Merger Sub becomes obligated to purchase pursuant to
the Offer.

  

  

SECTION 1.4. Company Actions.

  

  

(a) Subject to Section 6.3, the Company hereby consents to the Offer and to
the inclusion in the Offer Documents of a description of the recommendation of
the Company Board described in Section 4.3(b).

  

  

(b) Subject to Section 6.3, on the date of filing by Parent and Merger Sub of
the Offer Documents, the Company shall file with the SEC and mail to the
Company's shareholders a Solicitation/Recommendation Statement on Schedule
14D-9 (such Schedule 14D-9, together with any amendments or supplements
thereto, the "Schedule 14D-9") describing the recommendation of the Company
Board described in Section 4.3(b), and shall cause the Schedule 14D-9 to be
disseminated to the Company's shareholders (concurrently with and in the same
mailing envelope as the Offer Documents) as required by Rule 14d-9 under the
Exchange Act. Parent and Merger Sub shall furnish to the Company all
information concerning Parent and Merger Sub required by the Exchange Act to
be set forth in the Schedule 14D-9. Each of the Company, Parent and Merger Sub
agrees to promptly correct any information provided by it for use in the
Schedule 14D-9 if and to the extent that such information shall have become
false or misleading in any material respect, and the Company further agrees to
take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule 14D-9 as so corrected to be
filed with the SEC and to be disseminated to the Company's shareholders, in
each case, as and to the extent required by applicable federal securities
Laws. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a reasonable
opportunity to review and comment on the Schedule 14D-9 and any amendments
thereto (including the proposed final version thereof) prior to the filing
thereof with the SEC and the Company shall give due consideration to all
reasonable additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger
Sub and their counsel. In addition, the Company agrees to provide Parent,
Merger Sub and their counsel any comments, whether written or oral, that the
Company or its counsel may receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to
the Schedule 14D-9 promptly after the receipt of such comments, and any
written responses thereto, and to promptly inform them of any oral comments or
other communications. Parent, Merger Sub and their counsel shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to review and comment upon any written responses
(including the proposed final version thereof) and to participate in any oral
responses, and the Company shall give due consideration to all reasonable
additions, deletions or changes suggested thereto by Parent, Merger Sub and
their counsel.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

5  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) In connection with the Offer, the Company shall cause its transfer agent
promptly, and in any event within five (5) Business Days of the date of this
Agreement, to furnish Parent and Merger Sub with mailing labels, security
position listings, any non-objecting beneficial owner lists and any available
listings or computer files containing the names and addresses of the record
holders of shares of Company Common Stock as of the most recent practicable
date and shall furnish Parent and Merger Sub with such additional available
information (including periodic updates of such information) and such other
assistance as Parent, Merger Sub or their agents may reasonably request in
communicating the Offer to the record and beneficial holders of shares of
Company Common Stock. Subject to the requirements of applicable Law, and
except for such steps as are (i) necessary to disseminate the Offer Documents
and any other documents necessary to consummate the Transactions or (ii)
desirable in connection with making solicitations and recommendations to the
holders of Company Common Stock for purposes of causing the Minimum Condition
to be satisfied, Parent and Merger Sub shall keep confidential and not
disclose the information contained in any such labels, listings, files and
information, in each case, as required by the confidentiality agreement dated
May 2, 2011 between the Company and Parent as it may be amended from time to
time (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), shall use such information only in
connection with the Offer and the Merger and, if this Agreement shall be
terminated, shall, upon request, return to the Company all copies of such
labels, listings, files and information.

  

  

(d) Prior to the Expiration Date, the Company (acting through the Compensation
Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the "Compensation Committee"))
shall take all such actions as may be required to approve or ratify, as an
"employment compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangement"
within the meaning of Rule 14d-10(d)(2) under the Exchange Act, any and all
employment, compensation, severance or other employee benefit arrangements
that have been, or after the date of this Agreement will be, entered into by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with current, former or future
directors, officers or employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in
each case, under which any such Person could become entitled to (i) any
additional compensation, enhanced severance or other benefits or any
acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any compensation, severance
or other benefits or any funding of any compensation or benefits by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, in each case as a result of the
Transactions (alone or in combination with any other event), or (ii) any other
compensation or benefits from the Company or any of its Subsidiaries related
to or contingent upon or the value of which would be calculated on the basis
of the Offer, the Merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement (alone or in combination with any other event).

1.5(c), promptly upon the acceptance for payment by Merger Sub of shares of

of shares of Company Common Stock as shall satisfy the Minimum Condition (the
time of such acceptance, the "Acceptance Time"), and from time to time
thereafter, Parent shall be entitled to designate such number of directors,
rounded up to the next whole number, to the Company Board as is equal to the
product of the total number of directors on the Company Board (determined
after giving effect to the directors elected pursuant to this sentence)
multiplied by the percentage of the total number of outstanding shares of
Company Common Stock at such time represented by the aggregate number of
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries at such time (including shares of Company Common
Stock so accepted for payment); provided, however, that Parent shall be
entitled to designate at least a majority of the directors on the Company
Board as long as Parent and its Affiliates beneficially own a majority of the
shares of Company Common Stock. In furtherance thereof and subject to
applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the Effective
Time, the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock Exchange), the
Company shall, upon request of Parent, promptly take all actions necessary to
cause Parent's designees to be so elected or appointed, including increasing
the size of its Board of Directors (subject to the Company Charter Documents)
and/or obtaining the resignations of one or more incumbent directors and/or
filling any vacancies so created with Parent's designees. At such time and
subject to applicable Law (including, to the extent applicable prior to the
Effective Time, the continued listing requirements of the New York Stock
Exchange), the Company shall, upon request of Parent, also promptly take all
actions necessary to cause individuals designated by Parent to constitute at
least the same percentage (rounded up to the next whole number) as is on the
Company Board of (i) each committee of the Company Board, (ii) each board of
directors (or similar body) of each Subsidiary of the Company and (iii) each
committee (or similar body) of each such board. Prior to the Acceptance Time,
the Company shall obtain and deliver to Parent and Merger Sub true and correct
copies of duly executed, irrevocable resignation letters from such members of
the Company Board necessary to allow the Company to comply with this Section
1.5, which resignation letters (x) shall be conditioned upon the occurrence of
the Acceptance Time, (y) shall have been accepted by the Company Board and (z)
shall remain in full force and effect at all times prior to the Effective
Time; provided that, for the avoidance of doubt, any failure by the Company to
obtain and deliver to Parent, or by the Company Board to accept, such duly
executed, irrevocable resignation letters as required by this Section 1.5(a)
shall constitute, for purposes of clause (c)(ii)(B) of Annex A, a material
failure by the Company to perform and comply with an obligation, agreement or
covenant required by this Agreement to be performed or complied with by the
Company.

  

  

(b) The Company's obligations to appoint Parent's designees to the Company
Board shall be subject to Section 14(f) of the Exchange Act and Rule 14f-1
thereunder. The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable take all
actions required pursuant to Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1 in order to fulfill
its obligations under this Section 1.5, including mailing to shareholders
together with the Schedule 14D-9 the information required under Section 14(f)
and Rule 14f-1 as is necessary to enable Parent's designees to be elected or
appointed to the Company Board (provided that Parent and Merger Sub shall have
provided to the Company on a timely basis any information with respect to
itself and its officers, directors and Affiliates to the extent required by
Section 14(f) and Rule 14f-1).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

7  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) In the event that Parent's designees are elected or appointed to the
Company Board pursuant to this Section 1.5, then, until the Effective Time,
the Company shall cause the Company Board to maintain at least two directors
who are members of the Company Board on the date of this Agreement and who are
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act (the
"Independent Directors"); provided, however, that if the number of Independent
Directors is reduced below two for any reason, the remaining Independent
Director shall be entitled to nominate an individual who qualifies as an
independent director for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act to fill
such vacancy who shall be deemed to be an Independent Director for purposes of
this Agreement or, if no Independent Directors then remain, the other
directors shall designate two individuals to fill such vacancies who are
independent for purposes of Rule 10A-3 under the Exchange Act, and such
individuals shall be deemed to be Independent Directors for purposes of this
Agreement. The Company shall promptly take all action as may be necessary to
comply with its obligations under this Section 1.5(c). Notwithstanding
anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after the time, if any,
that Parent's designees pursuant to this Section 1.5 constitute a majority of
the Company Board and prior to the Effective Time, subject to the terms
hereof, (1) any amendment or termination of this Agreement by the Company, (2)
any extension by the Company of the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of Parent or Merger Sub hereunder, (3) any exercise
or waiver of any of the Company's rights or remedies hereunder, (4) any
amendment to the Company Charter Documents or (5) except for the Transactions
in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, any transaction between the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and Parent or any of its
Affiliates (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), on the other, will
require the concurrence of each of the Independent Directors (the "Independent
Director Approval"). It is understood that the Independent Directors will be
entitled to retain their own separate counsel.

  

  

SECTION 1.6. The Top-Up Option.

  

  

(a) The Company hereby grants to Merger Sub an irrevocable option (the "Top-Up
Option") to purchase that number of shares of Company Common Stock (the "Top-
Up Shares") equal to the lowest number of shares of Company Common Stock that,
when added to the number of shares of Company Common Stock held by Parent and
Merger Sub at the time of such exercise, shall constitute one share more than
90% of the total shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding (determined
on a fully diluted basis and assuming the issuance of the Top-Up Shares), at a
price per share equal to the Offer Price.

  

  

(b) The Top-Up Option shall be exercisable once in whole and not in part, (x)
following the expiration of the Offer or any Subsequent Offering Period and
(y) prior to the fifth Business Day after the applicable expiration date of
the Offer or any Subsequent Offering Period; provided, however, that the
obligation of the Company to deliver the Top-Up Shares is subject to the
conditions that (i) no Restraint that has the effect of prohibiting the
exercise of the Top-Up Option or preventing the issuance and delivery of the
Top-Up Shares shall be in effect; (ii) the Top-Up Option shall not be
exercisable for a number of shares of Company Common Stock in excess of the
number of authorized but unissued shares of Company Common Stock; and (iii)
Merger Sub has accepted for payment and paid for all shares of Company Common
Stock validly tendered in the Offer and any Subsequent Offering Period and not
withdrawn; provided further that the Top-Up Option shall terminate upon the
earlier to occur of (i) the Effective Time and (ii) the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with its terms. The parties shall cooperate to ensure
that the issuance of the Top-Up Shares is accomplished consistent with
applicable Law, including compliance with an applicable exemption from
registration of the Top-Up Shares under the Securities Act. Parent and Merger
Sub acknowledge that the Top-Up Shares that Merger Sub may acquire upon
exercise of the Top-Up Option will not be registered under the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, the "Securities Act"), and will be issued in reliance upon an
applicable exemption from registration under the Securities Act. Each of
Parent and Merger Sub hereby represents and warrants to the Company that
Merger Sub will be, upon the purchase of the Top-Up Shares, an "accredited
investor", as defined in Rule 501 of Regulation D under the Securities Act.
Merger Sub agrees that the Top-Up Option and the Top-Up Shares to be acquired
upon exercise of the Top-Up Option are being and will be acquired by Merger
Sub for the purpose of investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, any distribution thereof (within the meaning of the
Securities Act).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

8  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) In the event Merger Sub wishes to exercise the Top-Up Option, Merger Sub
shall notify the Company in writing, and shall set forth in such notice (i)
the number of shares of Company Common Stock that will be owned by Parent and
Merger Sub immediately preceding the purchase of the Top-Up Shares and (ii)
the place and time for the closing of the purchase of the Top-Up Shares (the
"Top-Up Closing"). The Company shall, as soon as practicable following receipt
of such notice, notify Parent and Merger Sub in writing of the number of
shares of Company Common Stock then outstanding and the number of Top-Up
Shares. At the Top-Up Closing, Merger Sub shall pay the Company the aggregate
price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares and the Company shall cause to
be issued to Merger Sub a certificate representing the Top-Up Shares, which
certificate may include any legends required by applicable securities Laws.
The aggregate price required to be paid for the Top-Up Shares or any portion
thereof may be paid by Merger Sub either in cash or by executing and
delivering to the Company a promissory note (the "Promissory Note") having a
principal amount equal to the aggregate cash purchase price for the Top-Up
Shares. Any such promissory note (v) shall be full recourse against Parent and
Merger Sub, (w) shall bear interest at the rate of interest per annum equal to
the prime lending rate prevailing from time to time during such period as
published in The Wall Street Journal, (x) shall mature on the first
anniversary of the date of execution and delivery of such promissory note, (y)
may be prepaid in whole or in part without premium or penalty and (z) shall
have no other material terms.

SECTION 2.1. The Merger. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set

SECTION 2.2. Closing. The closing of the Merger (the "Closing") shall take
place at 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on a date to be specified by the
parties (the "Closing Date"), which date shall be no later than the second

VSCA, with the State Corporation Commission of the Commonwealth of Virginia
(the "SCC") and (b) duly make all other filings and recordings required by the
VSCA in order to effectuate the Merger. The Merger shall become effective upon
the issuance of a certificate of merger by the SCC or at such later time as is
agreed to by the parties hereto and specified in the Articles of Merger (the

"Effective Time").

  

  

SECTION 2.4. Effects of the Merger. The Merger shall have the effects set
forth in this Agreement and Section 13.1-721 of the VSCA. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all
the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and
Merger Sub shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities
and duties of the Company and Merger Sub shall become the debts, liabilities
and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

SECTION 2.5. Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Surviving
Corporation. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the
Company shall be amended and restated so that they shall be identical to the
articles of incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect as of immediately prior

be "Arch Chemicals, Inc.") and shall be the articles of incorporation of the
Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended (subject to Section 6.8 hereof)
as provided therein or by applicable Law. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of
the Company shall be amended and restated to be identical to the bylaws of
Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that
the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Arch Chemicals, Inc.") and
shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended as
provided therein, by the articles of incorporation of the Surviving
Corporation or by applicable Law (subject to Section 6.8 hereof).

SECTION 2.6. Directors and Officers of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(a) Each of the parties hereto shall take all necessary actions to cause the

ARTICLE III

  

  

Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the Constituent Corporations;
Exchange of

  

Certificates; Company Stock Options

  

  

SECTION 3.1. Effect on Capital Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the
Merger and without any action on the part of Merger Sub, the Company or the
holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of
Merger Sub:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of Merger Sub. Each issued and outstanding share of capital
stock of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become one validly issued,
fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Subsidiary-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by any of the Company's Subsidiaries or by
Parent, Merger Sub or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall be
automatically cancelled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 3.1(b)), including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shares of Company
Common Stock held by a Company Plan or a trust that relates to obligations
pursuant to a Company Plan, shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to the Offer Price, without interest (the "Merger
Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common
Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate (or evidence of shares
in book-entry form) which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "Certificate") shall cease to
have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration to be paid in consideration therefor upon surrender of such
Certificate in accordance with the Plan of Merger, without interest.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

11  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(d) Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no
appraisal rights shall be available to the holders of Company Common Stock in
connection with the Transactions.

  

  

SECTION 3.2. Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive, for the benefit of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders
of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to Section
3.1(c) and the Plan of Merger. Parent shall deposit such aggregate Merger
Consideration in cash with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time.
Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall,
pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to
Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. In no event, however, shall the
investment of funds deposited with the Paying Agent, including any payment of
interest or income, delay the receipt by former holders of Company Common
Stock of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders' rights
hereunder. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
replace or restore the cash deposited with the Paying Agent so as to ensure
that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds on deposit at all times to make all
payments of Merger Consideration in accordance with this Article III. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures. As promptly as practicable (but in no event more than
three (3) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such
form and shall have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree prior to the
Acceptance Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 3.2, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Article III, without
interest.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

12  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Article III shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock not in violation of the terms
of this Agreement or prior to the date of this Agreement and which remain
unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books
of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except
as otherwise provided for herein, in the Plan of Merger or by applicable Law.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 3.2(e), if, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Article III.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Article III.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

13  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Termination of Fund. At any time following twelve months after the Closing
Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to
this Agreement, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining unclaimed
by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise escheat to
or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to the extent
permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear of all
claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Taxes. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Agreement such amounts as may be required to be deducted and
withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue
Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder
(the "Code"), or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To
the extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

  

  

SECTION 3.3. Treatment of Options, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Performance
Unit Awards and Phantom Share Awards.

  

  

(a) Options. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions
necessary to provide that each Option outstanding immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time (whether or not then vested or exercisable) shall be cancelled
and terminated and converted at the Acceptance Time into the right to receive
a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each share of Company
Common Stock then subject to the Option. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Option Consideration" means, with respect to any share of Company Common
Stock issuable under a particular Option, an amount equal to the excess, if
any, of (i) the Offer Price over (ii) the exercise price payable in respect of
such share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Option.

  

  

(b) Restricted Stock Unit Awards and Company Performance Unit Awards. Prior to
the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide
that each Restricted Stock Unit Award and each Performance Unit Award
outstanding immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be cancelled and
terminated and converted at the Acceptance Time into the right to receive a
cash amount equal to the Unit Award Consideration. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Unit Award Consideration" means an amount equal to the sum of
(i)(A) the Offer Price multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock subject to (or, in the case of cash-settled awards, deemed to be
subject to) such Restricted Stock Unit Award or such Performance Unit Award at
the Acceptance Time (assuming, in the case of any Performance Unit Award or
Restricted Stock Unit Award subject to performance conditions, attainment of
all applicable performance goals at the "target" level for 100% payout as set
forth in the applicable award agreement) and (ii) any accrued and unpaid
dividend equivalents with respect to dividends paid prior to the date hereof
with respect to such Restricted Stock Unit Award or such Performance Unit
Award (in the case of any Performance Unit Award or Restricted Stock Unit
Award subject to performance conditions, to the extent that the shares of
Company Common Stock subject thereto (or, in the case of cash-settled awards,
deemed to be subject thereto) are covered by the immediately preceding clause
(B)).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

14  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Phantom Share Awards. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall take
all actions necessary to provide that each Phantom Share Award outstanding
immediately prior to the Acceptance Time shall be cancelled and terminated and
converted at the Acceptance Time into an obligation of the Surviving
Corporation to pay the holder of such Phantom Share Award an amount in cash
equal to the Phantom Share Award Consideration. For purposes of this
Agreement, "Phantom Share Award Consideration" means an amount equal to (A)
the Offer Price multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock
subject to (or, in the case of cash-settled awards, deemed to be subject to)
such Phantom Share Award at the Acceptance Time.

  

  

(d) Definitions. For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

(i) "Option" means any option to purchase shares of Company Common Stock
awarded under a Company Stock Plan.

  

  

(ii) "Performance Unit Award" means any performance units, performance shares
or performance retention shares awarded under a Company Stock Plan, in each
case, whether settled in cash or shares of Company Common Stock.

  

  

(iii) "Phantom Share Award" means any right of any kind, contingent or
accrued, to acquire or receive shares of Company Common Stock or benefits
measured by the value of shares of Company Common Stock (including any such
rights or benefits settled solely in cash) under any Company Plan, other than
an Option, Restricted Stock Unit Award or Performance Unit Award.

  

  

(iv) "Restricted Stock Unit Award" means any restricted stock unit or
performance accelerated restricted stock unit awarded under a Company Plan, in
each case, whether settled in cash or shares of Company Common Stock.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

15  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(v) "Specified Deferred Share Arrangement" shall have the meaning set forth in
Section 3.3(d) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

  

  

(e) Timing of Payments. All amounts payable pursuant to this Section 3.3 shall
be subject to any required withholding of Taxes, and shall be paid, without
interest, within 10 Business Days following the Acceptance Time; provided,
however, that any amounts that are subject to the terms of the Arch Chemicals,
Inc. 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee Directors, the Arch Chemicals, Inc.
Supplemental Contributing Employee Ownership Plan, the Arch Chemicals, Inc.
Employee Deferral Plan or the Specified Deferred Share Arrangement (such
plans, collectively, the "Company Deferred Compensation Plans") shall be
credited to the relevant participant's account pursuant to the applicable plan
as of the Acceptance Time and may be paid to or reinvested by the participant
in accordance with the terms of such plan.

  

  

(f) Company Actions. Prior to the Acceptance Time, the Company shall, in
consultation with Parent, make any amendments to the terms of the Company
Stock Plans and obtain any consents from holders of Options, Restricted Stock
Unit Awards, Performance Unit Awards or Phantom Share Awards that, in each
case, the Company determines to be necessary to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Section 3.3. Without limiting the foregoing,
the Company shall take all actions that it determines to be necessary to
ensure that the Company will not after the Acceptance Time be bound by any
Options, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Performance Unit Awards, Phantom Share
Awards or any warrants or other rights or agreements which would entitle any
Person, other than Parent and its Subsidiaries, to own any capital stock of
the Surviving Corporation or to receive any payment in respect thereof. Prior
to the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to
terminate all its Company Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at or
before the Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Stock
Plans" shall mean the following plans: the Arch Chemicals, Inc. 1999 Long Term
Incentive Plan, the Arch Chemicals, Inc. 1999 Stock Plan for Non-Employee
Directors and the Arch Chemicals, Inc. 2009 Long Term Incentive Plan.

  

  

(g) Rights of Holders. The holders of Options, Restricted Stock Unit Awards,
Performance Unit Awards and Phantom Share Awards shall have the right to
enforce, and shall be beneficiaries with respect to, the provisions of this
Section 3.3.

  

  

SECTION 3.4. Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Article III to
the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in Section 6.2
hereof), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or
record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to
reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization,
split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

Except (i) as disclosed in, and reasonably apparent from, the reports,
schedules, forms, statements and other documents (including exhibits) filed by
the Company with, or furnished by the Company to, the SEC after January 1,
2011 and publicly available prior to the date of this Agreement (other than

(y) any disclosures in any section designated as relating to forward looking
statements, the "Filed Company SEC Documents") or (ii) as set forth in the
letter, dated as of the date of this Agreement, from the Company to Parent and
Merger Sub (which shall be arranged in numbered and lettered sections
corresponding to the numbered and lettered sections contained in this
Agreement, and the disclosure in any section shall be deemed to qualify or
apply to other sections in this Article IV to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent that such disclosure is relevant to such other sections, the "Company

Sub as follows:

  

  

SECTION 4.1. Organization, Standing and Corporate Power.

  

  

(a) Each of the Company and its significant Subsidiaries is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction in
which it is organized and has all requisite corporate or other comparable
power and authority necessary to own or lease all of its properties and assets
and to carry on its business as it is now being conducted, except in the case
of significant Subsidiaries where any such failure has not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Each of the Company and its
significant Subsidiaries is duly licensed or qualified to do business and is
in good standing (to the extent such concepts are applicable) in each
jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it or the
character or location of the properties and assets owned or leased by it makes
such licensing or qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so
licensed, qualified or in good standing has not had and would not reasonably
be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. For purposes of this Agreement, "Company Material Adverse
Effect" shall mean any change, event, development, circumstance or occurrence
(each an "Effect") that has a material adverse effect on the results of
operations, financial condition, assets, business or properties of the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; provided, however, that none of the
following, and no Effect arising out of, or resulting from, the following,
shall constitute or be taken into account, individually or in the aggregate,
in determining whether a Company Material Adverse Effect has occurred or would
reasonably be expected to occur: any Effect (A) generally affecting (1) the
industries in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate (including
changes in commodity prices) or (2) the economy, credit or financial or
capital markets, in the United States or elsewhere in the world, including
changes in interest or exchange rates, or (B) arising out of, resulting from
or attributable to (1) changes or prospective changes in Law or in GAAP or in
accounting standards, or any changes or prospective changes in the
interpretation or enforcement of any of the foregoing, or any changes or
prospective changes in general legal, regulatory or political conditions, (2)
the negotiation, execution or announcement of this Agreement (other than for
purposes of any representation or warranty contained in Section 4.3), (3)
natural disasters or acts of war (whether or not declared), sabotage or
terrorism, any escalation or worsening of any such acts of war (whether or not
declared), sabotage or terrorism, (4) any action taken by the Company or its
Subsidiaries that is required by this Agreement (other than obligations to
operate in the ordinary course) or with the written consent, or at the written
request, of Parent, or the failure to take any action by the Company if that
action is prohibited by this Agreement to the extent that the Company fails to
receive any required consent from Parent after delivering a written request
therefor to Parent a reasonable period of time prior to the time such action
was to have been taken, (5) any change or prospective change in the Company's
credit ratings, (6) any decline in the market price, or change in trading
volume, of the capital stock of the Company or (7) any failure to meet any
projections, forecasts, guidance, estimates, budgets or financial or operating
predictions of revenue, earnings, cash flow or cash position (it being
understood that the exceptions in clauses (5), (6) and (7) shall not prevent
or otherwise affect a determination that the underlying cause of any such
change, decline or failure referred to therein (if not otherwise falling
within any of the exceptions provided by clause (A) and clauses (B)(1) through
(4) hereof) is a Company Material Adverse Effect); provided further, however,
that any Effect referred to in clause (A), clause (B)(1) or clause (B)(3) may
be taken into account in determining whether or not there has been a Company
Material Adverse Effect to the extent such Effect has had or would reasonably
be expected to have a disproportionate adverse effect on the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as compared to other participants in the
industry in which the Company and its Subsidiaries operate.

(b) Section 4.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter lists all Subsidiaries of
the Company as of the date hereof, together with the jurisdiction of
organization of each such Subsidiary. All the outstanding shares of capital
stock of, or other equity interests in, each Subsidiary of the Company have
been duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and nonassessable
and are owned directly or indirectly by the Company free and clear of all
liens, pledges, charges, mortgages, encumbrances, licenses, ownership
interests of other Persons, adverse rights or claims and security interests of
any kind or nature whatsoever (including any restriction on the right to vote
or transfer the same, except for (i) shares of capital stock of foreign
Subsidiaries (other than significant Subsidiaries) required by applicable Law
to be held by a Person other than the Company or its Subsidiaries, such as
director qualifying shares, or by a minimum number of shareholders and (ii)
such transfer restrictions of general applicability as may be provided under
the Securities Act, and the "blue sky" Laws of the various States of the
United States) (collectively, "Liens"). The Company does not own, directly or
indirectly, any capital stock, voting securities or equity interests in any
Person other than the Company's Subsidiaries.

  

  

(c) True and complete copies of the articles of incorporation of the Company,
as amended to the date of this Agreement, and the Bylaws of the Company, as
amended to the date of this Agreement (together, the "Company Charter
Documents"), are included in the Filed Company SEC Documents. The Company is
not in violation of the Company Charter Documents in any material respect and
each of the Company's Subsidiaries is not in violation of its articles of
incorporation and bylaws (or comparable organizational documents) (the

including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K)), where the result, purpose or effect of

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse

claimed or alleged that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries was not in
compliance with all Laws applicable to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,

Statement, if any, and any information statement required under Rule 14f-1 in
connection with the Offer to be filed by the Company with the SEC or
distributed or otherwise disseminated to the Company's shareholders in
connection with the Transactions (the "Company Disclosure Documents"), and any
amendments or supplements thereto, when filed, distributed or disseminated, as
applicable, will comply as to form in all material respects with the
applicable requirements of the Exchange Act and will not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light
of the circumstances under which they are made, not misleading.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company makes no representation or warranty
with respect to information supplied by or on behalf of Parent or Merger Sub
specifically for inclusion or incorporation by reference in any Company
Disclosure Document.

of its Subsidiaries, except for Liens for Taxes not yet due.

  

  

(c) At any time within the five years prior to the date of this Agreement,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has constituted either a
"distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" (within the meaning

26  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries: (i) has waived any
statute of limitations in respect of material Taxes or agreed to any extension
of time with respect to a material Tax assessment or deficiency other than
waivers and extensions which are no longer in effect; (ii) has received any
written notice indicating an intent to open an audit or other review, a
written request for information related to Tax matters, or written notice of
deficiency or proposed adjustment in writing for any material amount of Tax
proposed, asserted or assessed (and no audit or administrative or judicial Tax
proceeding is pending or being conducted with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries); (iii) has been subject to a written claim by a Governmental
Authority in a jurisdiction where the Company or any of its Subsidiaries does

customary Tax indemnities in conjunction with an acquisition or divestiture or
(B) with third parties made in the ordinary course of business consistent with
past practice, the primary subject matter of which is not Tax; or (v) is
presently required, or shall be required, to include any taxable income for
any period ending after the Closing Date as a result of (A) a change in method
of accounting under Code Section 481 (or similar provision of foreign Law)
made prior to the Closing Date, (B) any intercompany transaction, (C) an
installment sale or open transaction disposition made on or prior to the
Closing Date, or (D) a prepaid amount received on or prior to the Closing Date

Law or fact which, to the Knowledge of the Company, arise out of a written
notice of deficiency, or proposed deficiency or written assessment from any
Governmental Authority with respect to material Taxes of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries.

SECTION 4.11. Employee Benefits and Labor Matters.

  

  

(a) Section 4.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter (i) sets forth a correct
and complete list of each material Company Plan as of the date hereof and (ii)
separately identifies each Company Plan pursuant to which the Company has
granted any outstanding Options, Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Performance
Unit Awards or Phantom Share Awards. The term "Company Plan" means (i) each
"employee benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA")) and (ii) each other
employee benefit plan, policy, agreement or arrangement, including any
employment, consulting or other compensation agreement, or bonus, retention or
other incentive compensation, stock purchase, equity or equity-based
compensation, deferred compensation, change in control, severance, sick leave,
vacation, loan, salary continuation, health, post-retirement (including
retiree medical and retiree life insurance), life insurance and educational
assistance plan, policy, agreement or arrangement (including any funding
mechanism now in effect or required in the future as a result of the
transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise), whether formal or informal,
oral or written, legally binding or not, with respect to which the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability, contingent or
otherwise, for Company Employees, other than any plan, policy, program,
arrangement or understanding mandated by any applicable Non-U.S. Laws. Section
4.11(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter separately sets forth each
Multiemployer Plan and each Company Plan that is or has been subject to
Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA, in each case as of the date hereof. Any
current, former or retired employee, director or consultant of the Company or
its Subsidiaries is referred to as a "Company Employee." Any Company Plan
maintained within the jurisdiction of the United States for the benefit of a
Company Employee who is primarily based in the United States is referred to as
"U.S. Company Plan."

  

  

(b) Section 4.11(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth a complete and
accurate list as of the date hereof of each material Company Plan maintained
outside the jurisdiction of the United States for the benefit of any Company
Employee who is primarily based outside of the United States (each such
Company Plan, a "Non-U.S. Company Plan"), listed separately by applicable
country or jurisdiction. With respect to each Non-U.S. Company Plan, since
January 1, 2008 (i) such Non-U.S. Company Plan has been established,
maintained and administered in compliance with its terms and all applicable
Laws, except for instances of non-compliance that are not, and would not
reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to
the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole; (ii) to the extent
required under applicable Laws to be funded, is so funded; and (iii) to the
extent not required under applicable Laws to be funded, adequate reserves
therefore have been established on the accounting statements of the applicable
Company or Subsidiary to the extent required by GAAP.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

28  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Correct and complete copies of the following documents with respect to
each material Company Plan have been delivered to Parent by the Company, to
the extent applicable: (i) the plan document and any amendments thereto,
other than plan documents that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
prohibited from making available to Parent as a result of applicable Laws
relating to the safeguarding of data privacy; (ii) the most recent Form 5500
and all schedules thereto; (iii) the most recent actuarial report, if any;
(iv) the most recent IRS determination letter; (v) the most recent summary
plan description; and (vi) written summaries of all non-written Company Plans.

  

  

(d) Since January 1, 2008, except for instances of non-compliance that are
not, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (i)
the U.S. Company Plans have been maintained, in all material respects, in
accordance with their terms and with all applicable provisions of ERISA, the
Code and other Laws and (ii) all required reports and descriptions (including
Form 5500 Annual Reports) have been filed or distributed appropriately with
respect to each U.S. Company Plan.

  

  

(e) Each U.S. Company Plan intended to qualify under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received a favorable determination letter as to its tax-qualified
status and the tax-exempt status of any trusts thereunder intended to be
exempt from federal income taxation, and nothing has occurred, whether by
action or failure to act, that would reasonably be expected to cause such
determination letter to be revoked.

  

  

(f) None of the Company, its Subsidiaries or any member of their Controlled
Group has, during the past six years, maintained, established, sponsored,
participated in, contributed to, or has any liability with respect to, any (i)
Multiemployer Plan, (ii) a "multiple employer plan" (as defined in ERISA or
the Code), or (iii) a "funded welfare plan" within the meaning of Section 419
of the Code.

  

  

(g) All contributions required to have been made under any of the Company
Plans subject to Title IV of ERISA or 412 of the Code (without regard to any
waivers granted under Section 412 of the Code) (each, a "Title IV Plan"), have
been timely made, and no accumulated funding deficiencies exist in any Title
IV Plans.

  

  

(h) As of the date of the most recent actuarial valuation report, the "benefit
liabilities" as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA of each Title IV Plan
using the actuarial assumptions used by the Pension Benefit Guaranty
Corporation to determine the level of funding required in the event of the
termination of such Title IV Plan do not exceed the assets of such Title IV
Plan or any similar Non-U.S. Laws.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

29  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(i) Except for events or conditions that are not, and would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, no event has occurred with respect to the
U.S. Company Plans and, to the Knowledge of the Company, no condition exists
that would subject the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, either directly or
by reason of their affiliation with any member of their Controlled Group, to
any Tax, fine, lien, penalty or other liability imposed by ERISA, the Code or
other applicable Laws, rules and regulations (other than any such liability
that may arise in the ordinary course of business). "Controlled Group" means
any organization which is a member of a controlled group of organizations
within the meaning of Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code.

  

  

(j) With respect to any Company Plan, including any assets of any such Company
Plan or any fiduciary to any such Company Plan, to the Knowledge of the
Company, as of the date hereof (i) no actions, suits or claims (other than
routine claims for benefits in the ordinary course) are pending or threatened,
(ii) no administrative investigation, audit or other administrative proceeding
by the Department of Labor, the Internal Revenue Service or other Governmental
Authority is pending (to the extent the Company has received notice thereof)
or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, in each case which is, or
which would be, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a
whole, and (iii) there has been no non-exempt "prohibited transaction" within
the meaning of Section 4975(c) of the Code or Section 406 of ERISA involving
the assets of any Company Plan.

  

  

(k) None of the Company Plans provide for post-retirement life or health
coverage for any participant or any beneficiary of a participant, except for
(i) coverage or benefits required under Section 4980B(f) of the Code or any
state or foreign Laws, (ii) coverage or benefits the future cost of which is
borne by the participant or (iii) coverage or benefits that would not
reasonably be expected to result in material costs to the Company.

  

  

(l) Except to the extent required pursuant to applicable non-U.S. Law, neither
the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor the consummation of the
Transactions will (i) result in any material payment becoming due to any
employee, (ii) materially increase any benefits otherwise payable under any
Company Plan, (iii) result in the acceleration of the time of payment or
vesting of any material benefits under any such plan, or (iv) require any
material contributions or payments to fund any obligations under any Company
Plan.

  

  

(m) Except to the extent required pursuant to applicable non-U.S. Law, (i) no
Company Plan provides for, as a result of any of the Transactions contemplated
by this Agreement (whether alone or in connection with other events), any
payment of any material amount of money or other property to or the
acceleration of or provision of any other material rights or benefits to any
current or former officer, employee, independent contractor or director of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether or not such payment, right or
benefit, or acceleration thereof, would constitute a "parachute payment"
within the meaning of Section 280G of the Code.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

30  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(n) None of the Company and its Subsidiaries have any indemnity or gross-up
obligation for any Taxes or interest imposed or accelerated under Section 409A
or Section 4999 of the Code.

  

  

(o) No Option (i) has an exercise price that has been or may be less than the
fair market value of the underlying equity as of the date such Option was
granted, (ii) has any feature that would result in the deferral of recognition
of income beyond the later of exercise or disposition of such Options or (iii)
has been granted after January 31, 2008, with respect to any class of stock of
the Company that is not "service recipient stock" (within the meaning of
current guidance under Section 409A of the Code).

  

  

(p) All compensatory and similar arrangements that the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries have made or entered into (including any payments that may be or
become payable, and any benefits that may be granted, according to employment
compensation, severance and other employee benefit plans, contracts or
arrangements) (i) have been made or entered into in consideration of, or paid
or granted as compensation for, past services performed, future services to be
performed or future services to be refrained from performing (and matters
incidental thereto), and (ii) have not been calculated based on the number of
shares of Company Common Stock tendered or to be tendered in the Offer. The
Company Board has determined that each of the members of the Compensation
Committee are "independent directors" as defined under the rules of the New
York Stock Exchange.

  

  

(q) Except as required by any Non-U.S. Laws, none of the employees of the
Company or its Subsidiaries is represented in his or her capacity as an
employee of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries by any labor organization,
other than any such labor organization that is industry-wide or nationwide in

Non-U.S. Laws or, in the case of a jurisdiction other than the United States,
on an industry-wide or nationwide basis, neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has recognized any labor organization, nor has any labor
organization been elected as the collective bargaining agent of any employees,
nor has the Company or any of its Subsidiaries entered into, with respect to
U.S. employees or Non-U.S. employees in any of the jurisdictions set forth in
Section 4.11(q) of the Company Disclosure Letter, any collective bargaining

and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of, and during the year prior to,
the date hereof, there is no union organization activity involving any of the
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries pending or, to the
Knowledge of the Company, threatened, nor has there been within the last year
prior to the date hereof union representation involving any of the employees
of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except as is not, and would not

the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, as of the date of this
Agreement (i) there is no picketing pending or, to the Knowledge of the
Company, threatened, (ii) there are no strikes, slowdowns, work stoppages,
other job actions, lockouts, arbitrations, grievances or other labor disputes
involving any of the employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened and (iii) there are no
complaints, charges or claims against the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened that could be brought
or filed with any Governmental Authority or arbitrator based on, arising out
of, in connection with, or otherwise relating to the employment or termination
of employment or failure to employ by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
of any individual. Except for instances of non-compliance that are not, and

local "mass layoff" or "plant closing" law ("WARN"), collective bargaining,
discrimination, civil rights, safety and health, workers' compensation and the
collection and payment of withholding and/or social security taxes and any
similar tax. There has been no "mass layoff" or "plant closing" (as defined by

practice). To the Knowledge of the Company, neither the Company, its
Subsidiaries nor any member of its Controlled Group has any material liability
with respect to any misclassification of any Person as an independent
contractor rather than as an employee, or with respect to any
misclassification of employee leased from another employer.

Section 4.11(s) of the Company Disclosure Letter.

services with annual revenues in excess of $5,000,000, (N) each other Contract
providing for annual payments by the Company in excess of $5,000,000 and each
Contract providing for annual payments to the Company in excess of $5,000,000
and (O) each commitment or agreement to enter into any of the foregoing (the
Contracts and other documents required to be listed on Section 4.13(a) of the
Company Disclosure Letter, together with any and all other Contracts of such
type entered into in accordance with Section 6.2 that would have been required
to be listed on Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure Letter if entered
into prior to the date hereof, each a "Material Contract"). The Company has
heretofore made available to Parent correct and complete copies of each
Material Contract in existence as of the date hereof, together with any and
all material amendments and supplements thereto and material "side letters"
and similar documentation relating thereto.

(b) Each of the Material Contracts is valid, binding and in full force and
effect and is enforceable in accordance with its terms by the Company and its
Subsidiaries party thereto, subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception,
except for such failures to be valid, binding or enforceable or to be in full
force and effect as have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. Except as
separately identified in Section 4.13(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter, no
approval, consent or waiver of any Person is needed in order that any of the
Material Contracts set forth in Section 4.13(a) of the Company Disclosure
Letter continue in full force and effect following the consummation of the
Transactions. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is in default
under any Material Contract or other Contract to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries is a party (collectively, the "Company Contracts"), nor does
any condition exist that, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default thereunder by the Company and its Subsidiaries party
thereto, except for such defaults as have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse
Effect. To the Knowledge of the Company, no other party to any Company
Contract is in default thereunder, nor does any condition exist that with
notice or lapse of time or both would constitute a default by any such other
party thereunder, except for such defaults as have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2009 to the date hereof, neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any notice of termination or
cancellation under any Material Contract or received any notice of breach or
default in any material respect under any Material Contract which breach has
not been cured, in each case except any notice of a termination, cancellation,
breach or default that is not and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. Since January 1, 2010, neither the Company nor
any of its Subsidiaries has granted to any third party any rights, adverse or
otherwise, that would constitute a breach of any Material Contract, in each
case except as has not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, each of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (a) has good and valid title to all properties and other assets
which are reflected on the most recent consolidated balance sheet of the
Company included in the Filed Company SEC Documents as being owned by the
Company or one of its Subsidiaries (or acquired after the date thereof) and
which are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company's
business or financial condition on a consolidated basis (other than properties
or assets that have been sold or disposed of, or for which a valid leasehold
interest has expired and not been renewed), free and clear of all Liens except
(i) Liens for Taxes that are not due and payable or that may thereafter be
paid without interest or penalty, (ii) mechanics', carriers', workmen's,
warehousemen's, repairmen's or other like Liens arising or incurred in the
ordinary course of business consistent with past practice, (iii) Liens

building and other similar codes and regulations, (v) security interests,
mortgages and pledges that are disclosed in the Filed Company SEC Documents or
that secure indebtedness or other financing arrangements that are reflected in
the most recent consolidated financial statements of the Company included in
the Filed Company SEC Documents and (vi) Liens, defects or irregularities in
title, easements, rights-of-way, covenants, restrictions and other similar
matters that would not reasonably be expected to, individually or in the
aggregate, materially impair the continued use and operation of the assets to
which they relate in the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiaries
as presently conducted (collectively, "Permitted Liens"), and (b) is the
lessee or sublessee of all leasehold estates and leasehold interests reflected
in the Filed Company SEC Documents (or acquired after the date thereof) which
are, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company's business or
financial condition on a consolidated basis (other than any such leaseholds
whose scheduled terms have expired subsequent to the date of such Filed
Company SEC Documents). Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries enjoys
peaceful and undisturbed possession under all such leases in all material
respects.

not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect, and neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has made any such claims against any Person (including employees
and former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries) nor, to the
Knowledge of the Company, is there any basis for such a claim, except for
claims that have not had and would not reasonably be expected to have,

any of the Policies, except for such breaches, defaults or terminations as are
not, and would not reasonably be expected to be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole. No
notice of cancellation or termination has been received by the Company with
respect to any of the Policies and, except as is not, and would not reasonably
be expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, the consummation of the Transactions
will not, in and of itself, cause the revocation, cancellation or termination
of any Policy.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

38  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 4.17. Regulatory Matters. Except for those matters that have not had

date thereof, and subject to the various assumptions and qualifications set
forth therein, the consideration to be received in the Transactions by holders
of the Company Common Stock is fair from a financial point of view to holders
of such shares (the "Fairness Opinion"), a signed copy of which opinion will
be made available to Parent for informational purposes only promptly following
the date of this Agreement. The Company has been authorized by Morgan Stanley
and Co. Incorporated to permit the inclusion of the Fairness Opinion and
references thereto in the Offer Documentation and the Proxy Statement.

Board have taken all action required to be taken by them to exempt this
Agreement, the Offer, the Merger, the Top-Up Option and the transactions

there have been no transactions, agreements, arrangements or understandings
between the Company or its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any director,
officer or other Affiliate of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of
such Person's Affiliates, or any entity in which any such Person has a direct
or indirect material interest (collectively, the "Company Affiliates"), on the
other hand, that would be required to be disclosed under Item 404 of
Regulation S-K under the Securities Act. This Section 4.21 does not relate to
employee benefits matters, which are addressed in part in Section 4.6(b) and
in Section 4.11.

  

  

SECTION 4.22. Certain Payments. Except as is not and would not reasonably be
expected to be, individually or in the aggregate, material to the Company and
its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, neither the Company nor any of its

Act of 1977 or (d) has made any bribe, unlawful rebate, payoff, influence
payment, kickback or other unlawful payment of any nature.

after the Company Proxy Statement is cleared with the SEC. Each of Parent,
Merger Sub and the Company agree to correct as soon as reasonably practicable
any information provided by it for use in the Company Proxy Statement which
shall have become false or misleading. If at any time prior to the Effective
Time, any information should be discovered by any party which should be set
forth in an amendment or supplement to the Company Proxy Statement so that the
Company Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading,
the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify the other
parties hereto and, to the extent required by applicable Law, an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed by
the Company with the SEC and disseminated by the Company to the shareholders
of the Company. The Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (i)
notify Parent and Merger Sub of the receipt of any oral or written comments
from the SEC with respect to the Company Proxy Statement and any request by
the SEC for any amendment to the company Proxy Statement or for additional
information and (ii) provide Parent with copies of all written correspondence
between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC, on
the other hand, with respect to the Company Proxy Statement.

SECTION 6.3. No Solicitation by the Company; Etc.

  

  

(a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries and the Company's and
its Subsidiaries' respective directors, officers, employees, investment
bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other
representatives (collectively, "Representatives") to, immediately cease and
cause to be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person
conducted heretofore with respect to a Takeover Proposal, and use reasonable
best efforts to obtain the return from all such Persons or cause the
destruction of all copies of confidential information previously provided
within the last twelve months to such parties by the Company, its Subsidiaries
or Representatives. The Company shall not, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
and Representatives not to, directly or indirectly (i) solicit or initiate, or
knowingly cause, facilitate or encourage (including by way of furnishing non-
public information) any inquiries or proposals that constitute a Takeover
Proposal, (ii) participate in any discussions or negotiations with any third
party regarding any Takeover Proposal or (iii) enter into any merger or other
agreement, agreement in principle, letter of intent, term sheet, joint venture
agreement, partnership agreement or other similar instrument constituting or
related to any Takeover Proposal; provided, however, that if after the date
hereof but prior to the Acceptance Time the Company Board receives an
unsolicited, bona fide written Takeover Proposal made after the date hereof
but prior to the Acceptance Time, in circumstances not involving a breach of
this Agreement, and the Company Board determines in its good faith judgment
that such Takeover Proposal constitutes or would reasonably be expected to
lead to a Superior Proposal, then the Company may, at any time prior to the
Acceptance Time (but in no event after the Acceptance Time) and after
providing Parent not less than 24 hours prior written notice of such
determination by the Company Board (A) furnish information with respect to the
Company and its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Takeover Proposal, but
only after such Person enters into a customary confidentiality agreement with
the Company (which confidentiality agreement must be no less restrictive with
respect to the confidentiality treatment of information by such Person) than
the Confidentiality Agreement), provided that (1) such confidentiality
agreement may not include any provision calling for an exclusive right to
negotiate with the Company and (2) the Company provides Parent, in accordance
with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement, any non-public information
with respect to the Company furnished to such other Person which was not
previously furnished to Parent and (B) participate in discussions and
negotiations with such Person regarding such Takeover Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by the Company's Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed
to be a breach of this Section 6.3 by the Company. The Company shall promptly
provide Parent with a correct and complete copy of any confidentiality
agreement entered into pursuant to this paragraph.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

49  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(b) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
Section 6.3, the Company shall promptly advise Parent, orally and in writing
of any Takeover Proposal, and shall, in any such notice to Parent, indicate
the identity of the Person making such Takeover Proposal and the terms and
conditions of such Takeover Proposal (and shall include with such notice
copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such Person
relating to such Takeover Proposal), and thereafter shall promptly keep Parent
reasonably informed of all material developments affecting the status and
terms of any such Takeover Proposal (and the Company shall provide Parent with
copies of any additional written materials received that relate to such
Takeover Proposal) and of the status of any such discussions or negotiations.

  

  

(c) Except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.3(c), neither the Company
Board nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw or modify, or propose
publicly to withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent or Merger Sub,
the recommendation by the Company Board that shareholders of the Company
accept the Offer, tender their shares of Company Common Stock to Merger Sub
pursuant to the Offer and approve this Agreement (the "Company Board
Recommendation") or (B) approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve
or recommend, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i)
being referred to as a "Company Adverse Recommendation Change") or (ii)
approve or recommend, or propose publicly to approve or recommend, or cause or
authorize the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to enter into, any letter of
intent, agreement in principle, memorandum of understanding, merger,
acquisition, purchase or joint venture agreement or other agreement related to
any Takeover Proposal (other than a confidentiality agreement in accordance
with Section 6.3(a)) (each, a "Company Acquisition Agreement").
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (x) the Company Board may withdraw or modify
the Company Board Recommendation, or recommend a Takeover Proposal, if the
Company Board determines in its good faith judgment, after consulting with
outside counsel, that the failure to make such withdrawal, modification, or
recommendation would be inconsistent with the Company Board's fiduciary duties
to the Company's shareholders under Virginia Law, and (y) if the Company Board
receives after the date hereof but before the Acceptance Time an unsolicited,
bona fide written Takeover Proposal that was made in circumstances not
involving a breach of this Agreement and that the Company Board determines in
its good faith judgment constitutes a Superior Proposal, the Company Board
may, in response to such Superior Proposal and after the expiration of the
five Business Day period described below (but in no event later than the
Acceptance Time), enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to
such Superior Proposal if the Company shall have concurrently with entering
into such Company Acquisition Agreement terminated this Agreement pursuant to

  

Section 8.1(c)(ii) and paid the Termination Fee required pursuant to Section
8.3, but only after the fifth Business Day following Parent's receipt of
written notice from the Company advising Parent that the Company Board is
prepared to enter into a Company Acquisition Agreement with respect to such
Superior Proposal (which notice shall include the most current versions of
such agreement and proposal) and terminate this Agreement, and only if, during
such five Business Day period, the Company and its representatives shall have
negotiated in good faith with Parent and Parent's representatives to make such
adjustments in the terms of this Agreement as would enable Parent to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement on such adjusted terms
and, at the end of such five Business Day period, after taking into account
any such adjusted terms as may have been proposed by Parent since its receipt
of such written notice, the Company Board has again in good faith made the
determination referred to above in this clause (y). In the event of any
material change to the material terms of a Superior Proposal, the Company
shall, in each case, make the determination referred to above in clause (y),
except that the notice period shall be at least three Business Days (rather
than the five Business Days otherwise contemplated by clause (y) above).

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

50  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) For purposes of this Agreement:

  

  

"Takeover Proposal" means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any Person or
"group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other than Parent
and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of
Subsidiaries) equal to 15% or more of the Company's consolidated assets or to
which 15% or more of the Company's revenues or earnings on a consolidated
basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition (whether in a
single transaction or a series of related transactions or by merger,
consolidation or otherwise) of 15% or more of any class of equity securities
of the Company or (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would
result in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act) beneficially owning 15% or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, other than the Transactions.

  

  

"Superior Proposal" means a bona fide written offer, obtained after the date
hereof but prior to the Acceptance Time and not in breach of this Agreement,
to acquire, directly or indirectly, for consideration consisting of cash
and/or securities, all of the equity securities of the Company or all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis, made by a third party, which the Company Board determines
in its good faith judgment (after consultation with outside counsel and a
financial advisor of national reputation) to be more favorable to the
Company's shareholders from a financial point of view than the Offer, the
Merger and the other Transactions, taking into account at the time of
determination (i) any changes to the terms of this Agreement that as of that
time had been proposed by Parent in writing and (ii) the financial,
regulatory, legal and other aspects and terms of such proposal and the third
party.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

51  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Nothing in this Section 6.3 shall prohibit the Company Board from taking
and disclosing to the Company's shareholders a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a), Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or making any disclosure to its shareholders required pursuant to
the rules and regulations of the SEC if the Company Board determines, in its
good faith judgment, after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure
to take such action would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties or
applicable Law; provided, however, that in no event shall the Company or the
Company Board or any committee thereof take, or agree or resolve to take, any
action prohibited by Section 6.3(c).

  

  

SECTION 6.4. Reasonable Best Efforts.

  

  

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each of the parties
hereto shall cooperate with the other parties and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable best efforts to
promptly (i) take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be
done, all things, necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make
effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Transactions,
including preparing and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect
all necessary filings, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain
all approvals, consents, registrations, permits, authorizations and other
confirmations from any Governmental Authority or third party necessary, proper
or advisable to consummate the Transactions, (iii) execute and deliver any
additional instruments necessary to consummate the Transactions and to fully
carry out the purposes of this Agreement and (iv) subject to Section 6.3, make
solicitations and recommendations to the holders of Company Common Stock for
purposes of causing the Minimum Condition to be satisfied, including, upon
Parent's request, preparing with Parent and Merger Sub a joint presentation to
RiskMetrics Group recommending this Agreement and the transactions
contemplated hereby, including the Offer and the Merger. For purposes hereof,
"Antitrust Laws" means the Sherman Act, as amended, the Clayton Act, as
amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, all
applicable Non-U.S. Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a
Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition through merger or acquisition.

  

  

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, Parent and the
Company each shall, in consultation and cooperation with the other and as
promptly as practicable and without undue delay: (i) no later than July 28,
2011, file a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act with respect
to the Transactions and use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to
be taken, all other actions consistent with this Section 6.4 necessary to
cause the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting periods under
the HSR Act as soon as practicable; (ii) file a merger notification with each
of the relevant national competition authorities of the Member States of the
European Economic Area where such filing would be required by the applicable
Laws of the respective Member State, or, if Parent and the Company agree that
it would be more expeditious to do so, file a reasoned submission on Form RS
pursuant to 4(5) of Regulation (EC) No 139/2004 with the European Commission,
using reasonable best efforts to file as soon as possible and if possible
within 20 Business Days after the date of this Agreement, taking into account
the exigencies of each jurisdiction's merger control procedures and practices,
and in all cases the Company agrees to provide Parent as promptly as
practicable with such assistance as Parent reasonably requests for the
purposes of filing such notification and, if such a filing is made, each party
agrees to supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and
documentary material that may be required or requested by the relevant
national competition authority and to use its reasonable best efforts to take
or cause to be taken all other actions consistent with this Section 6.4
necessary to obtain a decision from the relevant national competition
authority approving the Transactions as soon as practicable; (iii) file all
other appropriate filings required under any Non-U.S. Antitrust Law; and (iv)
file all other appropriate filings required by any other Governmental
Authority. The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to (x) take all
action necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the Transactions and (y) if any state takeover
statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the Transactions, take all
action necessary to ensure that the Transactions may be consummated as
promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and
otherwise minimize the effect of such Law on the Transactions.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

52  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Each of the parties hereto agrees to supply as promptly as reasonably
practicable any additional information and documentary material that may be
requested by any Government Authority, and each of the parties hereto shall,
and, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, shall cause each
of its Subsidiaries to, promptly take any and all steps necessary to avoid or
eliminate each and every impediment and obtain all consents under any
applicable Law (including Antitrust Laws) that may be asserted or required by
any foreign or U.S. federal, state or local Governmental Authority, in each
case with competent jurisdiction, so as to enable the parties hereto to close
the Transactions as promptly as practicable, and in any event prior to the
Walk-Away Date, including negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent
decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing
or disposition or the restricted use or operation (a "Divestiture or
Restriction") of its assets, properties or businesses or of the assets,
properties or businesses to be acquired by it pursuant hereto; provided that,
notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, under no
circumstances shall Parent be required to negotiate, commit to or effect, by
consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, any Divestiture or
Restriction of (i) any assets, properties or businesses of Parent and its
Subsidiaries not primarily used in the biocides business or (ii) any assets,
properties or businesses primarily used in Parent's biocides business, or any
assets, properties or businesses of the Company and its Subsidiaries to be
acquired by Parent pursuant hereto, in each case, the sale divestiture,
licensing or disposition or the restricted use or operation of which would
reasonably be expected to be material, individually or in the aggregate, to
the revenues or profitability of the combined biocides businesses of Parent,
the Company and their respective Subsidiaries, taken as a whole immediately
following the Effective Time. The Company shall not, without Parent's prior
written consent, commit to any Divestiture or Restriction of any assets,
properties or businesses or agree to any other restriction on its business.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 6.4 to the contrary, (1) under no
circumstances shall either party be required to negotiate, commit to or
effect, by consent decree, hold separate orders, or otherwise, any Divestiture
or Restriction of any assets, properties or businesses unless such Divestiture
or Restriction is conditioned upon the occurrence of the Acceptance Time and
(2) nothing in this Section 6.4 shall require any party to this Agreement to
contest or otherwise resist any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding brought by a Governmental Authority challenging any of the
Transactions as violative of any Antitrust Law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

53  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(d) In connection with and without limiting the foregoing, each of Parent and
the Company shall (i) furnish to the other party such necessary information
and reasonable assistance as the other party may request in connection with
its preparation of any filing or submission which is necessary under the HSR
Act, any Non-U.S. Antitrust Law or otherwise required by a Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions, (ii) give the other party
reasonable prior notice of any such filings or submissions and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, of any communication with, and any inquiries or
requests for additional information from, the FTC, the DOJ and any other
Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions, and permit the other party
to review and discuss in advance, and consider in good faith the views of, and
secure the participation of, the other party in connection with, any such
filings, submissions, communications, inquiries or requests, (iii) unless
prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable Governmental Authority, and
to the extent reasonably practicable, (A) not participate in or attend any
meeting, or engage in any substantive conversation, with any Governmental
Authority in respect of the Transactions without the other party, (B) give the
other party reasonable prior notice of any such meeting or conversation, (C)
in the event one party is prohibited by applicable Law or by the applicable
Governmental Authority from participating in or attending any such meeting or
engaging in any such conversation, keep such party apprised with respect
thereto, (D) cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white
papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending this Agreement or any of the Transactions, articulating any
regulatory or competitive argument or responding to requests or objections
made by any Governmental Authority and (E) furnish the other party with copies
of all filings, submissions, correspondence and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and its affiliates and their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any U.S. or foreign
Governmental Authority or members of any Governmental Authority's staff, on
the other hand, with respect to this Agreement and the Transactions and (iv)
comply with any inquiry or information or document request from the FTC, the
DOJ or any other U.S. or foreign Governmental Authority as promptly as
reasonably practicable. Any such additional information shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of the HSR Act, the applicable
Non-U.S. Antitrust Law or such other applicable Law, as the case may be.
Parent agrees not to extend, directly or indirectly, any waiting period under
the HSR Act, any Non-U.S. Antitrust Law or any other applicable Law or enter
into any agreement with a Governmental Authority to delay or not to consummate
the Transactions, except with the prior written consent of the Company (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). Each of Parent and the
Company may designate any non-public, competitively-sensitive information
provided to any Governmental Authority as restricted to "Outside Antitrust
Counsel" only and any such information shall not be shared with employees,
officers or directors or their equivalents of the other party without approval
of the party providing the non-public information.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

54  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Parent and the Company shall cooperate in good faith in devising and
implementing the strategy for obtaining any necessary clearances under
Antitrust Laws, including any determination to extend, directly or indirectly,
any waiting period under the HSR Act, any Non-U.S. Antitrust Law or any other
applicable Law, and shall coordinate all meetings and communications with any
Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining any such clearances.
Parent and the Company shall each consult the other party in advance and in
good faith take the other party's views into account regarding the overall
strategic direction of obtaining such clearances and consult with the other
party prior to taking any material substantive position in any written
submissions or discussions with Governmental Authorities. Parent and the
Company shall each provide the other with the opportunity to attend any
meetings with any Governmental Authority in connection with obtaining any
necessary clearances under Antitrust Laws.

  

  

(f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, each
of Parent and Merger Sub shall take all action necessary to ensure that Parent
and Merger Sub obtain the financing necessary to fund the Offer, the Merger,
and any other Merger Transactions in accordance with the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.5. Public Announcements. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent not previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to the Offer, the Merger, this
Agreement or the other Transactions without the prior consent of the other
party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as
may be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with a national
securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of the party
proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not issue or
cause the publication of such press release or other public announcement
without prior consultation with the other party).

  

  

SECTION 6.6. Access to Information; Confidentiality. Subject to applicable
Laws relating to the exchange of information, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, afford to Parent and Parent's
representatives reasonable access during normal business hours (under the
supervision of appropriate personnel and in a manner that does not
unreasonably interfere with the normal operation of the business of the
Company and the Company Subsidiaries) to all of the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' properties, books, Contracts, commitments, records and
correspondence (in each case, whether in physical or electronic form),
officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other
Representatives and the Company shall furnish as promptly as reasonably
practicable to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other document
filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of Federal or state
securities Laws (and the Company shall deliver to Parent a copy of each
report, schedule and other document proposed to be filed or submitted by the
Company pursuant to the requirements of Federal securities Laws not less than
two Business Days prior to such filing) and a copy of any communication
(including "comment letters") received by the Company from the SEC concerning
compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its
and its Subsidiaries' business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request. Notwithstanding the immediately preceding sentence,
neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to afford
access or furnish information to the extent (a) such information is subject to
the terms of a confidentiality agreement with a third party; provided, that
the Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to such access or the disclosure of such
information and shall disclose or describe such information to the fullest
extent possible (in the Company's reasonable judgment) consistent with its
obligations under the terms of the applicable confidentiality agreement; or
(b) the Company determines in good faith that affording such access or
furnishing such information would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, violate applicable Law or result in
significant antitrust risk for the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Except
for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement,
Parent and its Representatives shall hold information received from the
Company pursuant to this Section 6.6 in confidence in accordance with the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. No investigation, or information
received, pursuant to this Section 6.6 will modify any of the representations
and warranties of the parties hereto.

SECTION 6.7. Notification of Certain Matters. The Company shall give prompt
notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company, of (i)
any notice or other communication received by such party from any Governmental
Authority in connection with the Transactions or from any Person alleging that
the consent of such Person is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, if the subject matter of such communication or the failure of
such party to obtain such consent could be material to the Company, the
Surviving Corporation or Parent, (ii) any actions, suits, claims,
investigations or proceedings commenced or, to such party's Knowledge,
threatened against, relating to or involving or otherwise affecting such party
or any of its Subsidiaries which relate to the Transactions, (iii) the
discovery of any fact or circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-
occurrence of any event the occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would cause
an Offer Condition not to be satisfied, and (iv) any material failure of such
party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or agreement to be complied with
or satisfied by it hereunder; provided, however, that the delivery of any
notice pursuant to this Section 6.7 shall not (x) cure any breach of, or non-
compliance with, any other provision of this Agreement or (y) limit the
remedies available to the party receiving such notice.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

56  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 6.8. Indemnification and Insurance.

  

  

(a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or
omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and rights to
advancement of expenses) now existing in favor of any Person who is or prior
to the Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of
this Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a
fiduciary with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of the
Company Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (collectively,
the "Indemnitees") as provided in the Company Charter Documents, the
organizational documents of any Company Subsidiary or any indemnification
agreement between such Indemnitee and the Company or any of the Company
Subsidiaries (i) shall be assumed by the Surviving Corporation in the Merger,
without further action, at the Effective Time, (ii) shall survive the Merger,
(iii) shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
respective terms with respect to any claims against any such Indemnitee
arising out of such acts or omissions prior to the Effective Time and (iv)
shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any manner that would
adversely affect any right thereunder of any such Indemnitee. Parent shall
ensure that the Surviving Corporation complies with and honors the foregoing
obligations.

  

  

(b) Parent shall obtain, at the Acceptance Time, prepaid run-off directors'
and officers' liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability policies in
respect of acts or omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time
(including for acts or omissions occurring in connection with the approval of
this Agreement and the consummation of the Transactions) for the period
beginning at the Acceptance Time and ending six years from the Effective Time,
covering each Indemnitee and containing terms (including with respect to
coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to deductibles
and exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no less favorable
to any Indemnitee than those of the Company's existing directors' and
officers' liability insurance policies and fiduciary liability policies as of
the date hereof (the "Existing DandO Policies"); provided that neither Parent
nor the Surviving Corporation shall be required to pay an aggregate annual
premium for such insurance policies in excess of 300% of the annual premium
payable by the Company for coverage for its current fiscal year under the
Existing DandO Policies (which amount, as of the date hereof, the Company
represents and warrants is set forth in Section 6.8(b) of the Company
Disclosure Letter) (the "Maximum Amount"); provided further that if the annual
premium of such insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Parent or the
Surviving Corporation shall be obligated to obtain the most advantageous
policy available for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount; and
provided further that Parent may substitute therefor policies of a reputable
and financially sound insurance company containing terms (including with
respect to coverage and amounts) and conditions (including with respect to
deductibles and exclusions) that are, individually and in the aggregate, no
less favorable to any Indemnitee.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

57  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) In the event that (i) Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (A) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of
such consolidation or merger or (B) transfers or conveys all or a substantial
portion of its properties and other assets to any Person or (ii) Parent or any
of its successors or assigns dissolves the Surviving Corporation, then, and in
each such case, Parent shall cause proper provision to be made so that the
applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 6.8.

  

  

(d) The obligations of Parent and the Surviving Corporation under this Section
6.8 shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely
affect any Indemnitee to whom this Section 6.8 applies without the consent of
such affected Indemnitee. The provisions of this Section 6.8 are intended to
be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each Indemnitee, his or
her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to which each Indemnitee is entitled,
whether pursuant to Law, contract or otherwise.

  

  

SECTION 6.9. Securityholder Litigation. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
Transactions, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without Parent's prior
written consent, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

  

  

SECTION 6.10. Fees and Expenses. Except as provided in Section 8.3, all fees
and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Transactions
shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the
Transactions are consummated. Other than any Taxes imposed upon a holder of
Shares, Options, Performance Unit Awards, Restricted Stock Unit Awards or
Phantom Share Awards, the Company shall pay all Taxes incident to preparing
for, entering into and carrying out this Agreement and the consummation of the
Transactions (including (i) transfer, stamp and documentary Taxes or fees and
(ii) sales, use, gains, real property transfer and other similar Taxes or
fees).

  

  

SECTION 6.11. Rule 16b-3. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall take
such steps as may be required by applicable Law to cause dispositions of
Company equity securities (including derivative securities) pursuant to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each individual who is a
director or officer of the Company subject to Section 16 of the Exchange Act
to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act in accordance
with that certain No-Action Letter dated January 12, 1999 issued by the SEC
regarding such matters.

  

  

SECTION 6.12. New York Stock Exchange Delisting; Deregistration. Prior to the
Closing Date, the Company shall cooperate with Parent and use reasonable best
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do or cause to be done
all things, reasonably necessary, proper or advisable on its part under
applicable Laws and rules and policies of the New York Stock Exchange to
enable the de-listing by the Surviving Corporation of the Company Common Stock
from the New York Stock Exchange and the deregistration of the Company Common

officers and directors of the Surviving Corporation shall be authorized to
execute and deliver, in the name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub,
any deeds, bills of sale, assignments or assurances and to take and do, in the
name and on behalf of the Company or Merger Sub, any other actions and things
to vest, perfect or confirm of record or otherwise in the Surviving
Corporation any and all right, title and interest in, to and under any of the
rights, properties or assets of the Company acquired or to be acquired by the
Surviving Corporation as a result of, or in connection with, the Merger.

  

  

SECTION 6.14. Merger Without Meeting of Shareholders. If, after the
consummation of the Offer and any exercise of the Top-Up Option, the number of
shares of Company Common Stock beneficially owned by Parent, Merger Sub and
their respective Subsidiaries collectively represent at least 90% of the then
outstanding shares of Company Common Stock, Parent shall cause Merger Sub to,
and the Company shall execute and deliver such documents and instruments and
take such other actions as Parent or Merger Sub may reasonably request in
order to, cause the Merger to be completed as promptly as reasonably
practicable without a Company Shareholders Meeting or Company Shareholder
Approval as provided in Article 12 Section 13.1-719 of the VSCA, and otherwise
as provided in this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 6.15. Employee Matters.

  

  

(a) During the period commencing at the Acceptance Time and ending six months
after the Acceptance Time (the "Continuation Period"), Parent shall provide or
cause the Company and the Surviving Corporation to provide to each individual
who is employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries primarily in the
United States immediately prior to the Acceptance Time, other than any such
individual who is employed pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement or
union contract (each, a "Continuing Employee"), employee benefits and wages
and salaries that are comparable in the aggregate to customary industry levels
of employee benefits and wages and salaries or the employee benefits and wages
and salaries that are provided by Parent to similarly situated employees;
provided, however, that in no event shall Parent be required to provide any
portion of compensation to any Continuing Employee in the form of an equity
award; provided further that this Section 6.15(a) shall not address severance
benefits, which are addressed by Section 6.15(b).

  

  

(b) Without limiting the generality of Section 6.15(a), during the
Continuation Period, Parent shall or shall cause the Company and the Surviving
Corporation to provide to each Continuing Employee whose employment is
terminated by Parent, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective Affiliates during the Continuation Period, severance and
termination benefits (taking into account for such purpose such Continuing
Employee's service with the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with
Section 6.15(c)) that are no less favorable than the severance and termination
benefits that such Continuing Employee would have been eligible to receive
pursuant to the Company Plan that would have determined such Continuing
Employee's severance and termination benefits immediately prior to the
Acceptance Time.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

59  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) With respect to all employee benefits plans, programs and arrangements
maintained by Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Affiliates (collectively, the "Surviving Company Plans"), each Continuing
Employee's service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as
service with any predecessor employer of the Company or such Subsidiaries, to
the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company
or such Subsidiaries) shall be treated for all purposes as service with
Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective Affiliates; provided,
however, that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such
recognition would result in any duplication of benefits for the same period of
service.

  

  

(d) Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, (i) is intended
to confer or shall confer upon any individual or any legal representative of
any individual (including employees, retirees, or dependents or beneficiaries
of employees or retirees) any right as a direct party to, or a third party
beneficiary of, this Agreement or (ii) shall be deemed to confer upon any such
individual or legal representative any rights under or with respect to any
plan, program or arrangement described in or contemplated by this Agreement,
and each such individual or legal representative shall be entitled to look
only to the express terms of any such plans, program or arrangement for his or
her rights thereunder.

  

  

(e) Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied, shall prohibit
Parent, the Company or the Surviving Corporation from, subject to applicable
Law, adding, deleting or changing providers of benefits, changing, increasing
or decreasing co-payments, deductibles or other requirements for coverage or
benefits (e.g., utilization review or pre-certification requirements), and/or
making other changes in the administration or in the design, coverage and
benefits provided to Continuing Employees. No provision of this Agreement
shall be construed as a limitation on the right of Parent, the Company or the
Surviving Corporation, as applicable, to suspend, amend, modify or terminate
any employee benefit plan. Further, (i) no provision of this Agreement shall
be construed as an amendment to any employee benefit plan and (ii) no
provision of this Agreement shall be construed as limiting Parent's, the
Company's or the Surviving Corporation's discretion and authority, as
applicable, to interpret the respective employee benefit and compensation
plans, agreements arrangements, and programs, in accordance with their terms
and applicable Law.

  

  

SECTION 6.16. Merger Sub and Surviving Corporation Compliance. Parent shall

(a) Company Shareholder Approval. If required by the VSCA, the Company
Shareholder Approval shall have been obtained.

  

  

(b) No Injunctions or Restraints. No Law, injunction, judgment or ruling
enacted, promulgated, issued, entered, amended or enforced by any Governmental
Authority (collectively, "Restraints") shall be in effect enjoining,
restraining, preventing or prohibiting consummation of the Merger or making
the consummation of the Merger illegal.

  

  

(c) Purchase of Shares. Merger Sub shall have accepted for purchase and paid

SECTION 7.2. Frustration of Closing Conditions. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub
may rely on the failure of any Offer Condition or any condition set forth in
Section 7.1 to be satisfied if such failure was caused by the failure of
Parent or Merger Sub to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement,
to act in good faith or to use the standard of efforts required to be used by
such party pursuant to this Agreement to consummate the Transactions,
including as required by and subject to Section 6.4. The Company may not rely
on the failure of any condition set forth in Section 7.1 to be satisfied if
such failure was caused by its failure to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement, to act in good faith or to use the standard of efforts
required to be used by it pursuant to this Agreement to consummate the
Transactions, including as required by and subject to Section 6.4.

  

  

ARTICLE VIII

  

  

Termination

  

  

SECTION 8.1. Termination. This Agreement may be terminated and the Offer and
the Merger abandoned at any time prior to the Acceptance Time, notwithstanding
the receipt of the Company Shareholder Approval:

  

  

(a) by the mutual written consent of the Company and Parent duly authorized by
the Company Board and the Board of Directors of Parent; or

  

  

(b) by either of the Company or Parent:

  

  

(i) if any Restraint having the effect set forth in Section 7.1(b) shall be in
effect and shall have become final and nonappealable; provided, however, that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(i) shall not
be available to a party if such Restraint was primarily due to the failure of
such party to perform any of its obligations under this Agreement;

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

61  

  

 

 

 

  

  

(ii) if the Offer shall have expired pursuant to its terms (taking into
account all extensions made in accordance with Section 1.1 hereof) without any
shares of Company Common Stock being purchased therein, provided, however that
the right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(ii) shall not
be available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations
under this Agreement resulted in the failure of Merger Sub to purchase shares
of Company Common Stock in the Offer;

  

  

(iii) if no shares of Company Common Stock shall have been purchased pursuant
to the Offer on or before the Walk-Away Date; provided, however, that the
right to terminate this Agreement under this Section 8.1(b)(iii) shall not be
available to any party whose failure to perform any of its obligations under
this Agreement resulted in the failure of the Offer to be so consummated by
the Walk-Away Date; or

  

  

(c) by the Company:

  

  

(i) if Merger Sub shall have failed to commence the Offer on or prior to the
date provided therefor in Section 1.1; provided, however, that the Company may
not terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 8.1(c)(i) if the Company
is in material breach of Article I;

  

  

(ii) if concurrently it enters into a definitive Company Acquisition Agreement
providing for a Superior Proposal in accordance with Section 6.3; provided
that (x) prior to or simultaneously therewith the Company shall have paid or
caused to be paid the Termination Fee to Parent in accordance with Section 8.3
(and such termination of this Agreement by the Company shall not take effect
unless and until the Termination Fee has been paid to Parent) and (y) the
Company shall also have complied with all the other requirements of Section
6.3;

  

  

(iii) if Parent or Merger Sub breaches or fails to perform any of its
representations, warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which
breach or failure to perform (A) has had and would reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect and
(B) has not been cured or is not capable of being cured prior to the Walk-Away
Date; or

  

  

(d) by Parent:

  

  

(i) if (A) a Company Adverse Recommendation Change shall have occurred or (B)
the Company Board or any committee thereof shall have failed to publicly
reconfirm the Company Board Recommendation within 10 Business Days after
receipt of a written request from Parent that it do so if such request is made
following (x) the public announcement of any Takeover Proposal, (y) the making
of any Takeover Proposal directly to the Company's shareholders or (z) any
Takeover Proposal becoming otherwise publicly known; or

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

62  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(ii) if the Company breaches or fails to perform any of its representations,
warranties or covenants contained in this Agreement, which breach or failure
to perform (A) would give rise to the failure of the conditions set forth in
clause (c)(ii) of Annex A and (B) has not been cured or is not capable of
being cured prior to the Walk-Away Date.

  

  

SECTION 8.2. Effect of Termination. In the event of the termination of this
Agreement as provided in Section 8.1, written notice thereof shall be given to
the other party or parties, specifying the provision hereof pursuant to which
such termination is made, and this Agreement shall forthwith become null and
void (other than the provisions of the third sentence of Section 1.4(c), the
first sentence of Section 4.19, Section 5.7, the penultimate sentence of
Section 6.6, Sections 6.10, 8.2 and 8.3, and Article IX, all of which shall
survive termination of this Agreement), and there shall be no liability on the
part of Parent, Merger Sub or the Company or their respective directors,
officers and Affiliates, except (i) the Company may have liability as provided
in Section 8.3, and (ii) nothing shall relieve any party from liability for
fraud or any willful and material breach of this Agreement.

  

  

SECTION 8.3. Termination Fee.

  

  

(a) In the event that:

  

  

(i) (A) a Takeover Proposal shall have been made directly to its shareholders
generally, any Person shall have publicly announced an intention (whether or
not conditional or withdrawn) to make a Takeover Proposal or a Takeover
Proposal otherwise becomes publicly known and thereafter, (B) this Agreement
is terminated by the Company or Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(b)(ii) or
Section 8.1(b)(iii) because of a failure to satisfy the Minimum Condition and
(C) the Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to, or
consummates, a transaction contemplated by any Takeover Proposal within twelve
(12) months of the date this Agreement is terminated;

  

  

(ii) this Agreement is terminated by Parent pursuant to Section 8.1(d)(i); or

  

  

(iii) this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section
8.1(c)(ii);

  

  

(iv) then in any such event under clause (i), (ii) or (iii) of this Section
8.3(a), the Company shall pay to Parent a termination fee of $40,000,000 in
cash (the "Termination Fee").

  

  

For purposes of Section 8.3(a)(i), the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the
meaning set forth in the definition of Takeover Proposal contained in Section
6.3(d) except that all references to 15% shall be deemed references to 50%.

  

  

(b) Any payment required to be made pursuant to clause (i) of Section 8.3(a)
shall be made to Parent within three Business Days following the earlier of
the execution of a definitive agreement with respect to, or the consummation
of, any transaction contemplated by a Takeover Proposal; any payment required
to be made pursuant to clause (ii) of Section 8.3(a) shall be made to Parent
promptly following termination of this Agreement by Parent pursuant to Section
8.1(d)(i) (and in any event not later than two Business Days after delivery to
the Company of notice of demand for payment following such termination); any
payment required to be made pursuant to clause (iii) of Section 8.3(a) shall
be made to Parent prior to or simultaneously with (and as a condition to the
effectiveness of) termination of this Agreement by the Company pursuant to
Section 8.1(c)(ii). All such payments shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account to be designated by Parent.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

63  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) The Company acknowledges that the fee and the other provisions of this
Section 8.3 are an integral part of the Transactions and that, without these
agreements, Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, in the
event that the Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee required pursuant
to this Section 8.3 when due, such fee shall accrue interest for the period
commencing on the date such fee became past due, at a rate equal to the rate
of interest publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York from time
to time during such period, as such bank's Prime Lending Rate plus 2.00%. In
addition, if the Company shall fail to pay such fee when due, the Company
shall also pay to Parent all of Parent's costs and expenses (including
attorneys' fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee. The Company
acknowledges and agrees that in the event of a breach of this Agreement, the
payment of the Termination Fee shall not constitute the exclusive remedy
available to Parent.

SECTION 9.3. Extension of Time, Waiver, Etc. At any time prior to the
Effective Time, any party may, subject to applicable Law, (a) waive any
inaccuracies in the representations and warranties of any other party hereto,
(b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or acts of
any other party hereto or (c) waive compliance by the other party with any of
the agreements contained herein or, except as otherwise provided herein, waive
any of such party's conditions; provided that in the case of the Company
following the Acceptance Time, the Independent Director Approval contemplated
by Section 1.5 is obtained. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no failure or delay
by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder shall
operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise thereof
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

  

  

SECTION 9.4. Assignment. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior written
consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may assign, in its sole
discretion, any of or all its rights, interests and obligations under this
Agreement to any wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment
shall relieve Merger Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the
preceding sentence, this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit
of, and be enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors
and permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this
Section 9.4 shall be null and void.

  

  

SECTION 9.5. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts
(each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties.

  

  

SECTION 9.6. Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement,
together with Annex A hereto, the Company Disclosure Letter and the
Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and understandings, both written and oral, among
the parties, or any of them, with respect to the subject matter hereof and
thereof and (b) except for the provisions of Section 6.8, are not intended to
and shall not confer upon any Person other than the parties hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder. Notwithstanding clause (b) of the immediately preceding
sentence, following the Effective Time the provisions of Article III shall be
enforceable by holders of Certificates and holders of book-entry shares and
the provisions of Section 3.3 shall be enforceable by holders of Options,
Restricted Stock Unit Awards, Performance Unit Awards and Phantom Share
Awards.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

65  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

SECTION 9.7. Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial.

  

  

(a) This Agreement shall be governed by, and construed in accordance with, the
Laws of the Commonwealth of Virginia, without regard to the conflicts of law
rules of such state.

  

  

(b) Each party agrees that any dispute or disagreement between or among any of
the parties as to the interpretations of any provision of, or the performance
of obligations under, this Agreement shall be commenced and prosecuted in its
entirety solely in the United States District Court for the Eastern District
of Virginia and any reviewing appellate court thereof. If the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, or any reviewing
appellate court thereof, finds that it does not have jurisdiction over the
dispute or disagreement, then and only then can the parties proceed in state
court and the parties hereby agree that any such dispute will only be brought
in state court in Richmond, Virginia. Each party consents to personal and
subject matter jurisdiction and venue in such Virginia federal or state courts
(as the case may be) and waives and relinquishes all right to attack the
suitability or convenience of such venue or forum by reasons of their present
or future domiciles, or for any other reason. The parties acknowledge that all
directions issued by the forum court, including all injunctions and other
decrees, will be binding and enforceable in all jurisdictions and countries.
Process in any such suit, action or proceeding may be served on any party
anywhere in the world, whether within or without the jurisdiction of any such
court. Parent hereby irrevocably designates CT Corporation System (in such
capacity, the "Process Agent"), with an office at 4701 Cox Road, Suite 301,
Glen Allen, Virginia, as its designee, appointee and agent to receive, for and
on its behalf, service of process in such jurisdiction in any action, suit or
other proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
Transactions, and such service shall be deemed effective and complete upon
delivery thereof to the Process Agent. Without limiting the foregoing, each
party agrees that service of process on such party as provided in Section 9.9
shall be deemed effective service of process on such party. The parties hereto
agree that a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be
conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment
or in any other manner provided by applicable Law; provided, however, that
nothing in the foregoing shall restrict any party's rights to seek any post-
judgment relief regarding, or any appeal from, a final trial court judgment.

  

  

(c) EACH OF THE PARTIES HERETO HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ANY AND ALL RIGHT TO
TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THIS
AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.

  

  

SECTION 9.8. Specific Enforcement. The parties agree that irreparable damage
would occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
including if the parties hereto fail to take any action required of them
hereunder to consummate this Agreement, and that monetary damages, even if
available, would not be an adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed
that the parties shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and
provisions of this Agreement in any court specified in Section 9.7(b), without
proof of damages or bond or other security being required, this being in
addition to any other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity.
The right to specific enforcement shall include the right of the Company to
cause Parent and Merger Sub to cause the Transactions to be consummated on the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, the right of the Company to cause Parent and
Merger Sub to obtain the financing in accordance with Section 6.4(e). The
parties further agree not to assert that a remedy of specific enforcement is
unenforceable, invalid, contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, nor to
assert that a remedy of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy or
that the parties otherwise have an adequate remedy at law. Each of the parties
acknowledges and agrees that the right of specific enforcement is an integral
part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and without such
right, none of the parties would have entered into this Agreement.

Notwithstanding any other term of the Offer or the Merger Agreement, Merger

PLAN OF MERGER

  

  

merging

  

  

LG ACQUISITION CORP.,

  

a Virginia corporation

  

  

with and into

  

  

ARCH CHEMICALS, INC., 
 a Virginia corporation

  

  

1. Merger. LG ACQUISITION CORP., a Virginia corporation (the "Merged Corporation") and a wholly owned subsidiary of LONZA GROUP LTD., a company organized under the laws of Switzerland ("Parent"), shall, upon the effective time and date set forth in the Articles of Merger (the "Articles of Merger") to be filed with the State Corporation Commission (the "SCC") of the Commonwealth of Virginia (such time being referred to herein as the "Effective Time"), be merged (the "Merger") with and into ARCH CHEMICALS, INC., a Virginia corporation (the "Company"). As a result of the Merger, the separate corporate existence of the Merged Corporation shall cease and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation following the Merger (the "Surviving Corporation"). The corporate existence of the Company, with all its rights, privileges, immunities, powers and franchises, shall continue unaffected and unimpaired by the Merger.

  

  

2. Effects of the Merger. At the Effective Time, the Merger shall have the effects set forth in Section 13.1-721 of the Virginia Stock Corporation Act (the "VSCA"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the properties, rights, privileges, powers and franchises of the Company and the Merged Corporation shall vest in the Surviving Corporation, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and the Merged Corporation shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

3. Articles of Incorporation. At the Effective Time, the articles of incorporation of the Company shall be amended and restated as set forth on Schedule A attached hereto, so that they shall be identical to the articles of incorporation of the Merged Corporation as in effect as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Arch Chemicals, Inc."), and shall be the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable law.

  

  

4. Bylaws. At the Effective Time, the bylaws of the Company shall be amended and restated so that they shall be identical to the bylaws of the Merged Corporation as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time (except that the name of the Surviving Corporation shall be "Arch Chemicals, Inc."), and shall be the bylaws of the Surviving Corporation, until thereafter amended as provided therein, by the articles of incorporation of the Surviving Corporation or by applicable law.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

   

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

5. Board of Directors. The directors of the Merged Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the directors of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

6. Officers. The officers of Merged Corporation immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Corporation until their respective successors are duly appointed or their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the articles of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

7. Manner and Basis of Converting Shares of Company Common Stock. At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the Merged Corporation, the Company or the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or of any shares of capital stock of the Merged Corporation:

  

  

(a) Capital Stock of the Merged Corporation. Each issued and outstanding share
of capital stock of the Merged Corporation shall be converted into and become
one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par
value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation.

  

  

(b) Cancellation of Subsidiary-Owned and Parent-Owned Stock. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned by any of the Company's Subsidiaries or by
Parent, the Merged Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries shall
be automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall
be delivered in exchange therefor.

  

  

(c) Conversion of Company Common Stock. Each issued and outstanding share of
Company Common Stock (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
Section 7(b)), including, for the avoidance of doubt, any shares of Company
Common Stock held by a Company Plan or a trust that relates to obligations
pursuant to a Company Plan, shall be converted into the right to receive an
amount of cash equal to $47.20 net to the seller in cash (the "Offer Price"),
without interest (the "Merger Consideration"). As of the Effective Time, all
such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a
certificate (or evidence of shares in book-entry form) which immediately prior
to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock
(each, a "Certificate") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto,
except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to be paid in
consideration therefor upon surrender of such Certificate in accordance with
this Plan of Merger, without interest.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

2  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

8. Adjustments. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan of Merger to the contrary, if between the date of this Plan of Merger and the Effective Time the outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number of shares or a different class by reason of the occurrence or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be appropriately adjusted to reflect such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification, recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar transaction.

  

  

9. Appraisal Rights. In accordance with Section 13.1-730 of the VSCA, no appraisal rights shall be available to the holders of Company Common Stock in connection with the Merger.

  

  

10. Exchange of Certificates.

  

  

(a) Paying Agent. Prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall designate a bank
or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent
for the holders of shares of Company Common Stock in connection with the
Merger (the "Paying Agent") to receive, for the benefit of holders of shares
of Company Common Stock, the aggregate Merger Consideration to which holders
of shares of Company Common Stock shall become entitled pursuant to the Merger
and this Plan of Merger. Parent shall deposit such aggregate Merger
Consideration in cash with the Paying Agent at or prior to the Effective Time.
Such aggregate Merger Consideration deposited with the Paying Agent shall,
pending its disbursement to such holders, be invested by the Paying Agent as
directed by Parent. Any net profit resulting from, or interest or income
produced by, such amounts on deposit with the Paying Agent will be payable to
Parent or as Parent otherwise directs. In no event, however, shall the
investment of funds deposited with the Paying Agent, including any payment of
interest or income, delay the receipt by former holders of Company Common
Stock of the Merger Consideration or otherwise impair such holders' rights
hereunder. Parent shall or shall cause the Surviving Corporation to promptly
replace or restore the cash deposited with the Paying Agent so as to ensure
that the Paying Agent has sufficient funds on deposit at all times to make all
payments of Merger Consideration in accordance with this Plan of Merger. No
investment losses resulting from investment of the funds deposited with the
Paying Agent shall diminish the rights of any holder of Company Common Stock
to receive the Merger Consideration as provided herein.

  

  

(b) Payment Procedures. As promptly as practicable (but in no event more than
three (3) Business Days) after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate
(i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon
delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent, and which shall be in such
form and shall have such other provisions (including customary provisions with
respect to delivery of an "agent's message" with respect to shares held in
book-entry form) as the Company and Parent may reasonably agree prior to the
Acceptance Time) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
the Certificates in exchange for payment of the Merger Consideration. Upon
surrender of a Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance
with the instructions (and such other customary documents as may reasonably be
required by the Paying Agent), the holder of such Certificate shall be
entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration, without
interest, for each share of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such
Certificate, and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled.
If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered, it shall
be a condition of payment that (x) the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or shall otherwise be in proper form for transfer and (y)
the Person requesting such payment shall have paid any transfer and other
Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a
Person other than the registered holder of such Certificate surrendered or
shall have established to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Tax either has been paid or is not applicable. Until
surrendered as contemplated by this Section 10, each Certificate shall be
deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to
receive the Merger Consideration as contemplated by this Plan of Merger,
without interest.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

3  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(c) Transfer Books; No Further Ownership Rights in Company Stock. The Merger
Consideration paid in respect of shares of Company Common Stock upon the
surrender for exchange of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this
Plan of Merger shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all
rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock previously represented
by such Certificates, subject, however, to the Surviving Corporation's
obligation to pay any dividends or make any other distributions with a record
date prior to the Effective Time that may have been declared or made by the
Company on such shares of Company Common Stock not in violation of the terms
of this Plan of Merger or prior to the date of this Plan of Merger and which
remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed and thereafter there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. From and after the Effective Time,
the holders of Certificates that evidenced ownership of shares of Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease
to have any rights with respect to such shares of Company Common Stock, except
as otherwise provided for herein, in this Plan of Merger or by applicable Law.
Subject to the last sentence of Section 10(e), if, at any time after the
Effective Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent for any reason, they shall be canceled and exchanged as provided
in this Plan of Merger.

  

  

(d) Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. If any Certificate shall have been
lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the
Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if
required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such Person of a bond,
in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any claim
that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent
will pay, in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate, the
applicable Merger Consideration to be paid in respect of the shares of Company
Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificate, as contemplated by this
Plan of Merger.

  

  

  

 

 

 

  

 

4  

  

 

 

 

  

  

  

(e) Termination of Fund. At any time following twelve months after the Closing
Date, the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to require the Paying Agent
to deliver to it any funds (including any interest received with respect
thereto) that had been made available to the Paying Agent and which have not
been disbursed to holders of Certificates, and thereafter such holders shall
be entitled to look only to the Surviving Corporation (subject to abandoned
property, escheat or other similar Laws) as general creditors thereof with
respect to the payment of any Merger Consideration that may be payable upon
surrender of any Certificates held by such holders, as determined pursuant to
this Plan of Merger, without any interest thereon. Any amounts remaining
unclaimed by such holders at such time at which such amounts would otherwise
escheat to or become property of any Governmental Authority shall become, to
the extent permitted by applicable Law, the property of Parent, free and clear
of all claims or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

  

(f) No Liability. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan of Merger to the
contrary, none of the parties hereto, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent shall be liable to any Person for Merger Consideration delivered to a
public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law.

  

  

(g) Withholding Taxes. Each of Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the
Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable to a holder of shares of Company Common Stock
pursuant to this Plan of Merger such amounts as may be required to be deducted
and withheld with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder, or under any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the
extent amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing
authority, the withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Plan
of Merger as having been paid to the Person in respect of which such deduction
and withholding was made.

  

  

11. Amendment and Termination. At any time prior to the Effective Time, this Plan of Merger may be amended, whether before or after approval of any of the transactions contemplated hereby by the shareholders of the Company, by written agreement of the Company, the Merged Corporation and Parent, by action taken by their respective Boards of Directors; provided, however, that following approval of the Merger by the shareholders of the Company, if required, there shall be no amendment or change to the provisions hereof which by Law would require further approval by the shareholders of the Company without such approval.
