1.07Post-Closing Adjustment.

 

(a)No later than ninety (90) days following the Closing, Purchaser shall
deliver to Seller (i) a consolidated balance sheet of the Nutrition Entities
as of 11:59 p.m. Nashville, Tennessee time on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date (the "Closing Balance Sheet"), prepared in accordance with the
Accounting Principles, and (ii) a written statement (the "Closing Statement"),
together with all reasonable supporting calculations, and any supporting
information reasonably requested by Seller, setting forth the Cash Amount, the
Indebtedness Amount, and the Net Working Capital Amount, in each case, as of
11:59 p.m. Nashville, Tennessee time on the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date and calculated in accordance with this Agreement.

   

(b)No later than thirty (30) days following delivery by Purchaser of the
Closing Statement, Seller shall notify Purchaser in writing whether it accepts
or disputes the accuracy of the Closing Statement. If Seller accepts the
Closing Statement or fails to notify Purchaser of any dispute with respect
thereto, then the calculation of the Cash Amount, the Indebtedness Amount, and
the Net Working Capital Amount shall be deemed final and conclusive and
binding upon all Parties in all respects. If Seller disputes the accuracy of
the Closing Statement or any component thereof, Seller shall provide written
notice to Purchaser no later than thirty (30) days following the delivery by
Purchaser to Seller of the Closing Statement (the "Dispute Notice"), setting
forth in reasonable detail those items that Seller disputes. During the thirty
(30) day period following delivery of a Dispute Notice, the Parties shall
negotiate in good faith with a view to resolving their disagreements. If the
Parties fail to resolve their differences over the disputed items within such
thirty (30) day period, then Purchaser and Seller shall forthwith jointly
refer those items in the Dispute Notice that remain in dispute to the
Accounting Arbitrator and require that the Accounting Arbitrator render its
written decision with respect to the disputed items no later than the later of
(x) thirty (30) days from the date of referral and (y) ten (10) Business Days
from the final submission of information by Purchaser and Seller. In resolving
any item that remains in dispute, the Parties shall require that the
Accounting Arbitrator not assign a value to any such item greater than the
maximum value or less than the minimum value for each such item claimed by
Seller in the Dispute Notice or by Purchaser in the Closing Statement, as
applicable. Absent manifest error, the decision of the Accounting Arbitrator
shall be deemed final and binding upon the Parties, and judgment may be
entered upon determination of the Accounting Arbitrator in any court having
jurisdiction over the party against which such determination is to be
enforced. The Accounting Arbitrator shall allocate its fees and expenses of
the arbitration between Seller and Purchaser with each Party bearing the
proportion of the expenses calculated as the amount, if any, awarded to the
other Party by the Accounting Arbitrator divided by the aggregate contested
amount. For example, should the aggregate contested amount be $1,000 and the

company duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws
of the State of Delaware and has the requisite corporate or limited liability
company power and authority, as applicable, to own, lease and operate all of

the jurisdiction of its formation/organization, as applicable, and has the
requisite limited liability company power and authority to own, lease and
operate all of its properties and assets and to carry on its business as it is
now being conducted, except where the failure to be in good standing would not
be material to the Nutrition Entities taken as a whole. Each of Seller and
each Nutrition Entity is duly licensed, qualified or otherwise authorized to
do business, and, to the extent such concept is applicable, is in good
standing, as a foreign corporation or limited liability company, as
applicable, in each jurisdiction where the nature of the business conducted by
it or the character or location of the properties and assets owned, leased or
operated by it makes such licensing or qualification necessary, except where
the failure to be so licensed, qualified or in good standing would not,
individually or in the aggregate, have a Business Material Adverse Effect.

   

(b)Annex 1 of this Agreement lists all of the Subsidiaries of Nutrition Topco,
including the name and jurisdiction of formation/organization for each. The
Nutrition Subsidiaries do not have any Subsidiaries and do not own, directly
or indirectly, any capital stock or any membership, ownership, equity,

security, option, warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, derivative
contract, forward sale contract or undertaking, or obligating any Nutrition
Entity to make any payment based on or resulting from the value or price of
any equity security of any Nutrition Entity or of any such security, option,
warrant, call, right, commitment, agreement, derivative contract, forward sale

Securities").

 

(c)No Nutrition Entity has any outstanding contractual obligation (contingent
or otherwise) to repurchase, redeem or otherwise acquire any equity interests
or Equity Securities of any Nutrition Entity, to make any payments based on
the market price or value of Equity Securities, or to provide funds to make
any investment (in the form of a loan, capital contribution or otherwise) in

state securities Laws, and the Nutrition Stock was not issued in violation or

subject (including, without limitation, Nutrition Topco's Organizational
Documents) or in violation of any preemptive or similar rights.

 

(e)There are no outstanding bonds, debentures, notes, Indebtedness or other
obligations of any Nutrition Entity, the holders of which have the right to
vote (or convertible into, or exchangeable for, securities having the right to
vote) on any matters on which the equityholders of any Nutrition Entity may
vote.

 

(f)Nutrition Topco owns directly all of the equity interests of each of the
Nutrition Subsidiaries, free and clear of all Liens (except for Liens pursuant

Nutrition Entities taken as a whole.

 

2.05Governmental Approvals; Consents

 

. Other than (i) in connection with or in compliance with the Hart-Scott-
Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the rules and

2.06Financial Statements.

 

(a)Section 2.06(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth true, correct
and complete copies of (i) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Business as of August 31, 2020 (the "Latest Balance Sheet" and such date, the
"Latest Balance Sheet Date"), and the related unaudited consolidated statement
of operations for the eight-month period ended August 31, 2020 and the
unaudited consolidated statement of cash flows for the six-month period ended
June 30, 2020, and (ii) the unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the
Business as of December 31, 2019 and the related unaudited consolidated
statements of operations and cash flows for the period between March 8, 2019
and December 31, 2019 (all such financial statements in this clause (ii), the
"Annual Financial Statements" and, collectively with the financial statements
in (i), the "Financial Statements"). The Financial Statements have been
prepared based upon the information contained in the respective books and
records of the Nutrition Entities and have been prepared in accordance with
GAAP applied on a consistent basis and fairly present, in all material
respects, the consolidated financial position of the Business as at the
respective dates thereof and the

   

consolidated results of operations of the Business for the respective periods
covered thereby, except for allocations of certain corporate overhead expenses
and other items that would have been reflected in stand-alone financial
statements, and subject, in the case of interim statements, to normal year-end
adjustments.

 

(b) The respective books, records and accounts of the Nutrition Entities
accurately and fairly reflect, in all material respects and in reasonable
detail, the transactions in and dispositions of the assets of the Nutrition
Entities, as applicable. During the periods covered by the Financial
Statements, the respective accounting controls of the Nutrition Entities, as
applicable, have been, and are, sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
that (i) all transactions are executed in accordance with management's general
or specific authorization, and (ii) all transactions are recorded as necessary
to permit to accurate and complete preparation of financial statements in
accordance with GAAP, consistently applied, and to maintain proper
accountability for items. To the Knowledge of Seller, there is not, and in the
past five (5) years there has not been, any fraud, whether or not material,
that involves or involved Nutrition Topco's or any of the Nutrition
Subsidiaries' management or other employees who have or had a significant role
in Nutrition Topco's or any of the Nutrition Subsidiaries', as applicable,
internal controls over financial reporting. No significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses in the design or operation of Seller's (with respect to
the Business), Nutrition Topco's or any of the Nutrition Subsidiaries' systems
of internal controls over financial reporting were identified in the Nutrition
Entities' most recent assessment that would be reasonably likely to materially
affect their respective abilities to record, prove, summarize and report
financial information.

. Except as set forth in Section 2.07 of the Seller Disclosure Letter, there
are no liabilities or obligations of the Business of any nature, whether
accrued, contingent, absolute or otherwise, in each case, that would be
required by GAAP to be reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the
Business other than: (a) liabilities or obligations reflected or reserved
against in the applicable Financial Statements, (b) liabilities or obligations
that were incurred since the Latest Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course
of business (none of which is a liability arising from a breach of contract,
breach of warranty, tort, infringement or misappropriation), (c) Transaction
Expenses, (d) liabilities or obligations arising under executory Contracts to
which Seller or any Nutrition Entity is a party and incurred in the ordinary
course of business (other than to the extent arising from a breach of such
Contracts by Seller or any Nutrition Entity), and (e) other liabilities or
obligations that are not, and would not reasonably be expected to be,
individually or in the aggregate, material in amount.

the Business, taken as a whole, (c) neither Seller (with respect to the
Business) nor any Nutrition Entity has taken any action or omitted to take any
action which if taken or omitted to be taken after the date hereof would
constitute a violation of Section 4.01(a) or Section 4.01(b) (except with
respect to Section 4.01(b)(v)(5) and Section 4.01(b)(xiv)), and (d) neither
Seller nor any of its Subsidiaries (with respect to the Business) has: (i)

past practice; or (ii) (x) waived released or assigned any of its material
rights, claims or benefits with respect to any Nutrition Material Contract or

Entities (as applicable) have all material governmental licenses, permits,

review by any Governmental Authority with respect to the Business or any of
the Nutrition Entities is pending or, to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened,

in each case, which has not been resolved. To the Knowledge of Seller, no
material change is required in any of Seller's (as it relates to the Business)

Nutrition Entities has received any notice or communication of any material
non-compliance with any such Permits.

Trade Law, except in each case as would not be material to the Nutrition
Entities taken as a whole. There are no pending internal or governmental
investigations, inquiries or proceedings regarding any offense or alleged
offense under any International Trade Laws, and to the Knowledge of Seller,
there are no circumstances that would reasonably be expected to give rise to
any such investigation, inquiry or proceeding. Within the last five (5) years,
the Nutrition Entities and each of their respective directors and officers,
and to the Knowledge of Seller, employees, consultants, sales representatives,
distributors, agents and business partners, in each case in such capacity and
on behalf of the

   

Nutrition Entities, have complied at all times, and are in compliance, with
all applicable U.S. and non-U.S. anti-corruption and anti-bribery Laws with
respect to the Nutrition Entities, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt

Transactions, or to which Seller (with respect to the Business) or any
Nutrition Entity is a party, at Law or in equity, by or before any

2.12Employee Benefit Plans and Related Matters; ERISA.

 

(a)Section 2.12(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter sets forth as of the date
of this Agreement a list of Nutrition Benefit Plans, including all Nutrition
Benefit Plans subject to the

   

Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"). With
respect to each Nutrition Benefit Plan, Seller has made available to the
Purchaser Group a true and complete copy of such written Nutrition Benefit
Plan or, if no written plan document exists, a summary of the terms of such
Nutrition Benefit Plan, and, to the extent applicable, (i) all trust
agreements, insurance contracts or other funding arrangements, (ii) the most
recent actuarial and trust reports for both ERISA funding and financial
statement purposes, (iii) the most recent Form 5500 with all attachments filed
with the IRS or the Department of Labor, (iv) the most recent IRS
determination letter (or opinion or advisory letter upon which Seller is
entitled to rely), (v) all current summary plan descriptions, and (vi) all
material written communications with any Governmental Authority with respect
to any Nutrition Benefit Plans. "Nutrition Benefit Plans" means each employee
benefit plan, scheme, program, policy, arrangement and contract (including any
"employee benefit plan," as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, and any bonus,
commission, vacation, pension, profit sharing, retirement, health and welfare,
fringe benefit, deferred compensation, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted
stock, stock option, phantom equity, or other equity-based arrangement, and
any employment, termination, retention, bonus, change in control or severance
agreement, plan, program, policy, arrangement or contract) under which (i) any
Business Employee has any present or future right to benefits, (ii) that is
maintained, sponsored or contributed to by any Nutrition Entity, or which
(iii) any Nutrition Entity has any obligation to maintain, sponsor or
contribute to, or under which any Nutrition Entity may have any actual or
contingent liability.

 

(b)Each Nutrition Benefit Plan has been administered and operated in
accordance with its terms and with applicable Law, in all material respects,
including ERISA and the Code. All benefits, contributions and premiums
required by and due under the terms of each Nutrition Benefit Plan or
applicable Law have been timely paid in accordance with the terms of such
Nutrition Benefit Plan and the terms of all applicable Laws. With respect to
any Nutrition Benefit Plan, no event has occurred or is reasonably expected to
occur that has resulted in or would subject any Nutrition Entity to a Tax
under Section 4971 of the Code or the assets of the Nutrition Entities to a
lien under Section 430(k) of the Code. Each Nutrition Benefit Plan that is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination letter from the IRS, or with respect to a prototype
plan, can rely on an opinion or advisory letter from the IRS to the prototype
plan sponsor, to the effect that such Nutrition Benefit Plan is so qualified
and that the plan and trust related thereto are exempt from federal income
Taxes under Section 401(a) and Section 501(a), respectively, of the Code.
Nothing has occurred that could reasonably be expected to cause the revocation
of such determination letter or reliance on such opinion or advisory letter.

 

(c)No liability under Title IV or Section 302 of ERISA has been incurred by
Seller or any ERISA Affiliate that has not been satisfied in full, and to the
Knowledge of Seller, no condition exists that presents a risk or reasonably
could present a risk to any Nutrition Entity of incurring any such liability.
As used in this Agreement, "ERISA Affiliate" of any entity means any other
entity that, together with such entity, would be treated as a single employer
under Section 4001(b) of ERISA with regard to a Nutrition Entity.

 

(d)There are no pending, or to the Knowledge of Seller, threatened actions or
claims with respect to any of the Nutrition Benefit Plans by any current or
former Business Employee or otherwise involving any such plan or the assets of
any such plan (other than routine claims for benefits), and there are no
audits or investigations pending, or to the Knowledge of

   

Seller, threatened audits or investigations by any Governmental Authority with
respect to any Nutrition Benefit Plans.

 

(e)No Nutrition Benefit Plan is (i) a "multiemployer plan" within the meaning
of Section 4001(a)(3) of ERISA and Section 3(37) of ERISA, (ii) a "multiple
employer plan" within the meaning of Sections 4063 or 4064 of ERISA or Section
413(c) of the Code, (iii) a single employer defined benefit pension plan
subject to Title IV of ERISA, or (iv) a "multiple employer welfare
arrangement" within the meaning of Section 3(40) of ERISA. Except as set forth
on Section 2.12(e) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, neither Seller nor any
Nutrition Entity, nor any of their respective ERISA Affiliates, has at any
time during the last five (5) years contributed to or been obligated to
contribute to any such type of plan. Other than as required under Section
4980B of the Code or other applicable Law, no Nutrition Benefit Plan provides
benefits or coverage in the nature of health, life or disability insurance
following retirement (other than death benefits when termination occurs upon
death) to any current or former Business Employee.

 

(f)Except as set forth on Section 2.12(f) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the
consummation of the Transactions will not (i) entitle any Business Employee to
severance pay, compensation, or any benefits under any Nutrition Benefit Plan,
or (ii) result in any payment becoming due, accelerate the time of payment or
vesting, or increase the amount of compensation due to any such Business
Employee. Excluding the effect of any plan, program, agreement, or arrangement
(whether or not written) between any Business Employee and any member of the
Purchaser Group that is entered into (or treated as entered into) after the
date of this Agreement (other than any such arrangement if, and only to the
extent, the arrangement replaces other such arrangements that are in effect
between such Business Employee and any member of the Seller Affiliated Group
as of the date of this Agreement), neither the execution of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will result in
"excess parachute payments" within the meaning of Section 280G(b) of the Code
(determined without regard to the exceptions provided in Section 280G(b)(5) of
the Code). No Nutrition Entity or Business Employee is a party to any plan,
program, agreements, or arrangement that provides for the gross-up or
reimbursement of any employment or income Taxes, including Taxes imposed under
Section 4999 or Section 409A of the Code.

 

(g)As applicable, each Nutrition Benefit Plan has been maintained and operated
in documentary and operational compliance with Section 409A of the Code or an
available exemption thereto, and no Nutrition Benefit Plan will result in any
participant incurring income acceleration or Taxes under Section 409A of the
Code.

 

(h)Except as set forth in Section 2.12(h) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, the
Nutrition Entities have not made and, with respect to the Business, Seller has
not made, and there are no facts that would give rise to, any changes to the
Nutrition Benefit Plans resulting from disruptions caused by the COVID-19
pandemic, nor are any such changes currently contemplated.

Letter, dated as of the date hereof (the "Preferred Equity Commitment
Letter"), by and between Purchaser and MSD Partners, L.P., as the initial
purchaser party thereto (together with the purchasers who may become party
thereto, the "Preferred Equity Investor"), pursuant to which the Preferred
Equity Investor agrees to purchase, subject to the terms and conditions
therein, preferred and common equity securities of Parent (or its Affiliate)
(the "Preferred Equity Securities") in an aggregate initial liquidation
preference amount and purchase price set forth therein for the purpose

   

of providing such preferred and common equity financing (the "Preferred Equity
Financing") to Parent (or its Affiliate) in connection with the Transactions,
and (iii) the executed Debt Commitment Letter, dated as of the date hereof
(collectively, the "Debt Commitment Letter"), by and between Purchaser and the
Cooperatieve Rabobank U.A., New York Branch (together with any other debt
financing source, as applicable, under any New Commitment Letter, the "Debt
Financing Source," and collectively with the Equity Financing Source and the
Preferred Equity Investor, the "Financing Sources"), pursuant to which the
Debt Financing Source has committed to provide debt financing (the "Debt
Financing") to Purchaser in connection with the Transactions, together with
the executed fee letter (the "Fee Letter") associated therewith (with
customary redactions of fee amounts, price caps, market flex terms, and other
commercially sensitive economic terms set forth therein, none of which
redacted provisions contain any terms that could adversely affect the
aggregate principal amount, conditionality, enforceability, availability or
termination of the Debt Financing). The Equity Commitment Letter, together
with the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter,
are sometimes referred to collectively herein as the "Commitment Letters," and
the amounts committed pursuant to the Commitment Letters or any alternative
financing as the "Financing." Each of the Commitment Letters is in full force
and effect as of the date of this Agreement and sets forth the legal, valid
and binding obligations of, on the one hand, Parent, Purchaser and their
Affiliates, as applicable, and, on the other hand, to the Knowledge of Parent,
the other parties thereto, and is enforceable in accordance with its terms
against each of the parties thereto, subject, in each case, to the Bankruptcy
and Equity Exception.

 

(b)(i) The Commitment Letters and the terms of the Financing as reflected
therein have not been amended or modified as of the date hereof, (ii) as of
the date hereof, no such amendment or modification is contemplated and (iii)
the respective commitments contained therein have not been withdrawn,
terminated or rescinded in any respect as of the date hereof.

 

(c)There are no other Contracts, agreements, side letters or arrangements to
which either Parent, Purchaser or any of their respective Affiliates is a
party relating to the funding or investing, as applicable, of the full amount
of the Financing that could affect the availability or funded amount of the
Financing, other than as expressly set forth in the Commitment Letters and the
Fee Letters. Other than as set forth in the Commitment Letters, there are no
conditions precedent related to the funding or investing, as applicable, of
the full amount of the Financing. Purchaser has fully paid all commitment fees
required in connection with the Debt Commitment Letter that are payable on or
prior to the date hereof.

 

(d)Assuming the conditions set forth in Section 5.01 and Section 5.03 are
satisfied, the Financing, when funded in accordance with the Commitment
Letters, will be, in the aggregate, sufficient to (i) make the payment of all
amounts payable by Purchaser pursuant to ARTICLE I in connection with or as a
result of the Transactions on the Closing Date and (ii) pay all fees and
expenses required to be paid at the Closing by Purchaser in connection with
the Transactions and the Financing.

 

(e)As of the date hereof, no event has occurred that, with or without notice,
lapse of time or both, would constitute or reasonably be expected to
constitute a breach or default by Parent or Purchaser or any of their
Affiliates or, to the Knowledge of Parent, any other Person, thereunder or
otherwise result in any portion of the Financing to be unavailable. Assuming
the

   

conditions set forth in Section 5.01 and Section 5.03 are satisfied, Parent
does not have any reason to believe that any conditions to the Financing will
not be satisfied or that the Financing will not be available to Parent on the
Closing Date.

 

(f)In no event shall the receipt or availability of any funds or financing by
Parent or Purchaser or any other financing or other transactions be a
condition to any of Parent's or Purchaser's obligations hereunder.

 

3.10Guaranty

 



 

. Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Purchaser has delivered
to Seller a true, complete and correct copy of the executed Guaranty. The
Guaranty is valid, binding and enforceable in accordance with its terms
subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception, and is in full force and
effect as of the date of this Agreement, and as of the date of this Agreement,
no event has occurred that, with or without notice, lapse of time, or both,
would reasonably be expected to constitute a default or breach or a failure to
satisfy a condition precedent on the part of the Equity Financing Source under
the terms and conditions of the Guaranty.

 

3.11Solvency

 

. Assuming the accuracy of the representations and warranties of Seller in
this Agreement, after giving effect to the Closing, the payment of all amounts
required to be paid in connection with the consummation of the Transactions
(including payment of all amounts payable under ARTICLE I and the payment of
all related fees and expenses), the Purchaser Group and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (including the Nutrition Entities) shall be Solvent as of the
Closing Date immediately after the consummation of the Transactions. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the term "Solvent" when used with respect to any
Person, means that, as of any date of determination, (a) the amount of the
"fair saleable value" of the assets of such Person shall, as of such date,
exceed (i) the sum of the value of all "liabilities of such Person, including
contingent and other liabilities" as of such date, and the capital of such
Person as computed in accordance with applicable Law as of such date, as such
quoted terms are generally determined in accordance with applicable Law
governing determinations of the insolvency of debtors, and (ii) the amount
that shall be required to pay the probable liabilities of such Person on its
existing debts (including contingent and other liabilities) as such debts
become absolute and mature, (b) such Person shall not have, as of such date,
an unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged after such date, and (c) such
Person shall be able to pay its liabilities, including contingent and other
liabilities, as they mature. For purposes of this definition, "not have an
unreasonably small amount of capital for the operation of the businesses in
which it is engaged or proposed to be engaged" and "able to pay its
liabilities, including contingent and other liabilities, as they mature" mean
that such Person shall be able to generate enough cash from operations, asset
dispositions or refinancings, or a combination thereof, to meet its
obligations as they become due.

4.02No Solicitation by Seller.

 

(a)No Solicitation. Seller shall not, and shall cause each of its Affiliates
and its and their respective Representatives not to, directly or indirectly
(i) solicit, initiate or knowingly encourage, induce or facilitate any
Nutrition Takeover Proposal or any inquiry or proposal that would reasonably
be expected to lead to a Nutrition Takeover Proposal, in each case, except for
this Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and the Transactions, (ii) conduct,
continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or negotiations with any
Person (except for Parent and Parent's Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives in respect of the Transactions) regarding, or furnish or
provide access to any Person, any nonpublic information with respect to any
Nutrition Takeover Proposal or any inquiry, proposal, offer, indication of
interest or request for nonpublic information that would reasonably be
expected to lead to a Nutrition Takeover Proposal (an "Inquiry"), (iii)
approve, endorse, authorize, adopt or recommend or enter into any proposal,
offer or agreement that constitutes, or would be reasonably expected to lead
to, a Nutrition Takeover Proposal or resolve to do any of the foregoing or
(iv) authorize, resolve, propose or commit to take any of the foregoing
actions; provided, however, that Seller, its Affiliates and its and their
respective Representatives shall be permitted, in response to an Inquiry or
written Nutrition Takeover Proposal, to inform any such Person of the terms of
this Section 4.02. Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives to, immediately cease all existing
discussions or negotiations with any Person (except for Parent and Parent's
Affiliates and its and their respective Representatives with respect to the
Transactions) with respect to any actual or potential Nutrition Takeover
Proposal, request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential
information previously furnished or made available and immediately terminate
all physical and electronic data room access previously granted to any such
Person or its Representatives with respect to such Nutrition Takeover
Proposal.

 

(b)Seller Takeover Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, and subject to compliance with the terms of this Section 4.02, at
any time prior to the Closing, in response to the receipt of a written Seller
Takeover Proposal made after the date of this Agreement that the Seller Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside financial
advisor and outside legal counsel) constitutes or would reasonably be expected
to lead to a Superior Seller Proposal and that the failure to take action with
respect thereto would be reasonably likely to result in a breach of the Seller
Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law, Seller and its Representatives
may furnish information with respect to Seller and its Subsidiaries

   

(including the Nutrition Entities) to the Person making such Seller Takeover
Proposal (and such Person's Representatives).

 

(c)Seller Acquisition Agreement. Except as set forth in Section 4.02(b) and
Section 4.02(d), and subject to compliance with this Section 4.02, the Seller
Board shall not authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or propose publicly
to authorize, permit, approve or recommend, or allow the Seller or any of its
Affiliates to execute or enter into, any letter of intent, memorandum of
understanding, agreement in principle, agreement or commitment constituting,
or that would reasonably be expected to lead to, any Seller Takeover Proposal,
or requiring, or that would reasonably be expected to cause, Seller to abandon
or terminate this Agreement (a "Seller Acquisition Agreement").

 

(d)Superior Seller Proposal. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this
Agreement, at any time prior to the Closing, in response to Seller's receipt
of a written Superior Seller Proposal, the Seller Board may authorize and
direct Seller to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.01(c)(i), if
and only if, prior to taking such action, the Seller Board (i) determines in
good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel and outside
financial advisor) that the failure to authorize and direct Seller to so
terminate this Agreement would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
the Seller Board's fiduciary duties under applicable Law; provided, however,
that the Seller Board may not authorize or direct Seller to terminate this
Agreement pursuant to Section 6.01(c)(i) unless the Seller Board has delivered
to Parent prior written notice (a "Termination Notice") that the Seller Board
(A) has concluded in good faith that the applicable Seller Takeover Proposal
constitutes a Superior Seller Proposal and (B) is prepared to authorize and
promptly direct Seller to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section
6.01(c)(i) absent any revisions to this Agreement by which the Purchaser Group
has committed to be bound in writing that would cause such Superior Seller
Proposal to cease to constitute a Superior Seller Proposal, and which
Termination Notice shall (I) include the basis for such action, and (II)
identify the Person making the Superior Seller Proposal.

 

(e)Representatives. Seller agrees that any breach of this Section 4.02 by any
of its Representatives will be deemed to be a breach of this Agreement by
Seller.

Nutrition Entities may withhold from the Purchaser Group or its
Representatives any document or information that (i) Seller believes

privilege (provided that Seller shall use its commercially reasonable best
efforts to allow the disclosure of such document or information (or as much of
it as possible) in a manner that does not result in a loss of attorney-client
privilege) or (iv) relates to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement,
the process that led to the negotiation and execution of this Agreement or any

Affiliates and Representatives not to, prior to the Closing, use any
information obtained pursuant to this Section 4.03 for any competitive or
other purpose unrelated to the Transactions except as permitted by the
Confidentiality Agreement.

 

(c)All documents and information exchanged pursuant to this Section 4.03 shall
be subject to the agreement, dated as of July 2, 2020, between Seller and
Kainos (TX) Capital LP (the "Confidentiality Agreement"), as if the Purchaser
Group were subject to the obligations of Kainos (TX) Capital LP under the
Confidentiality Agreement. The Parties agree that notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the Confidentiality Agreement, the Confidentiality Agreement
will terminate at the Closing with respect to information regarding the
Business or the Nutrition Entities. 

 

(d)No rights under this Section 4.03 can be exercised by Parent or any of its
Representatives to prepare for, or otherwise in connection with, any
Proceeding against Seller relating to this Agreement.

 

4.04Post-Closing Access to Information; Confidentiality

 

.

 

(a)Subject to Section 8.05, for a period of seven (7) years after the Closing,
each of the Parties shall give the other and the other's Affiliates and its
and their Representatives reasonable access to the books and records of the
Seller and Nutrition Entities (to the extent primarily related to the
Business) (collectively, the "Accessible Information") transferred to the
Purchaser Group or retained by Seller, as applicable (even if any Accessible
Information is or becomes commingled with books and records of the Purchaser
Group or Seller and their respective Affiliates), and the properties,
personnel and Representatives of each Party, as may be reasonably required by
the requesting Party or such Party's Affiliates for any reasonable business
purpose, including to the extent necessary for the preparation of financial
statements or regulatory filings

   

in respect of periods ending on or prior to the Closing, or in connection with
any insurance claims, Claims against any Person (apart from the Parties) or
any obligations under this Agreement or any agreement, document or instrument
contemplated hereby or thereby. At the requesting Party's cost and expense,
the requesting Party and its Affiliates and its and their respective
Representatives shall be entitled to make copies of any Accessible Information
to which such Persons are entitled to access pursuant to this Section 4.04.
Any such access shall be conducted during regular business hours upon
reasonable advance notice and under reasonable circumstances and shall be
subject to restrictions under Law and any confidentiality obligations to which
the Parties are bound. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.05, each
Party shall preserve and keep the Accessible Information held by such Party or
any of its Affiliates relating to the Business prior to the Closing for a
period of seven (7) years following the Closing Date. Each Party shall, and
shall cause its Affiliates and Representatives to, (a) keep all confidential
information accessed pursuant to this Section 4.04 confidential, (b) not
publicly disclose such information to any other Person (except where such
disclosure, upon the advice of outside counsel, is required by Law and only to
the extent required by applicable Law); provided that each Party or its
Affiliates may disclose such information to its Representatives or other
Persons that have a duty of confidentiality (or similar duty or obligation of
non-disclosure) to such disclosing Party, and (c) not use such information
other than for the express purposes set forth in this Section 4.04.
Notwithstanding the foregoing and except as otherwise provided in Section
8.05, any and all such Accessible Information may be destroyed by the Parties
after the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date (or such later date as
required by applicable Law).

 

(b)From and after the Closing and for the longest period thereafter permitted
under applicable Law, in respect of all Confidential Information, except as
otherwise provided herein, Seller shall, and shall cause its Affiliates and
each of their respective officers, directors, members and employees to, (i)
treat all Confidential Information as confidential, (ii) preserve the
confidentiality thereof and (iii) not disclose to any Person or use for
Seller's own purposes any Confidential Information. "Confidential Information"
means information regarding the Nutrition Entities or the Business which is
confidential, including the following: (a) information regarding the
Nutrition Entities' business, operations, assets, liabilities or financial
condition, (b) information regarding the Nutrition Entities' pricing, sales,
merchandising, marketing, capital expenditures, costs, joint ventures,
business alliances, purchasing or manufacturing, (c) information regarding the
Nutrition Entities' employees or sales representatives, including their
identities, responsibilities, competence and compensation, (d) customer lists
or other information regarding the Nutrition Entities' current or prospective
customers, including information regarding their identities, contact persons
and purchasing patterns, (e) information regarding the Nutrition Entities'
current or prospective vendors, suppliers, distributors or other business
partners, (f) forecasts, projections, budgets and business plans regarding the
Nutrition Entities, (g) information regarding the Nutrition Entities' planned
or pending acquisitions, divestitures or other business combinations, (h) the
Nutrition Entities' trade secrets and proprietary information, (i) technical
information, patent disclosures and applications, copyright applications,
sketches, drawings, blueprints, models, know-how, discoveries, inventions,
improvements, techniques, processes, business methods, equipment, algorithms,
software programs, software source documents and formulae, in each case
regarding the Nutrition Entities' current, future or proposed products or
services (including information concerning the Nutrition Entities' research,
experimental work, development, design details and specifications, and
engineering), and (j) the Nutrition Entities' website designs, website
content, proposed domain names and databases. As used herein,

   

"Confidential Information" shall not include any information that (i) is or
becomes generally available to or known by the public (other than as a result
of a violation of this Section 4.04(b) by Seller or its Representatives); or
(ii) from and after the Closing becomes available to Seller or its
Representatives on a non-confidential basis from a source other than the
Purchaser Group or its Representatives; provided, that such source is not and
was not bound by a confidentiality agreement with, or other obligation of
secrecy or of a fiduciary nature to, the Purchaser Group of which the Seller
has knowledge. If Seller becomes actually aware that Confidential Information
is disclosed in violation of this Section 4.04(b), Seller shall promptly
notify Purchaser in writing and, as applicable, take all reasonable steps
required to prevent further disclosure. If Seller or its Affiliates or any of
their respective officers, directors, members, employees or Affiliates is
requested or required (by oral questions, interrogatories, requests for
information or documents in legal proceedings, subpoena, civil investigative
demand or other similar process or by operation of law) to disclose any
Confidential Information, Seller shall, or shall cause its Affiliates to, if
legally permissible, provide Purchaser with prompt written notice of such
request or requirement, which notice shall, if practicable, be made at least
48 hours prior to making such disclosure, so that Purchaser may seek (at its
own expense) a protective order or other appropriate remedy and/or waive
compliance with the provisions of this Section 4.04(b). If, in the absence of
a protective order or other remedy or the receipt of such a waiver, Seller or
any of its Affiliates or Representatives, as the case may be, is nonetheless,
in the opinion of Seller's counsel, legally required to disclose Confidential
Information, then such Person may disclose that portion of the Confidential
Information which such counsel advises is legally required to be disclosed,
provided that such Person uses its reasonable best efforts to preserve the
confidentiality of the Confidential Information, whereupon such disclosure
shall not constitute a breach of this Section 4.04(b).

 

4.05Further Actions; Regulatory Approvals; Required Actions.

 

(a)Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, each Party shall use
its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and
do, or cause to be done, and assist and cooperate with the other Parties in

Governmental Authorities that are necessary to consummate the Transactions as
promptly as reasonably practicable. The Purchaser Group shall be responsible
for 100% of the filing fees associated with any Filings or Consents
contemplated by this Section 4.05 with respect to Antitrust Laws. Aside from
the filing fees and except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, all other

Section 4.07.

   

(b)In connection with and without limiting the generality of Section 4.05(a),
each Party shall:

 

(i)file or cause to be filed with the Department of Justice and the Federal
Trade Commission, in consultation and cooperation with the other, as promptly
as practicable after the date of this Agreement and, in any event, no later
than five (5) Business Days after the date of this Agreement, an appropriate
Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act relating to the
Transactions;

 

(ii)furnish to the other all assistance, cooperation and information
reasonably required for any such Filing and in order to achieve the effects

the other reasonable prior notice of any such Filing and, to the extent
reasonably practicable, of any communication with any Governmental Authority
relating to the Transactions (including with respect to any of the actions
referred to in this Section 4.05(b)) and, to the extent reasonably
practicable, permit the other to review and discuss in advance, and consider
in good faith the views of, and secure the participation of, the other in
connection with any such Filing or communication;

 

(iv)respond as promptly as practicable to any inquiries received from any
Governmental Authority or any other authority enforcing applicable Antitrust

authorities not to consummate the Transactions, except with the prior written
consent of the other Party; and

 

(v)unless prohibited by applicable Law or a Governmental Authority, (1) not
participate in or attend any meeting (whether in person or via telephone) with
any Governmental Authority in respect of the Transactions without the other
Party, (2) keep the other Party apprised with respect to any meeting or
substantive conversation with any Governmental Authority in respect of the
Transactions, (3) cooperate in the filing of any substantive memoranda, white
papers, filings, correspondence or other written communications explaining or
defending this Agreement or the Transactions, articulating any regulatory or
competitive argument or responding to requests or objections made by any
Governmental Authority and (4) furnish the other Party with copies of all
substantive correspondence, Filings and communications (and memoranda setting
forth the substance thereof) between it and its Affiliates and their
respective Representatives, on the one hand, and any Governmental Authority or
members of any Governmental Authority's staff, on the other hand, with respect
to this Agreement or the Transactions; provided, however, that the Parties
shall be permitted to redact any correspondence, Filing or communication to
the extent such correspondence, Filing or communication contains commercially
sensitive information.

 

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4.05(b) and Section 4.05(d) shall not
apply with respect to Tax matters.

   

(c)The Purchaser Group shall not, and shall cause its Affiliates not to, take
any action, including acquiring any asset, property, business or Person (by
way of merger, consolidation, share exchange, investment, other business
combination, asset, stock or equity purchase, or otherwise), that would
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse affect on obtaining or
making any Consent or Filing contemplated by this Section 4.05 or the timely
receipt thereof. In furtherance of and without limiting any of the Purchaser
Group's covenants and agreements under this Section 4.05, the Purchaser Group
shall take all actions necessary, proper or advisable to avoid or eliminate
each and every impediment that may be asserted by a Governmental Authority
with respect to the Transactions pursuant to any Antitrust Law, so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible, which actions
(with respect to Antitrust Laws) shall include the following:

 

(i)defending through litigation on the merits, including appeals, any Claim
asserted in any court or other proceeding by any Person, including any
Governmental Authority, that seeks to or could prevent or prohibit or impede,
interfere with or delay the consummation of the Closing;

 

(ii)proposing, negotiating, committing to and effecting, by consent decree,
hold separate order or otherwise, the sale, divestiture, licensing or
disposition of any assets or businesses of the Purchaser Group or its
Affiliates or the Nutrition Entities, including entering into customary
ancillary agreements on commercially reasonable terms relating to any such
sale, divestiture, licensing or disposition;

 

(iii)agreeing to any limitation on the conduct of the Purchaser Group or its
Affiliates (including, after the Closing, the Nutrition Entities); and

 

(iv)agreeing to take any other action as may be required by a Governmental
Authority in order to effect each of the following: (1) obtaining the HSR
Clearance and any other Consent of a Governmental Authority under any
Antitrust Law that is necessary, appropriate or advisable to consummate the
Transactions, (2) avoiding the entry of, or having vacated, lifted, dissolved,
reversed or overturned any Order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent,
that is in effect that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of, or
impedes, interferes with or delays, the Closing and (3) effecting the
expiration or termination of any waiting period, which would otherwise have
the effect of preventing, prohibiting or restricting consummation of the
Closing or impeding, interfering with or delaying the Closing.

 

(d)Each of the Parties shall (i) promptly notify the other Parties prior to
the making or commencement of any request, inquiry, investigation, action or
legal proceeding by or before any Governmental Authority with respect to the
Transactions, (ii) keep the other Parties informed as to the status of any
such request, inquiry, investigation, action or legal proceeding and (iii)
promptly inform the other Parties of any communication to or from any
Governmental Authority regarding the Transactions, and (iv) promptly notify
the other of any notice or other communication from any Person alleging that
such Person's Consent is or may be required in connection with the
Transactions, and in each case to keep the other Party reasonably informed
with respect thereto.

   

(e)Prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
obtain the written Consent, in form and substance reasonably acceptable to
Purchaser, of (i) the third parties set forth in Section 4.05(e)(i) of the
Seller Disclosure Letter and (ii) any other third party (other than a
Governmental Authority) listed on Section 4.05(e)(ii) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter; provided, however, that Seller, with respect to the those Consents in
clause (i), shall not be required to expend material amounts of money,
commence any litigation or offer or grant any accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any such third party or any other Person. The Purchaser Group
shall use its reasonable best efforts to assist Seller in obtaining each such
Consent. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the receipt of any such Consent shall
not be a condition to any Party's obligation to effect the Closing.

 

4.06Public Announcements

 

. Except with respect to (a) any Seller Takeover Proposal in accordance with
this Agreement or (b) any press release or other public statement that is
consistent in all material respects with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by a Party in accordance with this
Agreement, including in investor conference calls, Filings with the SEC, QandAs
or other publicly disclosed documents, in each case under this clause (b), to
the extent such disclosure is still accurate, each of the Parties agrees that
no press release or public announcement or disclosure concerning the
Transactions shall be issued by any Party without the prior written consent of
the other Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned
or delayed), except as such release or announcement may be required by
applicable Law, court process or by obligations pursuant to any listing
agreement with any national securities exchange or national securities
quotation system, in which case, and in the case of clause (b) above, the
Party required or intending to make such release or announcement shall, to the
extent reasonably practicable, provide prior written notice to the other Party
of the contents of such release or announcement and allow the other Party a
reasonable opportunity to comment on such release or announcement in advance
of such issuance. The Parties agree that the initial press release to be
issued with respect to the execution of this Agreement shall be in a form
agreed to by the Parties. For the avoidance of doubt, the foregoing shall not
prohibit an Party, or any Affiliate of any Party, from disclosing information
(on a confidential basis) to such Party's investors, potential investors or
lenders with respect to the Transactions if such information is of a nature
customarily conveyed to investors, potential investors and lenders.

 

4.07Fees, Costs and Expenses

 

. Except as provided otherwise in this Agreement, including Section 4.05(a)
and ARTICLE VI, all fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with this
Agreement and the Transactions shall be paid by the Party incurring such fees,
costs or expenses, whether or not the Closing occurs.

 

4.08Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance.

 

(a)[Intentionally omitted.]

 

(b)The Purchaser Group agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement
of expenses and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring
at or prior to the Closing now existing in favor of the current or former
directors, officers or employees of the Nutrition Entities, in their
capacities as such, as provided in their respective Organizational Documents
and any indemnification or other similar Contracts of any Nutrition Entity set
forth in Section 4.08(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, in each case, as in
effect on the date of this

   

Agreement, shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their
terms (it being agreed that after the Closing such rights shall be mandatory
rather than permissive, if applicable, with respect to directors and
officers), and the Purchaser Group shall cause the Nutrition Entities to
perform their respective obligations thereunder. The Purchaser Group shall not
permit any such indemnification, advancement of expenses or exculpation
provision to be amended, repealed or otherwise modified after the Closing Date
in any manner that would adversely affect the rights of the Nutrition
Indemnified Parties thereunder, unless any such amendment, repeal or
modification is required by applicable Law. In connection with the foregoing,
from and after the Closing, the Purchaser Group agrees that it shall indemnify
and hold harmless each individual who at Closing or prior to Closing is a
current or former director or officer of any Nutrition Entity (including each
individual who becomes, prior to the Closing, a director or officer of any
Nutrition Entity), in their capacity as such, who is entitled to
indemnification and/or advancement of expenses under the respective
Organizational Documents of the Nutrition Entities or other similar Contracts
of any Nutrition Entity set forth in Section 4.08(b) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter, in each case, as in effect on the date of this Agreement (the
"Nutrition Indemnified Parties"), against all claims, losses, liabilities,
damages, judgments, inquiries, fines and reasonable fees, costs and expenses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements, incurred in connection with any
Claim, whether civil, criminal, administrative or investigative with respect
to matters existing or occurring at or prior to the Closing (including this
Agreement, the Transactions and the actions contemplated by this Agreement),
arising out of or pertaining to the fact that the Nutrition Indemnified Party
is or was a director or officer of any Nutrition Entity, whether asserted or
claimed prior to, at or after the Closing, in each case in accordance with
such Organizational Documents or such Contracts (including advancement of
expenses as provided therein). Any determination required to be made with
respect to whether any Nutrition Indemnified Party's conduct complies with an
applicable standard under applicable Law, the applicable Organizational
Documents of any Nutrition Entity or applicable indemnification agreements, as
the case may be, shall, if requested by such Nutrition Indemnified Party, be
made by independent legal counsel to be agreed upon by the Nutrition
Indemnified Party and Purchaser acting reasonably.

 

(c)In the event that the Purchaser Group or any Nutrition Entity or any of
their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into
any other Person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its assets to any Person, then, and in each such case,
the Purchaser Group or such Nutrition Entity, as applicable, shall cause
proper provision to be made so that the successors and assigns of the
Purchaser Group or such Nutrition Entity, as applicable, assume the covenants
and agreements set forth in this Section 4.08.

 

(d)The provisions of this Section 4.08 (i) shall survive the Closing for a
period of six (6) years, (ii) are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall
be enforceable by, each indemnified or insured party (including the Nutrition
Indemnified Parties), his or her heirs and his or her representatives, all of
which, are express third-party beneficiaries of this Section 4.08 and (iii)
are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to
indemnification or contribution that any such Person may have by contract or
otherwise.

 

4.09Seller Names and Marks

 

. Except as set forth in this Section 4.09, from and after the Closing, the
Purchaser Group shall not use, or permit any of its Affiliates to use, any
Seller Names and Marks in the operation or ownership of the Nutrition Entities
(including the Business)

   

and the Purchaser Group shall, as soon as practicable, and in any event within
twelve (12) months following the Closing Date, remove, strike over or
otherwise obliterate all the Seller Names and Marks from all materials,
including signage, vehicles, facilities, business cards, schedules,
stationery, packaging materials, displays, promotional materials, manuals,
forms, software or other materials and products. However, for clarity, the
foregoing sentence does not require the Purchaser Group or its Affiliates to
remove any Seller Names and Marks solely to the extent they are included as of
the Closing Date in any source code, internal programmer help files, internal
build materials, internal product development materials or other internal
documents, policies and materials, to the extent not publicly displayed.
Furthermore, without limiting either Party's obligations regarding
confidentiality, public statements or other matters under this Agreement, this
Section 4.09 shall not be construed to prohibit the Purchaser Group or its
Affiliates from referring to the Seller Names and Marks in factual
descriptions of Seller's prior ownership of the Business for historical or
informational purposes, provided that such marks are not used as a Trademark.
From and after the Closing until such removal occurs (and in any event no
later than twelve (12) months following the Closing Date), subject to the
terms and conditions hereof, Seller hereby grants the Purchaser Group and its
Affiliates a limited, personal, non-assignable and non-sublicensable (except
to contractors engaged to perform services with respect to the Business and as
sublicensed by Seller or any of the Nutrition Entities in connection with the
Business prior to the Closing Date), non-exclusive license to use the Seller
Names and Marks solely in connection with operating the Business and
transitioning to new names and marks in accordance with this Section 4.09. Any
use by the Purchaser Group or any of its Affiliates of any of the Seller Names
and Marks as permitted in this Section 4.09 is subject to their use of the
Seller Names and Marks in a form and manner, and with standards of quality, of
that in effect for the Seller Names and Marks as of the Closing Date. Seller
acknowledges and agrees that the Nutrition Entities' current use of the Seller
Names and Marks meets such usage requirements and the current operations,
products and services meet standards of quality. The Purchaser Group and its
Affiliates shall not use the Seller Names and Marks in a manner that reflects
negatively on such Seller Names and Marks or on Seller or its Affiliates.

 

4.10Insurance

 

. 

 

(a)At or prior to the Closing, Seller shall use its reasonable best efforts to
cause each of the Nutrition Entities be named as an insured under the
insurance policies set forth in Section 4.10 of the Seller Disclosure Letter,
to the extent the Nutrition Entities are not already named as insureds. With
respect to each insurer that has agreed to this change, Seller shall deliver
to Purchaser an endorsement or other documentation evidencing the change.

 

(b)For as long as reasonably necessary following the Closing Date: (i) at the
request of Purchaser, Seller shall reasonably cooperate with and assist
Purchaser and the Nutrition Entities in pursuing insurance coverage for any
loss, liability, damage or expense relating to the assets, business,
operations, conduct, products, directors, officers, and employees of any of
the Nutrition Entities (each, an "Insurance Claim") that is covered under the
DandO Tail or the Seller insurance policies maintained at any time prior to the
Closing Date by Seller; and (ii) Seller shall forward to Purchaser (and/or
Purchaser's designees), as soon as reasonably practicable, copies of any and
all notices to the Person named on such Seller insurance policy (the "Named
Insured") or to any Person insured under such Seller insurance policy (the
"Insured") of material changes in

   

the terms and conditions of the Seller insurance policies that relate to or
affect Insurance Claims, as well as copies of any Insurance Claims-related
correspondence or information that are delivered to Seller by the insurance
companies under the Seller insurance policies, including any new Insurance
Claims asserted or filed against the Nutrition Entities.

 

(c)From and after the Closing, except pursuant to the Transition Services
Agreement and as otherwise set forth in Section 4.08 and this Section 4.10,
(a) Seller shall have no obligation to purchase or maintain insurance for the
Nutrition Entities, the Business and the operations, assets and Liabilities in
respect thereof, under any of Seller's or its Affiliates' insurance policies
or by any of their self-insured programs, and (b) neither the Purchaser Group
nor any of its Affiliates (including, for the avoidance of doubt, the
Nutrition Entities) shall have any access, right, title or interest in or to
any such insurance policies or self-insured programs (including to all claims
and rights to make claims and all rights to proceeds) to cover the Business or
the operations, assets or Liabilities in respect thereof. From and after the
Closing, the Purchaser Group shall be responsible for securing, except
pursuant to the Transition Services Agreement and as otherwise set forth in
Section 4.08 and this Section 4.10, all insurance it considers appropriate for
the Business and the operations, assets and Liabilities in respect thereof.

 

4.11Termination of Affiliate Contracts; Intercompany Arrangements.

 

(a)Except for this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement, at or prior to the
Closing, Seller shall terminate, or cause to be terminated, all Affiliate
Contracts, and shall release each Nutrition Entity, or cause each Nutrition
Entity to be released, from all covenants, agreements, liabilities and
obligations under such Affiliate Contracts, whether arising prior to, at or
after the Closing, in each case, to be effective at or prior to the Closing.

 

(b)All intracompany (payables and receivables) accounts between Seller, its
Affiliates or any of its Subsidiaries (other than the Nutrition Entities), on
the one hand, and any Nutrition Entity on the other hand, that remain in
existence immediately prior to the Closing, shall hereby be cancelled and
settled without consideration or further liability to any Party and without
the need for any further documentation, effective immediately prior to the
Closing.

 

4.12Third Party Financing

 

.

 

(a)Without limitation of (and in addition to) the obligations of Parent under
other sections of this Agreement relating to the Financing or any alternate
financing, subject solely to the terms and conditions of the Equity Commitment
Letter, Parent shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Equity
Financing Source to comply with the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and,
subject solely to the terms and conditions of the Preferred Equity Commitment
Letter and the Debt Commitment Letter, Parent and Purchaser shall take, or
cause to be taken, all actions and do, or cause to be done, all things
necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Preferred Equity Financing and
the Debt Financing at the Closing, including using each of Parent's and
Purchaser's reasonable best efforts to: (i) maintain in effect the Commitment
Letters and the Financing; (ii) promptly satisfy all conditions that are
within its control applicable to the Purchaser Group and its Affiliates to
obtaining both the Preferred Equity Financing set forth in the Preferred
Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt Financing set forth in the Debt
Commitment Letter (subject to any market flex provisions in the Fee Letter)
and the definitive documents relating

   

thereto (including by, upon satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the
Equity Financing and the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions hereunder,
using reasonable best efforts to consummate the Equity Financing pursuant to
the terms of the Equity Commitment Letter and this Agreement, and making
payment of any fees and expenses required as a condition to the Preferred
Equity Financing and any commitment, engagement, or placement fees required as
a condition to the Debt Financing payable on the Closing Date (in each case,
which may be paid or satisfied from the proceeds of the Financing)); (iii)
enter into definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and
conditions contemplated by the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the Debt
Commitment Letter (subject to any market flex provisions in the Fee Letter),
as applicable; (iv) enforce its rights under the Commitment Letters; (v)
effect the issuance and sale to the Preferred Equity Investor of the Preferred
Equity Securities pursuant to the terms and conditions set forth in the
Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and draw down and consummate the Debt
Financing if the conditions to availability of the Preferred Equity Financing
and the Debt Financing, respectively, have been satisfied or waived at the
time the conditions set forth in ARTICLE V are satisfied; and (vi) upon
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions to the Equity Financing at the time
the conditions set forth in ARTICLE V are satisfied, cause the Equity
Financing Source to fund the Equity Financing at Closing (including through
litigation). 

 

(b)In the event any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms
and conditions contemplated in the Commitment Letters (subject, with respect
to the Debt Commitment Letter, to any market flex provisions in the Fee
Letter), Parent shall immediately notify Seller and shall use its reasonable
best efforts to arrange to obtain alternative and/or supplemental financing
(whether in the form of debt, equity or other financing) from alternative
sources in an amount sufficient, when combined with the funds under the Equity
Commitment Letter or any other available debt or equity financing sources, to
consummate the Transactions promptly following the occurrence of such event
but in all cases at or prior to Closing. Parent shall give Seller prompt
notice of any actual or threatened breach or default by any party of the
Commitment Letters of which Parent becomes aware or any actual or putative
termination of the Commitment Letters and, if applicable, obtain and promptly
provide Seller copies of any alternative financing commitments and
documentation ("New Commitment Letter(s)"), which New Commitment Letter(s)
will replace the applicable existing Commitment Letter(s). In the event that
any New Commitment Letters are obtained, (A) any reference in this Agreement
to the "Commitment Letters" will be deemed to include the Commitment Letters
to the extent not superseded by a New Commitment Letter at the time in
question and any New Commitment Letters to the extent then in effect; and (B)
any reference in this Agreement to the "Financing," "Equity Financing,"
"Preferred Equity Financing" or "Debt Financing" means the financing
contemplated by the Commitment Letters, as applicable, as modified pursuant to
the foregoing. Parent shall keep Seller informed on a reasonably current basis
in reasonable detail of the status of its efforts to arrange the Financing or
any alternative financing, including any delays or threatened delays in such
efforts. Parent shall not, without Seller's prior written consent, permit any
amendment or modification to be made to, any waiver of any provision or remedy
under, or any substitution or reduction of the commitments of the financing
sources party to, the Commitment Letters and/or the related definitive
documentation, and, if applicable, the alternative financing commitment
arrangements and definitive agreements, that would, or would reasonably be
expected to, (i) reduce the aggregate amount of the Financing, including by
changing the amount of the fees to be paid or the original issue discount of
the Financing, unless the aggregate amount of the Financing, together with
other financial resources available to Parent, is sufficient to consummate the
Transactions;

   

(ii) impose new or additional conditions or other terms or otherwise expand,
amend or modify any of the conditions to the receipt of the Financing or any
other terms to the Financing that would reasonably be expected to prevent,
impede or delay the timely consummation of the Financing or the Closing; (iii)
materially adversely impact the ability of Parent or Purchaser, as applicable,
to enforce its rights against the other parties to the Commitment Letters or
the definitive agreements with respect thereto; or (iv) prevent, impede or

the event that one or more of the Persons obligated to provide a portion of
the equity under the Equity Commitment Letter or, if applicable, the
alternative financing commitment arrangement and definitive agreements, fails
or threatens to fail to provide its respective portion of such equity
financing in the event that all conditions contained in the Equity Commitment
Letter have been satisfied or waived, Parent shall, at the written request of
Seller, promptly commence an enforcement proceeding against any such
defaulting Person or Persons in which Parent will use its reasonable best
efforts to compel such defaulting Person or Persons to provide its portion of
such equity financing on the Closing Date. Seller shall be entitled to
participate in any such litigation with counsel of its choice (at Seller's
expense). 

 

(c)The Seller shall, and shall cause its and each of the Nutrition Entities'
respective officers, employees, accountants, counsel, representatives and
advisors to, provide such reasonable cooperation with the arrangement,

forth therein) as may be reasonably requested by Parent or Purchaser,
including (i) participation in a reasonable number of meetings, drafting
sessions, rating agency presentations, and lender meetings and due diligence
presentations; (ii) assisting as is reasonably necessary with the preparation
of customary materials for rating agency presentations, lender presentations,
offering documents, private placement memoranda, bank information memoranda,
prospectuses and similar customary documents required in connection with the
Preferred Equity Financing and the Debt Financing, and otherwise reasonably
cooperating with the customary efforts of Purchaser and Parent in connection
with the issuance and sale of the Preferred Equity Securities contemplated by
the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter and the customary marketing efforts of
Purchaser and the Debt Financing Source for any portion of the Debt Financing;
(iii) furnishing Purchaser, the Preferred Equity Investor and the Debt
Financing Source with all pertinent information regarding the Nutrition
Entities as may be reasonably requested by Purchaser (and/or the Preferred
Equity Investor and the Debt Financing Source) and as is customary in
connection with the Preferred Equity Financing and Debt Financing to be
included in offering memoranda, prospectuses, information memoranda and other
marketing and/or syndication materials for the Preferred Equity Financing and
the Debt Financing, including, for the avoidance of doubt, customarily
required financial statements (including, without limitation, unaudited
quarterly consolidated balance sheets and related unaudited statements of
operations and cash flows of the Business for each fiscal quarter ending after
June 30, 2020 and at least forty five (45) days prior to the Closing Date);
(iv) providing to the Debt Financing Source (A) all documentation and other
information relating to Seller and each of the Nutrition Entities as may be
required by regulatory authorities or reasonably requested by Purchaser in
connection with applicable "know your customer" and anti-money laundering
rules and regulations, including the USA PATRIOT ACT, Title III of Pub. L.
107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001), and (B) a certification regarding
beneficial ownership required by 31 C.F.R. Section 1010.230 in relation to any
Borrower or Guarantor (each as defined in the Debt Commitment Letter) that
qualifies as a "legal entity customer" in connection with such certification;
(v) cooperating with the Debt Financing Source's reasonable due diligence

   

investigation and evaluation of the business, assets and properties of Seller

agreements and other financing documents as may be reasonably requested by
Purchaser or the Debt Financing Source to consummate the Debt Financing, (vi)
obtaining Lien terminations and instruments of discharge to be delivered at
the Closing as required by Section 4.17, as well as any customary insurance
certificates, (vii) executing and delivering customary authorization and

information necessary or reasonably requested by Purchaser to facilitate
Purchaser's preparation of unaudited pro forma consolidated financial
statements as of and for the four-quarter period ended on June 30, 2020 (or
any subsequent fiscal quarter for which financial statements have been
delivered pursuant to clause (iii) above), prepared to give effect to the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement; provided that, in each case set
forth above, Seller and its Subsidiaries shall not be required to (i) waive or
amend any terms of this Agreement or agree to pay any fees or reimburse any
expenses in connection with the Financing for which it will not be reimbursed
or indemnified by the Purchaser Group, except for any such fees or expenses to
be incurred by the Nutrition Entities from and after the Closing (for the
avoidance of doubt, it being understood, however, that Seller and its
Subsidiaries shall bear all costs and expenses of their financial statements
to the extent listed in Section 4.12(c) of the Seller Disclosure Letter); (ii)
enter into any definitive agreement (other than customary authorization and
representation letters) that is not conditioned on Closing having occurred;

breach of, or default under, this Agreement, any Organizational Document of
Seller or its Subsidiaries, any Nutrition Material Contract or other material

information that would result in waiving any attorney-client privilege, work-
product or similar privilege, (vii) take any action that would contravene any
position taken in any tax return or financial statements of Seller or any of
its Subsidiaries, or (viii) pay any placement, commitment or other similar fee
or incur any other expense, cost or liability in connection with the Financing
prior to the Closing, except for any liabilities that are conditioned on the
Closing having occurred. The Purchaser Group shall, promptly upon request by
Seller, reimburse Seller for all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket costs
incurred by Seller or its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation.
Seller hereby consents to the use of the logos of the Nutrition Entities in
connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended or reasonably likely to harm or disparage Seller
or its Affiliates or the reputation or goodwill of Seller and its Affiliates
and their respective marks. The Purchaser Group shall, on a joint and several
basis, indemnify and hold harmless Seller, its Subsidiaries, and its and their
Affiliates and Representatives, for and against any and all Losses suffered or
incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of Financing or any
alternative financing and any information utilized in connection therewith
(other than arising from information provided by Seller or its Affiliates),
except in the event such Losses arose out of or result from the willful

   

misconduct, gross negligence or intentional fraud by Seller, its Affiliates or
any of their Representatives (acting on its behalf).

 

(d)All non-public or other confidential information provided by Seller or any
of its Representatives pursuant to this Agreement shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement, except that Parent and
Purchaser will be permitted to disclose such information to any financing
sources or prospective financing sources and other financial institutions and
investors that are or may become parties to the Financing and to any
underwriters, initial purchasers or placement agents in connection with the
Financing (and, in each case, to their respective counsel and auditors), in
each case on a confidential basis.

 

(e)For the avoidance of doubt, the Purchaser Group's obligation to effect the
Closing shall not be subject to the Purchaser Group obtaining any financing,
including any Preferred Equity Financing or Debt Financing, or to the
performance of any party to any Commitment Letter of such party's obligations
thereunder.

 

4.13Transition Matters.

 

(a)During the period between the date of this Agreement and the Closing, in
furtherance of the Transactions, the Parties shall, and shall cause their
Affiliates to, cooperate in good faith and use their commercially reasonable
efforts to begin implementing those transition items identified in the
Transition Services Agreement as "Critical Activities for the Parent to
Complete by Day One" for the migration and integration of the Business out of
the business of Seller and into the business of the Purchaser Group, in each
case, subject to compliance with applicable Law. Such cooperation shall
include each Party using commercially reasonable efforts to take the following
actions:

 

(i)promptly after the date of this Agreement, appointing a transition manager
whose primary responsibility would be to plan and execute such transition and
manage such Party's transition team of the Business from the other operations
of Seller;

 

(ii)promptly after the date of this Agreement, reviewing the technology,
business operations and administration capabilities to be so transitioned or
migrated, taking into account any issues of separation;

 

(iii)establishing transition teams;

 

(iv)setting regular meetings of such transition teams during the period
between the date of this Agreement and the Closing; and

 

(v)making available appropriate knowledgeable business, operations,
administration and technology personnel and any other personnel reasonably
needed for such transition and migration planning;

 

provided that all such activities shall be in compliance with applicable Law.

 

(b)To the extent Seller does not complete those items set forth in the
Transition Services Agreement as "Critical Activities for the Parent to
Complete by Day One" on or prior to

   

the Closing, each Party shall (i) through their respective transition teams,
cooperate in good faith with the other Party and use commercially reasonable
efforts to review the schedules to the Transition Services Agreement and (ii)
negotiate in good faith any amendment, update or supplement to the schedules
to the Transition Services Agreement that is reasonably required by Purchaser
to incorporate additional services to be provided by Seller in light of such
"Critical Activities for the Parent to Complete by Day One" items not being
completed by Closing, which such service shall be provided at no additional
cost to Purchaser.

 

4.14Restrictive Covenants

 

. For a period of thirty-six (36) months from and after the Closing Date (the
"Restricted Period"):

 

(a)[Intentionally omitted.]

 

(b)[Intentionally omitted.]

 

(c)For a period commencing on the date of this Agreement continuing through
the Restricted Period (or the earlier termination of this Agreement), Seller
shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to), directly or indirectly,
personally or through any other Person, recruit, solicit for hire, hire or
enter into a consulting arrangement with (on Seller's own behalf or on behalf
of any other Person) any person who was a Business Employee as of the date
hereof (or the preceding six months), as of the time period between the date
hereof and Closing, or as of the Closing Date (it being the intent of the
Parties that this shall include those employees of Seller whose offer letters
governing employment are contemplated to be assigned to the Nutrition Entities
pursuant to Section 4.15(a)) to leave or stop working for such Nutrition
Entity for the purpose of working for any Person, unless such employee's
employment has been terminated after the Closing by such Nutrition Entity or
the Purchaser Group, as applicable.

 

(d)For a period commencing on the date of this Agreement continuing through
the Restricted Period (or the earlier termination of this Agreement), Parent,
Purchaser and the Nutrition Entities and their Subsidiaries shall not,
directly or indirectly, personally or through any other Person, recruit,
solicit for hire, hire or enter into a consulting arrangement with (on their
own behalf or on behalf of any other Person) any person who was an employee of
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries (other than a Business Employee) as of the
date hereof (or the preceding six months), as of the time period between the
date hereof and Closing, or as of the Closing Date (it being the intent of the
Parties that this shall not include those employees of Seller or its
Subsidiaries whose offer letters governing employment are contemplated to be
assigned to the Nutrition Entities pursuant to Section 4.15(a)) to leave or
stop working for Seller or its Subsidiaries for the purpose of working for any
Person, unless such employee's employment has been terminated after the
Closing by Seller or its Subsidiaries, as applicable.

 

4.15Employee Matters.

 

(a)Immediately prior to the Closing Date, Seller shall, or shall cause its
Affiliates to, assign the offer letters governing the employment of the
Business Employees (to the extent they remain employed by Seller or any of its
Affiliates as of such time) set forth in Section 4.15(a) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter from Seller or its Affiliate to a Nutrition Entity. Seller
shall retain all liabilities, costs, and expenses with respect to the actions
set forth in this Section 4.15(a)

   

including any severance or other termination-related payments that result from
such actions. If, prior to the Closing, Seller or the Purchaser Group obtains
(and Seller and the Purchaser Group shall use their reasonable best efforts to
obtain) a written representation (the "Disability Representation") from the
insurance carrier(s) that will provide short-term disability and long-term
disability coverage on behalf of the Nutrition Entities after the expiration
of the applicable service to be provided under the Transition Services
Agreement stating that Inactive Business Employees shall be eligible for
coverage under the short-term disability and long-term disability plans
sponsored by the Nutrition Entities after the expiration of the applicable
service to be provided under the Transition Services Agreement without
incurring any extraordinary costs or expenses, then each Inactive Business
Employee shall remain or become, as applicable, an employee of the Nutrition
Entities at the Closing. If the Disability Representation cannot (after
reasonable best efforts by Seller and the Purchaser Group) be obtained prior
to the Closing, then (a) Seller shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure
that the Inactive Business Employees remain covered under Seller's short-term
disability and long-term disability plans sponsored by Seller effective at the
Closing and (b) immediately following the date on which such Inactive Business
Employee returns to active duty and subject to receipt of notice from Seller
at least five (5) Business Days prior to such date, Purchaser shall, or shall
cause one of its Affiliates to, provide an offer of employment to such
Inactive Business Employee. For the avoidance of doubt, Purchaser shall be
under no obligation to offer employment to any Inactive Business Employee who
has not returned to active employment on or prior to the date on which such
Inactive Business Employee is entitled to reinstatement pursuant to applicable
Law (the "Last Reinstatement Date"). Purchaser shall reimburse Seller for the
reasonable costs and expenses associated with the continued coverage of such
Inactive Business Employees under the short-term disability and long-term
disability plans sponsored by Seller for the duration of the period that such
Inactive Business Employees receive short-term disability and long-term
disability benefits under the plans sponsored by Seller following the Closing
Date. For purposes of this Section 4.15(a), "Inactive Business Employee" means
any Business Employee who is employed at a Nutrition Entity, or any Business
Employee set forth in Section 4.15(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter, and is
on short-term disability or long-term disability immediately prior to the
Closing Date

 

(b)From the Closing Date until the first anniversary of the Closing Date (the
"Benefits Continuation Period"), the Purchaser Group shall provide, or cause
to be provided, for those Business Employees who continue as employees of the
Nutrition Entities and those Business Employees set forth in Section 4.15(a)
of the Seller Disclosure Letter, during all or a portion of the Benefits
Continuation Period (the "Continuing Employees"), (i) at least the same base
salary or hourly wage rate and annual target cash bonus opportunities that
were in effect for such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the Closing
Date (except that from and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser Group shall,
and shall cause the Nutrition Entities to, restore to pre-reduction levels the
base salaries of all Continuing Employees who were subject to base salary
reductions described in Section 4.15(b) of the Seller Disclosure Letter); and
(ii) employee benefits (excluding equity, phantom equity, retention bonus,
transaction bonus, defined benefit pension, deferred compensation, retiree
medical insurance, and retiree life insurance plans, programs, agreements or
arrangements) that are substantially similar in the aggregate to the employee
benefits (excluding equity, phantom equity, retention bonus, transaction
bonus, defined benefit pension, deferred compensation, retiree medical
insurance, and retiree life insurance plans, programs, agreements or
arrangements) provided to such Continuing Employees immediately prior to the
Closing Date.

   

(c)The Purchaser Group shall use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive,
or cause to be waived, any applicable pre-existing condition exclusions and
waiting periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements in any
replacement or successor welfare or fringe benefit plan of the Purchaser Group
or any of its Affiliates in which a Continuing Employee is eligible to
participate following the Closing Date to the extent such exclusions or
waiting periods were inapplicable to, or had been satisfied by, such
Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing Date under the analogous
Nutrition Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated, (ii)
provide, or cause to be provided, each Continuing Employee with credit for any
co-payments and deductibles paid prior to the Closing Date (to the same extent
such credit was given under the analogous Nutrition Benefit Plan prior to the
Closing Date) in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements, and (iii) recognize, or cause to be recognized, service prior to
the Closing Date with Seller or the Nutrition Entities for purposes of
eligibility to participate, vesting, and, for severance and vacation only,
determination of level of benefits and benefits accrual, to the same extent
such service was recognized by Seller or the Nutrition Entities under the
analogous Nutrition Benefit Plan in which such Continuing Employee
participated immediately prior to the Closing Date; provided, however, that
the foregoing shall not apply to the extent it would result in any duplication
of benefits for the same period of service.

 

(d)From and after the Closing Date, the Purchaser Group shall honor, agree to
be bound by, and fulfill any outstanding obligations under, in accordance with
its terms, (i) each employment, change in control (excluding, for the
avoidance of doubt, any change in control provisions set forth in any equity
awards granted under the Seller Stock Plans held by Business Employees),
severance, retention and termination protection plan or agreement of or
between Seller or any of the Nutrition Subsidiaries and any current or former
officer, director or employee set forth in Section 4.15(d) of the Seller
Disclosure Letter and (ii) all obligations under the 2020 year-end bonus
program (for Business Employees working in the contact center) and all
obligations under the 2020 bonus program (for all other Business Employees),
which bonuses shall be paid in accordance with the terms of such bonus
programs. The Purchaser Group acknowledges that the consummation of the
Transactions will constitute a change in control of Nutrition Topco to the
extent such is applicable under the terms of Seller's and the Nutrition
Entities' employee plans, programs, arrangements and Contracts containing
provisions triggering payment, vesting or other rights upon a change in
control or similar transaction.

 

(e)From and after the Closing, Seller shall be solely responsible for all
liabilities, costs, and expenses accrued prior to the Closing Date and related
to any Nutrition Benefit Plan that is not sponsored by a Nutrition Entity.

 

(f)The Purchaser Group, for a period commencing at the Closing Date and ending
ninety (90) days thereafter, shall not effectuate a "plant closing" or "mass
layoff" as those terms are defined in WARN affecting in whole or in part any
site of employment, facility, or operating unit of the Purchaser Group or any
of the Nutrition Entities, and shall cause the Purchaser Group and each of the
Nutrition Entities not to take any such action after such ninety (90) day
period without complying with all provisions of WARN.

 

(g) Prior to the Closing, Seller shall execute the documentation in
substantially the form set forth in Section 4.15(g) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter and provide such executed documentation to Purchaser at or prior to the
Closing. From and after the Closing, to the extent

   

that under any confidentiality, non-solicitation of customers, non-
solicitation of employees or consultants, non-interference, indemnification,
noncompetition, non-disparagement or similar Contracts between the Seller or
its Affiliates, on the one hand, and a third party (including any employees
that service the Business), on the other hand, with respect to the Business
are not assigned to Purchaser pursuant to this Agreement, from and after the
Closing, the Seller shall (and shall cause its applicable Affiliates to) at
the written request of the Purchaser or its Affiliates use commercially
reasonable efforts (at Nutrition Topco's sole expense) to cooperate with and
assist Purchaser or its Affiliates in asserting new claims thereunder relating
to the Business for the benefit of the Purchaser and its Affiliates, and the
Seller shall not (and shall cause its Affiliates not to) terminate or
materially modify any such Contract or waive or release any materials right
under any such Contract without Purchaser's prior written consent.

 

(h)Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement to the contrary, the
Purchaser Group shall provide Continuing Employees whose employment terminates
during the Benefits Continuation Period with severance benefits no less
favorable than the severance benefits that would have been provided in
accordance with Seller's or the Nutrition Entities' severance plans or
agreements set forth on Section 4.15(d) of the Seller Disclosure Letter to the
extent applicable to such Continuing Employee immediately prior to the Closing
Date, if any.

 

(i)From the date hereof through the Closing Date, Seller shall, and shall
cause its Affiliates to, use reasonable best efforts to cooperate with the
Purchaser Group with respect to payroll administration, establishing new
employee benefit plan and employee benefit plan administration, and such other
integration efforts related to the Continuing Employees as reasonably
requested by the Purchaser Group.

 

(j)Nothing contained in this Agreement, whether express or implied, (i) shall
be treated as an amendment or other modification of any Nutrition Benefit
Plan, (ii) shall create any third-party beneficiary rights in any Person,
(iii) shall create any right to continued employment with respect to any
person or any right to compensation or benefits of any nature or kind
whatsoever, or (iv) subject to the requirements of this Section 4.15, shall
limit the right of the Purchaser Group to amend, terminate or otherwise modify
any Nutrition Benefit Plan following the Closing Date.

 

4.16Nutrition Equity and Cash Awards

 

. Seller shall treat the equity and cash awards described in Section 4.16 of
the Seller Disclosure Letter in accordance with the terms set forth in Section
4.16 of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

. Seller shall deliver to Purchaser prior to the Closing customary Lien
release letters and other necessary documentation from the applicable agent(s)
under the Credit Agreement confirming the automatic release and discharge of
all guarantees and other obligations of, and Liens upon the assets of and
equity interests in, the Nutrition Entities pursuant to the Credit Agreement
and the documents related thereto upon consummation of the Closing, including
(a) the release of each Nutrition Entity from all covenants, agreements,
liabilities and obligations under the Credit Agreement, including expressly
being released as a guarantor with respect thereto, (b) the release of related
security interests in the assets of, and equity interests in, the Nutrition
Entities (the "Nutrition Entities Collateral"), and authorizing the filing
and/or delivery by Purchaser (or its designee) of UCC-3 termination

   

statements and other required termination statements or notices (including,
without limitation, as applicable, intellectual property security interest
terminations, deposit account control agreement terminations and collateral
access agreement terminations) solely with respect to the Nutrition Entities
Collateral and (c) providing for the delivery to Purchaser (or its designee
(including any Debt Financing Source)), promptly (but in any event within
three (3) Business Days) following consummation of the Closing, of any
possessory Nutrition Entities Collateral held by the applicable agent(s) or
any lender (if applicable) under the Credit Agreement (including, without
limitation, (i) any certificates evidencing equity interests of the Nutrition
Entities and (ii) a written confirmation that that certain Global Intercompany
Note, dated March 8, 2019, by and among certain of Seller's Subsidiaries has
been destroyed and cancelled)), in order to effect the release and termination
of such Liens on such Nutrition Entities Collateral. Prior to the Closing,
Seller deliver to Purchaser the documentation described in, and shall cause
Nutrition Topco to take the actions described in, Section 4.17 of the Seller
Disclosure Letter.

 

4.18RandW Insurance Policy

 

. Purchaser hereby acknowledges and agrees that the RandW Insurance Policy
shall at all times provide that the insurer shall have no, and shall waive and
not pursue any and all, subrogation rights against Seller or any of its
Subsidiaries (other than the Nutrition Entities) or Representatives (except in
the case of Fraud by the Seller) and Seller, its Subsidiaries (other than the
Nutrition Entities) and its Representatives shall be third party beneficiaries
of such waiver. Any costs and expenses related to the RandW Insurance Policy,
including the total premium, underwriting costs, brokerage commission for the
Purchaser's broker, Taxes related to such policy and other fees and expenses
of such policy shall be borne by the Purchaser Group. The Purchaser Group
shall not seek to make, enter into or consent to any amendment to the RandW
Insurance Policy that would adversely affect the rights of Seller or any of

without Seller's prior written consent.

if such failure to satisfy the condition set forth in Section 5.01(b) is the
result of breach of any representation or warranty of such Party or a failure
of such Party to comply with its covenants and agreements under this
Agreement; or

 

(c)Termination by Seller. Seller shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement prior to the Closing:

 

(i)in order to enter into a definitive, written Contract for a Superior Seller
Proposal concurrently with such termination; provided that such termination
will not be effective unless (1) Seller has complied with its obligations
under Section 4.02 and (2) Seller has paid Parent the Seller Termination Fee
pursuant to Section 6.03(a)(i) prior to or concurrently with such termination;

 

(ii)if the Purchaser Group breaches or fails to perform any of its covenants
or agreements in this Agreement, or if any of the representations or
warranties of the

   

Purchaser Group in this Agreement fails to be true and correct, which breach
or failure (1) would give rise to the failure to satisfy a condition set forth
in Section 5.01, Section 5.02(a) or Section 5.02(b), as applicable, and (2)
(A) is not reasonably capable of being cured by the Purchaser Group by the End
Date or (B) if reasonably capable of being cured by the Purchaser Group by the
End Date, Seller has delivered to Purchaser written notice of such breach and
such breach is not cured by the Purchaser Group by the earlier of (1) the End
Date and (2) the date that is thirty (30) days after delivery of such notice;
provided, however, that Seller shall not have the right to terminate this
Agreement under this Section 6.01(c)(ii) if Seller is then in breach of any
covenant or agreement in this Agreement or any representation or warranty of
Seller in this Agreement then fails to be true and correct, in each case, such
that any condition set forth in Section 5.01, Section 5.03(a), Section 5.03(b)
or Section 5.03(c), as applicable, could not then be satisfied; or

 

(iii)if (1) all of the conditions set forth in Section 5.01 and Section 5.03
(except for those conditions to the Closing that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which would be satisfied if the Closing then
occurred) have been satisfied or waived by Purchaser in writing, (2) Seller
has irrevocably confirmed in writing at least three (3) Business Days prior to
such termination that Seller stands ready, willing and able, and will take all
actions, to consummate the Closing, and (3) Purchaser has failed to consummate
the Closing by the day that the Closing should have been consummated pursuant
to Section 1.02 and within three (3) Business Days of receipt by Purchaser of
the written confirmation referred to in clause (2) of this sentence.

 

(d)Termination by Purchaser. Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement prior to the Closing if Seller breaches or fails to perform any of
its covenants or agreements in this Agreement, or if any of the
representations or warranties of Seller in this Agreement fails to be true and
correct, which breach or failure (1) would give rise to the failure to satisfy
a condition set forth in Section 5.01, Section 5.03(a), Section 5.03(b) or
Section 5.03(c), as applicable, and (2) (A) is not reasonably capable of being
cured by Seller by the End Date or (B) if reasonably capable of being cured by
Seller by the End Date, Purchaser has delivered to Seller written notice of
such breach and such breach is not cured by Seller by the earlier of (1) the
End Date and (2) the date that is thirty (30) days after delivery of such
notice; provided, however, that Purchaser shall not have the right to
terminate this Agreement under this Section 6.01(d) if the Purchaser Group is
then in breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement or any
representation or warranty of the Purchaser Group in this Agreement then fails
to be true and correct, in each case, such that any condition set forth in
Section 5.01, Section 5.02(a) or Section 5.02(b), as applicable, could not
then be satisfied.

 

(e)Termination Procedure. This Agreement may be terminated only pursuant to
Section 6.01(a)-(d). In order to terminate this Agreement, the Party desiring
to terminate this Agreement shall give written notice of such termination to
the other Parties in accordance with Section 9.03, specifying the provision of
this Agreement pursuant to which such termination is effected.

 

6.02Effect of Termination

 

. In the event this Agreement is terminated as provided in Section 6.01, this
Agreement shall immediately become void and have no effect, without any
liability or obligation on the part of Seller or the Purchaser Group (or any
stockholder, Affiliate or Representative thereof), whether arising before or
after such termination, based on, arising out of

   

or relating to this Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance or
subject matter of this Agreement (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise,
or whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity),
except for (a) the first sentence of Section 4.03(c) (Confidentiality),
Section 4.07 (Fees, Costs and Expenses), this Section 6.02 (Effect of
Termination), Section 6.03 (Termination Fee) and ARTICLE IX (General
Provisions), which provisions shall survive such termination and (b) liability
of any Party (whether or not the terminating Party) for Fraud or any Willful
Breach of this Agreement prior to such termination, which liabilities shall
survive the termination of this Agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
"Willful Breach" means a material breach of this Agreement that is a
consequence of an act or omission undertaken by the breaching Party with the
actual knowledge that such act or omission would, or would reasonably be
expected to, cause or constitute a material breach of this Agreement; provided
that, without limiting the meaning of Willful Breach, any failure of either
Party to consummate the Closing when required under Section 1.02 (if the other
Party has irrevocably confirmed in writing that, subject to such breaching
Party's performance, the Closing will occur) shall constitute a Willful Breach
by such Party; and provided further, that the failure to receive the proceeds
from the Financing, in and of itself, shall not constitute a Willful Breach by
the Purchaser Group as long as the Purchaser Group shall have complied with
all of their obligations with respect to Financing set forth in this
Agreement. 

 

6.03Termination Fee.

 

(a)Seller Termination Fee.

 

(i)If Seller terminates this Agreement pursuant to Section 6.01(c)(i), Seller
shall pay to Parent a fee of $15,000,000 in cash (the "Seller Termination
Fee") (to an account designated in writing by Parent (which account
information shall be provided by Purchaser promptly following Seller's written
request therefor)) concurrently with or prior to such termination.

 

(ii)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, if this Agreement is
terminated under circumstances in which Seller is obligated to pay the Seller
Termination Fee under Section 6.03(a)(i), upon payment of the Seller
Termination Fee, Seller shall have no further liability with respect to this
Agreement or the Transactions to the Purchaser Group or any of its Affiliates
or Representatives, and payment of the Seller Termination Fee shall be the
Purchaser Group's sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims or Losses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by the
Purchaser Group, the Purchaser Group's Subsidiaries and any other Person in
connection with this Agreement or the Transactions or any matter forming the
basis for such termination (including if such termination results from the
Willful Breach of this Agreement by Seller), and the Purchaser Group shall not
have, and expressly waives and relinquishes, any other right, remedy or
recourse (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity). In no event shall
Seller be required to pay the Seller Termination Fee on more than one (1)
occasion.

 

(b)Reverse Termination Fee.

 

(i)If this Agreement is terminated pursuant to Section 6.01(c)(ii) or Section
6.01(c)(iii) (a "Specified Termination"), then Purchaser shall pay to Seller a
fee of

   

$30,000,000 in cash (the "Reverse Termination Fee") (to an account designated
in writing by Seller) within fifteen (15) Business Days of any such Specified
Termination.

 

(ii)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, (x) if this Agreement is
terminated under circumstances in which Purchaser is obligated to pay the
Reverse Termination Fee under Section 6.03(b)(i), upon payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee, none of the Purchaser, Parent or any Financing Source shall
have any further liability with respect to this Agreement, the Transactions or
the Equity Commitment Letter to the Seller or any of its Affiliates,
stockholders or Representatives, and payment of the Reverse Termination Fee
shall be Seller's sole and exclusive remedy for any Claims or Losses,
including attorneys' fees and disbursements, suffered or incurred by Seller or
its Subsidiaries and any other Person in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions or any matter forming the basis for such termination (including
if such termination results from the Willful Breach of this Agreement by
Purchaser or Parent), (y) unless and until the Closing occurs, if the
Purchaser Group breaches this Agreement and/or the Transaction fails to be
consummated for any reason or no reason (in each case, whether willfully,
intentionally, unintentionally or otherwise), then except for the right to
seek specific performance and payment of Seller's costs and expenses
associated therewith, in each case, in accordance with and subject to the
terms and conditions of Section 9.11 of this Agreement or paragraph 5 of the
Equity Commitment Letter, the sole and exclusive remedy against the Purchaser,
Parent, any Financing Source, or any Non-Recourse Party (as defined in the
Guaranty) for any breach, Claims, Losses or failure to perform under this
Agreement shall be for Seller to terminate this Agreement in accordance with
Section 6.01 and, if applicable, receive payment of the Reverse Termination
Fee, and (z) in such cases, Seller shall not have, and expressly waives and
relinquishes, any other right, remedy or recourse (whether in contract or in
tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by statute)
or in equity). In no event shall Purchaser be required to pay the Reverse
Termination Fee on more than one (1) occasion. Under no circumstance shall
Seller be permitted or entitled to receive both a grant of specific
performance to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and the Transactions to
be consummated that results in the Closing and payment of the Reverse
Termination Fee; provided, that Seller shall be entitled and is hereby
expressly authorized to pursue simultaneous actions for the foregoing
(asserting in the alternative a claim for the Reverse Termination Fee
following termination should specific performance not be awarded). For the
avoidance of doubt, nothing in this Section 6.03(b)(ii) shall limit (1) any
remedies of Seller prior to a Specified Termination, including specific
performance and payment of Seller's costs and expenses associated therewith,
in each case, pursuant to Section 9.11, or (2) any of Purchaser's obligations
under or remedies available to Seller with respect to the Confidentiality
Agreement (whether in contract or in tort or otherwise, or whether at law
(including at common law or by statute) or in equity). The Financing Sources
are hereby named as third-party beneficiaries of this Section 6.03(b).

 

(c) If (i) this Agreement is terminated pursuant to (A) Section 6.01(b)(i)
and, at the time of such termination, all of the conditions set forth in
Section 5.01(a) and Section 5.02 have been satisfied or waived in writing
(except for such conditions to the Closing that by their nature are to be
satisfied at the Closing, each of which would be satisfied if the Closing then
occurred) and the Purchaser Group irrevocably confirms to Seller that the
Equity Financing and the Preferred Equity Financing and the Debt Financing are
available to be funded and the Purchaser Group otherwise stands ready, willing
and able to consummate the Closing, but for the Legal Restraint preventing the
satisfaction of the condition to Closing in Section 5.01(b) or (B) Section

   

6.01(b)(ii), and (ii) at the time of such termination, the Purchaser Group is
not in breach of any representation or warranty or its covenants or agreements
such that any condition set forth in set forth in Section 5.02(a) or Section
5.02(b) could not then be satisfied, then Seller shall pay to Parent, as
promptly as possible (but in any event within five (5) Business Days following
the delivery by Parent of an invoice therefor, together with reasonable
supporting documentation), the reasonable and documented out-of-pocket third-
party costs and expenses incurred by the Purchaser Group in connection with
the Transactions (the "Purchaser Expenses"); provided, that Seller shall not
be required to pay more than an aggregate of $5,000,000 in Purchaser Expenses
pursuant to this Section 6.03(c); provided further, that for the avoidance of
doubt, nothing in this Section 6.03(c) shall limit Seller's liability for
Fraud or any Willful Breach occurring prior to termination.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party on behalf of
itself, its Subsidiaries, and each of its controlled Affiliates agrees that
(i) neither the Debt Financing Source nor the Preferred Equity Investor shall
have any liability hereunder (whether in contract or in tort, in law or in
equity, or granted by statute) for any claims, causes of action, obligations,
or losses arising under, out of, in connection with, or related in any manner
to this Agreement or based on, in respect of or by reason of this Agreement or
its negotiation, execution, performance, or breach (provided that nothing in
this Section 6.03 shall limit the liability or obligations of (x) the Debt
Financing Source under the Debt Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements
with respect to the Debt Financing or (y) the Preferred Equity Investor under
the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements with
respect to the Preferred Equity Financing); (ii) only Purchaser (including its
permitted successors and assigns under the Commitment Letter) shall be
permitted to bring any claim against the Debt Financing Source for failing to
satisfy any obligation to fund the Debt Financing pursuant to the terms of the
Debt Commitment Letter; and (iii) only Purchaser (including its permitted
successors and assigns under the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter) shall be
permitted to bring any claim against the Preferred Equity Investor for failing
to satisfy any obligation to fund the Preferred Equity Financing pursuant to
the terms of the Preferred Equity Commitment Letter.

 

(e)Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, each Party on behalf of
itself, its Subsidiaries, and each of its controlled Affiliates agrees that
(i) the Debt Financing Source shall not have any liability hereunder (whether
in contract or in tort, in law or in equity, or granted by statute) for any
claims, causes of action, obligations, or losses arising under, out of, in
connection with, or related in any manner to this Agreement or based on, in
respect of or by reason of this Agreement or its negotiation, execution,
performance, or breach (provided that nothing in this Section 6.03 shall limit
the liability or obligations of the Debt Financing Source under the Debt
Commitment Letter or any definitive agreements with respect to the Debt
Financing); and (ii) only Purchaser (including its permitted successors and
assigns under the Commitment Letter) shall be permitted to bring any claim
against the Debt Financing Source for failing to satisfy any obligation to
fund the Debt Financing pursuant to the terms of the Debt Commitment Letter.

 

(f)The provisions of this Section 6.03 are an integral part of the
Transactions and, without such provisions, the Parties would not have entered
into this Agreement. Each Party acknowledges and agrees, on behalf of itself
and its Affiliates, that the payment of the Seller Termination Fee, the
Reverse Termination Fee or the Purchaser Expenses, as applicable, is not a
penalty but instead is liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that shall
compensate the Purchaser Group and its Affiliates (in the case of the Seller
Termination Fee or the Purchaser

   

Expenses) and Seller and its Affiliates (in the case of the Reverse
Termination Fee) in the circumstances in which the Seller Termination Fee, the
Reverse Termination Fee or the Purchaser Expenses, as applicable, is payable
for the efforts and resources expended and the opportunities foregone while
negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement and on the
expectation of the consummation of the Transactions, which amount would
otherwise be impossible to calculate with precision.

 

ARTICLE VII 
INDEMNIFICATION

 

7.01Survival

 

. Except as set forth below, the representations and warranties of the Parties
contained in this Agreement shall not survive the Closing, and all Claims with
respect thereto shall terminate at and as of the Closing. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Fundamental Representations shall survive the Closing until,
and terminate on, the date that is three (3) years after the Closing Date to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law. All of the covenants and
agreements of the Parties contained in this Agreement that, by their terms,
are to be performed or complied with in their entirety at or prior to the
Closing, and all Claims with respect thereto, shall terminate at and as of the
Closing. All of the covenants and agreements of the Parties contained in this
Agreement that, by their terms, are to be performed or complied with in whole
or in part after the Closing, and all Claims with respect thereto, shall
survive for the period provided in such covenants and agreements, if any, or
until performed in accordance with their respective terms.

 

7.02Indemnification.

 

(a)From and after the Closing, subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE
VII, Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser Group, its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives (collectively, the "Purchaser Indemnified
Persons") for, and defend and hold the Purchaser Indemnified Persons harmless
from and against, (i) any Claims asserted against alleging, and any and all
Losses actually paid or incurred by, any Purchaser Indemnified Person as a
result of any breach of any Fundamental Representations, (ii) any and all
Losses actually paid or incurred by any Purchaser Indemnified Person as a
result of any breach after the Closing of any covenant or agreement of Seller
or any of its Subsidiaries (but excluding, from and after the Closing, the
Nutrition Entities) set forth in this Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement
(other than the Transition Service Agreement), (iii) any Transaction Expenses,
to the extent not paid by Seller, and (iv) the matters set forth on Section
7.02(a) of the Seller Disclosure Letter.

 

(b)From and after the Closing, subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE
VII, the Purchaser Group shall indemnify Seller, its Affiliates and its and
their respective Representatives (excluding for the avoidance of doubt
stockholders solely in their capacity as such) (collectively, the "Seller
Indemnified Persons" and collectively with Purchaser Indemnified Persons, the
"Indemnified Persons") for, and defend and hold Seller Indemnified Persons
harmless from and against, any and all Losses actually paid or incurred by any
Seller Indemnified Person as a result of any breach after the Closing of any
covenant or agreement of the Purchaser Group set forth in this Agreement and
any Ancillary Agreement (other than the Transition Services Agreement).

   

7.03Limitations on Indemnification.

 

(a)The amount of indemnifiable Losses which the Party from which
indemnification is sought pursuant to Section 7.02 (the "Indemnifying Party")
is or may be required to pay to any Indemnified Person pursuant to this
ARTICLE VII shall be reduced (retroactively, if necessary) by any insurance
proceeds (net of reasonable and documented out-of-pocket recovery costs and
any increase in insurance premiums) received by such Indemnified Person
related to such indemnifiable Losses, and an Indemnified Person shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to receive or recover such insurance proceeds,
it being understood that in no event will any indemnification payment under
this ARTICLE VII be delayed in anticipation of the receipt of such proceeds.
If an Indemnified Person shall have received the payment required by this
Agreement from the Indemnifying Party in respect of indemnifiable Losses and
subsequently receives (or any of its Affiliates shall subsequently receive)
any insurance proceeds in respect of such indemnifiable Losses, then such
Indemnified Person shall promptly repay, or cause to be repaid, to the
Indemnifying Party a sum equal to the amount of such insurance proceeds
received (net of the recovery costs set forth above). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, (i) it is the intention of the Parties that Seller, and not the RandW
Insurance Policy, be the primary (and, with respect to any claims pursuant to
Section 7.02(a)(iii)-(iv), the sole) source of recovery for claims borne by
the Purchaser Indemnified Persons that are indemnifiable pursuant to Section
7.02(a)(i) and Section 7.02(a)(iii)-(iv), and (ii) no Purchaser Indemnified
Persons shall be obligated to make or pursue a claim under the RandW Insurance
Policy with respect to such claims prior to seeking indemnification from
Seller pursuant to this Article VII with respect to such claims (or at any
point thereafter) (nor solely with respect to any claims pursuant to Section
7.02(a)(iii)-(iv) shall amounts recovered under the RandW Insurance Policy
reduce the indemnification obligations of Seller with respect to such claims).

 

(b)In addition to the requirements of Section 7.03(a), each Indemnified Person
shall take all reasonable actions to mitigate all indemnifiable Losses as
required by applicable Law. In the event an Indemnified Person fails to take
such actions, such Indemnifying Party shall have no Liability for any portion
of such indemnifiable Losses that reasonably could have been avoided had such
Indemnified Person taken such actions.

 

(c)Subject to the rights of any Person providing insurance as contemplated by
Section 7.03(a), the Indemnifying Party shall be subrogated to any right,
defense or Claim that the Indemnified Person may have against any other Person
with respect to any matter giving rise to a Claim for indemnification
hereunder. Such Indemnified Person shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party
in a reasonable manner, at the sole cost and expense of the Indemnifying
Party, in presenting any subrogated right, defense or Claim.

 

(d)In no event shall the Purchaser Group (as a group) or the Seller have
aggregate liability (including with respect to any claims based on Fraud)
under this ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE VIII to the Seller Indemnified Persons or
the Purchaser Indemnified Persons, respectively, in excess of the Purchase
Price actually received under this Agreement.

 

(e)If the Closing occurs, except with respect to Fraud (but subject to Section
7.03(d)) or under any Ancillary Agreement (other than any certificate required
to be delivered at or prior to the Closing pursuant to Section 5.02(c) or
Section 5.03(d)), (i) the indemnification

   

provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE VIII shall be the sole
and exclusive remedy available to any Indemnified Person (including Purchaser,
Parent and Seller) related to or in connection with this Agreement or the
Transactions, (ii) neither Purchaser, Parent nor Seller shall be liable or
responsible in any manner whatsoever (whether for indemnification or
otherwise) to any Indemnified Person for a breach of this Agreement or in
connection with any of the Transactions, including the purchase of the
Nutrition Stock pursuant hereto, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE VIII, and (iii) each
Party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, any
and all rights, claims and causes of action (A) for any breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein
or (B) otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, in each
case, that it may have against the other Party and its Representatives arising
under or based upon any applicable Law, except pursuant to the indemnification
provisions set forth in this ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE VIII or in respect of
Fraud; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 7.03(e) shall (x) limit
the rights or remedies of, or constitute a waiver of any rights or remedies
by, any Person pursuant to (or shall otherwise operate to interfere with the
operation of) Section 1.07 (Post-Closing Adjustment) or Section 9.11 (Specific
Enforcement) or (y) limit the rights of Purchaser to equitable relief with
respect to any breaches of Section 4.14 (Restrictive Covenants) or (z) limit
causes of action arising from any breach or non-performance of this ARTICLE
VII and ARTICLE VIII (pursuant to the terms and subject to the limitations
thereof). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, after
the Closing, no breach of any covenant or agreement in this Agreement,
individually or in the aggregate, shall give rise to any right on the part of
any Party to rescind this Agreement or the Transaction.

 

(f)All indemnifiable Losses shall be determined without duplication of
recovery under other provisions of this Agreement or any other document or
agreement delivered in connection with this Agreement. Without limiting the
generality of the prior sentence, if a set of facts, conditions or events
constitutes a breach of more than one (1) representation, warranty, covenant
or agreement of this Agreement that is subject to an indemnification
obligation under this ARTICLE VII and ARTICLE VIII, only one (1) recovery of
the same indemnifiable Losses covering the same time period shall be allowed
with respect to such set of facts, conditions or events, and in no event shall
there be any indemnification or duplication of payments or recovery for the
same Losses covering the same time period under different provisions of this
Agreement arising out of the same set of facts, conditions or events.

 

(g)Neither Party shall have any right to off-set or set-off any payment due
pursuant to this ARTICLE VII or ARTICLE VIII.

 

(h)The Purchaser Group and Seller agree to treat, and to cause their
respective Affiliates to treat, for all Tax purposes, any payment made under
this ARTICLE VII or ARTICLE VIII, to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable Law, as an adjustment to the Purchase Price.

 

(i)Notwithstanding anything herein, neither this ARTICLE VII nor ARTICLE VIII
shall in any way limit any claim or recovery available to any Purchaser
Indemnified Person under the RandW Insurance Policy, if any.

   

7.04Indemnification Procedures

 

.

 

(a)Any Indemnified Person seeking indemnification under Section 7.02 shall
assert any Claim for indemnification, including any Third-Party Claim, by
delivering written notice thereof (a "Claim Notice") in accordance with
Section 9.03 to the Indemnifying Party as soon as reasonably practicable upon
becoming aware of any fact or circumstance that may give rise to an
indemnification Claim under Section 7.02, provided, that the failure to give
such notice shall not eliminate the right to indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent that such delay has resulted in the loss of
substantive rights with respect to the ability to defend such claim. Each
Claim Notice shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the Claim,
shall reference the provision or provisions of this Agreement under which the
Claim is asserted and, if applicable, the applicable sections of this
Agreement which are alleged to have been breached by the Indemnifying Party,
and attach copies of all material written evidence thereof that the
Indemnified Person has received from any Person that is not a Party or a
Person Affiliated with a Party (a "Third Party"). The date of delivery of such
Claim Notice is referred to herein as the "Claim Date." If the Indemnifying
Party objects to any Claims within such Claim Notice, such objection must be
made in writing delivered to the Indemnified Person within thirty (30) days
after the Claim Date (the "Objection Notice"). The Indemnified Person and the
Indemnifying Party shall attempt to resolve any dispute for a period of thirty
(30) days from the date of the delivery of the Objection Notice to the
Indemnified Person and thereafter, such dispute may be resolved in the manner
contemplated by Section 9.13.

 

(b)Upon receipt by an Indemnifying Party of a Claim Notice in respect of a
Claim brought by a Third Party (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnifying Party
shall be entitled to (i) assume and have sole control over the defense and
investigation of such Third-Party Claim at its sole cost and expense (subject
to the last sentence of this Section 7.04(b)) and with counsel of its own
choosing, provided such counsel is reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified
Person, if it gives notice of its intention to do so to the Indemnified Person
within thirty (30) days after the delivery of such Claim Notice by the
Indemnified Person and (ii) negotiate a settlement or compromise of, or
consent to the entry of an Order with respect to, such Claim; provided that,
if such settlement, compromise or consent (1) does not include a full release
by such Third Party of all applicable Indemnified Persons for all Losses with
respect to such Third-Party Claim, (2) does not only involve a monetary
payment that will be paid in full by the Indemnifying Party, (3) includes any
statement or admission of fact regarding culpability of the Indemnified
Parties, and/or (4) involves any injunctive relief against the Indemnified
Parties, such settlement, compromise or consent shall be permitted only with
the prior written consent of such Indemnified Person (whether or not such
Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to such Third-Party Claim),
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If
the Indemnifying Party elects to assume control of the defense and
investigation of any such Third-Party Claim, then the Indemnified Person shall
be entitled to participate in (but not control) such defense and investigation
at such Indemnified Person's sole cost and expense.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 7.04(b), the
Indemnifying Party shall not be entitled to assume and control the defense or
investigation of any Third-Party Claim that (i) seeks an injunction or other
equitable relief against an Indemnified Person, (ii) involves an allegation
that an Indemnified Person committed a criminal act, (iii) gives rise to one
or more legal or equitable defenses available to the Indemnified Party and
that counsel

   

for the Indemnifying Party could not adequately represent the Indemnified
Party's interests and asset such defenses because they conflict with the
interests of the Indemnifying Party, or (iv) the settlement of, or an adverse
judgment with respect thereto is, in the good faith judgment of the
Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedential custom or practice
adverse to the continuing business interests of the Indemnifying Party or
materially and adversely affect the Indemnified Party other than as a result
of money damages or other money payments. If, within thirty (30) days after
delivery by an Indemnified Person of any Claim Notice with respect to a Third-
Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party (1) (A) notifies such Indemnified Person
in writing that the Indemnifying Party does not elect to defend and
investigate such Third-Party Claim or (B) fails to deliver to the Indemnified
Person a written election to assume the defense and investigation of such
Third-Party Claim, (2) pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.04(c),
is not entitled to assume the defense or investigation of such Third-Party
Claim or (3) the Indemnifying Party has failed to use commercially reasonable
efforts to prosecute or defend such claim, then (I) such Indemnified Person
may, at its option, defend, investigate, settle or compromise, or consent to
an entry of an Order with respect to, such Third-Party Claim for the account
and risk of the Indemnifying Person; provided that any such settlement,
compromise or consent shall be permitted only with the prior written consent
of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed; provided, however, any such consent shall not
represent the agreement of the Indemnifying Party that any such Third-Party
Claims is an indemnifiable Claim under this Agreement or the amount of Losses
recoverable hereunder, and (II) the Indemnifying Party may participate in (but
not control) any such defense and investigation at its sole cost and expense.

 

(d)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7.04 to the contrary, ARTICLE VIII
shall govern for purposes of any Third-Party Claim that is a Tax Claim.

 



 

ARTICLE VIII 
TAX MATTERS

 

8.01Seller Tax Indemnification

 

. From and after the Closing, subject to the other provisions of this ARTICLE
VIII, Seller shall indemnify Purchaser for, and defend and hold Purchaser
harmless from and against, any and all Losses actually suffered, paid or
incurred by Purchaser, the Subsidiaries of Purchaser (including, after the
Closing, the Nutrition Entities) and their respective officers, directors,
agents, attorneys and employees (collectively, the "Purchaser Tax Indemnified
Parties") as a result of or related to (a) any Taxes of the Nutrition Entities
for a Pre-Closing Tax Period, or (b) any Taxes that any Nutrition Entity is
liable for, including under U.S. Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-6 (or
under any similar provision of foreign, state, local or other Law) as a result
of being a member of (or leaving) any Affiliated Group (including a Seller
Affiliated Group) on or before the Closing Date, in each case, except to the
extent such Taxes (i) are reflected in the Closing Statement or otherwise were
taken into account in determining the Adjustment Amount pursuant to Section
1.07, or (ii) result from any action or transaction engaged in by the
Nutrition Entities or their Affiliates on the Closing Date but after the
Closing that is not contemplated by this Agreement and is outside of the
ordinary course of business.

 

8.02Purchaser Tax Indemnification

 

. From and after the Closing, the Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for, and
defend and hold Seller harmless from and against, any and all Losses actually
suffered, paid or incurred by Seller, the Subsidiaries of Seller and their
respective officers,

   

directors, agents, attorneys and employees (collectively, the "Seller Tax
Indemnified Parties") as a result of or related to any (a) Taxes arising from
any action or transaction by the Purchaser Group, the Nutrition Entities or
their respective Affiliates outside the ordinary course of business on the
Closing Date after the Closing, (b) Transfer Taxes for which the Purchaser
Group is responsible under Section 8.09; and (c) costs and expenses, including
reasonable legal fees and expenses, attributable to any item described in the
foregoing clauses (a) and (b).

 

8.03Tax Returns

 

.

 

(a)Seller shall timely prepare and file (or cause to be timely prepared and
filed) (i) all Tax Returns of any Seller Affiliated Group (including Tax
Returns that are required to be filed by or with respect to any Nutrition
Entity as part of a Seller Affiliated Group for Tax years or periods ending on
or before the Closing Date), (ii) all other income Tax Returns required to be
filed with respect to any Nutrition Entity for any Tax period ending on or
before the Closing Date (other than any Straddle Period), and (iii) all other
Tax Returns required to be filed with respect to any Nutrition Entity by
Seller or any of its Subsidiaries that are due (taking into account requests
for extensions to file such returns) on or before the Closing Date (those Tax
Returns described in clauses (i) to (iii), "Seller Tax Returns"). In each
case, subject to the limitations described in Section 8.01, Seller shall
timely remit (or cause to be timely remitted) any Taxes shown as due on such
Seller Tax Returns. As any such Seller Tax Return relates to the Nutrition
Entities, (A) Seller shall prepare such Seller Tax Returns in accordance with
past practices of the Nutrition Entities, (B) completed drafts of any such
Seller Tax Returns filed after the Closing Date shall be submitted to
Purchaser not later than thirty (30) days prior to the due date for filing
such Seller Tax Return (or, if such due date is within forty-five (45) days
following the Closing Date, as promptly as practicable following the Closing
Date) for Purchaser's review and comment; provided, that with respect to any
Tax Return of a Seller Affiliated Group, Seller shall be obligated to provide
only pro forma statements (including the relevant data used to create such pro
forma statements, excluding data that may disclose information about the
operations of any member of a Seller Affiliated Group other than a Nutrition
Entity) reporting the operations of the Nutrition Entities on a separate
return basis, and (C) Seller shall consider in good faith any changes to such
Seller Tax Returns described in clause (ii) above that are reasonably
requested by Purchaser, and shall make any changes to any Seller Tax Return
described in clause (ii) above that Purchaser reasonably determines are
necessary to enable an authorized officer of the applicable Nutrition Entity
to sign such Seller Tax Return.

 

(b)Except as described in Section 8.03(a), Purchaser shall timely prepare and
file (or cause to be timely prepared and filed) all Tax Returns of the
Nutrition Entities for all taxable periods that are required to be filed after
the Closing Date. To the extent that any such Tax Returns report matters for
which indemnification may be claimed from Seller pursuant to Section 8.01,
then: (i) Purchaser shall prepare (or cause to be prepared) such Tax Returns
in accordance with past practices of the applicable Nutrition Entity, (ii)
completed drafts of such Tax Returns shall be submitted to Seller not later
than thirty (30) days (or five (5) days in the case of non-income Tax Returns)
prior to the due date for filing such Tax Returns (or, if such due date is
within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, as promptly as
practicable prior to such due date), (iii) Seller shall have the right to
review and comment on each such Tax Return prior to the filing thereof, and
(iv) to the extent relating to the matters for which indemnification may be
claimed from Seller pursuant to Section 8.01, Purchaser shall make any changes
to such Tax Returns reasonably requested by Seller. Without limiting the
obligations of Seller under Section 8.01, Purchaser shall

   

remit (or cause to be remitted) any Taxes due with respect to such Tax Returns
Purchaser files pursuant to this Section 8.03(b). No delay of Purchaser in
providing Tax Returns for Seller to review pursuant to this Section 8.03(b)
shall reduce or otherwise affect the obligations or liabilities of Seller
pursuant to this Agreement (including the obligations of Seller under Section
8.01), except to the extent Seller is actually and materially prejudiced by
such delay. 

 

(c) For the avoidance of doubt, the Parties hereto agree that (i) the taxable
year of the Nutrition Entities shall end for U.S. federal income Tax purposes
as of the end of the Closing Date and, to the extent permissible under
applicable Laws, the Nutrition Entities shall elect to have each of their
other taxable years end as of the end of the Closing Date; and (ii) neither
Party will make a ratable allocation election under Treasury Regulation
Section 1.1502-76(b)(2)(ii) or any other similar provision of Law. In
accordance with Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76 and any analogous
provision of Law, any Tax related to an extraordinary transaction not
contemplated by this Agreement that occurs on the Closing Date after the
Closing shall be allocated to the taxable period beginning after the Closing
Date. In addition, the principles of the preceding sentence shall apply in the
absence of an analogous provision of Law and in the case of Straddle Periods.

 

8.04Tax Contests.

 

(a)If any Taxing Authority asserts a Tax Claim with respect to a Pre-Closing
Tax Period, then the Party first receiving notice of such Tax Claim promptly
shall provide written notice thereof to the other Party; provided, however,
that the failure of such Party to give such prompt notice shall not relieve
the other Party of any of its obligations under this ARTICLE VIII, except to
the extent that the other Party is materially and actually prejudiced by such
failure. Such notice shall specify in reasonable detail the basis for such Tax
Claim and shall include a copy of the relevant portion of any correspondence
received from the Taxing Authority.

 

(b)Seller shall have the exclusive right to, at its expense, control (or
assume control of) any Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding to the extent that such Tax
Claims or Tax Proceeding involves Taxes or information related thereto with
respect to any Nutrition Entity for any taxable period ending on or prior to
the Closing Date; provided, that Purchaser shall have the right, at its
expense, to participate in any such Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding other than any
Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding regarding any Tax Return of a Seller Affiliated
Group. Except with respect to Tax Claims or Tax Proceedings involving Taxes or
Tax Returns of a Seller Affiliated Group, Seller shall not settle any Tax
Claim or Tax Proceeding that it controls pursuant to this Section 8.04(b)
without the consent of Purchaser, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld, conditioned or delayed. Upon the request of Seller, Purchaser shall
execute any powers of attorney or similar documents that may be required to
effectuate the intent of this Section 8.04(b); provided, that Seller shall
reimburse Purchaser for all reasonable expenses incurred by Purchaser (or any
Purchaser Affiliate) in the course of complying with such request. Seller may
elect in writing not to control any Tax Claim that Seller otherwise has the
right to control pursuant to this Section 8.04(b). If Seller makes such
election with respect to a Tax Claim, the Purchaser Group shall have the right
and obligation to conduct, at its own expense, such Tax Claim; provided, that
the Purchaser shall not settle, or permit to be settled, any such Tax Claim
for which the Seller would have an indemnification obligation pursuant to
Section 8.01 without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

   

(c)Purchaser shall have the exclusive right to control any Tax Claim or Tax
Proceeding with respect to any Nutrition Entity for any taxable period ending
after the Closing Date; provided, that with respect to any such Tax Claim or
Tax Proceeding relating to a Straddle Period, Seller shall have the right, at
its expense, to participate in any such Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding.
Purchaser shall not settle any such Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding relating to a
Straddle Period without the consent of Seller, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed.

 

8.05Cooperation and Exchange of Information

 

. Each Party shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, provide to the other
Party such cooperation, documentation and information as either of them
reasonably may request in connection with (i) filing any Tax Return, amended
Tax Return or claim for refund, (ii) determining a liability for Taxes or an
indemnity obligation under this ARTICLE VIII or a right to refund of Taxes or
(iii) preparing for or conducting any Tax Claim or Tax Proceeding; provided,
that with respect to any Tax Return of a Seller Affiliated Group, Seller shall
be obligated only to provide pro forma statements setting forth in sufficient
detail any information relevant for determining the amount of any Taxes of the
Nutrition Entities, if any, shown as due on such Tax Return (which information
shall include the relevant data used to create such pro forma statements).
Each Party shall make its employees reasonably available on a mutually
convenient basis at its cost to provide explanation of any documents or
information so provided.

 

8.06Tax Sharing Agreements

 

. Seller shall terminate or cause to be terminated, on or before the Closing
Date, all Tax sharing, allocation or indemnity agreements or arrangements
(other than this Agreement), if any, to which any of the Nutrition Entities,
on the one hand, and any other Person, on the other hand, are parties, and
none of the Nutrition Entities, or any of their respective Affiliates, shall
have any rights or obligations thereunder after the Closing.

 

8.07Payments, Refunds, Credits and Carrybacks.

 

(a)Payments due to a Purchaser Tax Indemnified Party or a Seller Tax
Indemnified Party under this ARTICLE VIII shall be made within twenty (20)
days following written notice, including relevant supporting calculations
(such notice and calculations, the "Indemnification Notice") by the
Indemnified Person that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing
Authority or other applicable third party is or was due by the Indemnified
Person, which Indemnification Notice shall be delivered as soon as reasonably
practicable upon becoming aware of any fact or circumstance that gives rise to
an indemnification claim under Section 8.01 or Section 8.02; provided,
however, that if the Indemnifying Party disputes any items set forth in such
Indemnification Notice, it shall notify the Indemnified Person (by written
notice within ten (10) days of delivery of the relevant Indemnification
Notice) of the dispute and the basis for its objection. If the Indemnifying
Party does not object by written notice within such period, the amount of
Losses set forth on such Indemnification Notice shall be deemed accepted and
agreed upon, and final, conclusive and binding upon the Parties. Otherwise,
the Parties shall cooperate and act in good faith to resolve any disputes
prior to the expiration of the twenty (20) day period within which the
Indemnifying Party is required to make payment pursuant to the first sentence
of this Section 8.07(a), and, if the Parties are unable to resolve any
disputed items within such period, the item or items in question shall be
resolved by the Accounting Arbitrator as promptly as practicable. The
determination by the Accounting Arbitrator of the amounts in the

   

Indemnification Notice shall be final, binding and conclusive on the Parties.
The fees and expenses of the Accounting Arbitrator shall be paid 50% by Seller
and 50% by the Purchaser Group. In the event of any dispute submitted to the
Accounting Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 8.07(a), the Indemnifying Party
shall pay or cause to be paid to the Indemnified Person, no later than three
(3) days following the determination by the Accounting Arbitrator, any amounts
shown as due on the final Indemnification Notice (as adjusted in accordance
with the determination by the Accounting Arbitrator).

 

(b)Any refunds of Taxes of the Nutrition Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax
Period shall be for the benefit of Seller. The Purchaser Group shall pay, or
cause its Affiliates to pay, to the Seller the amount of any such refund
(whether in the form of cash received or a direct credit or offset against
Taxes otherwise payable, and without interest other than interest received
from the applicable Governmental Authority), net of (i) any Taxes, and (ii)
any reasonable expenses that the Purchaser Group (or any Affiliate thereof)
has or will incur with respect to such refund (and related interest), in
readily available funds within fifteen (15) days of the actual receipt of the
refund or filing of the Tax Return claiming the application of the credit
against Taxes otherwise payable. To the extent permitted under applicable Law,
all such Tax refunds will be claimed in cash rather than applied as a credit
against Tax Liabilities for any Tax period beginning after the Closing Date.
The Purchaser Group shall, and shall cause its Affiliates to, take all actions
reasonably requested (and all necessary actions incidental to any such
request) by Seller to timely claim any refunds that will give rise to a
payment under this Section 8.07(b). Nothing in this Section 8.07(b) shall
require that the Purchaser Group make any payment with respect to any refund
for a Tax (and such refunds shall be for the benefit of the Purchaser Group
and the Nutrition Entities) that is with respect to (A) any refund of Tax that
is the result of the carrying back of any net operating loss or other Tax
attribute or Tax credit incurred in a taxable period (or portion thereof)
beginning after the Closing Date, (B) any refund for Tax that is reflected as
a current asset (or offset to a current liability) in the Actual Net Working
Capital Amount or (C) any refund for Tax that gives rise to a payment
obligation by any Nutrition Entity to any Person under applicable Law or
pursuant to a provision of a contract or other agreement entered (or assumed)
by any Nutrition Entity on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

8.08Elections

 

.

 

(a)Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the Purchaser
Group shall not make, and shall cause its Affiliates (including the Nutrition
Entities) not to make any election with respect to any Nutrition Entity
(including any election pursuant to Section 338 of the Code, Section 336(e) of
the Code or Treasury Regulation Section 301.7701-3), which election would be
effective on or prior to the Closing Date.

 

(b)If there would otherwise be an "attribute reduction amount" under Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1502-36(d) with respect to the Transactions, Seller shall
make an election (and, if it is not known whether there would otherwise be
such an attribute reduction amount at the time for filing such election,
Seller shall make a protective election) under Treasury Regulation Section
1.1502-36(d)(6) for the taxable year of Seller that includes the Closing Date
to reduce Seller's basis in the Nutrition Stock for U.S. federal income Tax
purposes by an amount not less than such attribute reduction amount.

   

8.09Transfer Taxes

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Purchaser
Group shall be responsible for 100% of any Transfer Taxes and related fees
imposed on or payable in connection with the Transactions. The Party
responsible under applicable Law for filing the Tax Returns with respect to
such Transfer Taxes shall prepare and timely file such Tax Returns and
promptly provide a copy of such Tax Return to the other Party. Seller and
Purchaser shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, cooperate to
timely prepare and file any Tax Returns or other filings relating to such
Transfer Taxes, including any claim for exemption or exclusion from the
application or imposition of any Transfer Taxes.

 

8.10Straddle Period

 

. In the case of any taxable period that includes (but does not end on) the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), the amount of any Taxes based on or
measured by income, payroll, sales or receipts of the Nutrition Entities for
the portion of such Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date
shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the close
of business on the Closing Date, and the amount of any other Taxes of the
Nutrition Entities for a Straddle Period which relate to the portion of such
Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date shall be deemed to
be the amount of such Tax for the entire taxable period multiplied by a
fraction the numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period
ending on (and including) the Closing Date and the denominator of which is the
number of days in the Straddle Period. Any credit or refund resulting from an
overpayment of Taxes for a Straddle Period shall be prorated based upon the
method employed in this Section 8.10, taking into account the type of Tax to
which the refund relates. In the case of Taxes in the form of interest or
penalties, all such Taxes shall be treated as attributable to the portion of
such Straddle Period ending on (and including) the Closing Date to the extent
relating to a Tax for a Pre-Closing Tax Period whether such items are
incurred, accrued or assessed, before or after the Closing Date. For the
avoidance of doubt, any payroll or other employment Taxes of the Nutrition
Entities for any Pre-Closing Tax Period that are deferred pursuant to Section
2302 of the CARES Act shall be treated as attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax
Period.

 

8.11Tax Matters Coordination and Survival

 

. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, indemnification
with respect to Taxes and the procedures relating thereto shall be governed
exclusively by this ARTICLE VIII and the provisions of ARTICLE VII shall not
apply, except for Section 7.03(e)-(h). The covenants and agreements of the
Seller and the Purchaser, including the indemnification obligations contained
in this ARTICLE VIII, shall survive the Closing Date until thirty (30) days
following the expiration of the applicable statutory periods of limitations.
The representations and warranties made pursuant to Section 2.11 and Section
2.12 shall not survive the Closing.

 

ARTICLE IX 
GENERAL PROVISIONS

 

9.01No Other Representations and Warranties

 

. Except for the representations and warranties expressly set forth in this
Agreement, the Ancillary Agreements and any certificates delivered hereunder
or thereunder, the Purchaser Group (i) specifically acknowledges and agrees
that neither Seller, the Nutrition Entities nor any of their respective
Affiliates, Representatives or equity holders nor any other Person makes, or
has made, any other express or implied representation or warranty whatsoever
(whether at law (including at common law or by statute) or in equity),
including with respect to the Nutrition Entities, the Business or their
respective

   

businesses, assets, employees, Permits, liabilities, operations, prospects,
condition (financial or otherwise) or any Projection, and (ii) specifically
acknowledges the Seller's express disclaimer and negation of any such other
representation or warranty (including regarding any Projection) and of all
liability and responsibility for any such other representation or warranty or
any Projection. The Purchaser Group acknowledges and agrees that it has
conducted its own independent investigation of the Transactions (including
with respect to the Nutrition Entities, the Business and their respective
businesses, operations, assets and liabilities) and, in making its
determination to enter into this Agreement and proceed with the Transactions,
has relied solely on the results of such independent investigation and the
representations and warranties expressly set forth in this Agreement, the
Ancillary Agreements and any certificates delivered hereunder or thereunder.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, except subject to the limitation
in Section 7.03(d), nothing (including this Section 9.01) shall limit a
Party's rights or remedies in respect of Fraud.

 

9.02Mutual Release

 

.

 

(a)Effective upon the Closing and without further action by any Person,
Seller, on behalf of itself and each of its Subsidiaries (other than the
Nutrition Entities) (each, a "Seller Releasing Person"), hereby irrevocably,

directors and officers of the Nutrition Entities solely in their capacity as
such and for the avoidance of doubt not in any capacity served at Seller or
its Subsidiaries (other than the Nutrition Entities)) (collectively, the

nature whatsoever, in each case arising or occurring or that could have arisen
or occurred from any actions, omissions or state of facts occurring, not

seek to recover any amounts in any forum in regard to any Seller Released
Claims from any of the Purchaser Released Parties (except as provided in this
Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement, in each case, only to the extent set
forth herein or therein). Seller, on behalf of itself and each other Seller
Releasing Person, acknowledges and agrees that facts in addition to or
different from those which are now known or believed to be true with respect
to the subject matter of this release may hereafter be discovered, but Seller,
on behalf of itself and each other Seller Releasing Person, agrees to remain
bound hereby and hereby fully releases all Seller Released Claims without
regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of different or additional
facts and waives the protection of any statute or doctrine limiting a release
of unknown or unsuspected Seller Released Claims. Without limitation of the
foregoing, Seller, on behalf of itself and each other Seller Releasing Person,
hereby waives the application of any provision of Law that purports to limit
the scope of a general release.

 

(b)Effective upon the Closing and without further action by any Person, Parent
and Purchaser, on behalf of themselves and each of the Nutrition Entities
(each, a "Purchaser Releasing Person" and together with the Seller Releasing
Persons, the "Releasing Persons"), hereby irrevocably, unconditionally and
fully waives, acquits, remises, and forever discharges and

   

releases each of Seller and its Subsidiaries (other than the Nutrition
Entities) (collectively, the "Seller Released Parties" and together with the
Purchaser Released Parties, the "Released Parties") from any and all
Liabilities of any kind or nature whatsoever, in each case arising or
occurring or that could have arisen or occurred from any actions, omissions or
state of facts occurring, not occurring or in existence (whether or not known)
on or prior to the Closing and whether absolute or contingent, liquidated or
unliquidated, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, matured or unmatured
or determined or determinable, and whether arising under any Law, Contract,
arrangement, or understanding, whether written or oral (other than this
Agreement and any Ancillary Agreement) or otherwise at law or in equity
(collectively, the "Purchaser Released Claims"), and Parent and Purchaser, on
behalf of themselves and each other Purchaser Releasing Person, covenants and
agrees not to sue, assert or otherwise seek to recover any amounts in any
forum in regard to any Purchaser Released Claims from any of the Seller
Released Parties (except as provided in this Agreement or any Ancillary
Agreement, in each case, only to the extent set forth herein or therein).
Purchaser, on behalf of itself and each other Purchaser Releasing Person,
acknowledges and agrees that facts in addition to or different from those
which are now known or believed to be true with respect to the subject matter
of this release may hereafter be discovered, but Parent and Purchaser, on
behalf of themselves and each other Purchaser Releasing Person, agrees to
remain bound hereby and hereby fully releases all Purchaser Released Claims
without regard to the subsequent discovery or existence of different or
additional facts and waives the protection of any statute or doctrine limiting
a release of unknown or unsuspected Purchaser Released Claims. Without
limitation of the foregoing, Parent and Purchaser, on behalf of itself and
each other Purchaser Releasing Person, hereby waives the application of any
provision of Law that purports to limit the scope of a general release.

 

(c)Notwithstanding anything in this Section 9.02, for the avoidance of doubt,
nothing in this Section 9.02 constitutes, or shall be deemed to constitute, a
release of (i) any claim, obligation, right or Liability that any Released
Party may have under this Agreement or any Ancillary Agreement or in respect
of Fraud, or (ii) claims described in Section 9.02(c) of the Seller Disclosure
Letter.

9.04Severability

 

. If any term or other provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced by any rule or Law, or public policy, all other
conditions and provisions of this Agreement shall nevertheless remain in full
force and effect so long as the economic or legal substance of the
Transactions is not affected in any manner materially adverse to any Party or
such Party waives its rights under this Section 9.04 with respect thereto.
Upon any determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or
incapable of being enforced, the Parties shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent

   

of the Parties as closely as possible in an acceptable manner to the end that
the Transactions are fulfilled to the extent possible.

 

9.05Counterparts

 

. This Agreement may be executed in one (1) or more counterparts (including by
means of email in .pdf format), all of which shall be considered one and the
same agreement, and shall become effective when one (1) or more counterparts
have been signed by each Party and delivered to the other Parties.

 

9.06Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries.

 

(a)This Agreement, together with the Ancillary Agreements and the
Confidentiality Agreement (except for paragraphs 5 and 8 of the
Confidentiality Agreement, which paragraphs of the Confidentiality Agreement,
except as set forth in the first sentence of Section 4.03(c), shall terminate
as of, and be of no further force or effect from and after, the date of this
Agreement), constitutes the entire agreement, and supersedes all prior
agreements and understandings, both written and oral, between or among the
Parties or their Affiliates with respect to the Transactions.

 

(b)Except as provided in Sections 4.08 and 7.02, each Party agrees that (1)
their respective representations, warranties, covenants and agreements set
forth in this Agreement are solely for the benefit of the other Parties, in
accordance with and subject to the terms of this Agreement and (2) this
Agreement is not intended to, and does not, confer upon any Person other than
the Parties any rights or remedies under this Agreement, including the right
to rely upon the representations and warranties set forth in this Agreement;
provided that the provisions of Sections 9.08 (Assignment), 9.09 (Amendment)
and this Section 9.06 (Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries) will
inure to the benefit of the Financing Sources all of whom are intended to be
third-party beneficiaries thereof.

 

9.07Governing Law

 

. This Agreement, and all Claims or causes of action (whether in contract or
in tort or otherwise, or whether at law (including at common law or by
statute) or in equity) that may be based on, arise out of or relate to this
Agreement or the negotiation, execution, performance, consummation or subject
matter of this Agreement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance
with the laws of the State of Delaware, without regard to principles of
conflict of laws.

 

9.08Assignment

 

. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or obligations under
this Agreement shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise, by any of the Parties without the prior written consent of the
other Parties, provided that the Purchaser Group, without the consent of any
Person shall be permitted to assign its rights and obligations hereunder or
under any instrument executed or delivered in connection herewith as
collateral security to any Debt Financing Source; provided, further, that no
such assignment shall relieve the Purchaser Group of any of its obligations
under this Agreement. Any purported assignment without such consent shall be
void. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Purchaser Group may and, as of and
following the Closing, any of the Purchaser Group, the Nutrition Entities and
any of their respective Subsidiaries may, pledge, transfer or assign its
respective rights hereunder to its financing sources as collateral security,
without the prior written consent of any

   

other party hereto. Subject to the preceding sentences, this Agreement shall
be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be enforceable by, the Parties
and their respective successors and assigns.

 

9.09Amendment

 

. This Agreement may be amended, modified and supplemented in any and all
respects any time prior to the Closing with respect to any of the terms of
this Agreement; provided that any such amendment, modification or supplement
shall be effective only if it is set forth in an instrument in writing
executed by each Party. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, Section 9.06 (Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries),
Sections 9.08 (Assignment), 9.13 (Jurisdiction; Venue), and this Section 9.09
(Amendment) (and any provision of this Agreement to the extent an amendment,
modification, waiver or termination of such provision would modify the

terminated in a manner that impacts or is adverse to the Financing Sources
without the prior written consent of the Financing Sources.

 

9.10Extension; Waiver

 

. The Parties may (a) extend the time for the performance of any of the
obligations or other acts of the other Parties, (b) waive any inaccuracies in
the representations and warranties in this Agreement or in any document
delivered pursuant to this Agreement, (c) waive compliance with any covenants
and agreements in this Agreement or (d) waive the satisfaction of any of the
conditions in this Agreement. Any agreement on the part of a Party to any such
extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such Party. The failure of any Party to this
Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or otherwise shall
not constitute a waiver of such rights.

 

9.11Specific Enforcement

 

.

 

(a)The Parties acknowledge and agree that irreparable damage would occur in
the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed in
accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached or threatened
to be breached and that monetary damages, even if available, would not be an
adequate remedy therefor. It is accordingly agreed that, at any time prior to
the termination of this Agreement pursuant to ARTICLE VI, the Parties shall be
entitled to an injunction or injunctions, specific performance or other
equitable remedies to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of terms and provisions
of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to cause the other Party to
effect the Closing (including, without limitation, the right of Seller to a
remedy of specific performance to enforce Parent's or Purchaser's obligation
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded and to consummate the Closing), in
any court referred to in Section 9.13, without proof of actual damages (and
each Party hereby waives any requirement for the securing or posting of any
bond in connection with such remedy), this being in addition to any other
remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. The Parties further
agree not to assert that a remedy of an injunction or injunctions, specific
performance or other equitable remedies to prevent breaches or threatened
breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the performance of
terms and provisions of this Agreement, including the right of a Party to
cause the other Party to effect the Closing, is unenforceable, invalid,
contrary to Law or inequitable for any reason, and not to assert that a remedy
of monetary damages would provide an adequate remedy for any breach or
threatened breach of this Agreement. If any Party commences a Proceeding to
enforce specifically the performance of the terms and provisions of this
Agreement when expressly available to such Party pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

   

this Agreement, the End Date shall be subject to a one-time automatic
extension until the 20th Business Day following the date on which such
Proceeding is finally resolved (if the End Date would otherwise occur on or
prior to such date); provided however, for the avoidance of doubt, that the
right of Seller to obtain specific performance to consummate the Closing or to
cause Purchaser or Parent to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to
consummate the Closing (including through Seller's third party beneficiary
rights thereunder), and the Purchaser Group's obligation to enforce its rights
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded, shall be subject to the
requirements in Section 9.11(b) at the time of such final determination by the
court presiding over such Proceeding. The costs and expenses of a Party that
is successful on the merits in any Proceeding brought to compel the specific
performance of this Agreement shall be paid by the other Party.

 

(b)Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement, it is explicitly agreed that
the right of Seller to obtain specific performance to consummate the Closing
or to cause Purchaser or Parent to cause the Equity Financing to be funded to
consummate the Closing (including through Seller's third party beneficiary
rights thereunder), and the Purchaser Group's obligation to enforce its rights
to cause the Equity Financing to be funded, shall be subject to the
requirements that:

 

(i)Purchaser has failed to consummate the Closing, and is required to
consummate the Closing, in accordance with Section 1.02;

 

(ii)the conditions set forth in Section 5.01 and Section 5.03 have been
satisfied or waived in writing (except for those conditions to the Closing
that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, each of which would
be satisfied if the Closing then occurred);

 

(iii)the Preferred Equity Financing and the Debt Financing (or, in either
case, any alternate financing in accordance with Section 4.12 in an amount
sufficient, when combined with the funds under the Equity Commitment Letter
and any available portion of the Preferred Equity Financing and/or the Debt
Financing, to consummate the Transactions) have been funded or will be funded
at the Closing if the Equity Financing is funded at the Closing; and

 

(iv)Seller has irrevocably confirmed in writing to Purchaser that if specific
performance is granted and the Preferred Equity Financing and the Debt
Financing (or, in either case, any alternate financing in accordance with
Section 4.12) are funded and the Equity Financing is funded, then Seller
stands ready, willing and able, and will take all actions, to consummate the
Closing.

 

9.12Further Assurances

 

. As a material obligation of each Party to consummate the Transactions, from
time to time after the Closing, each Party shall (a) cooperate with the other
Parties, (b) perform any further act and (c) execute and deliver such
documents, instruments or certificates, in each case, as may be reasonably
requested by the other Parties in order to effectuate the Transactions.

 

9.13Jurisdiction; Venue

 

. All Claims arising from, under or in connection with this Agreement shall be
raised to and exclusively determined by the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware or, to the extent such court does not have subject matter
jurisdiction, the Superior Court of the State of Delaware or the United States
District Court for the District of Delaware, each such

   

court to whose jurisdiction and venue the Parties unconditionally consent and
submit. Each Party hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives any objection
to the laying of venue of any such Claim in such court and hereby further
irrevocably and unconditionally waives and agrees not to plead or claim in any
such court that any such Claim brought in any such court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. Each Party further agrees that service of any process,
summons, notice or document by U.S. registered mail to the respective
addresses set forth in Section 9.03 shall be effective service of process for
any Claim brought against such Party in any such court. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if any claim is brought against the Debt Financing Source or the
Preferred Equity Investor, such claim will be governed by the law of the State
of New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law principles that
would result in the application of the laws of another state) and subject to
the jurisdiction limitations and waiver of jury trial provisions set forth in
the Debt Commitment Letter or Preferred Equity Commitment Letters, as
applicable, as if fully set forth herein. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
any claim is brought against the Debt Financing Source, such claim will be
governed by the law of the State of New York (without giving effect to any
conflicts of law principles that would result in the applicable of the laws of
another state) and subject to the jurisdiction limitations and waiver of jury
trial provisions set forth in the Debt Commitment Letter as if fully set forth
herein. The Debt Financing Source and the Preferred Equity Investor are hereby
named as third-party beneficiaries of this Section 9.13.

. EACH PARTY HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW,
ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR
OTHER PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT, INCLUDING ANY LITIGATION

PREFERRED EQUITY COMMITMENT LETTER. THE PREFERRED EQUITY INVESTOR IS HEREBY
NAMED AS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THIS SECTION 9.14. EACH PARTY (A)
CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE EVENT
OF ANY ACTION, SUIT OR PROCEEDING, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND
(B) ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO
THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVER AND CERTIFICATIONS IN
THIS SECTION 9.14.

. Each Party has participated in the drafting and negotiation of this
Agreement. If an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
