v    AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER   AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this
"AGREEMENT"), dated December 13, 2005 (the "AGREEMENT DATE"), by and among
ANTEON INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "COMPANY"),
GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Parent"), and
AVENGER ACQUISITION CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation and an indirect,
wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent (the "MERGER SUBSIDIARY").  
BACKGROUND   WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Parent, the
Merger Subsidiary and the Company deem it advisable and in the best interests
of their respective companies and stockholders to consummate the merger of
the Merger Subsidiary with and into the Company, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth herein, and have unanimously adopted resolutions
adopting, approving and declaring the advisability of this Agreement, the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated herein.   WHEREAS, pursuant
to the Merger, shares of the Company\'s common stock, par value $0.01 per
share (the "COMPANY COMMON STOCK"), shall be, except as otherwise provided
herein, converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as
defined below) in the manner set forth herein, and the Company shall become
an indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of the Parent.   NOW, THEREFORE, in
consideration of the mutual agreements contained in this Agreement, and for
other good and valuable consideration, the value, receipt and sufficiency of
which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:   ARTICLE I  THE
MERGER   SECTION 1.1 THE MERGER. Subject to the terms and conditions
of this Agreement, at the Effective Time the Merger Subsidiary shall be
merged with and into the Company (the "MERGER") in accordance with the
provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the
"DELAWARE ACT"). Following the Merger, the Company shall continue as the
surviving corporation (the "SURVIVING CORPORATION") and the separate
corporate existence of the Merger Subsidiary shall cease. As a result of the
Merger, the Surviving Corporation shall become an indirect, wholly-owned
subsidiary of the Parent. The Company and the Merger Subsidiary are sometimes
referred to collectively as the "CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS."   SECTION 1.2
THE CLOSING. Unless this Agreement has been terminated pursuant to SECTION
7.1, the closing of the Merger (the "CLOSING") shall take place at 10:00
a.m., local time, on a date no later than the second business day following
satisfaction or waiver of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI (the
"CLOSING DATE"), at the Washington, D.C. offices of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind,
Wharton and Garrison, LLP, unless another date, time or place is agreed to in
writing by the parties.      SECTION 1.3 EFFECTIVE TIME. Upon the terms
and subject to the satisfaction or waiver of the conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing (or at such other time as the parties may agree)
the Company shall execute and file with the Delaware Secretary of State an
appropriate certificate of merger (the "CERTIFICATE OF MERGER") in accordance
with Section 251 of the Delaware Act and make all other filings or recordings
required by the Delaware Act in connection with the Merger. The Merger shall
be consummated upon the filing of the Certificate of Merger with the Delaware
Secretary of State or such later time as is agreed upon by the parties and
specified in such Certificate of Merger. The time the Merger becomes
effective in accordance with the Delaware Act is referred to in this
Agreement as the "EFFECTIVE TIME."   SECTION 1.4 EFFECTS OF THE MERGER. The
Merger shall have the effects set forth in this Agreement and the relevant
provisions of the Delaware Act. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall succeed
to all the properties, rights, privileges, powers, franchises and assets of
the Constituent Corporations, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the
Constituent Corporations shall become debts, liabilities and duties of the
Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 1.5 ORGANIZATIONAL DOCUMENTS. At the
Effective Time, and without any further action on the part of the Constituent
Corporations, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Company
shall be amended in their entirety to read as set forth on EXHIBITS A and B
respectively, and thereby shall become the certificate of incorporation and
bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter amended in accordance
with their respective terms and the Delaware Act.   SECTION 1.6 DIRECTORS
AND OFFICERS. The directors and the officers of the Merger Subsidiary at the
Effective Time shall be the initial directors and officers of the Surviving
Corporation and shall hold office from the Effective Time in accordance with
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Corporation
until their respective successors are duly elected or appointed and qualified
or until their earlier death, resignation or removal.   SECTION 1.7
CONVERSION OF SHARES. As of the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and
without any action on the part of the Company, the Parent or the Merger
Subsidiary or their respective stockholders:   (a) each share of Company
Common Stock together with the associated Rights, if any, (each share of
Company Common Stock together with the associated Rights, if any, is
hereinafter referred to as a "SHARE" and collectively, the "SHARES"), other
than shares to be canceled in accordance with subsection (b) below and any
Dissenting Shares, issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time shall be converted into the right to receive $55.50 in cash, without
interest, (the "MERGER CONSIDERATION") payable to the holder thereof upon
surrender of the Certificate formerly representing such Share in the manner
provided in SECTION 2.2. All such Shares, when so converted, shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a Certificate shall cease to have any rights with
respect   2   to such Shares, except the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, without interest, upon the surrender of such Certificate in
accordance with SECTION 2.2;   (b) each Share owned immediately prior to the
Effective Time by the Company, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or any of
their respective Subsidiaries, including any such Shares held as treasury
stock of the Company, shall be canceled and extinguished and no consideration
shall be delivered in exchange therefor. For purposes of this section,
Company Common Stock owned beneficially or held of record by any plan,
program or arrangement sponsored or maintained for the benefit of any current
or former employee of the Company, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or any
of their respective Subsidiaries, shall not be deemed to be held by the
Company, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or any such Subsidiary, regardless
of whether the Company, the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary or any such
Subsidiary has the power, directly or indirectly, to vote or control the
disposition of such shares. For purposes of this Agreement, the term
"SUBSIDIARY" means, with respect to any Person, any other Person
fifty percent (50%) or more of the outstanding voting ownership securities of
which (or if there are no such voting interests, fifty percent (50%) or more
of the equity interests of which) are owned, directly or indirectly, by such
first Person; and   (c) each share of common stock, par value $1.00 per
share, of the Merger Subsidiary issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time will, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of the holder thereof, be converted into one share of common stock,
par value $1.00 per share, of the Surviving Corporation and shall constitute
the only outstanding shares of capital stock of the Surviving
Corporation.   (d) The holders of Dissenting Shares, if any, shall be
entitled to such rights as provided for in SECTION 2.5.   SECTION 1.8
COMPANY OPTIONS AND EQUITY-BASED AWARDS.   (a) As soon as reasonably
practicable following the Agreement Date, the Company shall take such action
as shall be required: (i) to cause the vesting of any outstanding but
unvested options to purchase shares of Company Common Stock (the "COMPANY
OPTIONS") granted pursuant to the Amended and Restated Anteon International
Corporation Omnibus Stock Plan (or any other stock option plan, program,
agreement or arrangement of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively,
the "COMPANY STOCK PLANS")) to be accelerated in full, effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time; (ii) to effectuate the cancellation, as of the
Effective Time, of all Company Options outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time (without regard to the exercise price of such Company
Options); (iii) to cause, pursuant to the Company Stock Plans,
each outstanding Company Option to represent as of the Effective Time solely
the right to receive, in accordance with this SECTION 1.8, a lump sum cash
payment in the amount of the Option Consideration (as defined below), if any,
with respect to such Company Option and to no longer represent the right to
purchase Company Common Stock or any other equity security of the Company,
the Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any other Person; and (iv) to cause
the transactions contemplated by this section to be   3   exempt from
the provisions of Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (together with the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, the
"EXCHANGE ACT").   (b) Each holder of a Company Option shall receive from
the Surviving Corporation, in respect and in consideration of each Company
Option so cancelled, as soon as practicable following the Effective Time (but
in any event not later than five business days after the Effective Time), an
amount equal to the product of (i) the excess, if any, of (A) the Merger
Consideration over (B) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock
subject to such Company Option, MULTIPLIED BY (ii) the total number of shares
of Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Option
(whether or not then vested or exercisable), without any interest thereon
(the "OPTION CONSIDERATION").   (c) As soon as practicable following the
execution of this Agreement, the Company shall mail to each person who is a
holder of Company Options a letter describing the treatment of and payment
for such Company Options pursuant to this SECTION 1.8 and providing
instructions for use in obtaining payment for such Company Options. Parent
shall at all times from and after the Effective Time maintain sufficient
liquid funds to satisfy its obligations to holders of Company Options
pursuant to this SECTION 1.8.   (d) As of the Effective Time, the Company
Stock Plans shall terminate and all rights under any provision of any other
plan, program or arrangement providing for the issuance or grant of any other
interest in respect of the capital stock of the Company shall be canceled. At
and after the Effective Time, no Person shall have any right under the
Company Options, the Company Stock Plans or any other plan, program or
arrangement with respect to equity securities of the Surviving Corporation or
any Subsidiary thereof, except the right to receive the amount payable under
this SECTION 1.8.   (e) Each right of any kind other than Company Options,
whether vested or unvested, contingent or accrued, to acquire or receive
Company Common Stock or to receive benefits measured by the value of a number
of shares of Company Common Stock, that may be held, awarded, outstanding,
credited, payable or reserved for issuance under the Company Stock Plans
(including restricted stock and performance shares or awards) (each, a
"COMPANY STOCK-BASED AWARD") outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time, whether vested or unvested, shall fully vest (at the maximum level of
possible payout, if applicable) by virtue of the Merger and without any
action on the part of the holder thereof, and the holder thereof shall
receive from the Surviving Corporation (and the Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to pay) within five (5) business days after the
Effective Time a cash payment with respect thereto equal to the product of
(x) the Merger Consideration and (y) the number of shares of Company Common
Stock subject to such Company Stock-Based Award (the "STOCK-
BASED PAYMENT").   (f) No additional Company Options, Company Stock-Based
Awards or other equity-based awards or other rights to acquire Company Common
Stock shall be granted pursuant to the Company Stock Plans or otherwise after
the Agreement Date.   4   (g) The Board of Directors of the Company
shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions as may be required or
appropriate such that, upon the Effective Time, each Company Option and
Company Stock Plan is treated in accordance with this SECTION 1.8.  
SECTION 1.9 EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN. The Board of Directors of the
Company shall adopt such resolutions or take such other actions with respect
to the Anteon International Corporation Employee Stock Purchase Plan, dated
as of April 11, 2004 (the "STOCK PURCHASE PLAN"), as may be required
or appropriate to provide that (i) no "Offering Period" (as defined in the
Stock Purchase Plan) shall commence following the Agreement Date and (ii) the
Stock Purchase Plan (and, subject to subparagraph (i), any Offering Period
thereunder) shall terminate, effective as of the Effective Time, and each
outstanding option, if any, for the Offering Period that terminates at the
Effective Time shall be canceled and each participant in the Stock Purchase
Plan for that Offering Period shall be entitled to receive, within five (5)
business days following the Effective Time, in lieu of any other amounts
otherwise payable to such participant under the Stock Purchase Plan with
respect to such participant\'s options, an amount in cash equal to the sum of
(a) (x) the Merger Consideration multiplied by (y) the number of whole shares
of Company Common Stock that would have been issuable upon exercise of such
options had they been exercised at the Effective Time and the participant
purchased the maximum number of shares subject thereto at the applicable
"Purchase Price" (as defined in the Stock Purchase Plan) and using the full
amount of his or her "contributions" (as defined in the Stock Purchase Plan)
to the Stock Purchase Plan for that Offering Period sufficient to purchase
whole shares and (b) the amount of any such "contributions" that would not
have been sufficient to purchase a whole share.   SECTION 1.10 ADJUSTMENTS.
In the event of any stock split, reverse stock split, stock dividend
(including any dividend or distribution of securities convertible into
capital stock), reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change with respect to the Company Common
Stock occurring after the Agreement Date and prior to the Effective Time, all
references in this Agreement to specified numbers of shares of any class
or series affected thereby, and all calculations provided for that are based
upon numbers of shares of any class or series affected thereby, shall be
adjusted to the extent necessary to provide the parties the same economic
effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such stock split, reverse
stock split, stock dividend, reorganization, reclassification, combination,
recapitalization or other like change.   ARTICLE II  PAYMENT   SECTION
2.1 SURRENDER OF CERTIFICATES. From and after the Effective Time, each holder
of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented an
outstanding Share (a "CERTIFICATE") shall be entitled to receive in exchange
therefor, upon surrender thereof to the Paying Agent, the Merger
Consideration into which the Shares formerly evidenced by such Certificate
were converted into the right to receive pursuant to the Merger. No interest
shall be payable on the Merger Consideration   5   to be paid to any
holder of a Certificate irrespective of the time at which such Certificate is
surrendered for exchange.   SECTION 2.2 PAYING AGENT; CERTIFICATE SURRENDER
PROCEDURES.   (a) Prior to the Effective Time, the Parent shall designate
(with the approval of the Company, not to be unreasonably withheld), or shall
cause to be designated, a bank or trust company based in the United States,
to act as agent for the payment of the Merger Consideration upon surrender of
Certificates (the "PAYING AGENT").   (b) Immediately prior to the Effective
Time, the Parent shall deposit, or cause to be deposited, with the Paying
Agent, an amount in cash sufficient to provide all funds necessary for the
Paying Agent to make prompt payment of the aggregate Merger Consideration
payable pursuant to SECTION 1.7 (the "PAYMENT FUND"). For purposes of
determining the amount of Merger Consideration to be so deposited, the Parent
and the Merger Subsidiary shall assume that no holder of Company Common Stock
shall perfect any right to appraisal of his, her or its Company Common Stock.
Pending payment of such funds to the holders of Certificates, the Payment
Fund shall be held and may be invested by the Paying Agent pursuant to the
terms of the agreement entered into between the Parent and the Paying Agent
(which such agreement shall be reasonably acceptable to the Company). The
Parent shall replenish the Payment Fund to the extent of any investment
losses any monies lost through any investment made pursuant to this
subsection (b).   (c) As soon as reasonably practicable, and in any event
not later than three (3) business days, after the Effective Time, the Parent
shall instruct the Paying Agent to mail to each record holder of a
Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery
shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to such Certificates shall
pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and shall be
in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender
of Certificates for the Merger Consideration. Upon the surrender to the
Paying Agent of a Certificate together with a duly executed and completed
letter of transmittal and all other documents and other materials required by
the Paying Agent to be delivered in connection therewith, the holder shall be
entitled to receive promptly in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
into which the Shares formerly represented by such Certificates so
surrendered have been converted into the right to receive in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement and the Certificates so surrendered shall
forthwith be canceled. If payment of the Merger Consideration is to be made
to a Person other than the Person in whose name the surrendered Certificate
is registered, it shall be a condition precedent of payment that (i) the
Certificate so surrendered shall be properly endorsed or shall be
otherwise in proper form for transfer and (ii) the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid any transfer and other Taxes required by reason of
the payment of the Merger Consideration to a Person other than the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such Tax either has been paid
or is not required to be paid. Until so surrendered, each outstanding
Certificate shall be deemed from and after the Effective Time, for all  
6   corporate purposes, to evidence the right to receive the Merger
Consideration without interest thereon, into which the Shares represented by
such Certificate have been converted into the right to receive in accordance
with the provisions of this Agreement.   SECTION 2.3 TRANSFER BOOKS. The
stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed at the Effective Time,
and no transfer of any shares of Company Common Stock shall thereafter be
recorded on any of the stock transfer books. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of any shares of Company Common Stock prior to the Effective Time
that is not registered in the stock transfer records of the Company at the
Effective Time, the Merger Consideration into which such Company Common Stock
has been converted into the right to receive in the Merger shall be paid to
the transferee in accordance with the provisions of SECTION 2.2 only if the
Certificate is surrendered as provided in SECTION 2.2 and accompanied by all
documents required to evidence and effect such transfer (including evidence
of payment of any applicable stock transfer taxes).   SECTION 2.4
TERMINATION OF PAYMENT FUND. Any portion of the Payment Fund (including any
interest received with respect thereto) that remains undistributed one
hundred eighty (180) days after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the
Parent upon demand, and each holder of Company Common Stock as of the
Effective Time who has not previously surrendered Certificates in accordance
with the provisions of this ARTICLE II shall thereafter look only to the
Parent (subject to abandoned property, escheat or similar laws) only
as general creditors thereof with respect to the Merger Consideration payable
upon due surrender of their Certificates or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof, without any interest thereon.   SECTION 2.5 APPRAISAL RIGHTS.  
(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Company
Common Stock outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and held by
a holder who has not voted in favor of the Merger or consented thereto in
writing and who has complied with all of the relevant provisions of
Section 262 of the Delaware Act regarding appraisal for such shares
("DISSENTING SHARES") shall not be converted into the right to receive the
Merger Consideration, unless such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or
otherwise loses its right to appraisal. A holder of Dissenting Shares shall
be entitled to receive payment of the appraised value of such shares held by
him, her or it in accordance with Section 262 of the Delaware Act, unless
such holder fails to perfect or withdraws or otherwise loses his, her or its
right to appraisal, in which case such Company Common Stock shall be deemed
to have converted into and represent, as of the Effective Time, only the
right to receive the Merger Consideration without interest thereon, upon
surrender of the Certificate or Certificates or affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof.   (b) The Company shall give the Parent prompt written notice of
any and all demands for appraisal rights, withdrawal of such demands and any
other communications delivered to the Company pursuant to Section 262 of the
Delaware Act, and the Company shall give the Parent the opportunity, to the
extent permitted by   7   applicable Law, to participate in all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to such demands. Except with the
prior written consent of the Parent, the Company shall not voluntarily make
any payment with respect to any demand for appraisal rights and shall not
settle or offer to settle any such demand.   SECTION 2.6 LOST CERTIFICATES.
If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making
of an affidavit (in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the Parent)
of that fact by the Person making such a claim, and, if required by the
Parent, the posting by such Person of a bond in such reasonable amount as the
Parent may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against or
with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall pay the Merger
Consideration in respect of each Share represented by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate.   SECTION 2.7 NO RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. From and
after the Effective Time, the holders of Certificates shall cease to have any
rights as a stockholder of the Surviving Corporation except as otherwise
expressly provided in this Agreement or by applicable Laws, and the Parent
shall be entitled to treat each Certificate that has not yet been surrendered
for exchange solely as evidence of the right to receive the Merger
Consideration into which the Company Common Stock evidenced by such
Certificate has been converted pursuant to the Merger.   SECTION 2.8
WITHHOLDING. Each of the Parent, the Merger Subsidiary, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold
from the Merger Consideration, Option Consideration and/or Stock-Based
Payment otherwise payable to any former holder of Company Common Stock,
Company Options and Company Stock-Based Awards, or pursuant to SECTIONS 1.8
and 1.9, all amounts required to be deducted or withheld therefrom by
the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "CODE") or other
applicable state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so
deducted and withheld and paid to the appropriate Governmental Authority,
such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having
been paid to the holder thereof in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Parent or the Surviving Corporation. All payments
to any Governmental Authority required to be made in connection with the
withholding Taxes as described in this SECTION 2.8 shall be paid to the
relevant Governmental Authority through the withholding tax payment systems
of the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 2.9 ESCHEAT. Neither the Parent, the
Merger Subsidiary nor the Company shall be liable to any former holder of
Company Common Stock for any portion of the Merger Consideration delivered to
any public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or
similar Law. In the event any Certificate has not been surrendered for the
Merger Consideration prior to the sixth anniversary of the Closing Date, or
prior to such earlier date as of which such Certificate or the Merger
Consideration payable upon the surrender thereof would otherwise escheat to
or become the property of any Governmental Authority, then the Merger
Consideration otherwise payable upon the surrender of such Certificate will,
to the extent permitted by applicable Laws, become the property of the
Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all rights, interests and adverse
claims of any person.   8    ARTICLE III  REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

existing and in good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation, and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as
presently being conducted, except when the failure to be in good standing or
have such power and authority, individually or in the aggregate, would not
reasonably be expected to have a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed to
conduct business and is in good standing in each jurisdiction in which the
properties owned, leased or operated by it or the nature of the business
conducted by it makes such qualification or license necessary, except where
the failure to be so qualified or licensed and in good standing, individually

Material Adverse Effect. The Company has made available to the Parent or its
counsel, true, correct and complete copies of the charter and bylaws of each

material business activities.   (b) For purposes of this Agreement, "COMPANY
MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT" means a Material Adverse Effect with respect to the

condition, change, development or effect that, individually or in the
aggregate with all other events, circumstances, conditions, changes,
developments or effects, would have a material adverse effect on the

operations of a Person and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, or the ability
of a Person to consummate the Merger and to perform its obligations under
this Agreement; PROVIDED THAT, none of the following will be taken into
account in determining whether there has been a Material Adverse Effect: (i)
conditions affecting any of the industries in which such entity operates
generally, (ii) conditions generally affecting the economy or capital
markets,   9   (iii) changes in the Person\'s stock price or trading
volume (it being understood that the facts or occurrences giving rise to or
contributing to such change in stock price or trading volume may be taken
into account in determining whether there has been a Material Adverse
Effect), or (iv) the announcement, pendency or consummation of the Merger.
For purposes of this Agreement, "PERSON" means an individual, a corporation,
a limited liability company, a partnership, a joint venture, an association,
a trust, an unincorporated organization or any other entity or organization,

together with the information incorporated by reference therein, the "COMPANY
SEC DOCUMENTS"). Each of the Company SEC Documents, as of its filing date (or
if amended or superceded by a filing prior to the Agreement Date, then as of

applicable requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together
with the rules and regulations thereunder, the "SECURITIES ACT"), the
Exchange Act or the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOXA") (as the case may be)
and the applicable rules and regulations of the SEC thereunder, and did not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material

statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading. No Subsidiary of the Company is required to file
any statements, reports, schedules, forms or other documents with the

8-K or any successor form under the Exchange Act), and (iii) fairly presented
in all material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company
and its Subsidiaries as of the respective dates thereof and the consolidated

generality of the foregoing, KPMG, LLP has not resigned nor been dismissed as
independent public accountant of the Company as a result of or in connection
with any disagreement with the Company on a matter of accounting practices
which materially impacts or would require the restatement of any  
13   previously issued financial statements, covering one or more years or
interim periods for which the Company is required to provide financial
statements, such that they should no longer be relied on.   (d) As of the
Agreement Date, to the knowledge of the Company, no investigation by the SEC

Company\'s financial reporting and its preparation of financial statements
for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and (ii) disclosure controls
and procedures (as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act), which are
designed to ensure that all material information required to be disclosed by
the Company in the Company SEC Documents is accumulated and communicated to
the Company\'s and its Subsidiaries\' management, as appropriate to allow
timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Each Company SEC Document
that was required to be accompanied by the certifications required of the
Company\'s principal executive officer and principal financial officer
pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of SOXA and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder was accompanied by such certification and, as the time

Company\'s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, such
certification was true and accurate and complied with SOXA and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder as of the date filed.   SECTION 3.7 NO

subject. The Company and its Subsidiaries have all permits, licenses,
approvals, authorizations of and registrations with and under all Laws, and
from all Governmental Authorities, required by the Company and
its Subsidiaries to carry on their respective businesses as currently
conducted, except where the failure to have such permits, licenses,

other party thereto, except those defaults or breaches that, individually or
in the aggregate, would not reasonably be expected to have a Company Material

September 30, 2005 are adequate to cover all Taxes of the Company and its
Subsidiaries for all periods ending at and prior to the date of such balance

validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of the jurisdiction of
its incorporation and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and assets and to carry on its business as

any activities other than in connection with, or as contemplated by, this
Agreement.   SECTION 4.2 AUTHORIZATION OF TRANSACTION; NON-
CONTRAVENTION; APPROVALS.   (a) The Parent and the Merger Subsidiary have

Subsidiary (which shall occur promptly after the execution and delivery
hereof), to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby and to perform
its obligations hereunder. This Agreement has been duly authorized, executed
and delivered by the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery thereof by the Company, constitutes a
valid and legally binding agreement of the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary
enforceable against each of them in accordance with its terms, except that
(i) such enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy,
insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent transfer or similar Laws
of general applicability relating to or affecting enforcement of creditors\'
rights generally and (ii) the remedy of specific performance and injunctive
and other forms of equitable relief may be subject to equitable defenses and

Certificate of Merger pursuant to the Delaware Act, and (d) any filings
required under the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange,

Merger Subsidiary, nor the consummation by the Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary of the transactions contemplated hereby, shall (i) violate or
conflict with any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of
the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary, (ii) violate any Laws applicable to the
Parent or the Merger Subsidiary or any of their respective properties or

of salaries and setting of bonus targets which shall be approved in February
2006 and the Company\'s approval of 2005 bonuses which shall occur
in February 2006, shall not be deemed a violation of this provision if such
action results in salaries, 2005 bonuses and 2006 bonus targets that are
consistent with the Company\'s past practices in the aggregate) or increase
any bonus, insurance, severance, pension or other benefit plan, payment or

shall exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
complete control and supervision of its and its Subsidiaries\'
operations.   SECTION 5.5 PROXY STATEMENT; COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.  
(a) As soon as possible after the Agreement Date, the Company shall commence
preparation of a proxy statement (as amended or supplemented, the "PROXY
STATEMENT") relating to a special meeting of the Company\'s
stockholders meeting (the "COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS MEETING") for the purpose of
obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval, and file a preliminary Proxy
Statement with the SEC or its staff. The Company shall use its reasonable
efforts to respond to any comments by the SEC or its staff to such
preliminary Proxy Statement and to cause a definitive Proxy Statement to be
mailed to the Company Stockholders as soon as possible following the
Agreement Date. The Company shall notify Parent promptly of the receipt of
and shall respond promptly to any (i) comments from the SEC or its staff and
(ii) request by the SEC or its staff or its staff for amendments or
supplements to the Proxy Statement or for additional information and shall
supply Parent with copies of all correspondence between the Company or any of
its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the other
hand, with respect to the Proxy Statement or the Merger. Parent and
its counsel shall be given a reasonable opportunity to review and comment
upon the Proxy Statement and any amendment or supplement thereto and any
such correspondence prior to its filing with the SEC or dissemination to the
Company Stockholders. If necessary, after the Proxy Statement has been so
mailed, the Company shall promptly circulate amended, supplemental or
supplemented proxy materials, and if required in connection therewith,
resolicit proxies. Subject to SECTION 5.7(D), the Company shall include in
the definitive   33   Proxy Statement the unanimous recommendation of the
Company\'s Board of Directors that the Company Stockholders vote in favor of
approval of the Merger and the adoption of this Agreement (the "COMPANY
RECOMMENDATION").   (b) The Parent shall provide the Company with
information concerning or relating to the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary
that may be required in connection with the preparation and filing of the
Proxy Statement pursuant to this SECTION 5.5. The information supplied by
Parent and the Company for inclusion in the Proxy Statement shall not at the
time (i) the Proxy Statement is filed with the SEC, (ii) the Proxy Statement
is first mailed to the Company Stockholders, or (iii) of the Company
Stockholders Meeting, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit
to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in
order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. For purposes of the foregoing, it is
understood and agreed that information concerning or relating to Parent will
be deemed to have been supplied by Parent, and all other information will be
deemed to have been supplied by the Company. The Company shall cause all
documents filed with the SEC in connection with the Merger to comply as to
form and substance in all material respects with the applicable requirements
of the Exchange Act.   (c) The Company, acting through the Company\'s Board
of Directors, shall in accordance with applicable Law and as soon as possible
following the Agreement Date, establish a record date for, duly call, give
notice of, convene and hold the Company Stockholders Meeting for the purpose
of voting upon this Agreement and the Merger, and the Company shall submit
this Agreement at such meeting. The Company shall use its reasonable efforts
to solicit from the Company Stockholders proxies in favor of the adoption of
this Agreement and take all actions reasonably necessary or, in the
reasonable opinion of Parent, advisable to secure the Company Stockholders
Approval. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Company\'s
obligation pursuant to the preceding two sentences will not be affected by
the commencement, public proposal, public disclosure or communication to the
Company of any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Proposal or any withdrawal of
the Company Recommendation. Subject to the Company withdrawing, modifying or
changing its recommendation pursuant to SECTION 5.7(D), the Company, acting
through the Company\'s Board of Directors, shall make the Company
Recommendation at the Company Stockholders Meeting.   SECTION 5.6
INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.   SECTION 5.7 ACQUISITION PROPOSALS.   (a) From the
Agreement Date until the Effective Time, the Company shall, and shall cause
its Subsidiaries and each of their respective directors, officers, employees,
agents, attorneys, accountants, investment bankers and other representatives
(collectively, the "COMPANY REPRESENTATIVES"), to immediately cease all
existing discussions, negotiations or other action with any other Person
conducted heretofore with respect to any Acquisition Proposal. From the
Agreement Date until the Effective Time, the Company shall not, and shall
cause its Subsidiaries and each of the Company   34   Representatives not
to, (i) solicit, initiate, facilitate or knowingly encourage, directly or
indirectly, the making or submission of any Acquisition Proposal, (ii) enter
into any letter of intent, agreement, arrangement or understanding with
respect to any Acquisition Proposal, or agree to approve or endorse any
Acquisition Proposal or enter into any agreement, arrangement
or understanding that would require the Company to abandon, terminate or fail
to consummate the Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this
Agreement, (iii) initiate or participate in any way in any discussions or
negotiations with, or furnish or disclose any information to, any Person
(other than the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary) in furtherance of any
proposal that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal, or (iv) facilitate or further in any other manner any
inquiries or the making or submission of any proposal that constitutes, or
could reasonably be expected to lead to, any Acquisition Proposal. Without
limiting the foregoing, it is agreed that any violation of the foregoing
restrictions by any Company Representative, whether or not such Person is
purporting to act on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or
otherwise, will be deemed to be a breach of this SECTION 5.7(A) by the
Company.   (b) Notwithstanding the restrictions set forth in SECTION
5.7(A), if at any time prior to obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval,
the Company\'s Board of Directors receives a bona fide, unsolicited
Acquisition Proposal (under circumstances in which there has not been a
violation of SECTION 5.7(A)) and the Company\'s Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consulting with its financial advisor and outside legal
counsel) that such Acquisition Proposal is, or is reasonably likely to result
in, a Superior Proposal (as such term is defined in subsection (h) below) and
that failure to take such action permitted under this paragraph would result
in a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Laws, the Company may (or permit the Company Representatives),
subject to providing Parent with the information required pursuant to
subsection (c) below, (A) furnish information with respect to the Company and
its Subsidiaries to the Person making such Acquisition Proposal pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive (including with
respect to standstill provisions) on the other party than the confidentiality
agreement between the Company and the Parent dated November 2, 2005 (the
"CONFIDENTIALITY AGREEMENT"), and (B) participate in discussions or
negotiations with the Person making such Acquisition Proposal.   (c) The
Company shall as promptly as practical, and in any event within forty-eight
(48) hours, notify Parent of any Acquisition Proposal or of any request for
information or inquiry that could reasonably be expected to lead to an
Acquisition Proposal, which notification shall include a copy of
the applicable Acquisition Proposal or a reasonably detailed written
summary thereof, request or inquiry (or, if oral, a written copy of statement
setting forth in reasonable detail the terms and conditions of such
Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry), including the identity of the
third party making such Acquisition Proposal, request or inquiry. The Company
shall keep the Parent advised on a reasonably current basis of the status and
content of any discussions or negotiations involving any Acquisition
Proposal, request or inquiry and shall promptly make available to the Parent
any non-public information furnished to any third party in connection
therewith that has not been previously provided to the Parent. The
Company   35   will notify the Parent in writing promptly after any
determination by the Board of Directors of the Company that an Acquisition
Proposal is, or would reasonably be likely to result in or lead to, a
Superior Proposal.   (d) Neither the Company\'s Board of Directors nor any
committee thereof will withdraw, modify or change, or propose publicly to
withdraw, modify or change, in a manner adverse to the Parent, the Merger
Subsidiary or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the Company
Recommendation, unless prior to obtaining the Company Stockholders Approval,
(A) the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith (after
consultation with outside legal counsel) that the failure to take such action
would be a breach of its fiduciary duties to the Company Stockholders under
applicable Laws, and (B) if such withdrawal, modification or public proposal
is taken in response to a Superior Proposal, then unless the Company also
first gives the Parent four (4) business days written notice of the material
terms and provisions of such Superior Proposal, during which four (4)
business day period the Company will and will cause the Company
Representatives to negotiate in good faith with the Parent, so that the
Parent may propose an amendment to this Agreement for the purpose of causing
the Acquisition Proposal to no longer constitute a Superior Proposal. In the
case of subclause (A) of the immediately preceding sentence, the Company
may withdraw, modify or change its recommendation and shall give Parent
prompt notification thereof. In the case of subclause (B) of the immediately
preceding sentence, if at the end of such four (4) business day period, the
Company\'s Board of Directors continues to believe in good faith, after
receiving the advice of its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
that the Acquisition Proposal continues to be a Superior Proposal, and the
Company has concurrently satisfied its obligations pursuant to SECTIONS 7.3
and 7.4, then the Company may withdraw, modify or change the Company
Recommendation by written notice to the Parent and terminate this Agreement
pursuant to SECTION 7.1(C)(II).   (e) Unless the Company\'s Board of
Directors has previously withdrawn or modified, or is concurrently
withdrawing or modifying, the Company Recommendation in accordance with this
section, the Company\'s Board of Directors shall not recommend any
Acquisition Proposal to the Company Stockholders. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company\'s
Board of Directors from complying with Rule 14e-2(a) and Rule 14d-9
promulgated under the Exchange Act with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
or making any disclosure required by applicable Laws.   (f) The Company
shall not release nor permit the release of any Person from, or waive or
permit the waiver of any provision of, and the Company shall use its
reasonable efforts to enforce or cause to be enforced, any confidentiality,
"standstill" or similar agreement to which any of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, unless the Company\'s Board of Directors determines
in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that the
failure to take such action would be a breach of its fiduciary duties to
the Company Stockholders under applicable Laws; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
Company shall not release or permit the release from, or waiver or permit the
waiver of any provision of any standstill or similar agreement the  
36   effect of which would be to permit such Person to effect a transaction
without the approval of the Company\'s Board of Directors.   (g) The term
"ACQUISITION PROPOSAL" means an inquiry, proposal, indication of interest or
offer relating to any (i) acquisition or sale of (1) 20% or more of the
consolidated assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, or (2) 20% or more
(in number or voting power) of the equity securities of the Company (or any
of its Subsidiaries, as applicable), (ii) tender offer or exchange offer, as
defined pursuant to the Exchange Act, that, if consummated, would result in
any Person beneficially owning 20% or more (in number or voting power) of the
equity securities of the Company (or a Company Subsidiary as applicable), or
(iii) merger, consolidation, business combination, reorganization,
recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or other similar transaction
involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or a merger involving only the Company and one
or more of its wholly-owned Subsidiaries.   (h) The term "SUPERIOR PROPOSAL"
means a bona fide, written Acquisition Proposal that is (i) not received in
violation of SECTION 5.7(A), (ii) for at least a majority of the outstanding
Company Common Stock or all or substantially all of the assets of the Company
on a consolidated basis, (iii) fully financed or for which financing, to the
extent required, is reasonably likely to be available and (iv) on terms that
the Company\'s Board of Directors determines in good faith (A) would result
in a transaction that is more favorable to the Company Stockholders from a
financial point of view, than the transactions contemplated hereby, and (B)
is reasonably capable of being completed according to its terms.   SECTION
5.8 INDEMNIFICATION. (a) From and after the Effective Time, the Parent shall,
and shall cause the Surviving Corporation to, fulfill and honor in all
respects the obligations of the Company pursuant to any indemnification,
exculpation and advancement of expenses provisions in favor of the current or
former directors, officers, employees or agents of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or any other person who, at the request of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries, served as a director, officer, member, trustee or fiduciary
of another corporation, partnership, joint venture, trust, employee benefit
plan or other enterprise (the "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") under the constitutional
documents of the Company and its Subsidiaries or any agreement between an
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in effect as of
the Agreement Date. The certificate of incorporation and by-laws of the
Surviving Corporation shall contain provisions with respect
to indemnification, exculpation and advancement of expenses that are at least
as favorable to the Indemnified Parties as those contained in the certificate
of incorporation and by-laws of the Company in effect on the Agreement Date
(and which shall expressly provide for advancement of expenses to former
officers, directors, employees or agents subject only to delivery of an
undertaking to repay such advanced expenses if the Indemnified Party is
ultimately determined not to be entitled to indemnification), and such
provisions shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified for a period
of six (6) years from the Effective Time in any manner that would adversely
affect the rights of the Indemnified Parties thereunder.   37    (b) For
a period of six (6) years after the Closing Date, the Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect policies of directors and officers liability
insurance and fiduciary liability insurance substantially equivalent in scope
and amount of coverage (and on terms and conditions no less advantageous to
the insureds) to the policies maintained by the Company as of the Agreement
Date with respect to claims arising from or relating to actions or omissions,
or alleged actions or omissions, occurring on or prior to the Effective Time.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the Parent shall not be
obligated to make total annual premium payments with respect to such policies
of insurance to the extent such premiums exceed two hundred percent (200%) of
the last annual premium paid by the Company prior to the Agreement Date. If
the annual premium costs necessary to maintain such insurance coverage exceed
the foregoing amount, the Parent shall maintain as much comparable directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance reasonably
obtainable for an annual premium not exceeding the foregoing amount. The
Company represents that the amount of the last annual premium paid by
the Company prior to the Agreement Date was the amount set forth on Section
5.8(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter.   (c) The Parent shall cause the
Surviving Corporation to honor the provisions of this SECTION 5.8.   (d)
The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder shall be in addition to any
other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the Delaware Act or
otherwise. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Agreement or otherwise, the provisions of this SECTION 5.8 shall survive
the consummation of the Merger, and each Indemnified Party will, for all
purposes, be a third party beneficiary of the covenants and agreements
contained in this SECTION 5.8 and, accordingly, shall be treated as a party
to this Agreement for purposes of the rights and remedies relating to
enforcement of such covenants and agreements and shall be entitled to enforce
any such rights and exercise any such remedies directly against the Parent
and the Surviving Corporation.   SECTION 5.9 PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS. The
initial press releases issued by each party announcing the Merger and the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in a form that is
mutually acceptable to the Parent and the Company. Thereafter, the Parent and
the Company shall consult with one another before issuing any press releases
or otherwise making any public announcements with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and except as may be required by applicable
Laws or by the rules and regulations of the New York Stock Exchange shall not
issue any such press release or make any such announcement prior to such
consultation, except that (a) the Parent and the Company shall agree on the
content of the first announcement made to the Company\'s employees regarding
the execution of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby and
(b) the Company may otherwise communicate with the Company\'s employees as it
deems appropriate, PROVIDED THAT, in any formal communications with such
employees, the Company shall not make any commitments to the employees that
might reasonably be expected to be binding upon the Parent or the Surviving
Corporation after the Closing.   38    SECTION 5.10 FULL ACCESS. (a)
Between the Agreement Date and the Effective Time, the Company shall, and
shall cause its Subsidiaries to, afford Parent and its Representatives
reasonable access during normal business hours and upon reasonable notice, to
the officers, employees, agents, properties, books and records of the Company
and its Subsidiaries; PROVIDED THAT, the foregoing shall not require the
Company (i) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any information, that in
the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in the disclosure of any
trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its obligations with respect
to confidentiality if the Company shall have used reasonable efforts to
obtain the consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure
without requiring the Company to pay any amount or waive any rights to obtain
such consent; (ii) to disclose any information of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries subject to the attorney client privilege, PROVIDED THAT, the
Company will nonetheless provide the Parent and its Representatives with
appropriate information regarding the factual basis underlying
any circumstances that resulted in the preparation of such privileged
analyses; (iii) to provide any information or access that the Company
reasonably believes could violate applicable Laws; PROVIDED, FURTHER, that
this SECTION 5.10 shall not obligate the Company to devote any material
resources to create any information that does not already exist at the time
of such request (other than to convert existing information from one medium
to another, such as providing a printout of information that is sorted in a
computer database).   (b) The Parent shall hold, and shall cause its
directors, officers, employees, agents and representatives to hold, all
information provided to them pursuant to this SECTION 5.10 in confidence in
accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality Agreement and, in the event
of the termination of this Agreement for any reason, the Parent promptly
shall return or destroy all such information in accordance with the terms of
the Confidentiality Agreement.   SECTION 5.11 ACTIONS REGARDING
ANTITAKEOVER STATUTES. If Section 203 of the Delaware Act or any other
potentially applicable anti-takeover or similar statute or regulation is or
becomes applicable to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, the
Board of Directors of the Company shall grant such approvals and take such
other actions as may be required so that the transactions contemplated hereby
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement.   SECTION 5.12 CONTINUED BENEFITS PLANS. (a) The
Parent shall, through the period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on
December 31, 2007, cause or take such necessary action to cause the Company
and its Subsidiaries to maintain for each person who is an employee of the
Company immediately prior to the Closing (including each such person who is
on vacation, temporary layoff, leave of absence, sick leave or short- or
long-term disability) (each, a "CONTINUING EMPLOYEE") the wages, other
compensation and benefits of the types provided to such Continuing Employees,
that are not less favorable in the aggregate to such Continuing Employees
than the wages, other compensation   39   and benefits provided to them
as in effect immediately prior to the Closing. Commencing on January 1, 2007,
the Parent may satisfy its obligations under the preceding sentence by
providing the Continuing Employees wages, other compensation and benefits on
substantially the same basis and level as are provided to similarly situated
employees of General Dynamics Network Systems, Inc. ("GDNS"); PROVIDED THAT,
commencing on January 1, 2007, the Parent may in the ordinary course of
business (i) add, delete or change providers of benefits, (ii) change,
increase or decrease co-payments, deductibles or other requirements for
coverage or benefits (e.g., utilization review or pre-
certification requirements), and/or (iii) make other changes in
administration or changes in the design, coverage and benefits given, so long
as the foregoing apply to all similarly situated employees of GDNS. The
Parent shall take all necessary action so that, for all purposes under each
employee benefit plan maintained by the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates in which Continuing Employees become eligible to participate upon
or after the Closing, the Continuing Employees shall be given credit for all
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries to the same extent as if such
services had been rendered to the Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or
Affiliates (but only to the extent that such credit does not create any
duplication of benefits or benefit accruals under any Parent-sponsored
defined benefit retirement or welfare plan). Notwithstanding the foregoing,
Continuing Employees, will not be offered any Parent-sponsored defined
benefit retirement plan, any Parent-provided post-employment benefits, such
as retiree medical or retiree life or employee stock purchase plans.   (b)
The Parent shall, or shall cause the Company and its Subsidiaries to: (i)
waive all limitations as to pre-existing conditions, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the Continuing Employees under any welfare or fringe benefit plan in which
such Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing;
and (ii) provide each Continuing Employee with credit under any general
leave, welfare plan or fringe benefit plan in which such Continuing Employee
becomes eligible to participate after the Closing for any co-payments and
deductibles paid by such Continuing Employee for the then current plan
year under the corresponding welfare or fringe benefit plan maintained by the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing.   (c) Without
limiting the application of the provisions of SECTION 5.12(A), Parent shall
or shall cause the Company or its Subsidiaries to (i) honor and continue in
effect in accordance with their terms any and all severance arrangements,
agreements or policies of the Company and its Subsidiaries (which in the case
of senior executive arrangements and agreements are set forth on the Company
Disclosure Letter) as in effect on the Agreement Date and honor all
commitments under those agreements whenever due, and (ii) honor, pay, perform
and satisfy all liabilities and commitments, with respect to the annual
incentive bonuses payable to any Continuing Employees for 2005 in accordance
with the terms of the applicable bonus plans, programs and policies of the
Company as in effect on the Agreement Date.   (d) From and after the Closing
Date, Parent assumes full responsibility for compliance with, as well as any
liability which may exist under, the Workers Adjustment and Retraining
Notification Act, P.L. 100-379, and any other similar state law on account of
any Continuing Employee terminated after the Closing.   40    SECTION
5.13 STANDSTILL PROVISIONS. The restrictions on the Parent and the Merger
Subsidiary contained in Section 6A of the Confidentiality Agreement are
hereby waived by the Company but only to the extent reasonably necessary to
permit the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary to consummate the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and/or to comply with their obligations or
exercise their legal remedies under this Agreement.   SECTION 5.14
NOTIFICATION OF CERTAIN MATTERS; SUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE. Each party shall
give the other reasonably prompt notice upon learning of any event that is
reasonably likely to cause any of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VI not
to be satisfied. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Parent
of the occurrence of any event that, individually or in the aggregate, would
reasonably be expected to result in a Company Material Adverse Effect. Each
of the Company, the Parent and the Merger Subsidiary agrees use their
respective reasonable efforts to prevent or promptly remedy, (i) the
occurrence or failure to occur or the impending or threatened occurrence or
failure to occur, of any event which occurrence or failure to occur would be
likely to cause any of its representations or warranties in this Agreement to
be untrue or inaccurate in any material respect at any time from the
Agreement Date to the Effective Time and (ii) any material failure on
its part to comply with or satisfy any covenant, condition or agreement to
be complied with or satisfied by it hereunder. Each party shall give prompt
written notice to the other of any material development which would give rise
to a failure of a condition set forth in ARTICLE VI. The delivery of any
notice pursuant to this SECTION 5.14 shall not limit or otherwise affect the
remedies available hereunder to the party receiving such notice nor be deemed
to have amended any of the disclosures set forth in the Company Disclosure
Letter, to have qualified the representations and warranties contained herein
or to have cured any misrepresentation or breach of a representation or
warranty that otherwise might have existed hereunder by reason of such
material development. No disclosure after the Agreement Date of the untruth
of any representation and warranty made in this Agreement will operate as a
cure of any breach of the failure to disclose the information, nor any untrue
representation or warranty made herein.   ARTICLE VI  CONDITIONS TO THE

shares of Company Common Stock), PROVIDED THAT, if (y) in the preceding
clause is greater than or equal to 16%, then the Dissenting Shares shall be
deemed to exceed the Dissenting Share Limit for purposes of this SECTION
6.3(F) and SECTION 7.1(D)(IV). For purposes of this Agreement, "SPECIFIED

the Parent or the Merger Subsidiary may rely on the failure of any condition
set forth in SECTIONS 6.1, 6.2 or 6.3, as the case may be, to be satisfied if
such party\'s material breach of this Agreement has been a principal cause of
the failure of such condition to be satisfied.   ARTICLE VII

REPRESENTATIONS. None of the representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement or in any schedule, certificate, instrument or other writing
delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Merger or the

or agreement of the parties hereto which by its terms contemplates
performance after the Effective Time and this ARTICLE VIII shall survive the
Effective Time.   SECTION 8.2 SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The parties agree
that irreparable damage would occur and the non-breaching party could not be
made whole by monetary damages in the event any of the provisions of this
Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms, and it
is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to specific
performance of the terms of this Agreement, without posting a bond or other
security, this being in addition to any other remedy to which they are
entitled hereunder, at law or in equity.   SECTION 8.3 SUCCESSORS AND
ASSIGNS. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights, interests or
obligations provided by this Agreement shall be assigned by any of the
parties (whether by operation of law or otherwise) without the prior written

Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties
hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.   SECTION 8.4
AMENDMENT. This Agreement may be amended in accordance with its terms by the
execution and delivery of a written instrument by or on behalf of the Parent,

the approval of the stockholders of the Company if and to the extent such
approval is required under applicable Law or in accordance with the rules of
any relevant stock exchange.   SECTION 8.5 SEVERABILITY. Whenever possible,
each provision of this Agreement shall be interpreted in such manner as to be
effective and valid under applicable Laws, but if any provision of this
Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under applicable Laws, such
provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such prohibition or
invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of this Agreement. The parties
hereto agree to replace any such void or unenforceable provision of this
Agreement with a valid and enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the
greatest   48   extent possible, the economic, business and other
purposes of such void or unenforceable provision.   SECTION 8.6 EXTENSION
OF TIME; WAIVER. Except as set forth elsewhere in this Agreement, at any time
prior to the Effective Time, the parties may extend the time for performance
of or waive compliance with any of the covenants, agreements or conditions of
the other parties to this Agreement, and may waive any breach of the
representations or warranties of such other parties. No agreement extending
or waiving any provision of this Agreement shall be valid or binding unless
it is in writing and is executed and delivered by or on behalf of the party
against which it is sought to be enforced. Delay in exercising any right
under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right.   SECTION
8.7 COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in two or more counterparts
(whether by facsimile or otherwise), each of which shall be deemed an
original, but all such counterparts taken together shall constitute one and
the same Agreement.   SECTION 8.8 DESCRIPTIVE HEADINGS. The descriptive

the feminine and neuter genders, the feminine gender shall include the

SECTION 8.15 COMPANY DISCLOSURE LETTER. The Company Disclosure Letter is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the specific provisions of this

the scope of any representation or warranty contained in this Agreement or to
create any representation, warranty, agreement or covenant on the part of the
Company. The inclusion of any matter, information, item or other
disclosure set forth in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall
not be deemed to constitute an admission of any liability of the Company to
any third party or otherwise imply that such matter, information or item is
material or creates a measure for materiality for purposes of this Agreement
or is required to be disclosed under this Agreement. Each section of the
Company Disclosure Letter, as the case may be, corresponds to the section of
this Agreement to which it relates; PROVIDED THAT, disclosure of any fact or
item in any section of the Company Disclosure Letter shall be deemed to be
disclosed with respect to another paragraph or section whether or not a
specific cross-reference thereto appears, to the extent it is reasonably
apparent that such disclosure should apply to such paragraph or section.
Certain matters have been disclosed in the Company Disclosure Letter for
informational purposes only.   * * * * *      52    IN WITNESS
