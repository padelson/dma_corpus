Section 2.4 Consideration.

(a) On the Closing Date and subject to the terms and conditions set forth in
this Agreement, in consideration of the sale, assignment and transfer of the
Sold Shares and the Acquired Assets, in addition to the assumption by the
Buyer of the Assumed Liabilities, the Buyer will pay to the Sellers,
$215,000,000, plus (i) Estimated Closing Net Cash (which may be a negative
number), plus (ii) the Estimated Buyer Working Capital Payment, if any, minus
(iii) the Estimated Seller Parent Working Capital Payment, if any, minus (iv)
the amount set forth on Schedule 2.4(a), by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S.
dollars (such net amount, the "Initial Purchase Price," and as adjusted
pursuant to Sections 2.4(c), 2.4(d) and 2.7, the "Purchase Price"), to an
account or accounts designated by Seller Parent in writing at least seven (7)
Business Days before the Closing Date. With regard to the sale and transfer of
the Sold Shares, it is the common understanding of the parties hereto that
such sale and transfer is not subject to VAT, and no party hereto shall waive
any exemption from VAT pursuant to Section 9 German Value Added Tax Act
("VATA", Umsatsteuergesetz) or any similar provision under non-German VAT
Laws. If any VAT accrues contrary to this understanding for any other reason
than the waiver of a VAT exemption by the respective Share Seller, the Buyer
shall pay such VAT after receipt of an invoice issued by the Seller in
compliance with applicable VAT Laws. If and to the extent that VAT shall apply
under applicable Law due to the sale and transfer of Acquired Assets, it shall
become payable by the Buyer in addition to the Initial Purchase Price and the
Purchase Price, unless the reverse charge procedure (Leistungsempfanger als
Steuerschuldner) will apply. The Buyer shall pay such VAT to the applicable
Seller or, in the case that the reverse charge procedure shall apply, to the
applicable Taxing Authority, in each case, within fifteen (15) Business Days
after receipt of a proper invoice from the applicable Seller complying with
the requirements of VAT Law in the applicable jurisdiction and enabling the
Buyer to claim such VAT as input VAT.

Should any asset sale by any of the Asset Sellers qualify as transfer of a
going concern (Geschaftsveraußerung im Ganzen) being out of scope of VAT, the
parties hereto shall seek and cooperate to treat the respective asset sale as
such and provide each other with all relevant information for that purpose and
the applicable Seller will provide the Buyer within twenty (20) Business Days
after the Closing Date with all documentation (including calculations)
required for an adjustment of input VAT according to Section 15a German VATA
or any similar provision under any non-German Tax Law including copies of the
invoices (Section 15 para 10 German VATA or any similar provision under any
non-German Tax Law). If a VAT amount actually payable as a consequence of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement turns out to
be higher or lower than the amount shown on the relevant invoice issued by the
applicable Asset Seller (including if no VAT has been invoiced at all) due to
(i) an assessment after Closing of a Taxing Authority in charge of the
applicable Seller's or of the Buyer's or (ii) for any other reason identified
by the parties after Closing, the parties shall make appropriate declarations
and filings with the relevant Governmental Authorities, amend any invoices (to
the extent required by applicable VAT Laws), provide to the respective other
party any requested information and copies of relevant documents and make any
required payments to each other and the Governmental Authorities,
respectively, in each case without undue delay. In particular, if according to
a determination made by a Taxing Authority in charge of the applicable Asset
Seller's VAT affairs decides the VAT payable by the Asset Seller is higher
than shown on the relevant invoice (including if no VAT has been invoiced at
all), the Buyer shall pay the corresponding shortfall amount to the applicable
Asset Seller within fifteen (15) Business Days after receipt of notification
of the shortfall amount and of a corrected invoice which complies with the
provisions of the VAT Laws from the applicable Asset Seller, but not earlier
than five (5) Business Days before the applicable VAT becomes due (taking into
account any extension of the due date granted by the Taxing Authority). If
according to a determination made by a Taxing Authority in charge of the
applicable Asset Seller's or Buyer's VAT affairs decides the VAT payable by
the Asset Seller is lower than shown on the relevant invoice (including if no
VAT should have been triggered at all), the respective Asset Seller shall
repay the corresponding excess amount to the Buyer within fifteen (15)
Business Days after receipt of the corresponding Tax assessment notice from
the Taxing Authority and provide the Buyer with a corrected invoice which complies with the provisions of the VAT Laws. Any interest and/or
penalty due to be paid to a Taxing Authority on the VAT due because of the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be
equally borne by Seller Parent and the Buyer, unless and to the extent such
interest and/or penalty is triggered by a failure of one party to timely pay
the VAT in accordance with the determination pursuant to this Section 2.4(a),
in which case such party shall bear the applicable interest and/or penalty.
Any claims of the Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case may be, resulting from
this Section 2.4(a) shall become time barred in accordance with Section
9.5(b).

(b) Seller Parent has delivered to the Buyer a statement of Working Capital,
Indebtedness and Cash of the Business (the "Reference Date Calculations") as
of December 31, 2018 (the "Reference Date"), a copy of which is set forth in
Schedule 2.4(b). The Reference Date Calculations have been prepared in
accordance with the Calculation Principles. Seller Parent shall provide, or
cause to be provided, to the Buyer all information reasonably requested by the
Buyer, including any work papers (including those prepared by Seller Parent's
accountant) and other supporting documents, used in preparing the Reference
Date Calculations. The Parties agree that the Reference Date Calculations
provide an accurate example of how the Actual Working Capital and Estimated
Closing Net Cash (including the components thereof) are to be prepared for the
purposes of this Agreement.

(c) No later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
Parent shall deliver to the Buyer a statement of Working Capital of the
Business (the "Preliminary Closing Working Capital"), setting forth Seller
Parent's good faith estimate of the amount of Working Capital of the Business
as of the Effective Time (such estimate, the "Estimated Working Capital"). The
Preliminary Closing Working Capital will be in the format set out in Working
Capital included in the Reference Date Calculations and shall be prepared
using (i) the same policies and procedures (including asset valuation
allowances) used in the preparation of the Working Capital included in the
Reference Date Calculations; and (ii) the Calculation Principles. The parties
agree that none of the Preliminary Closing Working Capital, the Actual Working
Capital, the Initial Statement, the Final Working Capital and the Final
Statement shall take into account any events to occur or occurring after the
Closing. The amount, if any, by which the Estimated Working Capital exceeds
the Target Working Capital is referred to herein as the "Estimated Buyer
Working Capital Payment". The amount, if any, by which the Target Working
Capital exceeds the Estimated Working Capital is referred to herein as the
"Estimated Seller Parent Working Capital Payment". The "Target Working
Capital" is $211,521,000. The calculation of the Target Working Capital is set
forth on Schedule 2.4(c).

(d) No later than seven (7) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, Seller
Parent shall deliver to the Buyer a good faith estimate of Cash of the
Business as of the Effective Time and Indebtedness of the Business as of the
Effective Time, in each case, prepared in accordance with the Calculation
Principles (the amount of such Cash net of such Indebtedness, which amount may
be a negative number, "Closing Net Cash", and such estimate referred to as
"Estimated Closing Net Cash"). At the Closing, (i) to the extent Estimated
Closing Net Cash is positive, the Buyer shall pay to Seller Parent the amount
of Estimated Closing Net Cash in the manner contemplated by, and in accordance
with, Section 2.4(a) and (ii) to the extent Estimated Closing Net Cash is
negative, Seller Parent shall pay to the Buyer the amount of Estimated Closing
Net Cash, in each case by wire transfer of immediately available funds in U.S.
dollars to an account or accounts designated by the Buyer or Seller Parent, as
applicable, in writing at least seven (7) Business Days before the Closing Date. Following the Closing, the parties
shall calculate and agree upon Closing Net Cash as provided in Section 2.7.

Section 2.5 The Closing. Unless this Agreement shall have been terminated
pursuant to Article VIII, and subject to satisfaction or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Articles VI and VII, the closing (the "Closing") of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall take place at the
offices of Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner LLP, 1290 Avenue of the Americas, New
York, New York, 10104, on a day that is at least five Business Days following
the satisfaction or waiver of all of the conditions set forth in Articles VI
and VII hereof (excluding conditions that, by their terms, are to be satisfied
at Closing but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions), or
at such other place and time as may be agreed upon by Seller Parent and the
Buyer (the "Closing Date"). Unless the parties agree otherwise, the Closing
will be deemed to have occurred in each applicable jurisdiction with the
expiry (24:00, local time) of the Closing Date (with respect to each such
jurisdiction, the "Effective Time").

calculating and setting forth the actual Working Capital as of the Effective
Time (the amount calculated and set forth on such Initial Statement, the

Capital and the Estimated Closing Net Cash. The Initial Statement shall be
prepared (i) in accordance with the same accounting methods, policies,
practices and procedures, with the same classifications, judgments and
estimation methodology (including asset valuation allowances) used by Seller
Parent in the preparation of the Reference Date Calculations and (ii) the
Calculation Principles. In calculating the Actual Working Capital (as well as
Closing Net Cash, including each component thereof, and each other component
of the Purchase Price), the respective amounts included therein, including for
reserves (including accounts receivable reserves) and for asset valuation
allowances, that were valued for purposes of the Reference Date Calculations
shall be calculated using the same methodology in respect of such items used
in connection with the Reference Date Calculations (the "Agreed Valuation
Principles").

(b) During the sixty (60) days immediately following Seller Parent's receipt
of the Initial Statement (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period"),
Seller Parent shall be permitted to review the Buyer's working papers and any
working papers of the Buyer's independent accountants relating to the
preparation of the Initial Statement and the calculation of the Actual Working

Cash with respect to the period up to and including the Closing Date, and the

preparation or calculation of, the Initial Statement, the Actual Working
Capital and Closing Net Cash.

(c) Seller Parent shall notify the Buyer in writing (the "Adjustment Notice")
prior to the expiration of the Purchase Price Adjustment Review Period if
Seller Parent disagrees with the Initial Statement, the Actual Working Capital
or Closing Net Cash. The Adjustment Notice shall set forth in reasonable
detail the basis for such disagreement, the amounts involved and Seller
Parent's determination of the amount of the Actual Working Capital and/or
Closing Net Cash, together with a worksheet setting forth in reasonable detail
how such amounts were calculated. If no Adjustment Notice is received by the
Buyer on or prior to the expiration date of the Purchase Price Adjustment
Review Period, then the Initial Statement, and the Actual Working Capital and
Closing Net Cash set forth in the Initial Statement, shall be deemed to have
been accepted by Seller Parent and shall become final and binding upon Seller
Parent and the Buyer.

(d) During the thirty (30) days immediately following the delivery of an
Adjustment Notice (the "Purchase Price Adjustment Consultation Period"),
Seller Parent and the Buyer shall seek in good faith to resolve any
disagreement that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the
Adjustment Notice. Seller Parent will provide the Buyer and its accountants
access to any relevant books and records of the Business not in the possession
of the Buyer, work papers and to any other information necessary to evaluate
the Adjustment Notice, and Seller Parent shall make reasonably available to the Buyer the individuals
responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the
preparation or calculation of, the Adjustment Notice and each component
included therein.

(e) If, at the end of the Purchase Price Adjustment Consultation Period,
Seller Parent and the Buyer have been unable to resolve all disagreements that
they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Adjustment Notice,
then Seller Parent and the Buyer shall submit all matters that remain in
dispute with respect to the Adjustment Notice (along with a copy of the
Initial Statement marked to indicate those line items that are in dispute) to
Ernst and Young ("EY") (the "Independent Accountant"). In the event that EY
refuses or is otherwise unable to act as the Independent Accountant, Seller
Parent and the Buyer shall cooperate in good faith to appoint an independent
certified public accounting firm in the United States of national recognition
mutually agreeable to Seller Parent and the Buyer, in which event "Independent
Accountant" shall mean such firm. Within thirty (30) days after the submission
of such matters to the Independent Accountant, or as soon as practicable
thereafter, the Independent Accountant, acting as an expert and not as an
arbitrator, will make a final determination, binding on Seller Parent and the
Buyer, on the basis of the Agreed Valuation Principles and in accordance with
Section 2.4(c), Section 2.4(d), Section 2.7(a) and this Section 2.7(e), of the
appropriate amount of each of the line items in the Initial Statement as to
which Seller Parent and the Buyer disagree as specified in the Adjustment
Notice. With respect to each disputed line item, such determination, if not in
accordance with the position of either Seller Parent or the Buyer, shall not
be in excess of the higher, nor less than the lower, of the amounts advocated
by the Buyer in the Initial Statement or Seller Parent in the Adjustment
Notice with respect to such disputed line item. For the avoidance of doubt,
the Independent Accountant shall not review any line items or make any
determination with respect to any matter other than those matters in the
Adjustment Notice that remain in dispute. The statement of the Working Capital
as of the Effective Time and Closing Net Cash and the determination of the
Working Capital and Closing Net Cash set forth therein that are final and
binding on Seller Parent and the Buyer, as determined either through agreement
of Seller Parent and the Buyer (deemed or otherwise) pursuant to Section
2.7(c) or through the determination of the Independent Accountant pursuant to
this Section 2.7(e), are referred to herein as the "Final Statement", the
"Final Working Capital" and the "Final Closing Net Cash", respectively.

(f) The cost of the Independent Accountant's review and determination shall be
shared equally by Seller Parent and the Buyer. Seller Parent and the Buyer
shall each bear the fees of their respective counsel, auditors and other
representatives incurred in connection with the determination and review of
the Initial Statement. During the review by the Independent Accountant, the
Buyer and Seller Parent shall each make available to the Independent
Accountant and to the other party such individuals and such information,
books, records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by (i) the
Independent Accountant to fulfill its obligations under Section 2.7(e) or (ii)
such other party in order for it to fully participate in the dispute
resolution process.

(g) The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall be the amount, if any, by which (A)
the sum of (1) the Final Working Capital plus (2) the Final Closing Net Cash
(such sum, the "Final Adjustment Amount") is greater or less than (B) the sum
of (1) the Estimated Working Capital plus (2) the Estimated Closing Net Cash
(such sum, the "Estimated Adjustment Amount"); provided; that if (x) the Final
Adjustment Amount is equal to the Estimated Adjustment Amount, (y) the Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount by
less than $1,000,000 or (z) the Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final
Adjustment Amount by less than $1,000,000, the Post-Closing Adjustment shall
be deemed to be zero. If the Estimated Adjustment Amount exceeds the Final
Adjustment Amount, then Seller Parent shall be obligated to pay in cash
directly to the Buyer an amount equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the
Final Adjustment Amount exceeds the Estimated Adjustment Amount, then the
Buyer shall be obligated to pay in cash directly to Seller Parent an amount
equal to the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such payments shall be made by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated
by Seller Parent or the Buyer, as applicable, within seven (7) Business Days
after the date on which the Final Statement, Final Working Capital and Final
Closing Net Cash become such (the later of (1) the date on which payment of
the Post-Closing Adjustment payment is made, if any, or (2) the date on which
the Final Statement, Final Working Capital and Final Closing Net Cash become
such, the "Post-Closing Adjustment Determination Date").

(h) In the event that either party discovers within ninety (90) days after the
Closing that there exists any Seller Intercompany Balance or Sold Company
Intercompany Balance then such party shall inform the other party, in writing,
of the balances so discovered, together with reasonable supporting detail
therefor and such other party will have sixty (60) days thereafter (such
period, the "Intercompany Balance Review Period") to review such information
and to provide any objection to the calculations presented. During the
Intercompany Balance Review Period, the parties shall seek in good faith to
resolve any differences in their respective positions with respect to Seller
Intercompany Balances or Sold Company Intercompany Balances, and make their
respective representatives reasonably available to answer questions as to
their respective positions with respect to such amounts. If the parties are
unable to agree on any such amount during the Intercompany Balance Review
Period, then such dispute shall be referred to the Independent Accountant and
resolved in accordance with the dispute provisions set forth in Section
2.7(e). Upon final agreement as to the Seller Intercompany Balances and Sold
Intercompany Balances (or upon the Independent Accountant's final
determination thereof, which shall be final and binding on the parties) the
absolute value of the difference between all such Seller Intercompany Balances
so discovered and all such Sold Intercompany Balances so discovered shall be
deemed for purposes of this Agreement (i) an increase to the Purchase Price if
the Sold Company Intercompany Balances are greater than the Seller
Intercompany Balances and (ii) a decrease to the Purchase Price if the Seller
Intercompany Balances are greater than the Sold Company Intercompany Balances.
Such deemed adjustment shall be finalized between the parties no later than
the date on which the Working Capital as of the Effective Time and Closing Net
Cash are deemed final for purposes of this Agreement in accordance with
Section 2.7(e). For purposes of this Agreement, a payable discovered after
Closing in favor of Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates (that prior to
Closing was an intercompany payable and was not taken into account in the
calculations of Final Working Capital) shall herein be referred to as a
"Seller Intercompany Balance" and a payable discovered after Closing in favor
of a Sold Company or any Subsidiary of a Sold Company (that prior to Closing
was an intercompany payable and was not taken into account in the calculations
of Final Working Capital) shall herein be referred to as a "Sold Company
Intercompany Balance."

(i) In the event that Seller Parent determines that an Organschaft payment or
transfer pricing adjustment payment (each, a "Required Tax Payment") is
required after Closing between Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates and a
Sold Company (or any Subsidiary of a Sold Company) then such payments shall be made by the parties in the following
manner, with the impact on the Purchase Price as described below. If a
Required Tax Payment is made by Seller Parent or any of its Affiliates to a
Sold Company (or any Subsidiary of a Sold Company) then the amount of such
Required Tax Payment shall be deemed to be an increase in the Purchase Price
by the exact amount of the Required Tax Payment, such that the net impact of
both amounts shall be zero (0). If a Required Tax Payment is made by a Sold
Company (or any Subsidiary of a Sold Company) to Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates then the amount of such Required Tax Payment shall be deemed to be
a decrease in the Purchase Price by the exact amount of the Required Tax
Payment, such that the net impact of both amounts shall be zero (0).

(j) The parties agree that any amount used for purposes of determining the
Post-Closing Adjustment, Seller Intercompany Balance, Sold Company
Intercompany Balance or any other similar Purchase Price adjustment or as a
basis for any indemnification hereunder, shall be counted only once and may
not be counted in more than one Purchase Price adjustment or indemnification
claim hereunder.

Section 2.8 Works Council Matters.

(a) Seller Parent and the Buyer acknowledge that, under French labor Laws, the
works council of Terex France will need to be informed and consulted with
respect to the offer made by the Buyer to acquire the total outstanding equity
interests and voting rights of Terex France (the "French Shares") and the
employees of Terex France will need to be informed of this projected sale and
given the possibility to submit a purchase offer. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, unless and until Seller Parent has executed
and delivered to the Buyer the France Exercise Notice, for the purpose of this
Article II, Terex France will not be considered to be a Sold Company.

(b) On the terms and conditions set forth in the option letter signed by the
Buyer and delivered to Seller Parent on the date of this Agreement (the
"French Option Letter" and the put option set forth therein, the "French Put
Option"), including the price specified therein (the "France Purchase Price"),
the Buyer has irrevocably granted a binding and firm option (promesse
unilaterale d'achat irrevocable), in accordance with article 1124 of the
French Code Civil, to require the Buyer to acquire the French Shares (within
the time limit set forth therein) and to have the provisions of this Article
II apply to the French Shares following completion of the consultation process
described in Section 2.8(a). Subject to and only after exercise of the French
Put Option by French Seller following effective and valid completion of the
consultation process and employee information described in Section 2.8(a), and
upon delivery to the Buyer of the executed exercise notice attached as
Schedule 2 to the French Option Letter (the "France Exercise Notice"), this
Article II shall be effective with respect to the French Shares, Terex France
shall be included in the Sold Companies, and the Purchase Price shall be
increased by the France Purchase Price (it being understood that the Purchase
Price does not assume delivery of the France Exercise Notice and therefore
does not already include the France Purchase Price) and at or prior to
Closing, the Seller Parent shall deliver to the Buyer:

(i) a copy of the information letter on the contemplated sale of the French
Shares sent out to the employees of Terex France in accordance with the
provisions of Article L. 23-10-7 of the French Commercial Code; (ii) a copy of Terex France's works council's opinion with respect to the
transfer of the French Shares;

(iii) duly executed share transfer forms (ordres de mouvement) in favour of
the Buyer in respect of the transfers of the French Shares; and

(iv) duly executed tax transfer deed (actes reiteratifs) in respect of the
transfers of the French Shares, to the Buyer; and

(v) the shareholders' accounts (compte titres d'actionnaires) and share
transfer register (registre de mouvements de titres) of Terex France, duly
updated to reflect the transfers of the French Shares to the Buyer.

(c) The Buyer shall reasonably cooperate with Seller Parent and its relevant
Affiliates in connection with the applicable consultation process described in
this Section 2.8, including timely provision of any required information
relating to the Buyer in respect of such consultation process.

(d) If, as a result of the consultation process of the works council, changes
to this Agreement or further arrangements in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements are considered
necessary, Seller Parent and the Buyer shall negotiate in good faith on such
changes (if any) to this Agreement or further arrangements (if any) in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements that are appropriate, in accordance with the terms and
conditions set forth in the French Option Letter.

Section 2.9 Purchase Price Allocation.

(a) The Purchase Price, the Assumed Liabilities and, if applicable, the
liabilities of the Sold Companies and their respective Subsidiaries (to the
extent properly included as purchase consideration for Tax purposes) shall be
allocated among the Acquired Assets, the Sold Shares and, if applicable, among
the assets of the Sold Companies and their respective Subsidiaries, in
proportion to their respective fair market values and in accordance with
Section 1060 of the Code and any similar provision of state, local or non-U.S.
Law as appropriate. Within thirty (30) days after the date hereof, Seller
Parent shall prepare and deliver to the Buyer a draft of the allocation
provided for in the immediately preceding sentence (the "Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule"). The Buyer shall have thirty (30) days to review and
comment on such Purchase Price Allocation Schedule. If the Buyer does not
notify Seller Parent in writing of any objections within thirty (30) days or
if Seller Parent and the Buyer mutually resolve any objections, each of Seller
Parent and Buyer agree that the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule shall
become final and binding. To the extent the Buyer and Seller Parent cannot
resolve any and all such objections within thirty (30) days following the
Buyer's receipt of the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule, then the dispute
resolution procedures of Section 2.7(e) and Section 2.7(f) shall apply mutatis
mutandis and upon resolution of any disputed matters, the Purchase Price
Allocation Schedule shall become final and binding. In the event an adjustment
to the Purchase Price is made pursuant to Section 2.7 or otherwise under this
Agreement, the allocation of the Purchase Price, the Assumed Liabilities and,
if applicable, the liabilities of the Sold Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries (to the extent properly included as purchase consideration for
Tax purposes) shall be revised to allocate such adjustment to the Acquired Assets, the Sold Shares and/or among the assets of the Sold Companies
(and Sold Company Subsidiaries), if applicable, as the case may be, based upon
the item to which such adjustment is attributable.

(b) Except as otherwise required by applicable Law, Seller Parent and the
Buyer shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates, to report the Tax
consequences of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement in a manner
consistent with the Purchase Price Allocation Schedule as finalized, and as it
may be revised from time to time, and shall not take any position inconsistent
therewith in preparing any Tax Returns, including IRS Form 8594 and any other
Tax forms or filings, as well as in preparing any published financial
statements, and, to the extent permitted under applicable Law, none of the
Buyer, Seller Parent or their respective Affiliates shall take any position
inconsistent therewith upon examination of any Tax Return, in any Tax refund
claim, or in any Tax litigation or investigation, without the prior written
consent of the Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case may be (such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed).

Section 2.10 Tax Treatment of Post-Closing Payments. For Tax purposes, the
Parties shall treat any payments made pursuant to Section 2.7 and, as provided
in Section 9.10, any indemnity payments made pursuant to Article IX, as
adjustments to the Purchase Price in accordance with the amendments to the
Purchase Price Allocation Schedule made with respect to such payments pursuant
to Section 2.9(a), except to the extent otherwise required by a Final
Determination.

Section 2.11 Completion of Transfers. Notwithstanding any other provision in
this Agreement to the contrary, no asset, claim, right or benefit, the
assignment or transfer of which is otherwise contemplated by this Agreement,
shall be assigned or transferred if such assignment or transfer (or attempt to
make such an assignment or transfer) without the consent or approval of a
third party would constitute a breach or other contravention of the rights of
such third party or would constitute a violation of or be ineffective under
applicable Law (such assets, claims, rights or benefits being collectively
referred to herein as "Restricted Assets") until such consent or approval is
obtained, or other action has been taken, at which time such Restricted Asset
shall be automatically assigned or transferred. Subject to Section 5.3(e),
each party shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such
consent or approval as promptly as practicable after the date hereof. If any
such consent or approval is not obtained prior to the Closing, (i) each party
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain any such consent or
approval as promptly as practicable, (ii) the assigning party shall endeavor
to provide the assignee party, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, with
the benefits (including Tax benefits) of, or with respect to, the applicable
Restricted Asset as if such Restricted Asset had been assigned to the assignee
party (including by means of any licensing, operating, subcontracting,
sublicensing or subleasing arrangement), if the same is not prohibited under
the applicable Restricted Asset and (iii) the assignee party shall bear and
indemnify the assigning party for (except to the extent resulting from or
arising out of the bad faith, willful misconduct or violation of applicable Law by the assigning
party) all the costs (including Tax costs), liabilities, burdens and other
Losses incurred with respect to any such Restricted Asset to the extent that
it receives the corresponding benefits of, or with respect to, the applicable
Restricted Asset under clause (ii) and subject to the limitation set forth in
Section 5.3(e). Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the foregoing
provisions of this Section 2.11 shall not apply with respect to the Sold
Shares.

Section 2.12 Withholding. If and to the extent any amounts payable by a Seller
Parent or an Affiliate thereof, on the one hand, or the Buyer or an Affiliate
thereof, on the other hand, in each case, pursuant to or in connection with
this Agreement should be subject to any withholding Taxes or any other
deduction of Taxes, the applicable party shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold such Taxes, shall remit such deducted and withheld Taxes to the
proper Taxing Authority in a timely manner and shall promptly transmit to the
other party an official Tax certificate or other evidence of such withholding
or deduction and remittance. To the extent that amounts are so withheld or
deducted and remitted, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the recipients in respect of which such
withholding or deduction was made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, provided
that the Seller Parent has timely provided any information or certifications
requested by the Buyer in order to determine the existence and scope of its
potential withholding obligations, the Buyer shall notify Seller Parent of any
amounts that Buyer (or any of its Affiliates) intends to deduct or withhold
from any amount otherwise payable under the terms of this Agreement no later
than sixty (60) Business Days after the date of this Agreement; provided, that
any failure to so notify Seller Parent of the Buyer's intention to withhold,
whether occasioned by Seller Parent's inability or delay in providing any
requested information or otherwise, shall not be interpreted to prevent the
Buyer from complying with any withholding obligations imposed on it under
applicable Law. The parties hereto shall, and shall cause their Affiliates to,
cooperate in good faith and use joint efforts in order to apply any exemption
from or achieve any reduction, credit or refund of such Taxes, if and to the
maximum extent possible under the applicable Law.

throughout the periods involved, and (c) present fairly in all material
respects the combined financial position and results of the operation of the

Section 3.6 Non-Contravention. The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement by Seller Parent and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby (including the execution and delivery of the Ancillary
Agreements by the applicable parties thereto) do not and will not (a) violate
any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Seller Parent

respects with all Laws or Orders applicable to it and any of its business,
properties, or assets. The Asset Sellers and the Sold Companies have all
licenses, permits, franchises, registrations and other governmental
authorizations necessary to conduct the Business ("Permits"), except where the
failure to have such Permits would not, individually or in the aggregate,
reasonably be expected to result in a material Liability or disruption with
respect to the Business. To the Knowledge of Seller Parent, no condition or state of facts exists that is
reasonably likely to give rise to a material violation of, or a material
liability or default under, any applicable Law, Order or Permit.

Companies or in connection with the Business or the Acquired Assets by the
Closing Date (subject to permitted extensions of time applicable to any such
filings), (i) have been or will be timely filed and (ii) are, or will be,
correct and complete in all material respects. All material Taxes shown as due
on such Tax Returns in respect of the Business, the Acquired Assets or the
Sold Companies have been, or will be by the Closing Date, fully paid or
properly reserved for in accordance with appropriate generally accepted
accounting principles. None of the Sold Companies has ever received notice
from any Taxing Authority of a jurisdiction in which it does not file Tax

any statute of limitations or extension of time with respect to an assessment
or collection of any material Taxes of the Sold Companies, other than an
extension arising out of an extension of the due date for filing a Tax Return.

(d) There are no examinations, audits, actions, proceedings, investigations,
disputes, assessments or claims pending regarding Taxes of the Sold Companies,

result in a material increase in Taxes of the Sold Companies or with respect
to the Business or the Acquired Assets for any taxable period ending after the
Closing Date.

(e) The Sold Companies are, and will be as of the Closing, in possession of
all material books, records and documentation required under Tax Laws and
pursuant to the administrative orders (Verwaltungsanweisungen) issued under
these laws, including but not limited to evidence (Nachweise) on claimed VAT
exemption for intra-community supplies (innergemeinschaftliche Lieferungen)
and export supplies (Ausfuhrlieferungen). The outsourcing abroad of a tax
accounting function by a Sold Company has been made with the full and valid
consent of the applicable Taxing Authorities in such jurisdictions where such
consent was required under applicable Law to be obtained by such Sold Company.

(f) No binding Tax rulings relevant for the Tax matters of any of the Sold
Companies for any period after the Closing Date have been issued by any Taxing

until Closing.

organization and do not have nor had a permanent establishment outside their
respective country of organization, nor carried out activities which could be
considered as a permanent establishment outside their respective country of
organization, in each case under any applicable Law. (h) Terex Germany and Terex Cranes have properly executed (tatsachlich
durchgefuhrt) the existing profit and loss transfer agreement
(Ergebnisabfuhrungsvertrag).

(i) None of the Sold Companies have entered into a recharge agreement with
regard to Taxes with any Share Seller or any of Affiliate of any Share Seller.

Section 3.13 Intellectual Property.

(a) Schedule 3.13(a) sets forth a complete and accurate list of (i) all
Business Registered IP and (ii) any material unregistered Intellectual
Property contained in the Business Owned IP. All Business Registered IP is
valid, enforceable and subsisting except where such failure to be valid,
enforceable and subsisting would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
material to the Business.

(b) Schedule 3.13(b) accurately identifies all licenses of or covenants not to
assert or exploit any Intellectual Property granted (a) by any Asset Seller
(in connection with the Business) or any Sold Company to any third party, and
(b) to any Asset Seller (in connection with the Business) or any Sold Company
from a third party (each such license in this subsection (b), a "Business IP
License" and all such IP licensed pursuant to the Business IP Licenses, the
"Business Licensed IP").

(c) Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(c), the Asset Sellers or the Sold
Companies own all right, title and interest to and in the Business Owned IP,
free and clear of any Encumbrances (other than Permitted Encumbrances) and
have a valid right to use (as the case may be) all other Business IP, in each
case free and clear of any Encumbrance. All necessary documents and
certificates in connection with the Business Registered IP have been filed
with the relevant patent, copyright, trademark or other authorities in
applicable jurisdictions, as the case may be, for the purposes of maintaining
such Business Registered IP in their respective jurisdictions. The Business IP
constitutes all of the Intellectual Property necessary and sufficient to
conduct the Business as currently conducted.

(d) Each of the Asset Sellers (in connection with the Business) and the Sold
Companies has taken and does take commercially reasonable steps to maintain
the confidentiality of and otherwise protect and enforce its rights in all
Trade Secrets and other proprietary information pertaining to the Business or
the Business IP. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(d), each Person who is
or was involved in the creation or development of any Business Owned IP
(including all past and present employees, consultants and contractors) has
signed a valid and enforceable agreement pursuant to which such Person has presently assigned to the
applicable Asset Seller or Sold Company all of such Person's rights, title and
interest in and to all Intellectual Property rights created or developed for
such Asset Seller (in connection with the Business) or Sold Company or
currently used in the Business in the course of their employment or retention
thereby and agreed to waive all moral rights such person may have in any work
in which copyright subsists of which such person is or was the creator or an
author, except in the case of a lack of such assignment and waiver as would
not, individually, or in the aggregate, be material to the Business.

(e) To the Knowledge of Seller Parent, no Person has infringed,
misappropriated, made unlawful use of or otherwise violated in the three years
preceding the date hereof, or is currently infringing, misappropriating,
making unlawful use of or otherwise violating, any Business Owned IP, except
where such infringement, misappropriation, unlawful use or violation would not
reasonably be expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to
the Business. Neither the conduct of the Business, nor the use, practice,
offer, license, provision, sale, distribution or other exploitation of any
Business IP, infringes, misappropriates or otherwise violates, and has not in
the three years preceding the date hereof infringed, misappropriated or
otherwise violated, any Intellectual Property right of any Person, except
where such infringement, misappropriation or violation would not reasonably be
expected, individually or in the aggregate, to be material to the Business.

(f) Each of the Asset Sellers and the Sold Companies owns or has a valid right
to access all Business IT Systems. Except as set forth on Schedule 3.13(f)(i),
all material software used internally by any Asset Seller (in connection with
the Business) or any Sold Company is owned by such Asset Seller or Sold
Company or used pursuant to a valid license or other enforceable right and is
not a "bootleg" version or unauthorized copy. The Business IT Systems (i) are
adequate for, and operate and perform in all material respects as required in
connection with, the operations of the Business as currently conducted, and
(ii) do not, to the Knowledge of Seller Parent, contain any "viruses,"
"worms," "trojan horses," "bugs," "faults" or other devices, errors,
contaminants or effects. To the Knowledge of Seller Parent, except as set
forth on Schedule 3.13(f)(ii), no Business IT System currently, nor will in
the twelve (12) month period following the date of this Agreement, have any
issue with respect to any end-of-support with respect to such Business IT
System or software related thereto.

(g) No privacy policy applicable to the Business is or has been misleading or
deceptive, materially incomplete or materially inaccurate and each of the
Asset Sellers and the Sold Companies has been and is in material compliance
with all such privacy policies and all Laws and contractual obligations
concerning data privacy and security. Neither any Asset Seller nor any Sold
Company has made any illegal or unauthorized collection, use, disclosure or
destruction of any personally identifiable information and there has been no
illegal or unauthorized access to, or use or disclosure of, any such personal
information. There have been no material data breaches involving loss or
theft, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure of personal information. Each
of the Asset Sellers and the Sold Companies has commercially reasonable
safeguards in place to protect Personal Information in its possession or
control from loss or theft, or unauthorized access, use or disclosure, including appropriate contractual
terms with service providers who process or store such personal information on
behalf of such Asset Seller or Sold Company.

all requisite corporate power and authority to own its assets and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing in the jurisdictions in which the ownership
of its property or the conduct of its business requires such qualification or

transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.2 Authorization, Enforceability.

(a) The Buyer has all requisite corporate power and authority to execute and
deliver this Agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, and the

Buyer of this Agreement, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby (including the execution and delivery of the Ancillary Agreements by
the applicable parties thereto), do not and will not (a) violate any provision
of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Buyer; (b) result in a
breach of, or default under, or right to accelerate with respect to, any term

Buyer or any of its Affiliates is a party or is subject; or (c) assuming
compliance with the matters set forth in Sections 3.7(b) and 4.5(b), violate
or result in a breach of or constitute a default under any Law or other
restriction of any Governmental Authority to which the Buyer is subject,
except with respect to clauses (b) and (c), for violations, breaches,
conflicts and defaults as would not reasonably be expected, individually or in
the aggregate, to materially impede or delay the Buyer's ability to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.4 Litigation. There are no Proceedings pending or, to the knowledge
of the Buyer, threatened against the Buyer or any of its Subsidiaries that
would reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the ability of the

materially impede or delay its ability to consummate the transactions as
contemplated by this Agreement.

Section 4.5 Compliance with Laws; Governmental Authorizations.

(a) The Buyer is not in violation of any Order or Law applicable to it or its

transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer has all licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations
necessary to conduct its business as currently conducted, except where the
failure to have such licenses, permits and other governmental authorizations
would not reasonably be expected to materially impede or delay the ability of
the Buyer to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

(b) Other than as set forth in Schedule 4.5(b) and as contemplated by Section
5.3(b), the execution, delivery and consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this Agreement by the Buyer does not require any material

Closing Date, sufficient cash to pay the Purchase Price and any other amounts
payable by the Buyer in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

may be, are purchasing the Sold Shares for their own account and solely for
investment, with no present intention to sell, transfer or distribute any Sold
Shares to any other Person. The Buyer acknowledges that none of the Sold

and the Buyer will not, and shall cause all of its Affiliates that purchase
the Sold Shares not to, sell, transfer or distribute any Sold Shares except in
compliance with the registration requirements or exemption provisions under
the Securities Act (if applicable to such Sold Shares) and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any other equivalent applicable
securities Law.

representations and warranties contained in this Article IV, neither the Buyer
nor any other Person makes any other express or implied representation or
warranty on behalf of the Buyer or any Affiliate of the Buyer with respect to

representatives, reasonable access, during normal business hours and upon
reasonable prior notice, to the officers, directors, management, accountants
and other advisors and agents, properties, books, records and contracts of the
Business solely for purposes related to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement; provided, that Seller Parent may impose reasonable limitations on
such access to ensure that such access does not interfere with the normal
business operations of Seller Parent, the Asset Seller or the Sold Companies
(including requiring the Buyer's representatives to be bound by customary
confidentiality agreements); provided further, that the Buyer shall pay any
out-of-pocket costs associated with such access; and provided further, that
any invasive water, soil or other environmental testing and monitoring shall
be conducted only with Seller Parent's prior written consent, such consent not
to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. The parties agree that
the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement shall continue in full force
and effect following the execution and delivery of this Agreement, and all
information obtained pursuant to this Section 5.2 shall be kept confidential
in accordance with the Confidentiality Agreement.

Section 5.3 Efforts; Regulatory Filings and Consents.

(a) Each of Seller Parent and the Buyer shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be
done, all things necessary, proper or advisable (i) to consummate and make
effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and (ii) to obtain
any Consent of any Governmental Antitrust Authority and any other Governmental
Authority required to be obtained or made by Seller Parent or the Buyer, or
any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the taking of any action
contemplated by this Agreement; provided, however, that neither party shall be
required to divest any assets, and provided, further, neither party shall be
required to make any material monetary expenditure, commence or be a plaintiff
in any litigation or offer or grant any material accommodation (financial or
otherwise) to any Person.

(b) Each of Seller Parent and the Buyer shall (i) as promptly as practicable
make all filings under applicable Other Competition Laws, if any, required or
advisable (as agreed upon by the parties) for the transactions contemplated
hereby, and (ii) as promptly as practicable make all required filings for
approval of this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby under
applicable laws of Germany, Poland and the United Kingdom. Any such antitrust
notification and report form or filing and supplemental information shall be
in substantial compliance with the requirements of the applicable Other
Competition Laws, as the case may be. All other regulatory filings shall be in
substantial compliance with the requirements of applicable Laws. Each of Seller Parent and the Buyer shall furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other may request in
connection with its preparation of any filing or submission that is necessary
under applicable Other Competition Laws or other applicable laws and
regulations, as the case may be. Seller Parent and the Buyer shall use their
respective commercially reasonable efforts to comply promptly with any
inquiries or requests for additional information and documentary material from
any Governmental Authority having jurisdiction.

(c) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings and subsections (a),
(b) and (d) of this Section 5.3 and subject to any appropriate confidentiality
protections, Seller Parent and the Buyer shall each furnish to the other such
necessary information and reasonable assistance as the other party may request
in connection with the foregoing and shall each promptly provide outside
counsel for the other party with copies of all filings made by such party, and
all correspondence between such party (and its advisors) with any Governmental
Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority and any other information
supplied by such party and such party's Affiliates to a Governmental Antitrust
Authority or other Governmental Authority in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Each such party shall,
subject to applicable Law, permit outside counsel for the other party (i) to
review in advance, if practicable, any proposed written or oral, communication
to any Governmental Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority and
(ii) to attend any telephonic or in person meeting with any Governmental
Antitrust Authority or other Governmental Authority.

(d) The filing fees under the Other Competition Laws and other applicable
Laws, as well as the fees and disbursements of any legal counsel or other
advisor jointly retained by the parties in connection with any such filings
and any other filings with Governmental Authorities, shall be borne by the
party incurring such fees and disbursements.

Section 5.4 Third Party Consents. Seller Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain any Consent of any Person (other than
Governmental Authorities) required to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Buyer agrees to reasonably
cooperate with such parties in obtaining such Consents. To the extent that
Seller Parent and the Buyer are unable to obtain any required third party
Consents prior to the Closing (such Consents, the "Post-Closing Consents"),
each of Seller Parent and the Buyer, respectively, shall use all commercially
reasonable efforts (including the making of any filing required to obtain any
Post-Closing Consents) to obtain (or cause to be obtained) as promptly as
practicable all Post-Closing Consents. For purposes of this Section 5.4, the
term "all commercially reasonable efforts" shall not be deemed to require any
Person to pay or commit to pay any material amount to (or incur any material
obligation in favor of) any Person from whom any consent or waiver may be
required.

Section 5.5 Tax Matters.

(a) The Buyer and Seller Parent agree to furnish or cause to be furnished to
each other, upon request, as promptly as practicable, such information and
assistance relating directly to the Sold Companies (including their respective
Subsidiaries), the Acquired Assets or the Business (including, in each case, access to books and records, employees, contractors
and representatives) as is reasonably necessary for the filing of all Tax
Returns, the making of any election related to Taxes, the preparation for any
audit by any Taxing Authority, and the prosecution or defense of any claim,
suit or proceeding relating to any Tax Return; provided, however, that if such
requested information is contained within a document containing any unrelated
information, only portions pertaining to such relevant information shall be
furnished. The Buyer and Seller Parent shall each retain all books and records
with respect to Taxes pertaining to the Sold Companies (including their
respective Subsidiaries), the Acquired Assets and the Business within their
respective possessions until thirty (30) days following the expiration of all
relevant statutes of limitations (and, to the extent notified by the Buyer and
Seller Parent, as the case may be, any extensions thereof). At the end of such
period, each party shall provide the other with at least 30 days' prior
written notice before destroying or disposing of any such books and records,
during which period the party receiving such notice can elect to take
possession, at its own expense, of such books and records. If a party destroys
or disposes of any such books and records prior to the expiration of all
relevant statutes of limitations, then such party that prematurely destroyed
or disposed of such books and records shall be fully responsible for any Tax
payment, including any penalties, resulting from, related to or arising out of
the destruction or disposal of such books and records.

(b) Seller Parent shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause
to be filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Sold Companies (including their
respective Subsidiaries), the Acquired Assets or the Business for any taxable
period ending on or before the Closing Date. All such Tax Returns shall be
prepared consistently with the past practice of Seller Parent, the Sold
Companies and the applicable Asset Sellers (in each case, to the extent
relating to the Business, and/or the Sold Companies, as applicable), in filing
their Tax Returns unless otherwise required by applicable Law. Seller Parent
shall forward to the Buyer copies of any such Tax Returns (other than income
Tax Returns of any Asset Seller, and any consolidated, combined, unitary or
other group Tax Return including the Sold Companies for such taxable period)
reasonably requested by Buyer for its review and comment (i) at least thirty
(30) days prior to the filing of such Tax Return or (ii) in the case of a Tax
Return that is required to be filed within thirty (30) days of the Closing
Date, at least ten (10) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to
be filed, and shall make such changes as are requested thereto by the Buyer to
the extent reasonable and consistent with applicable Law. Seller Parent shall
timely file each such Tax Return or forward such Tax Returns to the Buyer for
filing. Seller Parent shall be responsible for, and shall pay the amount of,
any Taxes shown as due on any such Tax Returns to the extent in excess of any
accrual in respect thereof that was taken into account in the Final Working
Capital, and Buyer shall be responsible for, and shall pay the amount of, any
Taxes shown as due on any such Tax Returns to the extent of any accrual in
respect thereof that was taken into account in the Final Working Capital, with
the timing of such payment in each case determined in accordance with Section
9.7(c). The Buyer shall prepare, or cause to be prepared, and file, or cause
to be filed, all Tax Returns in respect of the Sold Companies (including their
respective Subsidiaries), the Acquired Assets or the Business for any taxable
period ending after the Closing Date. To the extent such Tax Returns relate to
a taxable period ending after the Closing Date which begins on or before the
Closing Date (a "Straddle Period"), such Tax Returns shall be prepared in a
manner consistent with past practices unless otherwise required by applicable
Law. The Buyer shall provide Seller Parent with a draft of each Straddle
Period Tax Return (and such additional information regarding such Straddle
Period Tax Return as may reasonably be requested by Seller Parent consistent
with applicable Law) for its review and comment (i) at least thirty (30) days
prior to the filing of such Tax Return or (ii) in the case of a Tax Return
that is required to be filed within thirty (30) days of the Closing Date, at least ten
(10) days prior to the date such Tax Return is required to be filed; provided,
that in the case of a Tax Return that is required to be filed within ten (10)
days of the Closing Date, the Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to
afford Seller Parent a reasonable opportunity to review such Straddle Period
Tax Return prior to filing such Tax Return. The Buyer shall make all changes
to Straddle Period Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Seller Parent,
to the extent permitted under applicable Law. The Buyer, its applicable
Affiliates, or the applicable Sold Companies or Sold Company Subsidiary, as
the case may require, shall pay the amount shown to be due on any such Tax
Returns to the relevant Taxing Authority. To the extent the Taxes due with
respect to such Straddle Period Tax Returns are the responsibility of Seller
Parent pursuant to Section 9.7(a), Seller Parent shall pay to the Buyer the
amount of such Taxes, with the timing of such payment determined in accordance
with Section 9.7(c).

(c) For purposes of Section 5.5(b) and otherwise under this Agreement, other
than with respect to Transfer Taxes, in order to apportion appropriately any
Taxes relating to a Straddle Period (including refunds of, or credits in lieu
thereof attributable to, such Taxes), the Parties shall, to the extent
permitted or required under applicable Law, treat the Closing Date as the last
day of the taxable period of each of the Sold Companies (including their
respective Subsidiaries) and the Asset Sellers (with respect to the Business)
for all Tax purposes. In any case where applicable Law does not permit any
Sold Company (including their respective Subsidiaries) or the Asset Sellers
(with respect to the Business) to treat the Closing Date as the last day of
the taxable period, the amount of any Taxes for the portion of any Straddle
Period ending on and including the Closing Date shall (x), in the case of any
Tax based upon or related to income, gains, receipts, employment, sales, use,
or other Taxes imposed on a non-periodic basis, be based on an interim closing
of the books as of the end of the Closing Date (and for such purpose, the
taxable period of any pass-through entity or controlled foreign corporation
(within the meaning of the Code) shall be deemed to terminate at such time),
provided, however, that exemptions, allowances or deductions that are
calculated on an annual basis (including depreciation and amortization
deductions) shall be allocated between the period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the period after the Closing Date in proportion to the number
of days in each such period, and (y), in the case of property, ad valorem and
other Taxes imposed on a periodic basis, be deemed to be the amount of such
Taxes for the entire taxable period multiplied by a fraction the numerator of
which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on and including the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire
taxable period. Any credits relating to a Taxable period that begins before
and ends after the Closing Date shall be taken into account as though the
relevant Taxable period ended on and included the Closing Date. All
determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be
made in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Sold Companies
(including their respective Subsidiaries) or the Sellers (with respect to the
Business), as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Taxes relating to
any transactions initiated by the Buyer that are not in the ordinary course of
business that occur after the time of the Closing on the Closing Date shall be
treated as occurring on the day after the Closing Date. (d) Tax Elections.

(i) Without the written consent of Seller Parent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), the Buyer and its Affiliates
(including the Sold Companies and their respective Subsidiaries) shall not
make any Tax election under the Code (or the Tax Laws of any other
jurisdiction) with respect to the Sold Companies or their respective
Subsidiaries which would cause the sale of the Sold Shares to be treated as an
asset sale for Tax purposes, including any "check-the-box" election pursuant
to Section 301.7701-3 of the Treasury regulations or any election pursuant to
Section 338 or Section 336(e) of the Code (or, in each case, any comparable
state, local or non-U.S. Law). At the request of Seller Parent (including any
additional Taxes of Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Sold Companies and
their respective Subsidiaries) arising as a result of any such election), the
Buyer or its Affiliates (including the Sold Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries) shall make, or shall join Seller Parent (or any Affiliate of the
Seller Parent) in making, any such election under the Code (or the Tax Laws of
any other jurisdiction) with respect to the Sold Companies and their
respective Subsidiaries, as applicable, and shall execute and file any
documentation and take any action as is necessary to effectuate such election;
provided, however, that Seller Parent shall pay all costs of evaluating,
preparing and filing any such election, and any additional Taxes, costs,
expenses or other losses incurred by Buyer, any Sold Company, or any of their
respective Affiliates, arising as a result of, or otherwise attributable to,
the making of any such elections, as determined by the Buyer in its sole
discretion.

(ii) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained or implied in this
Agreement, unless otherwise required by applicable Law, neither the Buyer nor
its Affiliates (including the Sold Companies and their respective
Subsidiaries) shall, without the prior written consent of Seller Parent (such
consent not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed), file or
cause to be filed any amended any Tax Return or claim for Tax refund with
respect to the Sold Companies or their respective Subsidiaries (or, in each
case, relating to their income, properties or operations) or the Acquired
Assets, consent to the waiver or extension of the statute of limitations
relating to Taxes of the Sold Companies, the Subsidiaries of the Sold
Companies or the Acquired Assets, take any Tax position on any Tax Return, or
compromise or settle any Tax liability, in each case, if such action would be
reasonably likely to have the effect of increasing the liability of Seller
Parent, or its Affiliates for Taxes under this Agreement. Seller Parent shall
be deemed to have given its consent if Seller Parent does not provide written
comments within twenty (20) Business Days after receipt of a written request
from the Buyer specifying the subject matter in reasonable detail and
including copies of all necessary documentation.

(e) Any Tax refunds that are received by the Buyer, or the Sold Companies
(including their respective Subsidiaries), and any amounts credited against

except to the extent that amounts in respect of the right to such refund are
reflected in the Final Working Capital, and the Buyer shall pay over to Seller
Parent the amount of any such refund or any such credit (net of Taxes, if any,
incurred solely as a result of the receipt of such refund) within fifteen (15)
days after the receipt or entitlement thereto. In addition, to the extent that
a claim for refund, credit or other Tax benefit or offsetting adjustment in
connection with any audits, examinations or Tax proceedings results in a
refund (or credit against otherwise currently payable Tax) by a Taxing
Authority to the Buyer or the Sold Companies (including their respective Subsidiaries) of any
amount accrued for any taxable period (or portions thereof in the case of the
Straddle Period) ending on or before the Closing Date, including any Tax
benefits allowable in connection with the Excluded Liabilities or Excluded
Assets, then other than to the extent such refund or credit was taken into

such refund or credit (net of Taxes, if any, incurred solely as a result of
the receipt of such refund) to Seller Parent within fifteen (15) days after

conditioned or delayed), cause or permit the Sold Companies (or their
respective Subsidiaries) to carry back to any taxable period ending on or
prior to the Closing Date any net operating loss, loss from operations or
other Tax attribute, and further agrees that Seller Parent has no obligation
under this Agreement to return or remit any refund or other Tax benefit
attributable to a breach by the Buyer of the foregoing undertaking. For
purposes of this Section 5.5(e), to the extent that any Tax reflected as a
Liability in the Final Working Capital exceeds the amount of such Tax actually
paid, or due and payable, to the relevant Taxing Authority, the amount of such
excess shall be treated as a Tax refund for the account of Seller Parent.

Germany and Terex Germany shall not be required to reimburse Terex Cranes if,

VAT amount to Terex Germany or received payment of the respective input VAT
amount from Terex Germany, as the case may be, until and including the Closing

representatives (the "Buyer Indemnified Persons") from, against and in respect
of any and all Losses that they incur arising out of or due to, without

and (x) payments on any credit guaranties required to be set forth on Schedule
5.24 (which Schedule the parties agree may be updated pursuant to Section
5.22) in excess of the amount reserved for on the Final Statement.

(b) In respect of Section 9.1(a)(i) (in the case of the Buyer Indemnified
Persons) or Section 9.2(a) (in the case of the Seller Parent Indemnified
Persons), as applicable, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, other than claims relating to (w) fraud or intentional misconduct, (x)

related to Taxes in Section 3.10 of this Agreement, and (z) Taxes pursuant to
Section 9.7, the following thresholds and limits shall apply:

(i) none of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, on the one hand, or the Seller
Party Indemnified Persons, on the other, as applicable, shall be entitled to
recover any such individual Loss that is $200,000 or less;

(ii) none of the Buyer Indemnified Persons, on the one hand, or the Seller
Party Indemnified Persons, on the other, as applicable, shall be entitled to
recover any such Losses unless and until the total of all such Losses,
including such Losses which do not individually exceed $200,000, collectively
exceeds $2,000,000 and then only for the amount by which such Losses
collectively exceed $2,000,000; and

(iii) no Buyer Indemnified Persons, on the one hand, or Seller Party

more, in the aggregate, than $20,000,000 with respect to all such Losses. Section 9.2 Indemnification by the Buyer. Subject to the limits set forth in

Persons") from, against and in respect of any and all Losses, that they incur

representation or warranty of the Buyer contained in this Agreement, (b) any
failure of the Buyer to perform any covenant or other agreement of the Buyer

resulting from this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

Section 9.4 Indemnification Calculations.

(a) The amount of any Losses for which indemnification is provided under this
Agreement shall be computed net of any insurance proceeds or proceeds pursuant
to any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by and against any other Person
received by the Indemnified Party in connection with such Losses, net of any
Taxes incurred on such proceeds. If an Indemnified Party receives insurance
proceeds or other proceeds in connection with Losses for which it has received
indemnification, such party shall refund to the Indemnifying Party the amount
of such insurance proceeds or other proceeds when received, up to the amount
of indemnification received, but net of Taxes. An Indemnified Party shall use
its commercially reasonable efforts to pursue insurance claims with respect to
any Losses.

(b) If the amount with respect to which any claim is made under this Agreement
(an "Indemnity Claim") gives rise to a Tax benefit to the Indemnified Party
(or any of its Affiliates) and such Tax benefit (or any portion thereof) is
actually realized in cash (or as a reduction of Taxes otherwise currently
payable in cash in the then-current taxable period), the indemnity payment
shall be reduced by the amount of such Tax benefit, when and as realized and
determined on a "with and without" basis, and, if such Tax benefit is actually
realized after an indemnification payment is made, the Indemnified Party
shall, within seven days of so actually realizing such Tax benefit, pay (on
its behalf or on behalf of its Affiliate, as applicable) to the Indemnifying
Party the amount of such realized Tax benefit, up to the amount of
indemnification received.

(c) Seller Parent and the Buyer agree to use commercially reasonable efforts
to mitigate any Loss that forms the basis of a claim hereunder.

(d) For purposes of calculating the amount of Losses arising from a breach of
a representation or warranty and determining whether a breach of a
representation or warranty has occurred, the representation or warranty shall
not be deemed qualified by any references to any materiality, "Material
Adverse Effect" or similar qualification contained in or otherwise applicable
to such representation or warranty. Section 9.5 Survival. The representations and warranties of the parties
contained in this Agreement or in any instrument delivered pursuant hereto
will survive the Closing and will remain in full force and effect thereafter
until 5:00 p.m. (New York City time) on the second (2nd) anniversary of the
Closing Date, except that the representations and warranties contained in (a)
Section 3.1 (Organization), Section 3.2(a) (Authorization; Enforceability),
Section 3.3 (Capital Stock of the Sold Companies), Section 3.4 (Subsidiaries),
Section 3.21 (No Brokers' or Other Fees), Section 4.1 (Organization) and
Section 4.2(a) (Authorization; Enforceability) and Section 4.7 (No Brokers' or
other Fees) shall survive indefinitely, (b) Section 2.4 (Consideration),
Section 3.10 (Tax Matters), Section 5.5 (Tax Matters), Section 5.11 (Expenses;
Transfer Taxes) and Section 9.7 (Tax Indemnity) shall survive the Closing Date
until thirty (30) days following the expiration of the applicable statute of
limitations; provided, that for German Tax purposes, the statute of
limitations shall not be deemed to expire any earlier than ninety (90) days
after the relevant Tax assessment notices (Steuerbescheide) for the respective
fiscal year/taxing period have become final, binding and non-appealable
(formell und materiell bestandskraftig), and (c) Section 3.15 (Environmental
Matters) shall survive the Closing Date until the fifth (5th) anniversary of
the Closing Date; provided, that, in any case under the immediately preceding
clauses (a) through (c), all survival periods shall be extended automatically
to include any time period necessary to resolve a good faith claim for
indemnification which was made in accordance with Section 9.6 before the
expiration of such survival period but not resolved prior to its expiration.

Section 9.6 Notice and Opportunity to Defend.

(a) If there occurs an event which a party asserts is an indemnifiable event
pursuant to Section 9.1 or Section 9.2, the party or parties seeking
indemnification (the "Indemnified Party") shall notify the other party or
parties obligated to provide indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party")
promptly after becoming aware of such event, provided, however, that the
failure to provide such written notice shall not excuse the Indemnifying Party
from any of its obligations under this Article IX except to the extent that
the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby, so long as in any event
the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing `of the claim
and the facts relating to it prior to the expiration of the applicable
survival period. Such notice shall describe in reasonable detail the good
faith basis upon which indemnification is then being sought. For a period of
thirty (30) days following such notice, the Indemnified Party and the
Indemnifying Party shall negotiate in good faith to resolve such claim.
Thereafter, either party may exercise any right or remedy available hereunder.

(b) If any third party notifies any party hereto with respect to any matter
which may give rise to a claim for indemnification under this Agreement
against the other party hereto, then the Indemnified Party will notify the
Indemnifying Party thereof in writing promptly, but in no event later than 30
days following the Indemnified Party's receipt of such notice, stating the
nature and basis of any claim made by the third party; provided, that no delay
on the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying the Indemnifying Party will
relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder except to the
extent that the Indemnifying Party is actually prejudiced thereby, so long as
in any event the Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing
of the claim and the facts relating to it prior to the expiration of the
applicable survival period. Within 30 days after receiving such notice, the
Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to the Indemnified Party stating
whether it disputes the claim for indemnification and whether it will defend
against any third party claim or liability at its own cost and expense. To the
extent the Indemnifying Party does not dispute the claim for indemnification, the
Indemnifying Party shall be entitled to direct the defense against a third
party claim or liability with counsel selected by it (subject to the consent
of the Indemnified Party, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) as
long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting a good faith and diligent defense
(it being agreed that counsel for an Indemnifying Party's insurer shall be
deemed consented to by the Indemnified Party). The Indemnifying Party shall
not (x) consent to the entry of a judgment with respect to any matter or (y)
enter into any settlement which, in either case, does not include a provision
whereby the plaintiff or claimant in the matter releases the Indemnified Party
from all liability with respect thereto and is not consented to in writing by
the Indemnified Party. To the extent the Indemnifying Party elects to take
over the defense of such third party claim, the Indemnified Party shall at all
times have the right to fully participate in the defense of a third party
claim or liability at its own expense directly or through counsel; provided,
however, that if (i) the named parties to an action or proceeding include both
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party and (ii) the Indemnified
Party is advised in writing by its outside counsel that representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate under applicable standards
of professional conduct, then, in such event, the Indemnified Party may engage
separate counsel (subject to the consent of the Indemnifying Party, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) for such
action or proceeding at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party. If
an Indemnifying Party (A) fails timely to notify the Indemnified Party that
the Indemnifying Party will defend against a third party claim, (B) disputes
the Indemnified Party's claim for indemnification or (C) fails to commence, or
if commenced, fails to prosecute, a diligent defense of a third party claim,
then in either of such events, the Indemnified Party shall have the right, at
the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying Party, to undertake the defense of
such claim (with counsel selected by the Indemnified Party and reasonably
acceptable to the Indemnifying Party), and to compromise or settle such claim,
with the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed. If a third party claim
or liability is one that by its nature cannot be defended solely by the
Indemnifying Party, then the Indemnified Party shall make available such
information and assistance as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request
and shall cooperate with the Indemnifying Party in such defense, at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party.

Section 9.7 Tax Indemnity. Other than as specifically set forth in Sections
9.1, 9.2, 9.4 and 9.9:

(a) Seller Parent shall indemnify the Buyer and its Affiliates (including the
Sold Companies) and each of their respective officers, directors,
stockholders, employees, agents and representatives and hold them harmless
against (i) all Tax liabilities of Seller Parent, the Sold Companies or their
Affiliates (including their respective Subsidiaries) for all taxable periods
(or portions thereof in the case of a Straddle Period, which shall be
apportioned in accordance with the principles set forth in Section 5.5(c))
ending on or before the Closing Date, including interest accrued on such Tax
Liabilities (even to the extent accruing after the Closing Date), except to
the extent such Taxes are reflected as a Liability on the Final Working
Capital, (ii) all Taxes that are Excluded Liabilities, (iii) all Tax
liabilities arising out of or due to any breach of any covenant or other
agreement of Seller Parent, any Seller or any Sold Company contained in this
Agreement, (iv) any amount of receivables for Tax refunds, which have been
reflected in the Final Working Capital, if and to the extent that such Tax
refund proves non-recoverable and the respective receivable needs to be
dissolved in the applicable Sold Company's or Sold Company Subsidiary's
individual financial statements, (v) any Taxes payable by the Sold Companies (including the Sold
Company Subsidiaries) to the extent such Taxes are caused by Transaction
Expenses, even if the payment triggering the respective Tax occurs after
Closing (including but not limited to withholding Taxes on deemed dividends or
payroll Taxes on transaction bonuses), (vi) Transfer Taxes allocable to Seller
Parent in accordance with Section 5.11(b) and (vii) any Taxes attributable to
the restructuring of the ownership of the Acquired Assets between the date of
this Agreement and the Closing Date; provided, however, that no
indemnification will be provided in any case with respect to: (A) any such Tax
liability that results from any action of the Sold Companies (including their
respective Subsidiaries), the Buyer, any of their Affiliates, or any
transferee of the Sold Companies (including their respective Subsidiaries), in
each case, after the Closing that takes retroactive effect under the
applicable Tax Law (i.e., any such action, regardless of when taken, affects
Tax liability in a taxable period (or portion thereof) for which Seller Parent
or any of its Affiliates is liable or has assumed an indemnification
obligation), other than to the extent that implementation of these measures is
required under applicable Law or has been agreed to in writing with Seller
Parent (such measures described in this clause (A), including the conclusion
and/or termination of the PLPA, change of Tax accounting practices or Tax
election rights or retroactive reorganizations, each, a "Buyer Tax Act"), (B)
any legal fees or expenses incurred in connection with a Buyer Tax Act, or (C)
any such Tax to the extent that such Tax has already been paid to the relevant
Taxing Authority on or before the Closing Date.

(b) The Buyer shall indemnify Seller Parent and its Affiliates (other than the
Sold Companies and their Subsidiaries) and each of their officers, directors,
employees and agents and hold them harmless against (i) all Tax liabilities of
the Sold Companies (including their respective Subsidiaries) or with respect
to the Acquired Assets (A) resulting from any Buyer Tax Act or (B) with
respect to any taxable period (or portion thereof in the case of a Straddle
Period, the Taxes in respect of which shall be apportioned in accordance with
the principles set forth in Section 5.5(c)) that begins after the Closing
Date, (ii) all Taxes that are Assumed Liabilities, (iii) Transfer Taxes
allocable to the Buyer in accordance with Section 5.11(b) and (iv) all Tax
Liabilities arising out of or due to any breach of any covenant or other
agreement of the Buyer contained in this Agreement.

(c) Payment by the indemnitor of any amount due under this Section 9.7 shall
be made within ten (10) Business Days following written notice by the
indemnitee that payment of such amounts to the appropriate Taxing Authority is
due, provided that the indemnitor shall not be required to make any payment
earlier than five (5) Business Days before it is due to the appropriate Taxing
Authority. In the case of any written notice by any of the Buyer or its
Affiliates indicating that Taxes are due for a Straddle Period Tax Return,
such notice shall set forth in reasonable detail the calculations regarding
Seller Parent's share of such Taxes, and if within ten (10) Business Days
after receipt of such notice, Seller Parent notifies the Buyer in writing that
it disagrees with the computation of its share of such Taxes, Seller Parent
and the Buyer shall proceed in good faith to determine Seller Parent's share
of such Taxes. If Seller Parent and the Buyer cannot agree in good faith on
such share within thirty (30) days after Seller Parent's receipt of such
notice, Seller Parent's share of such Taxes shall be determined pursuant to
Section 9.7(e); provided, that if the amount of Seller Parent's share of such
Taxes is not finally determined prior to the date that such Taxes are due and
payable, Seller Parent shall pay its share of the amount of such Taxes as
determined by the Buyer, and if it is subsequently determined that Seller
Parent's share of such Taxes was less than the amount determined by the Buyer,
the Buyer shall pay such excess amount to Seller Parent. Seller Parent's payment to the Buyer shall be
due three (3) Business Days after the amount payable by Seller Parent is
determined by agreement between Seller Parent and the Buyer or pursuant to
Section 9.7(e), subject to the proviso in the first sentence of this Section
9.7(c). In the case of a Tax that is contested in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9.8 below, other than a Tax that is due and payable in
connection with filing an applicable Tax Return, payment of the Tax to the
appropriate Taxing Authority shall not be considered to be due earlier than
the date a final determination to such effect is made by the appropriate
Taxing Authority or court. For the avoidance of doubt, any interest incurred
by the Buyer or its Affiliates (including any Sold Company or Sold Company
Subsidiary after the Closing) in relation to a suspension of Tax payments, if
requested by Seller Parent pursuant to Section 9.8 shall be borne by Seller
Parent.

(d) Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary, the
obligations of a party to indemnify and hold harmless another party pursuant
to this Section 9.7 shall terminate in accordance with Section 9.5(b).

(e) Any disputes between the parties with respect to the Tax matters regarding
the Sold Companies or their respective Subsidiaries (or, in each case,
relating to their income, properties or operations) or the Acquired Assets in
Sections 5.5, 9.7 and 9.8 shall be resolved in accordance with the dispute
provisions set forth in Section 2.7(e) mutatis mutandis. The parties shall
each bear the fees of their respective counsel, accountants and other
representatives incurred in connection with any such disputes.

Section 9.8 Procedures Relating to Indemnity of Tax Claims.

(a) If a claim shall be made against the Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case
may be, or any of their Affiliates by any Taxing Authority, which, if
successful, would result in an indemnity payment to the Buyer or Seller
Parent, as the case may be, or one of their respective Affiliates pursuant to
Section 9.7(a) or (b) (a "Tax Claim"), the Buyer or Seller Parent, as the case
may be, shall promptly notify Seller Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be,
in writing of such Tax Claim stating the nature and basis of such Tax Claim
and the amount thereof, to the extent known. If notice of a Tax Claim is not
given within a sufficient period of time to allow Seller Parent or the Buyer,
as the case may be, to effectively contest such Tax Claim, or in reasonable
detail to apprise Seller Parent or the Buyer, as the case may be, of the
nature of the Tax Claim, in each case taking into account the facts and
circumstances with respect to such Tax Claim, Seller Parent or the Buyer, as
the case may be, shall not be liable to the Buyer or Seller Parent, as the
case may be, or any of their Affiliates to the extent that Seller Parent's or
the Buyer's, as the case may be, ability to effectively contest such Tax Claim
is materially prejudiced as a result thereof.

(b) With respect to any Tax Claim that relates solely to a taxable period of a
Sold Company or Sold Company Subsidiary ending on or before the Closing Date,
at Seller Parent's election and Seller Parent's sole expense, Seller Parent and Seller
Parent's professional advisors shall have the right to reasonably control all
proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Claim, including whether to
pursue or forego any and all administrative appeals, proceedings, hearings and
conferences with any Taxing Authority with respect thereto, whether to sue for
a refund where applicable Law permits such refund suits, and whether to
otherwise contest the Tax Claim in any permissible manner; provided that (1)
the Buyer and its professional advisors shall have the right to participate
in, and consult with Seller Parent regarding, the course of any such audit or
proceeding to the extent that, in the reasonable judgment of the Buyer, an
adverse determination in any such audit or proceeding would result in a
material Tax liability of the Buyer, the Sold Companies (including their Sold
Company Subsidiaries) or any of their Affiliates in a Tax period that ends
after the Closing and (2) Seller Parent shall not settle or compromise any
such Tax Claim without the prior written consent of the Buyer, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed.

(c) The Buyer shall have the exclusive right to control the conduct of any Tax
Claim described in subparagraph (b) that Seller Parent does not elect to
direct, any Tax Claim relating to a taxable period (other than a Straddle
Period) that begins after the Closing Date, as well as a Tax Claim relating to
a Straddle Period so long as the matter does not relate to federal Taxes or
state, local or foreign income Taxes applicable to a Sold Company (including
their respective Subsidiaries) or Seller Parent (or Affiliate) for any portion
of such period prior to the Closing Date. If such Tax Claim does relate to
federal Taxes or state, local or foreign income Taxes for any portion of such
period prior to the Closing Date, Seller Parent shall have the rights, and
shall have such obligations, as specified in the preceding paragraph (b). With
respect to any Tax Claim relating to the portion of a Straddle Period ending
on or prior to the Closing Date and that is not covered by the immediately
preceding sentence, the Buyer shall control at its expense all proceedings
taken in connection with such Tax Claim (including selection of counsel) but
shall not, without the prior written approval of Seller Parent (which shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed, and shall be deemed to be granted if
Seller Parent does not respond within twenty (20) Business Days (or ten (10)
days in the case of urgent matters, which shall be specified in the
communication requesting such approval) after receipt of the Buyer's request
for such approval), agree or consent to compromise or settle, either
administratively or after the commencement of litigation, any issue or claim
arising in such proceeding, or otherwise agree or consent to any Tax
liability, to the extent that any such compromise, settlement, consent or
agreement may increase the liability of Seller Parent for Taxes under Section
9.7 of this Agreement, unless the Buyer indemnifies the Sellers for the
increase in Taxes resulting from such compromise, settlement, consent or
agreement.

Section 9.9 Other Limitations on Indemnification.

(a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, no
Buyer Indemnified Person shall be entitled to indemnification under Article V
or IX for any Losses to the extent that such Losses (a) relate to any action
taken by the Buyer or any of its Affiliates or representatives in breach of
this Agreement or (b) are reflected as a liability of the Business on the
Final Statement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, no Seller Parent Indemnified Person shall be entitled to
indemnification under Article V or IX for any Losses to the extent that such
Losses (a) relate to any action taken by Seller Parent or any of its
Affiliates or representatives in breach of this Agreement. (b) The Buyer shall (or shall cause the named insured under the RandW Policy
to), on behalf of the applicable Buyer Indemnified Person(s), first seek
recovery for any portion of Losses that would otherwise constitute
indemnifiable Losses pursuant to this Article IX and that are subject to
coverage under RandW Policy ("Covered Losses"). With respect to indemnifiable
Losses arising under Sections 9.1(a)(i), 9.1(a)(iii), 9.1(a)(iv) or 9.7,
Seller Parent shall have no obligation to indemnify any Buyer Indemnified
Person for those Covered Losses that are actually recovered by the applicable
Buyer Indemnified Person(s) from the RandW Policy, and any claim for indemnity
pursuant to Sections 9.1(a)(i) with respect to any Covered Losses shall be
held in abeyance pending the full and final resolution of any applicable claim
under the RandW Policy. Except as set forth in the immediately preceding
sentence, Buyer Indemnified Person(s) shall be entitled to pursue all rights
and remedies available to them under this Agreement concurrently with seeking
recovery under the RandW Policy, subject to the obligations of Buyer Indemnified
Persons pursuant to all other provisions of this Article IX (expressly
including, without limitation, the obligation to refund any insurance proceeds
subsequently received pursuant to Section 9.4(a)). Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, if the RandW Policy is not procured and issued
in accordance with Section 5.23 of this Agreement, then this Section 9.9(b)
shall not apply and shall be of no force and effect.

Section 9.10 Characterization of Indemnity Payments. Seller Parent and the
Buyer agree to treat any indemnity payment made pursuant to this Article IX as
an adjustment to the Purchase Price for federal, state, local and foreign Tax
purposes, unless otherwise required by applicable Law.

Section 9.11 Certain Indemnification Matters.

(a) The parties agree that Seller Parent shall, or shall cause its Affiliates
to, defend against the claims or liabilities set forth in Schedule 9.1(a)(v)
at its own cost and expense, and shall control such defense, including by
retaining and directing counsel and other professionals in connection with
such defense; provided, that Seller Parent shall not enter into any settlement
of such claims without receiving the Buyer's prior written consent if such
settlement does not include a full and unconditional release of the Buyer and
its Affiliates, and no statement or admission of responsibility by the Buyer
or any of its Affiliates. The Buyer covenants and agrees that after the
Closing, the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith with Seller Parent
and any retained professionals and other representatives Seller Parent
reasonably chooses to engage in connection with the defense, including by
providing reasonable access to any relevant documents, employees (including
but not limited to Klaus Meissner), and other material information that is
reasonably necessary in the defense of such matters, in each case, at the sole
cost of Seller Parent; provided, that with respect to employees, such access
shall not (i) obligate any such employee (or the Buyer to cause any such
employee) to miss an unreasonable amount of work or (ii) otherwise cause
unreasonable interference with such employees duties with respect to the
Business; provided, further, that the Buyer may, upon advice of outside
counsel, deny any such access pursuant to this sentence if in the opinion of
such outside counsel, doing so would cause the Buyer to lose privilege,
violate confidentiality, or violate applicable Law. The Buyer further
covenants and agrees that in the event that after the Closing it receives any
claims, notices or other information relevant to the defense of the claims or
liabilities set forth in Schedule 9.1(a)(v), it will provide such material to
Seller Parent as promptly as reasonably practicable following receipt thereof. (b) In the event an indemnity claim under Section 9.1(a)(x) has been asserted
against Seller Parent, Seller Parent shall have the right to control and
direct the process of mitigating the amount indemnifiable with respect to such
claim, including, without limitation, (i) retaining and directing
professionals, (ii) directing any product repossessions, refurbishments,
remarketing and resales (including pricing), and (iii) such other actions that
reasonably prudent companies conducting a business similar to the Business
would be likely to undertake. The Buyer covenants and agrees that after the
Closing, the Buyer shall reasonably cooperate in good faith with Seller Parent
in such mitigation efforts.

ARTICLE X 

MISCELLANEOUS

Section 10.1 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be construed under and
governed by the Laws of the State of New York.

Section 10.2 Projections. In connection with the Buyer's investigation of the
Sold Companies and the Business, the Buyer may have received, or may receive,
from Seller Parent and/or their respective representatives certain projections
and other forecasts for the Business, and certain business plan and budget
information. The Buyer acknowledges that (a) there are uncertainties inherent
in attempting to make such projections, forecasts, plans and budgets, (b) the
Buyer is familiar with such uncertainties, and (c) the Buyer is taking full
responsibility for making its own evaluation of the accuracy of all estimates,
projections, forecasts, plans and budgets so furnished to it. Accordingly, the
Buyer acknowledges that Seller Parent makes no representation or warranty with
respect to such projections, forecasts, business plans or budget information
and that Seller Parent makes only those representations and warranties
explicitly set forth in Article III.

Section 10.3 Materiality; Schedules.

(a) As used in this Agreement, unless the context would require otherwise, the
terms "material" and the concept of the "material" nature of an effect upon
the Sold Companies or the Business shall be measured relative to the entire
Business, taken as a whole, as such business is currently being conducted.

(b) With respect to the Schedules hereto, the disclosures made on any Schedule
with respect to any representation or warranty shall be deemed to be made with
respect to any other representation or warranty to which the relevance of such
disclosure is reasonably apparent on its face.

Section 10.4 Amendment. This Agreement may not be amended, modified or
supplemented except upon the execution and delivery of a written agreement
executed by the parties hereto. Section 10.5 Waiver. Any of the terms or conditions of this Agreement, which
may be lawfully waived, may be waived in writing at any time by each party
which is entitled to the benefits thereof. Any waiver of any of the provisions
of this Agreement by any party hereto shall be binding only if set forth in an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of such party. No failure to enforce
any provision of this Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a
waiver of such provision and no waiver of any of the provisions of this
Agreement shall be deemed to or shall constitute a waiver of any other
provision hereof (whether or not similar) nor shall such waiver constitute a
continuing waiver.

Section 10.6 Assignment. This Agreement and the rights and obligations
hereunder shall not be assignable or transferable by the Buyer or Seller
Parent (including by operation of law in connection with a merger or
consolidation of the Buyer or Seller Parent) without the prior written consent
of the other parties hereto. Notwithstanding the foregoing, prior to Closing,
the Buyer may assign its right to purchase the Acquired Assets, the Sold
Shares or any of its other rights or any portion thereof hereunder to one or
more Affiliates of the Buyer without the prior written consent of Seller
Parent, provided that such assignment (a) shall not relieve the Buyer of its
obligations hereunder, (b) will not render a representation of the Buyer
hereunder untrue and (c) does not adversely impact or delay the obtaining of
any material Consent required by this Agreement to be obtained, or otherwise
hinder or delay the completion of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Seller Parent may, or may cause its
Affiliates to, transfer assets, create holding companies or otherwise
restructure the Business to facilitate the sale to the Buyer, so long as such
restructuring is consented to beforehand in writing by the Buyer. After the
Closing, any merger, consolidation, restructuring or other transaction
involving the Buyer, any of the Sold Companies, any Sold Company Subsidiary,
or any of their respective Affiliates, shall not materially impair any of the
rights of any such party or such party's legal successor under this Agreement,
whether to indemnification or otherwise.

any respect by a court of competent jurisdiction in any jurisdiction, such
invalidity, illegality or unenforceability shall, as to that jurisdiction, be
ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability,
without affecting in any way the remaining provisions hereof in such
jurisdiction or rendering that or any other provision of this Agreement
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. Upon such
determination that any provision or the application thereof is invalid,
illegal or unenforceable, the parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to
modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as
closely as possible to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law in an
acceptable manner to the end that the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement are fulfilled to the extent possible.
