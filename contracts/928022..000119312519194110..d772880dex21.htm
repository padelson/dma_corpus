_THE MERGER_

 

Section 1.1 _The_ _Merger_. At the Effective Time, upon the terms and subject
to the conditions set forth in this Agreement and in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the DGCL and TBOC, the Company shall be merged with

continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware.

Section 1.2 _Closing_. The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall
take place by the exchange of documents by electronic mail in "portable
document format" (".pdf") form or other electronic means at 9:00 a.m., local
time, on the fifth business day after the satisfaction or waiver (to the
extent permitted by applicable Law) of the conditions set forth in _Article_
_VI_ (other than those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at
the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or waiver of such conditions),
or at such other place, date and time as the Company and Parent may agree in
writing. The date on which the Closing actually occurs is referred to as the "
_Closing Date_."

 

Section 1.3 _Effective Time_. On the Closing Date, Parent and the Company
shall file with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the
Secretary of State of the State of Texas, respectively, certificates of merger
(collectively, the " _Certificates of Merger_ "), executed in accordance with,
and containing such information as is required by, the relevant provisions of
the DGCL and the TBOC, respectively, in order to effect the Merger. The Merger
shall become effective at such time as specified in the Certificates of Merger
after acceptance by the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware and the
Secretary of State of the State of Texas or at such other date and time as may
be provided by applicable Law (such date and time is hereinafter referred to
as the " _Effective Time_ ").

 

Section 1.4 _Effects of the Merger_. The Merger will have the effects
specified in this Agreement and as provided in the applicable provisions of
the DGCL and the TBOC. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, and
subject thereto, at the Effective Time, all the property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of the Company and Parent shall vest in the
Surviving Company, and all debts, liabilities and duties of the Company and
Parent shall become the debts, liabilities and duties of the Surviving
Company, all as provided under the TBOC and the DGCL, as applicable.

 

Section 1.5 _Organizational Documents of the Surviving_ _Company_. At the
Effective Time, the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Parent, as in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, shall be the certificate of
incorporation and bylaws of the Surviving Company until thereafter amended in
accordance with the provisions thereof and applicable Law.

 



\- 6 -

    

Section 1.6 _Officers_. The parties shall take all necessary actions so that,
from and after the Effective Time, the officers of Parent immediately prior
to the Effective Time shall be the officers of the Surviving Company and shall
hold office until their respective successors are duly elected and qualified,
or their earlier death, resignation or removal.

Section 1.7 _Governance_. Unless otherwise agreed to by Parent and the Company
prior to the Closing, Parent shall take all such action, including through
action of the Parent Board of Directors, as may be necessary so that,
immediately after the Effective Time, the directors of Parent shall consist of
(i) each director of Parent immediately prior to the Effective Time and (ii)
(A) two members of the Company Board of Directors, who shall be designated by
the Company prior to the Closing and appointed to the Parent Board of
Directors, and (B) one additional member of the Company Board of Directors,
who shall be designated by Parent prior to the Closing and appointed to the
Parent Board of Directors (such three individuals described in (A) and (B),
together, the " _Company Designated Directors_ "), with the Company
Designated Director designated by Parent being appointed as a Class III
director, with a term ending at the 2021 annual meeting of the stockholders of
Parent, and the two Company Designated Directors designated by the Company
being appointed as Class I directors, each with a term ending at the 2022
annual meeting of the stockholders of Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Company Designated Directors designated by the Company must be reasonably
acceptable to Parent; and _provided_ , _further_ , that any current director
of the Company shall be deemed reasonably acceptable to Parent without
requiring any further approval from Parent. Except as provided in  _A_ _r_
_ti_ _c_ _le_ ___II_ , the parties shall ensure that the remuneration
(including any share or stock awards) to be paid to the Company Designated
Directors after the Effective Time shall be consistent with Parents
directors remuneration policy. The provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 1.7_
are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, the
parties, and each of the Company Designated Directors.

Section 2.1 _E_ _f_ _f_ _ec_ _t_ ___on_ ___Ca_ _pi_ _tal_ _ _ _S_ _to_ _c_
_k_.

(a) At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on
the part of Parent, the Company or any holder of any securities of Parent or
the Company:

(i)  _C_ _a_ _n_ _ce_ _ll_ _a_ _tion of_ ___C_ _er_ _t_ _a_ _in_ _S_ _to_ _c_
_k_. Each share of Company Common Stock that immediately prior to the
Effective Time is owned or held in treasury by the Company or any of its
wholly owned Subsidiaries and each share of Company Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that is owned by Parent or
any of its wholly owned Subsidiaries and, in each case, not held on behalf of
third parties, shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be
cancelled and shall cease to exist (the " _C_ _a_ _n_ _c_ _e_ _ll_ _e_ _d_ _S_
_h_ _are_ _s_ "), and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange
therefor.

 



\- 7 -

    

(ii) _C_ _onv_ _er_ _sion of_ ___Company_ _ _ _C_ _ommon_ _S_ _to_ _c_ _k_.
Subject to the other provisions of this _A_ _r_ _ti_ _c_ _le_ ___II_ , each
share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time, other than any Cancelled Shares, shall be converted
automatically into and shall thereafter represent the right to receive from
Parent 2.05 shares of validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable Parent
Common Stock (the " _Exchange Ratio_ "). The consideration to be received by
holders of Company Common Stock pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(ii)_
and the Fractional Share Cash Amount as contemplated by _Section 2.1(c)_
shall be collectively referred to herein as the " _Merger Consideration_."

(iii)  _Treatment of Company Preferred Stock_.

(A) If the Company Preferred Shareholder Approval has been obtained at
or prior to the completion of the Company Shareholders Meeting at which the
Company Common Shareholder Approval is obtained (the " _Company Preferred
Approval Event_ "), then  _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a_ _)(_ _iii)(B)_ shall apply
to the Company Preferred Stock. If there is no Company Preferred Approval
Event, the Company will effect the redemption to be effective immediately
prior to the Effective Time of each issued and outstanding share of Company
Preferred Stock for an amount in cash equal to the applicable Secondary
Company Redemption Price (the " _Preferred Redemption_ ") in accordance with
the terms and subject to the conditions of this Agreement, including
_Section_ __ _ 5.19_. In the event that the Preferred Redemption has been
completed prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall have no obligation to take
the actions in respect of the exchange of the Company Preferred Stock set
forth in _Section_ __ _ 2.2_.

(B) If the Company Preferred Approval Event occurs, then at the Effective
Time and pursuant to a certificate of designation in substantially the form
attached hereto as Exhibit B creating a series of 8.875% redeemable preferred
stock, par value $0.01 per share, of Parent, with the number, designations,
preferences, limitations, and relative rights, voting redemption and other
rights thereof (the " _Parent New Preferred Stock_ "), filed with the
Secretary of State of the State of Delaware (the " _New Certificate of
Designation_ "), each share of Company Preferred Stock issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than any Dissenting Preferred
Shares, shall be converted automatically into and shall thereafter represent
the right to receive from Parent (i) one share of validly issued, fully paid
and nonassessable Parent New Preferred Stock and (ii) any dividend or
distribution on such share of Company Preferred Stock that has been declared
but not paid as of the Effective Time (which dividend or distribution shall
be payable to the applicable holder of record in accordance with the Company
Preferred Statement of Resolutions). Any revisions and/or amendments to the
form attached hereto as Exhibit B as Parent deems necessary, advisable or
appropriate based on discussions with the holders of the Company Preferred
Stock and as to which the holders of a majority of the outstanding shares have
agreed may be submitted to the Company for its written consent (i) which
shall be granted for any such revisions and/or amendments that are not
material and (ii) which shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed for any revision and/or amendment that is material;  _provided_ ,
that no such revisions and/or amendments are subject to this sentence if
submitted in proximity to the Company Shareholders Meeting so as to result in
a reasonably expected delay to the completion of such meeting.

 



\- 8 -

    

(iv) _Treatment_ _of Company Warrants_. At the Effective Time, the right of a
holder of any Company Warrant outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time to acquire shares of Company Common Stock upon exercise of any Company
Warrants shall cease and shall, in accordance with the Company Warrant
Agreement, be converted into the right to acquire the Merger Consideration
that the Company Common Stock issuable upon exercise of such Company Warrants
immediately prior to the Effective Time would have entitled a holder of such
Company Common Stock to receive in the Merger. Parent shall include in the
Form S-4 a number of shares of Parent Common Stock necessary to fulfill
Parents obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 2.1(a)(iv)_.

 

(v) All of the shares of Company Common Stock converted into the right to
receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to this  _A_ _r_ _ti_ _c_ _le_
___II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be cancelled and
shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time, and uncertificated shares of
Company Common Stock represented by book-entry form (" _B_ _ook_ _-_ _Ent_
_r_ _y_ ___S_ _h_ _a_ _r_ _e_ _s_ ") and each certificate that, immediately
prior to the Effective Time, represented any such shares of Company Common
Stock (each, a " _C_ _er_ _ti_ _f_ _i_ _ca_ _t_ _e_ ") shall thereafter
represent only the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any cash to
be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of Parent Common Stock into which
the shares of Company Common Stock represented by such Book-Entry Share or
Certificate have been converted pursuant to this _S_ _ec_ _tion_ __ _ 2.1_,
as well as any dividends or other distributions to which holders of Company
Common Stock become entitled in accordance with _S_ _ec_ _tion_ __ _ 2.2(d)_.
If applicable, all of the shares of Company Preferred Stock converted into the
right to receive shares of Parent New Preferred Stock pursuant to this _A_
_r_ _ti_ _c_ _le_ ___II_ shall no longer be outstanding and shall
automatically be cancelled and shall cease to exist as of the Effective Time,
and such shares of Company Preferred Stock shall thereafter represent only
the right to receive the shares of Parent New Preferred Stock into which the
shares of Company Preferred Stock have been converted pursuant to this _S_
_ec_ _tion_ __ _ 2.1_, any dividend or distribution on such shares of
Company Preferred Stock that has been declared but not paid as of the
Effective Time (which dividend or distribution shall be payable to the
applicable holder of record in accordance with the Company Preferred
Statement of Resolutions) and any dividends or other distributions to which
holders of Company Preferred Stock become entitled in accordance with _S_ _ec_
_tion_ __ _ 2.2(d)_ _._

 

(vi) _Treatment of Parent Common Stock_. Each share of Parent Common Stock
issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall remain
outstanding following the Merger as a share of Parent Common Stock.

(b) _C_ _er_ _t_ _a_ _in Adjustm_ _e_ _nts_. If, between the date of this
Agreement and the Effective Time, the outstanding shares of Company Common
Stock or Parent Common Stock shall have been changed into a different number
of shares or a different class of shares by reason of any stock dividend,
subdivision, reorganization, reclassification, recapitalization, stock split,
reverse stock split, combination or exchange of shares, or any similar event
shall have occurred, then the Exchange Ratio shall be equitably adjusted,
without duplication, to proportionally reflect such change; _p_ _r_ _ovid_ _e_
_d_ _,_ that nothing in this _S_ _ec_ _tion_ __ _ 2.1(b)_ shall be construed
to permit the Company to take any action with respect to its securities that
is prohibited by the terms of this Agreement.

 acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a benefit under
any loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement, contract (including, without limitation, any
Company Oil and Gas Lease or Company Oil and Gas Contract), instrument,
permit, concession, franchise, right or license binding upon the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries or by which or to which any of their respective
properties, rights or assets are bound or subject, or result in the creation
of any liens, claims, mortgages, encumbrances, pledges, security interests,

Agreement, including _Section_ __ _ 5.19_.

Section 3.4 _Reports and Financial Statements_.

 

(a) The Company and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _SEC_ ")
since January 1, 2018 (all such documents and reports filed or furnished by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Company SEC Documents_ "). As
of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the date of the last such
amendment, the Company SEC Documents complied, as to form, in all material
respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act
and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder (the " _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ "), as the case may be, and none of the
Company SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they
were made, not misleading, except that information set forth in the Company
SEC Documents as of a later date (but before the date of this Agreement) will
be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules thereto) of the Company included in the Company SEC Documents (the "
_Company Financial Statements_ ") (i) fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods
then ended, (ii) were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted
accounting principles (" _GAAP_ ") (except, in the case of the unaudited
statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence
of footnote disclosure) applied on a consistent basis during the periods
involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto), (iii)
have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and records of
the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries and (iv) comply in all material
respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the rules and
regulations of the SEC, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act.

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in any comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by the
Company relating to the Company SEC Documents. The Company has heretofore made
available to Parent, through EDGAR or otherwise, true, correct and complete
copies of all material written correspondence between the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries and the SEC occurring since January 1, 2018. As of the date
of this Agreement, none of the Company SEC Documents is, to the knowledge of
the Company, the subject of ongoing SEC review.

(d) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it
have any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance
sheet partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to
any transaction or relationship between or among the Company or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
in the Company Financial Statements or the Company SEC Documents.

Section 3.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. The Company has established
and maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by Rule
13a-15 under the Exchange Act. The Companys disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports that it files or
furnishes under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and
reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the
SEC, and that all such material information is accumulated and communicated
to the Companys management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. The Companys management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

Section 3.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued,
absolute, determined or contingent, that would be required by GAAP to be
reflected on a consolidated balance sheet of the Company and its consolidated
Subsidiaries (including the notes thereto), except for (i) liabilities or
obligations disclosed and provided for in the balance sheets included in the
Company Financial Statements (or in the notes thereto) filed and publicly
available prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) liabilities or obligations
incurred in accordance with or in connection with this Agreement, (iii)
liabilities or obligations incurred since December 31, 2018 in the ordinary
course of business, (iv) liabilities or obligations that have been discharged
or paid in full and (v) liabilities or obligations that have not had and would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate,

as they are now being conducted (collectively, the " _Company Permits_ "),
except where the failure to have or to have filed such Company Permits would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. All Company Permits are valid and in full
force and effect and are not subject to any administrative or
judicial proceeding that could result in modification, termination or
revocation thereof, except where the failure to be in full force and effect or
any modification, termination or revocation thereof would not reasonably be
expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect. The Company and each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with
the terms and requirements of all material Company Permits, except where the

Benefit Plans or the assets of any of the trusts under any of the Company
Benefit Plans.

(g) Except as set forth in _Section_ __ _ 3.9(g)_ of the Company Disclosure
Schedule, the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
will not, either alone or in combination with another event, (i) entitle any
current or former employee, director, consultant or officer of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries to severance pay, unemployment compensation or
accrued pension benefit or any other payment, (ii) accelerate the time of
payment or vesting, or increase the amount, or result in the forfeiture of any

individual" (as such term is defined in Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1)
that could, individually or in combination with any other such payment,
constitute an "excess parachute payment" (as defined in Section 280G(b)(1) of

insurance benefits, other than as required under Part 6 of Subtitle B of Title
I of ERISA, Section 4980B of the Code or any similar state Law for which
the covered person pays the full cost of coverage. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect, none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred or could reasonably be expected to incur any penalty or Tax under

 _REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PARENT_

 

Except as disclosed (a) in the Parent SEC Documents filed with or furnished to
the SEC and available on EDGAR on or after December 31, 2018 (including all
exhibits and schedules thereto that have been publicly filed with or furnished
to the SEC by Parent, regardless of whether such exhibits or schedules were
originally filed or furnished on or before December 31, 2018) and prior to
the date hereof (excluding any forward-looking disclosures set forth in any
such Parent SEC Document in any risk factor section, any disclosure in any
section relating to forward-looking statements or any other statements that
are non-specific, predictive or primarily cautionary in nature other than
historical facts included therein), where the relevance of the information as
an exception to (or disclosure for purposes of) a particular representation
is reasonably apparent on the face of such disclosure, or (b) in the
disclosure schedule delivered by Parent to the Company immediately prior to
the execution of this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Schedule_ ") (each
section of which qualifies the correspondingly numbered representation,
warranty or covenant if specified therein and such other representations,
warranties or covenants where its relevance as an exception to (or disclosure
for purposes of) such other representation, warranty or covenant is reasonably
apparent) notwithstanding the presence or absence of an appropriate section of
the Parent Disclosure Schedule with respect to such other representations
or warranties or an appropriate cross reference thereto, Parent represents
and warrants to the Company as follows:

Section 4.1  _Qualification, Organization, Subsidiaries_.

Parent and its Subsidiaries is duly qualified or licensed, and has
all necessary governmental approvals, to do business and is in good standing
in each jurisdiction in which the property owned, leased or operated by it or
the nature of the business conducted by it makes such approvals, qualification

qualified or licensed and in good standing would not reasonably be expected to
have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

 

(b) Parent has made available prior to the date of this Agreement a true and
complete copy of Parents certificate of incorporation and bylaws, in each
case, as amended through the date hereof (collectively, the " _Parent

(ii) granting any preemptive or antidilutive or similar rights with respect
to any security issued by Parent or its Subsidiaries. No Subsidiary of Parent
owns any shares of capital stock of Parent.

 

(b) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has outstanding bonds,
debentures, notes or other indebtedness, the holders of which have the right
to vote (or which are convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
securities having the right to vote) with the stockholders of Parent on any
matter.

stock or other equity interests are duly authorized, validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free of preemptive rights. Except for equity

deliver this Agreement, and, subject to receipt of (i) the approval of the
Parent Share Issuance by a vote of the holders of the majority of the Parent
Common Stock having voting power present in person or represented by proxy at
the Parent Stockholders Meeting, (ii) the approval of the Parent Charter
Amendment by a vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote thereon and (iii) the adoption
of this Agreement and the Merger by the vote of the holders of a majority of
the issued and outstanding shares of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote

execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Support Agreements and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby have been
duly and validly authorized by the Parent Board of Directors and, except for
the Parent Stockholder Approval and the approval of this Agreement by Parent,
no other corporate action on the part of Parent or vote of Parents
stockholders are necessary to authorize the execution and delivery by Parent
of this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby. The Parent Board of Directors has unanimously (i) declared advisable
and approved this Agreement and the Support Agreements and the transactions
contemplated hereby and thereby, including the Merger, the Parent Share
Issuance, the issuance of the Parent New Preferred Stock and the Parent
Charter Amendment, (ii) resolved to recommend that Parents stockholders
approve and adopt this Agreement and the transactions 

 



\- 40 -

    

 contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger, the Parent Share
Issuance and the Parent Charter Amendment (the recommendation referred to in
this clause (ii), the " _Parent Recommendation_ "), and (iii) directed that
the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger, the Parent Share
Issuance and the Parent Charter Amendment be submitted for adoption and
approval by the holders of Parent Common Stock. The vote of the holders of

or represented by proxy at the Parent Stockholders Meeting is the only vote
or consent of Parents stockholders necessary to approve the Parent Share
Issuance. The vote of the holders of a majority of the issued and outstanding
shares of Parent Common Stock entitled to vote thereon is the only vote or
consent of Parents stockholders necessary to approve and adopt this
Agreement, the Merger and the Parent Charter Amendment. No vote of
stockholders is required for the issuance of the Parent New Preferred Stock.
This Agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered by Parent,
and, assuming this Agreement constitutes the legal, valid and binding
agreement of the Company, constitutes the legal, valid and binding agreement
of Parent, and is enforceable against Parent in accordance with its terms,
except as such enforcement may be subject to the Remedies Exceptions.

Certificates of Merger with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware

the representations and warranties of the Company in _Section_ __ _ 3.3(b)_,
no authorization, consent, clearance, order, license, permit or approval of,
or registration, declaration, notice or filing with, any Governmental Entity
is necessary, under applicable Law, for the consummation by Parent of the
Parent Share Issuance, except for such authorizations, consents, clearances,
orders, licenses, permits, approvals, registrations, declarations, notices or
filings that are not required to be obtained or made prior to consummation of
such transactions or that, if not obtained or made, would not materially
impede or delay the consummation of the Merger and the Parent Share Issuance
or reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

(c) The execution and delivery by Parent of this Agreement do not, and
(assuming the Parent Approvals and the Parent Stockholder Approval are
obtained) the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and
compliance with the provisions hereof will not (i) result in any loss, or
suspension, limitation or impairment of any right of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries to own or use any assets required for the conduct of their
business or result in any violation of, or default (with or without notice or
lapse of time, or both) under, or give rise to a right of
termination, cancellation, first offer, first refusal, modification or
acceleration of any material obligation or to the loss of a benefit under any
loan, guarantee of indebtedness or credit agreement, note, bond, mortgage,
indenture, lease, agreement, contract (including, without limitation, any
Parent Oil and Gas Lease or Parent Oil and Gas Contract), instrument, permit,
concession, franchise, right or license binding upon Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries or by which or to which any of their respective properties,

assets of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, (ii) conflict with or result in
any violation of any

 



\- 41 -

    

 provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other equivalent
organizational document, in each case as amended or restated, of Parent or any
of its Subsidiaries or (iii) conflict with or violate any applicable Laws,
except in the case of clauses (i) and (iii), for such losses, suspensions,
limitations, impairments, conflicts, violations, defaults, terminations,
cancellations, accelerations or Liens as would not reasonably be expected to

Section 4.4  _Reports and Financial Statements_.

(a) Parent and each of its Subsidiaries has filed or furnished all forms,
documents and reports required to be filed or furnished prior to the date
hereof by it with the SEC since January 1, 2018 (all such documents and
reports filed or furnished by Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, the " _Parent
SEC Documents_ "). As of their respective dates or, if amended, as of the
date of the last such amendment, the Parent SEC Documents complied, as to
form, in all material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act,
the Exchange Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, and none of
the Parent SEC Documents contained any untrue statement of a material fact or
omitted to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading, except that information set forth in the
Parent SEC Documents as of a later date (but before the date of this
Agreement) will be deemed to modify information as of an earlier date.

 

(b) The consolidated financial statements (including all related notes and
schedules thereto) of Parent included in the Parent SEC Documents (the "
_Parent Financial Statements_ ") (i) fairly present in all material respects
the consolidated financial position of Parent and its consolidated
Subsidiaries, at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of
their operations and their consolidated cash flows for the respective periods
then ended, (ii) were prepared in conformity with GAAP (except, in the case of
the unaudited statements, subject to normal year-end audit adjustments and
the absence of footnote disclosure) applied on a consistent basis during the
periods involved (except as may be indicated therein or in the notes thereto),
(iii) have been prepared from, and are in accordance with, the books and
records of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries and (iv) comply in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and with the
rules and regulations of the SEC, the Exchange Act and the Securities Act.

 

(c) As of the date of this Agreement, there are no outstanding or unresolved
comments in any comment letters of the staff of the SEC received by Parent
relating to the Parent SEC Documents. Parent has heretofore made available to
the Company, through EDGAR or otherwise, true, correct and complete copies of
all material written correspondence between Parent or any of its Subsidiaries
and the SEC occurring since January 1, 2018. As of the date of this
Agreement, none of the Parent SEC Documents is, to the knowledge of Parent,
the subject of ongoing SEC review.

 

(d) Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, nor does it have
any commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract relating to any
transaction or relationship between or among Parent or one of its
Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated affiliate, including
any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or person,
on the other hand) or any

 



\- 42 -

    

 "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined in Item 303(a) of Regulation
S-K of the SEC), where the result, purpose or effect of such Contract is to
avoid disclosure of any material transaction involving, or material
liabilities of, Parent or any of its Subsidiaries in the Parent Financial
Statements or the Parent SEC Documents.

 

Section 4.5 _Internal Controls and Procedures_. Parent has established and
maintains disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over
financial reporting (as such terms are defined in paragraphs (e) and (f),
respectively, of Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act) as required by
Rule 13a-15 under the Exchange Act. Parents disclosure controls and
procedures are reasonably designed to ensure that all material information
required to be disclosed by Parent in the reports that it files or furnishes
under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within
the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that all
such material information is accumulated and communicated to
Parents management as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding
required disclosure and to make the certifications required pursuant to
Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Parents management has
completed an assessment of the effectiveness of Parents internal control
over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of Section 404 of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act for the year ended December 31, 2018, and such
assessment concluded that such controls were effective.

Section 4.6 _No Undisclosed Liabilities_. There are no liabilities or
obligations of Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, whether accrued, absolute,
determined or contingent, that would be required by GAAP to be reflected on a
consolidated balance sheet of Parent and its consolidated Subsidiaries

disclosed and provided for in the balance sheets included in the Parent
Financial Statements (or in the notes thereto) filed and publicly available
prior to the date of this Agreement, (ii) liabilities or obligations incurred
in accordance with or in connection with this Agreement, (iii) liabilities or
obligations incurred since December 31, 2018 in the ordinary course of
business, (iv) liabilities or obligations that have been discharged or paid
in full and (v) liabilities or obligations that have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect.

 

Section 4.7 _Compliance with Law; Permits_.

 

(a) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in compliance with, and are not in default
under or in violation of, any Laws, except where such non-compliance, default
or violation would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. Since January 1, 2018, neither
Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries has received any written notice or, to
Parents knowledge, other communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
any actual or possible violation of, or failure to comply with, any Law,
except as would not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the
aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(b) Parent and its Subsidiaries are in possession of all Permits, and all
rights under any Parent Material Contract with all Governmental Entities, and
have filed all tariffs, reports, notices and other documents with all
Governmental Entities necessary for Parent and its Subsidiaries to own,
lease and operate their properties and assets and to carry on their
businesses as they are now being conducted (collectively, the " _Parent
Permits_ "), except where the failure to have or to have filed such Parent
Permits would not reasonably be expected to have, individually

 



\- 43 -

    

 or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect. All Parent Permits
are valid and in full force and effect and are not subject to any
administrative or judicial proceeding that could result in modification,
termination or revocation thereof, except where the failure to be in full
force and effect or any modification, termination or revocation thereof would
not reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Parent Material Adverse Effect. Parent and each of its Subsidiaries is in
compliance with the terms and requirements of all material Parent Permits,
except where the failure to be in compliance would not reasonably be expected
to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(c) Each of Parent and its Subsidiaries is and, to the knowledge of Parent,
each third-party operator of any of the Parent Oil and Gas Interests (with
respect to such interests) is, and since January 1, 2018 has been, in

expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse
Effect, since January 1, 2018, (i) none of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent
nor, to the knowledge of Parent, any director, officer, employee, auditor,
accountant or representative of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, has

methods of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent or any concerns from employees
of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent regarding questionable accounting or
auditing matters with respect to Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, and (ii)
no attorney representing Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, whether or not
employed by Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent, has reported in writing
evidence of a violation of securities Laws, breach of fiduciary duty or

respective officers, directors, employees or agents to the Parent Board of
Directors or any committee thereof, or to the General Counsel or Chief
Executive Officer of Parent.

Section 4.8 _Environmental Laws and Regulations_. Except as would not
reasonably be expected to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Parent
Material Adverse Effect: (i) there are no investigations, actions, suits or
proceedings (whether administrative or judicial) pending, or to the knowledge
of Parent, threatened against Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any person
or entity whose liability Parent or any of its Subsidiaries has retained or
assumed either contractually or by operation of law, alleging non-
compliance with or other liability arising under any Environmental Law and,
to the knowledge of Parent, there are no existing facts or circumstances that
would reasonably be expected to give rise to any such action, suit or
proceeding or liability, (ii) Parent and its Subsidiaries and, to the
knowledge of Parent, each third-party operator of any of the Parent Oil and

give rise to any

 



\- 44 -

    

 fine, penalty, remediation, investigation, obligation or liability of any
kind to Parent or its Subsidiaries, (iv) none of Parent and its Subsidiaries
and, to the knowledge of Parent, any third-party operator of any of the
Parent Oil and Gas Interests and any predecessor of any of them, is subject to
any Order or any indemnity obligation (other than asset retirement

Parent set forth in the Parent Reserve Reports that have been provided to the
Company prior to the date of this Agreement) or other Contract with any other
person that could reasonably be expected to result in obligations or
liabilities under applicable Environmental Laws or otherwise relating to or
arising from Hazardous Materials or Releases thereof, (v) none of Parent and

 amendments to any material Parent Benefit Plans that have been adopted or

material amendments or to adopt or approve any new material Parent Benefit
Plans. No Parent Benefit Plan is maintained outside the jurisdiction of the
United States, or provides benefits or compensation to any employees or other
service providers who reside or provide services outside of the United

All contracts of the types referred to in clauses (i) through (xi) hereof are
referred to herein as " _Parent Material Contracts_." As used in this

aggregate, a Parent Material Adverse Effect, (i) neither Parent nor any
Subsidiary of Parent is in breach of or default under the terms of any Parent
Material Contract and, (ii) to the knowledge of Parent, no other party to any
Parent Material Contract is in breach of or default under the terms of any
Parent Material Contract. Each Parent Material Contract is a valid and binding
obligation of Parent or the Subsidiary of Parent that is party thereto and, to
the knowledge of Parent, of each other party thereto, and is in full force
and effect, subject to the limitation of such enforcement by the Remedies
Exceptions.

Section 4.21 _Reserve Reports_. Parent has delivered or otherwise made

prepared by any Report Preparer concerning the Parent Oil and Gas Interests as

matters that, individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not
reasonably be expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the factual,

Reports), accurate in all respects. Except for any such matters that,
individually or in the aggregate, have not had and would not reasonably be
expected to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect, the oil and gas reserve
estimates of Parent set forth in the Parent Reserve Reports are derived from
reports that have been prepared by the Report Preparer as set forth
therein, and such reserve estimates fairly reflect, in all respects, the oil
and gas reserves of Parent at the dates indicated therein and are in
accordance with the rules promulgated by the SEC and applied on a consistent
basis throughout the periods reflected therein. Except for changes generally
affecting the oil and gas exploration, development and production industry

attributable to the production and marketing of Parent and its Subsidiaries,

agreed to take any action, and are not aware of any fact or circumstance,

Section 5.3 _Access_.

 

(a) For purposes of furthering the transactions contemplated hereby, each
party shall afford the other party and (i) the officers and employees and
(ii) the accountants, consultants, legal counsel, financial advisors,
financing sources (including the employees, consultants and Representatives
thereof) and agents and other representatives of such other party reasonable
access 

 



\- 70 -

    

 during normal business hours and with reasonable notice, throughout the
period prior to the earlier of the Effective Time and the Termination Date, to
its and its Subsidiaries personnel and properties, contracts, commitments,
books and records and any report, schedule or other document filed or received
by it pursuant to the requirements of applicable Laws and with such additional
accounting, financing, operating, environmental and other data and
information regarding such party as the other party may reasonably request.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither party shall be required to afford such
access if it would unreasonably disrupt the operations of such party or any
of its Subsidiaries, would cause a violation of any agreement to which such
party or any of its Subsidiaries is a party, would cause a risk of a loss of
privilege to such party or any of its Subsidiaries or would constitute a
violation of any applicable Law. No party shall have access to personnel
records of the other party or any of its Subsidiaries relating to individual
performance or evaluation records, medical histories or other information, the
disclosure of which, in the other partys good faith opinion, could subject
the other party or any of its Subsidiaries to risk of liability. Neither party
nor any of its officers, employees or representatives, shall be permitted to
perform any invasive testing, sampling or analysis with respect to any
property of such other party or any of such other partys Subsidiaries without
such partys prior written consent (which may be withheld in its sole
discretion).

 

(b) The parties hereto hereby agree that all information provided to them or
their respective officers, directors, employees or Representatives in
connection with this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby shall be governed in accordance with the confidentiality
agreement, dated as of January 29, 2019, between the Company and Parent
(the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ").

Section 5.4 _Company No Solicitation_.

 

(a) Except as permitted by this _ Section 5.4_, the Company shall, shall
cause each of its affiliates and its and their respective officers and
directors to, and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the employees,
agents, financial advisors, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and
other representatives (collectively " _Representatives_ ") of the Company or
any of its affiliates to:

(i) immediately cease any ongoing solicitation, knowing encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect
to a Company Takeover Proposal, and promptly instruct (to the extent it has
contractual authority to do so and has not already done so prior to the date
of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any person that has entered into a
confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement that has not been terminated or
expired and was executed within the 12-month period prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with any actual or potential Company Takeover Proposal
to return or destroy all such information or documents or material
incorporating confidential information in the possession of such person or
its Representatives;

(ii) until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _ Article VII_, not, directly or indirectly:

 



\- 71 -

    

(A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly
encourage (including by way of furnishing non-public information) any
inquiries regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes,
or would reasonably be expected to lead to, a Company Takeover Proposal,

(B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any non-public
information regarding the Company in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, a Company Takeover Proposal, or

 

(C) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or
enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment,
or agreement in principle (whether written or oral) with respect to a Company
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with _ Section 5.4(b)_); and

 

(iii) Except to the extent necessary to take any actions that the Company or
any third party would otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this _
Section 5.4_ __ or except to the extent that the Company Board of Directors
concludes, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure
to take such action would reasonably be expected to be inconsistent with the
fiduciary duties of the Company Board of Directors under applicable Law, (A)
the Company and its Subsidiaries shall not release any third party from, or
waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission under, any
standstill provision in any agreement to which the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party and (B) the Company shall, and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to, enforce the standstill provisions of any such agreement.

 

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _ Section 5.4(a)_,
if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Company Common Shareholder Approval, the Company, directly or
indirectly, receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Company Takeover
Proposal from any person that did not result from the Companys,
its affiliates or the Companys or its affiliates Representatives material
breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ and if the Company Board of Directors
determines in good faith, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that such Company Takeover Proposal
constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead to a Company Superior
Proposal, then the Company may, directly or indirectly:

 

(i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement,
information (including non-public information) with respect to the Company
and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties, assets,
employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of the Company and
its Subsidiaries, to the person who has made such Company Takeover Proposal
and its Representatives and potential sources of financing; _ provided_, that
the Company shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person
provide to Parent any non-public information concerning the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided or made available to Parent; and

 



\- 72 -

    

(ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations
with the person making such Company Takeover Proposal and its Representatives
and potential sources of financing regarding such Company Takeover Proposal,
and solicit (it being understood that no solicitation under this clause (ii)
shall result in any proposal or offer being deemed to be "unsolicited"),
initiate, facilitate, or encourage inquiries or the making of proposals or
offers from such person. " _Acceptable Company Confidentiality Agreement_ "
means any customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that
are no less favorable to the Company than those applicable to Parent that are
contained in the Confidentiality Agreement (including standstill
restrictions), provided that such confidentiality agreement shall not
prohibit compliance by the Company with any of the provisions of this
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.4 _shall prohibit the
Company or the Company Board of Directors, directly or indirectly through any
officer, employee or Representative, from (1) informing any person that the
Company is party to this Agreement and informing such person of the
restrictions that are set forth in this  _Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or (2)
disclosing factual information regarding the business, financial condition or
results of operations of the Company or its Subsidiaries or the fact that a
Company Takeover Proposal has been made, the identity of the party making
such proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or otherwise; _provided_ that, in the case of this clause
(2), the Company shall in good faith determine that such information, facts,
identity or terms are required to be disclosed under applicable Law or that
failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(c) The Company shall promptly (and in any event within one business day after
receipt) notify, orally and in writing, Parent after receipt by the Company
or any of its Representatives of any Company Takeover Proposal, including the
identity of the person making the Company Takeover Proposal and the material
terms and conditions thereof, and shall promptly (and in any event within
one business day after receipt) provide copies to Parent of any written
proposals, indications of interest and draft agreements relating to such
Company Takeover Proposal. The Company shall keep Parent reasonably informed,
on a prompt basis, as to the status of (including changes to any material
terms of, and any other material developments with respect to) such Company
Takeover Proposal (including by promptly (and in any event within one business
day after receipt) providing to Parent copies of any additional or revised
written proposals, indications of interest and draft agreements relating to
such Company Takeover Proposal).

 

(d) Except as permitted by this _ Section 5.4(d)_ or by _Section_ __ _
5.4(e)_, the Company Board of Directors shall not (i) fail to include the
Company Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (ii) change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to
change, qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to Parent,
the Company Recommendation, (iii) make any recommendation or public statement
that addresses or relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of
advisability by the Company Board of Directors in connection with a tender
offer or exchange offer that constitutes a Company Takeover Proposal (other
than a recommendation against such offer or a customary "stop, look and
listen" communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act, in each case that includes a reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation or refers to the prior Company Recommendation of the Company
Board of Directors) (it being understood that the

 



\- 73 -

    

 Company Board of Directors may refrain from taking a position with respect
to such a tender offer or exchange offer until the close of business as of the
tenth business day after the commencement of such tender offer or exchange
offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act without such action (or
refraining from taking such action) being considered a Company Adverse
Recommendation Change) or (iv) adopt, approve or recommend, or publicly
propose to adopt, approve or recommend to shareholders of the Company a
Company Takeover Proposal (any action described in this first paragraph of
this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_ being referred to as a " _Company Adverse
Recommendation Change_ ").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement with
respect to a Company Takeover Proposal, at any time, prior to obtaining the
Company Common Shareholder Approval, the Company Board of Directors may make a
Company Adverse Recommendation Change or terminate this Agreement pursuant
to  _Section_ __ _ 7.1(i)_ if, after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited
Company Takeover Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this _
Section_ __ _ 5.4_, the Company Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that (i) such Company Takeover Proposal constitutes a Company
Superior Proposal and (ii) in light of such Company Takeover Proposal, the
failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _
provided_, _ however_, that, prior to making such Company Adverse
Recommendation Change or terminating this Agreement pursuant to _Section_ __ _
7.1(i)_, (A) the Company has given Parent at least four business days prior
written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice shall
specify the material terms and conditions of any such Company Superior
Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided to Parent a copy of the Company
Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed transaction agreements with the
person making such Company Superior Proposal and a copy of any financing
commitments relating thereto (or, if not provided in writing to the Company, a
written summary of the material terms thereof), (B) the Company has
negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith
with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes to
negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would cause such Company Superior Proposal to no
longer constitute a Company Superior Proposal, (C) the Company Board of
Directors shall have considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of
this Agreement proposed in writing by Parent, and shall have determined,
after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside legal
counsel, that the Company Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to
constitute a Company Superior Proposal if the revisions proposed by Parent
were to be given effect, and (D) in the event of any change to any of the
financial terms (including the form, amount and timing of payment of
consideration) or any other material terms of such Company Superior Proposal,
the Company shall, in each case, have delivered to Parent an additional
notice consistent with that described in clause (A) above of this proviso and
a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall commence (except
that the four business day notice period referred to in clause (A) above of
this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (1) two business days and
(2) the period remaining under the notice period under clause (A) of this
proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such additional notice under
this clause (D)) during which time the Company shall be required to comply
with the requirements of this _ Section 5.4(d)_ anew with respect to such
additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of this proviso.

 



\- 74 -

    

(e) Other than in connection with a Company Takeover Proposal that has been
determined by the Company Board of Directors to be a Company Superior
Proposal (which shall be subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4(d)_ and shall not be
subject to this _Section_ __ _ 5.4(e)_), nothing in this Agreement shall
prohibit or restrict the Company Board of Directors from making a Company
Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a Company Intervening Event if
the Company Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after
consultation with its outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Company
Board of Directors to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change would
reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors
fiduciary duties under applicable Law;  _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior
to making such Company Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) the Company has
given Parent at least four business days prior written notice of its intention
to take such action, which notice shall specify the reasons therefor, (B) the
Company has negotiated, and has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in
good faith with Parent during such notice period, to the extent Parent wishes
to negotiate, to enable Parent to propose revisions to the terms of this
Agreement such that it would permit the Company Board of Directors not to make
a Company Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _
5.4(e)_, and (C) the Company Board of Directors shall have considered in good
faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by
Parent, and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside
financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the
Company Board of Directors to effect a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
in response to a Company Intervening Event would reasonably be likely to be
inconsistent with the Company Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _ Section 5.4_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit the Company or the Company Board of Directors from taking and
disclosing to the shareholders of the Company a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen" communication or any
other disclosure to the shareholders of the Company pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or making a disclosure that is required by applicable
Law; provided, that any such position or disclosure (other than any "stop,
look and listen" communication that includes a reaffirmation of the Company
Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Company Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Company Board of Directors in connection with such communication
publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has
not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Company Board of
Directors.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.4_, prior to the receipt of the Company Common Shareholder Approval, the
Company shall be permitted, through its Representatives or otherwise, to seek
clarification from (but not, unless otherwise allowed pursuant to this
Agreement, to engage in any negotiations with or provide any non-public
information to) any person that has made a Company Takeover Proposal solely to
clarify and understand the terms and conditions of such proposal to provide
adequate information for the Company Board of Directors to make an informed
determination under _Section_ __ _ 5.4(b)_.

Section 5.5 _Parent No Solicitation_.

(a) Except as permitted by this _ Section 5.5_, Parent shall, shall cause
each of its affiliates and its and their respective officers and directors to,
and shall use reasonable best efforts to cause the Representatives of Parent
or any of its affiliates to:

 

(i) immediately cease any ongoing solicitation, knowing encouragement,
discussions or negotiations with any persons that may be ongoing with respect
to a Parent Takeover Proposal and promptly instruct (to the extent it has
contractual authority to do so and has not already done so prior to the date
of this Agreement) or otherwise request, any person that has entered into
a confidentiality or non-disclosure agreement that has not been terminated or
expired and was executed within the 12-month period prior to the date of this
Agreement in connection with any actual or potential Parent Takeover Proposal
to return or destroy all such information or documents or material
incorporating confidential information in the possession of such person or its
Representatives;

 

(ii) until the Effective Time or, if earlier, the termination of this
Agreement in accordance with _ Article VII_, not, directly or indirectly:

(A) solicit, initiate or knowingly facilitate or knowingly encourage
(including by way of furnishing non-public information) any inquiries
regarding, or the making of any proposal or offer that constitutes, or would
reasonably be expected to lead to, a Parent Takeover Proposal,

 

(B) engage in, continue or otherwise participate in any discussions or
negotiations regarding, or furnish to any other person any non-public
information regarding Parent in connection with or for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, a Parent Takeover Proposal, or

 

(C) approve, recommend or enter into, or propose to approve, recommend or
enter into, any letter of intent or similar document, agreement, commitment,
or agreement in principle (whether written or oral) with respect to a Parent
Takeover Proposal (other than an Acceptable Parent Confidentiality Agreement
entered into in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.5(b)_); and

(iii) Except to the extent necessary to take any actions that Parent or
any third party would otherwise be permitted to take pursuant to this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_ or except to the extent that the Parent Board of
Directors concludes, after consultation with its outside legal counsel, that
the failure to take such action would reasonably be expected to be
inconsistent with the fiduciary duties of the Parent Board of Directors under
applicable Law, (A) Parent and its Subsidiaries shall not release any third
party from, or waive, amend or modify any provision of, or grant permission
under, any standstill provision in any agreement to which Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party, or under the Support Agreements and, if applicable,
the Voting Agreement and (B) Parent shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries
to, enforce the standstill provisions of any such agreement.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.5(a)_, if at any time from and after the date of this Agreement and prior to
obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent, directly or indirectly,
receives a bona fide, unsolicited written Parent Takeover Proposal from any
person that did not result from Parents, its affiliates or Parents or its
affiliates Representatives material breach of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ and
if the Parent Board of Directors determines in good faith, after consultation
with its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that such
Parent Takeover Proposal constitutes or could reasonably be expected to lead
to a Parent Superior Proposal, then Parent may, directly or indirectly:

 



\- 76 -

    

(i) furnish, pursuant to an Acceptable Parent Confidentiality
Agreement, information (including non-public information) with respect to
Parent and its Subsidiaries, and afford access to the business, properties,
assets, employees, officers, Contracts, books and records of Parent and its
Subsidiaries, to the person who has made such Parent Takeover Proposal and its
Representatives and potential sources of financing; _provided_ , that Parent
shall substantially concurrently with the delivery to such person provide to
the Company any non-public information concerning Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries that is provided or made available to such person or its
Representatives unless such non-public information has been previously
provided or made available to the Company; and

 

(ii) engage in or otherwise participate in discussions or negotiations with
the person making such Parent Takeover Proposal and its Representatives and
potential sources of financing regarding such Parent Takeover Proposal, and
solicit (it being understood that no solicitation under this clause (ii) shall
result in any proposal or offer being deemed to be "unsolicited"), initiate,
facilitate, or encourage inquiries or the making of proposals or offers from
such person. " _Acceptable Parent Confidentiality Agreement_ " means any
customary confidentiality agreement that contains provisions that are no less
favorable to Parent than those applicable to the Company that are contained in
the Confidentiality Agreement (including standstill restrictions), provided
that such confidentiality agreement shall not prohibit compliance by Parent
with any of the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5_. Nothing in this
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_ shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board of Directors,
directly or indirectly through any officer, employee or Representative, from
(1) informing any person that Parent is party to this Agreement and informing
such person of the restrictions that are set forth in this _Section_ __ _
5.5_ or (2) disclosing factual information regarding the business, financial
condition or results of operations of Parent or its Subsidiaries or the fact
that a Parent Takeover Proposal has been made, the identity of the party
making such proposal or the material terms of such proposal in the Proxy
Statement/Prospectus or otherwise; _provided_ that, in the case of this clause
(2), Parent shall in good faith determine that such information, facts,
identity or terms are required to be disclosed under applicable Law or that
failure to make such disclosure is reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

(c) Parent shall promptly (and in any event within one business day after
receipt) notify, orally and in writing, the Company after receipt by Parent or
any of its Representatives of any Parent Takeover Proposal, including the
identity of the person making the Parent Takeover Proposal and the material
terms and conditions thereof, and shall promptly (and in any event within one
business day after receipt) provide copies to the Company of any written
proposals, indications of interest and draft agreements relating to such
Parent Takeover Proposal. Parent shall keep the Company reasonably informed,
on a prompt basis, as to the status of (including changes to any material
terms of, and any other material developments with respect to) such
Parent Takeover Proposal (including by promptly (and in any event within one
business day after receipt) providing to the Company copies of any additional
or revised written proposals, indications of interest and draft agreements
relating to such Parent Takeover Proposal).

 



\- 77 -

    

(d) Except as permitted by this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ or by  _Section_ __ _
5.5(e)_, the Parent Board of Directors shall not (i) fail to include the
Parent Recommendation in the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, (ii) change, qualify,
withhold, withdraw or modify, or authorize or publicly propose to change,
qualify, withhold, withdraw or modify, in a manner adverse to the Company, the
Parent Recommendation, the Support Agreements and, if applicable, the Voting
Agreement (iii) make any recommendation or public statement that addresses or
relates to the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the
Parent Board of Directors in connection with a tender offer or exchange offer
that constitutes a Parent Takeover Proposal (other than a recommendation
against such offer or a customary "stop, look and listen" communication of
the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act, in each case
that includes a reaffirmation of the Parent Recommendation or refers to the
prior Parent Recommendation of the Parent Board of Directors) (it being
understood that the Parent Board of Directors may refrain from taking a
position with respect to such a tender offer or exchange offer until
the close of business as of the tenth business day after the commencement of
such tender offer or exchange offer pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the
Exchange Act without such action (or refraining from taking such action)
being considered a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change) or (iv) adopt,
approve or recommend, or publicly propose to adopt, approve or recommend to
stockholders of Parent a Parent Takeover Proposal (any action described in
this first paragraph of this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ being referred to as a "
_Parent_ _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").

 

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement with
respect to a Parent Takeover Proposal, at any time, prior to obtaining the
Parent Stockholder Approval, the Parent Board of Directors may make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change if, after receiving a bona fide, unsolicited
Parent Takeover Proposal that did not result from a material breach of this 
_Section_ __ _ 5.5_, the Parent Board of Directors has determined in good
faith, after consultation with its outside financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, that (i) such Parent Takeover Proposal constitutes a
Parent Superior Proposal and (ii) in light of such Parent Takeover Proposal,
the failure to take such action would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent
with the Parent Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law; _
provided_, _ however_, that, prior to making such Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change, (A) Parent has given the Company at least four business
days prior written notice of its intention to take such action (which notice
shall specify the material terms and conditions of any such Parent Superior
Proposal) and has contemporaneously provided to the Company a copy of the
Parent Superior Proposal, a copy of any proposed transaction agreements with
the person making such Parent Superior Proposal and a copy of any financing
commitments relating thereto (or, if not provided in writing to Parent, a
written summary of the material terms thereof), (B) Parent has negotiated, and
has caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the Company
during such notice period, to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to
enable the Company to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such
that it would cause such Parent Superior Proposal to no longer constitute a
Parent Superior Proposal, (C) the Parent Board of Directors shall have
considered in good faith any revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed
in writing by the Company, and shall have determined, after consultation with
its outside financial advisors and outside legal counsel, that the Parent
Superior Proposal would nevertheless continue to constitute a Parent Superior
Proposal if the revisions proposed by the Company were to be given effect,
and (D) in the event of any change to any of the financial terms (including
the form, amount and timing of payment of consideration) or any other material
terms of such Parent Superior Proposal, Parent shall, in each case,
have delivered to the Company an additional notice consistent with that
described in clause (A) above of this

 



\- 78 -

    

 proviso and a new notice period under clause (A) of this proviso shall
commence (except that the four business day notice period referred to in
clause (A) above of this proviso shall instead be equal to the longer of (1)
two business days and (2) the period remaining under the notice period under
clause (A) of this proviso immediately prior to the delivery of such
additional notice under this clause (D)) during which time Parent shall be
required to comply with the requirements of this _ Section 5.5(d)_ anew with
respect to such additional notice, including clauses (A) through (D) above of
this proviso.

 

(e) Other than in connection with a Parent Takeover Proposal that has been
determined by the Parent Board of Directors to be a Parent Superior Proposal
(which shall be subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5(d)_ and shall not be subject to
this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(e)_), nothing in this Agreement shall prohibit or
restrict the Parent Board of Directors from making a Parent Adverse
Recommendation Change in response to a Parent Intervening Event if the Parent
Board of Directors has determined in good faith, after consultation with its
outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Parent Board of Directors
to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change would reasonably be likely
to be inconsistent with the Parent Board of Directors fiduciary duties under
applicable Law; _provided_ , _however_ , that, prior to making such Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, (A) Parent has given the Company at least four
business days prior written notice of its intention to take such action, which
notice shall specify the reasons therefor, (B) Parent has negotiated, and has
caused its Representatives to negotiate, in good faith with the Company
during such notice period, to the extent the Company wishes to negotiate, to
enable the Company to propose revisions to the terms of this Agreement such
that it would permit the Parent Board of Directors not to make a Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.5(e)_, and
(C) the Parent Board of Directors shall have considered in good faith any
revisions to the terms of this Agreement proposed in writing by the Company,
and shall have determined, after consultation with its outside financial
advisors and outside legal counsel, that the failure of the Parent Board of
Directors to effect a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change in response to a
Parent Intervening Event would reasonably be likely to be inconsistent with
the Parent Board of Directors fiduciary duties under applicable Law.

 

(f) Nothing contained in this _ Section 5.5_ or elsewhere in this Agreement
shall prohibit Parent or the Parent Board of Directors from taking and
disclosing to the stockholders of Parent a position contemplated by Rule
14e-2(a) or Rule 14d-9 or Item 1012(a) of Regulation M-A promulgated under the
Exchange Act or from making any "stop, look and listen" communication or any
other disclosure to the stockholders of Parent pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f)
under the Exchange Act or making a disclosure that is required by applicable
Law; provided, that any such position or disclosure (other than any "stop,
look and listen" communication that includes a reaffirmation of the Parent
Recommendation) shall be deemed to be a Parent Adverse Recommendation Change
unless the Parent Board of Directors in connection with such communication
publicly states that its recommendation with respect to this Agreement has
not changed or refers to the prior recommendation of the Parent Board of
Directors.

(g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section_ __ _
5.5_, prior to the receipt of the Parent Stockholder Approval, Parent shall be
permitted, through its Representatives or otherwise, to seek clarification
from (but not, unless otherwise allowed pursuant to this Agreement, to engage
in any negotiations with or provide any non-public information to) any person
that has made a Parent Takeover Proposal solely to clarify and understand the
terms and conditions of such proposal to provide adequate information for the
Parent Board of Directors to make an informed determination under _Section_ __
_ 5.5(b)_.

Section 5.6 _Filings; Other Actions_.

 

(a) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this
Agreement, Parent and the Company shall prepare and file with the SEC
the Form S-4, which will include the Proxy Statement/Prospectus and shall,
for the avoidance of doubt, register the issuance of the Parent Common Stock,
issued at the Effective Time in the Merger. Each of Parent and the Company
shall use reasonable best efforts to have the Form S-4 declared effective
under the Securities Act as promptly as reasonably practicable after such
filing and to keep the Form S-4 effective as long as necessary to consummate
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. Each of Parent and
the Company will cause the Proxy Statement/Prospectus to be mailed to their
respective stockholders as promptly as practicable after the Form S-4 is
declared or becomes effective under the Securities Act. Parent shall also take
any action required to be taken under any applicable state or provincial
securities laws in connection with the issuance and reservation of shares of
Parent Common Stock in the Merger, and the Company shall furnish all
information concerning the Company and the holders of Company Common Stock, or
holders of a beneficial interest therein, as may be reasonably requested in
connection with any such action. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to,
the Form S-4 or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by Parent or the
Company, as applicable, without the others prior consent (not to be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) and without providing the other
party a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon. Parent or
the Company, as applicable, will advise the other promptly after it receives
oral or written notice of the time when the Form S-4 has become effective or
any supplement or amendment thereto has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the shares of Parent Common
Stock issuable in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any
jurisdiction, or any oral or written request by the SEC for amendment of
the Proxy Statement/Prospectus or the Form S-4 or comments thereon and
responses thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information, and will
promptly provide the other with copies of any written communication from the
SEC or any state securities commission with respect to the Form S-4 or the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus. If at any time prior to the Effective Time any
information relating to Parent or the Company, or any of their respective
affiliates, officers or directors, is discovered by Parent or the Company
which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to either the Form S-4
or the Proxy Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not
include a misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the party that discovers such
information shall promptly notify the other party hereto and an appropriate
amendment or supplement describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by law, disseminated to the
stockholders of each party.

(b) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, Parent shall take all action necessary
in accordance with applicable Laws and the Parent Organizational Documents to
duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its stockholders for the
purpose of obtaining the Parent Stockholder Approval (as such meeting may be
adjourned or postponed in accordance with this Agreement, the " _Parent
Stockholders_ __ _Meeting_ ") and not postpone or adjourn the Parent
Stockholders Meeting except to

 



\- 80 -

    

 the extent required by applicable Law or to solicit additional proxies and
votes in favor of the approval and adoption of this Agreement and the Merger,
the Parent Share Issuance or the Parent Charter Amendment, as contemplated by
this Agreement, if sufficient votes to constitute the Parent Stockholder
Approval have not been obtained. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.5_ and
applicable Law, Parent will, through its Board of Directors, recommend that
its stockholders approve and adopt this Agreement and the Merger, the Parent
Share Issuance and the Parent Charter Amendment, as contemplated by this
Agreement, and will use reasonable best efforts to solicit from
its stockholders proxies in favor of the approval and adoption of this
Agreement and the Merger, the Parent Share Issuance and the Parent Charter
Amendment, as contemplated by this Agreement, and to take all other action
necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of its stockholders
required by the rules of the NYSE or applicable Laws to obtain such approvals.

(c) As promptly as reasonably practicable following the clearance of the
Proxy Statement/Prospectus by the SEC, the Company shall take all action
necessary in accordance with applicable Laws and the Company Organizational
Documents to duly give notice of, convene and hold a meeting of its
shareholders, for the purpose of obtaining the Company Shareholder Approvals
(as such meeting may be adjourned or postponed in accordance with this
Agreement, the " _Company Shareholders_ __ _ Meeting_ ") and not postpone or
adjourn the Company Shareholders Meeting except to the extent required by
applicable Law or to solicit additional proxies and votes in favor of approval
of this Agreement if sufficient votes to constitute the Company Common
Shareholder Approval have not been obtained. Subject to _Section_ __ _ 5.4_
and applicable Law, the Company will, through its Board of Directors,
recommend that the holders of Company Common Stock approve this Agreement and
will use reasonable best efforts to solicit from the holders of Company Common
Stock proxies in favor of the approval of this Agreement and to take all other
action necessary or advisable to secure the vote or consent of the holders
of Company Common Stock required by the rules of NASDAQ or applicable Laws to
obtain such approvals.

Section 5.7 _Regulatory Approvals; Efforts_.

(a) Parent and the Company shall use their respective reasonable best efforts
to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done,
all things necessary, proper or advisable, including under any applicable
Laws, to consummate and make effective the Merger, including (i) the prompt
preparation and filing of all forms, notifications, declarations,
registrations, notices and other submissions required to be filed with any
Governmental Entity prior to the consummation of the Merger, (ii) the
satisfaction of the conditions to consummating the Merger, (iii) taking
all reasonable actions necessary to obtain (and cooperating with each other
in obtaining) any consent, clearance, authorization, Order or approval of, or
any exemption by, any third party, including any Governmental Entity (which
actions shall include furnishing all information and documentary material
required or requested under the HSR Act) required to be obtained or made by
Parent, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries in connection with
or that are necessary to consummate the Merger, (iv) defending any lawsuits
or other legal proceedings, whether judicial or administrative, challenging
this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, including seeking to have
any stay or temporary restraining order entered by any Governmental Entity
vacated or reversed and (v) the execution and delivery of any additional
instruments necessary to consummate the Merger and to fully carry out the
purposes of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, in no event shall the Company, Parent or any
of their respective Affiliates be required to pay any

 



\- 81 -

    

 consideration to any third parties or give anything of value to obtain any
such persons authorization, approval, consent or waiver to effectuate the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. In the
event that any litigation, administrative or judicial action or other
proceeding is commenced challenging the Merger, the parties hereto shall
cooperate with each other and use their respective reasonable best efforts to
contest and resist any such litigation, action or proceeding and to have
vacated, lifted, reversed or overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or
other order, whether temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect
and that prohibits, prevents or restricts consummation of the Merger.
Additionally, each of Parent and the Company shall use reasonable best efforts
to fulfill all conditions precedent to the Merger and shall not take any
action after the date of this Agreement that would reasonably be expected to
materially delay the obtaining of, or result in not obtaining, any consent,
clearance, authorization, Order or approval from any Governmental Entity
necessary to be obtained prior to Closing. To the extent that transfers of
any permits issued by any Governmental Entity are required as a result of the
execution of this Agreement or the consummation of the Merger, the parties
hereto shall use reasonable best efforts to effect such transfers.

 

(b) Parent and the Company shall each keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to the completion of the Merger and work cooperatively in
connection with obtaining all required consents, clearances, authorizations,
Orders or approvals of, or any exemptions by, any Governmental Entity
undertaken pursuant to the provisions of this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_. In that
regard, each party shall promptly consult with the other party to this
Agreement with respect to, provide any necessary information with respect to
(and, in the case of correspondence, provide the other party (or its counsel)
copies of), all filings, notices or other submissions made by such party with
any Governmental Entity or any other information supplied by such party to, or
correspondence with, a Governmental Entity in connection with this Agreement
and the Merger. Each party to this Agreement shall promptly inform the other
party to this Agreement, and if in writing, furnish the other party with
copies of (or, in the case of oral communications, advise the other party
orally of) any material communication from any Governmental Entity regarding
the Merger, and permit the other party to review and discuss in advance, and
consider in good faith the views of the other party in connection with, any
proposed written or oral communication with any such Governmental Entity. If
either party to this Agreement or any Representative of such party receives a
request for additional information or documentary material from any
Governmental Entity with respect to the Merger, then such party will use
reasonable best efforts to make, or cause to be made, promptly and after
consultation with the other party to this Agreement, an appropriate response
in substantial compliance with such request. Neither party shall participate
in any meeting or teleconference with any Governmental Entity where material
issues would likely be discussed in connection with this Agreement and the
Merger unless it consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent
permitted by such Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity
to attend and participate thereat. Each party shall furnish the other party
with copies of all correspondence, filings and communications (and memoranda
setting forth the substance thereof) between it and any such
Governmental Entity with respect to this Agreement and the Merger, and
furnish the other party with such necessary information and reasonable
assistance as the other party may reasonably request in connection with its
preparation of necessary filings, notices or other submissions of information
or documents to any such Governmental Entity; _provided_ , _however_ , that
materials provided pursuant to this _Section_ __ _ 5.7_ may be redacted (i)
to remove references concerning the valuation of the Company, Parent, the
Merger or other confidential information, (ii) as necessary to comply with
contractual requirements and (iii) as necessary to address reasonable
privilege waiver risks.

 



\- 82 -

    

(c) Parent shall and, shall cause its Subsidiaries to, propose, negotiate,
offer to commit and effect (and if such offer is accepted, commit to and
effect), by consent decree, hold separate order, or otherwise, the sale,
divestiture or disposition of such assets or businesses of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries, or effective as of the Effective Time, the Surviving
Company or its Subsidiaries, or otherwise offer to take or offer to commit to
take any action (including any action that limits its freedom of action,
ownership or control with respect to, or its ability to retain or hold, any
of the businesses, assets, product lines, properties or services of Parent,
the Surviving Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries) which it is
lawfully capable of taking and if the offer is accepted, take or commit to
take such action (each, a " _Divestiture Action_ "), in each case, as may be
required in order to avoid the commencement of any Action to prohibit the
Merger or any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement, or if already
commenced, to avoid the entry of, or to effect the dissolution of, any
injunction, temporary restraining order or other order in any Action so as to
enable the Closing to occur as soon as reasonably possible (and in any event,
not later than the End Date). To assist Parent in complying with its
obligations set forth in this _ Section 5.7(c)_, at Parents request the
Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, enter into one or more
agreements prior to the Closing with respect to any Divestiture Action; _
provided_, _ however_, that the consummation of the transactions provided for
in any such agreement for a Divestiture Action shall be conditioned upon the
Closing. The Company shall not, without the written consent of Parent,
publicly or before any Governmental Entity or other third party, offer,
suggest, propose or negotiate, and shall not commit to or effect, by consent
decree, hold separate order or otherwise, any Divestiture Action.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, nothing in this _
Section 5.7_ or elsewhere shall require, or be deemed to require, Parent to
take or agree to take any Divestiture Action if doing so would, individually
or in the aggregate, be reasonably likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or a Parent Material Adverse Effect.

(d) The Company and Parent shall use reasonable best efforts to file, as
promptly as practicable, but in any event no later than ten business days
after the date of this Agreement, the notification and report forms required
under the HSR Act. In the event that the parties receive a request for
information or documentary material pursuant to the HSR Act (a " _Second
Request_ "), the parties will use their respective reasonable best efforts to
respond to such Second Request as promptly as practicable, and counsel for
both parties will closely cooperate during the entirety of any such Second
Request review process.

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, the parties
agree that it is Parents sole right to devise strategy, actions and timing
for obtaining all required consents, clearances, authorizations, Orders and
approvals under the HSR Act.

 

Section 5.8 _Takeover Statutes_. If any "moratorium," "control share
acquisition," "fair price," "supermajority," "affiliate transactions" or
"business combination statute or regulation" or other similar state anti-
takeover Laws and regulations may become, or may purport to be, applicable to
this Agreement, the Support Agreements, the Voting Agreement (if and when
entered into), the Merger or any other transactions contemplated hereby, each
of the Company and Parent shall grant such approvals and take such actions as
are reasonably necessary so that the transactions contemplated hereby may be
consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated hereby and
otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the effects of such statute or
regulation on this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



\- 83 -

    

Section 5.9 _Public Announcements_. Parent and the Company shall use
reasonable best efforts to develop a joint communications plan and each party
shall use reasonable best efforts to ensure that all press releases and other
public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby, to the
extent they have not been previously issued or disclosed, shall be consistent
with such joint communications plan. Unless otherwise required by applicable
Law or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of any
securities exchange, each party shall use reasonable best efforts to consult
with each other before issuing any press release or public statement with
respect to the transactions contemplated hereby to the extent they have not
been previously issued or disclosed. Parent and the Company agree to issue a
mutually acceptable initial joint press release announcing this Agreement.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, a party, its Subsidiaries or their
Representatives may issue a public announcement or other public disclosures
consistent with the final form of the joint press release announcing the
Merger and the investor presentation given to investors on the morning
of announcement of the Merger. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no provision this Agreement shall be deemed to restrict in
any manner a partys ability to communicate with its employees, and neither
party shall be required by any provision of this Agreement to consult with or
obtain any approval from any other party with respect to a public announcement
or press release issued in connection with the receipt and existence of a
Company Takeover Proposal or a Parent Takeover Proposal, as applicable, and
matters related thereto or a Company Adverse Recommendation Change or Parent
Adverse Recommendation Change, as applicable, other than as set forth in
_Section_ __ _ 5.4_ or  _Section_ __ _ 5.5_, as applicable.

Section 5.10 _Indemnification, Advancement of Expenses and Insurance_. 

(a) Parent agrees that all rights to exculpation, indemnification, advancement
of expenses and arrangements of self-insurance for acts or omissions
occurring at or prior to the Effective Time, whether asserted or claimed prior
to, at or after the Effective Time, now existing in favor of the current or
former directors or officers, as the case may be, of the Company or its
Subsidiaries as provided in their respective articles or certificate of
incorporation or bylaws or other organizational documents or in any agreement
shall, from and after the Effective Time, survive the Merger and shall
continue in full force and effect. For a period of six years from the
Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall maintain in effect any
and all exculpation, indemnification and advancement of expenses provisions
and arrangements of self-insurance of the Companys and any of its
Subsidiaries articles or certificate of incorporation and bylaws or similar
organizational documents in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time or
in any indemnification agreements of the Company or its Subsidiaries with any
of their respective current or former directors, officers or employees in
effect immediately prior to the Effective Time, and shall not amend, repeal or
otherwise modify any such provisions or the exculpation, indemnification,
advancement of expenses provisions or arrangement of self-insurance of the
Surviving Companys organizational documents in any manner that would
adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individuals who immediately
before the Effective Time were current or former directors, officers or
employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_
, that all rights to exculpation, indemnification, advancement of expenses and
arrangements of self-insurance in respect of any Action pending or asserted
or any claim made within such period shall continue until the disposition of
such Action or resolution of such claim.

 



\- 84 -

    

(b) From and after the Effective Time, Parent and the Surviving Company shall,
to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law, indemnify and hold
harmless (and advance expenses in respect of each of the foregoing) each
current and former director or officer of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and each person who served as a director, officer, member,
trustee or fiduciary of another corporation, partnership, joint venture,
trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or enterprise if such service
was at the request or for the benefit of the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries (each, together with such persons heirs, executors or
administrators, an " _Indemnified Party_ "), in each case against any costs or
expenses (including advancing reasonable attorneys fees and expenses
in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or
investigation incurred by an Indemnified Party in defense of such claim, suit,
proceeding or investigation to the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the Indemnified Party who has requested an
advance of expenses provides an undertaking consistent with the Company
Organizational Documents and to the extent required by Texas law to repay such
amounts if it is ultimately determined that such person is not entitled to
indemnification), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
amounts paid in settlement in connection with any actual or threatened claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative (an " _Action_ "), arising out of, relating to
or in connection with any action or omission by them in their capacities as
such occurring or alleged to have occurred whether before or after the
Effective Time (including acts or omissions in connection with such
Indemnified Party serving as an officer, director, employee or other fiduciary
of any entity if such service was at the request or for the benefit of
the Company). In the event of any such Action, Parent and the Surviving
Company shall cooperate with the Indemnified Party in the defense of any such
Action.

 

(c) For a period of six years from the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be maintained in effect the coverage provided by the policies of directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance in effect
as of the date hereof by the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to
matters existing or arising on or before the Effective Time;  _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Parent shall not be required to pay, in respect of any year
after the Effective Time, annual premiums in excess of 300% of the last annual
premium paid by the Company prior to the date hereof in respect of
the coverages (the " _Maximum Amount_ ") required to be obtained pursuant
hereto, but in such case shall purchase as much coverage as reasonably
practicable for such amount. If the Company elects in its sole discretion,
then the Company may, prior to the Effective Time, purchase a "tail policy"
with respect to acts or omissions occurring or alleged to have occurred prior
to the Effective Time that were committed or alleged to have been committed by
such Indemnified Parties in their capacity as such; _provided_ , that in no
event shall the cost of such policy, if purchased by the Company, exceed six
(6) times the Maximum Amount and, if such a "tail policy" is purchased, Parent
shall have no further obligations under this _Section_ __ _ 5.10(c)_.

(d) Parent shall pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys
fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Party in enforcing the indemnity
and other obligations provided in this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_.

(e) The rights of each Indemnified Party shall be in addition to, and not in
limitation of, any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under the
articles or certificate of incorporation or bylaws or other organizational
documents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or the Surviving Company,
any other indemnification arrangement, the TBOC, the DGCL or otherwise.

(f) In the event that Parent or any of its respective successors or
assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and shall not
be the sole continuing or sole surviving corporation or entity in such
consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its
properties and assets to any person, then, and in either such case, proper
provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Parent, as the
case may be, shall assume the obligations of such party set forth in this
_Section 5.10_. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to, shall be construed
to or shall release, waive or impair any rights to directors and officers
insurance claims under any policy that is or has been in existence with
respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or their respective
officers, directors and employees, it being understood and agreed that the
indemnification provided for in this _Section 5.10_ is not prior to, or in
substitution for, any such claims under any such policies.

(g) The obligations of Parent under this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall not be
terminated, amended or modified in any manner so as to adversely affect any
Indemnified Party (including their successors, heirs and legal
representatives) to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ applies without the
consent of such Indemnified Party. It is expressly agreed that,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement that may be to the
contrary, (i) the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_
applies shall be third-party beneficiaries of this  _Section_ __ _ 5.10_,
and (ii) this _Section_ __ _ 5.10_ shall survive consummation of the Merger
and shall be enforceable by such Indemnified Parties and their respective
successors, heirs and legal representatives against Parent and its successors
and assigns.

Section 5.11 _Employee Matters_.

 

(a) Effective as of the Effective Time and continuing until the applicable
date specified below, Parent or its applicable Subsidiary, including the
Surviving Company, shall provide to employees of the Company or its
Subsidiaries who were employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Effective Time and who continue to be employed by
Parent or any of its Subsidiaries immediately following the Effective Time
(the " _Company Employees_ ") (i) until the first anniversary of the Effective
Time, base salary or base wages that are no less favorable than the base
salary or base wage rate provided to such Company Employee immediately prior
to the Effective Time, (ii) until December 31, 2019, a target annual cash
incentive opportunity that is no less than the target annual cash incentive
opportunity provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the
Effective Time, (iii) from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2020, a target
annual cash incentive opportunity substantially consistent with the target
annual cash incentive opportunity provided by Parent to similarly situated
employees of Parent, as determined in accordance with Parents compensation
policies, (iv) long-term incentive opportunities that are substantially
consistent with the long-term incentive opportunities provided by Parent to
similarly situated employees of Parent, as determined in accordance with
Parents compensation policies; _provided_ that, for calendar year 2020, the
combined target annual cash incentive opportunity, cash bonus awards
and long-term incentive opportunities offered to each

 



\- 86 -

    

 Company Employee by Parent will be substantially consistent with the
combined target annual cash incentive opportunity and long-term incentive
opportunities offered by the Company to such Company Employee for the
calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs or, if the Effective Time
occurs in calendar year 2020 and such opportunities have not yet been
established for 2020, for calendar year 2019, and (v) other employee
benefits (excluding defined benefit, nonqualified deferred compensation,
long-term incentive, retention equity or equity-based, severance, post-service
or retiree health or welfare benefits) that are substantially comparable, in
the aggregate, to other employee benefits (excluding defined benefit,
nonqualified deferred compensation, long-term incentive, retention equity or
equity-based, severance, post-service or retiree health or welfare benefits)
provided to such Company Employee immediately prior to the Effective Time.
With respect to any Company Employee who is not eligible to receive and does
not receive an equity-based long-term incentive grant under Parents long-term
incentive compensation program in the annual grant cycle that immediately
follows the Effective Time, but who did receive a grant pursuant to the
Companys long-term incentive program in the annual grant cycle prior to the
Effective Time, Parent shall provide to such Company Employee in the
calendar year that includes the annual equity grant cycle following the
Effective Time, a cash bonus award that (i) is equivalent to one-third of the
grant date value of the long-term incentive grant that such Company Employee
received in the annual grant cycle immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(ii) shall vest upon the one year anniversary of the grant date of such award.

 

(b) Following the Closing Date, Parent shall cause any employee benefit plans
sponsored or maintained by Parent or its Subsidiaries, including the
Surviving Company, in which the Company Employees are eligible to participate
(collectively, the " _Post-Closing Plans_ ") to recognize the service of each
Company Employee with the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the
Closing Date for purposes of eligibility and vesting under any 401(k) and
paid time off plan, and for purposes of determining the level of paid time off
benefits under such analogous Post-Closing Plans, in each case, for the same
purpose and to the same extent such service was recognized immediately prior
to the Effective Time under a comparable Company Benefit Plan in which such
Company Employee was eligible to participate immediately prior to the
Effective Time; _provided_ , that such recognition of service shall not (i)
apply for purposes of any defined benefit retirement plan or plan that
provides post-service or retiree health or welfare benefits, (ii) operate to
duplicate any benefits or compensation of a Company Employee with respect to
the same period of service or (iii) apply for purposes of any plan, program or
arrangement that is grandfathered or frozen, either with respect to level of
benefits or participation, or for purposes of any plan or arrangement that
provides equity or equity-based compensation. With respect to any Post-Closing
Plan that provides medical, dental or vision insurance benefits, for the plan
year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to (A) cause any pre-existing condition
limitations or eligibility waiting periods under such plan to be waived with
respect to such Company Employee to the extent such limitation would have
been waived or satisfied under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which
such Company Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time and
(B) credit each Company Employee for an amount equal to any medical, dental or
vision expenses incurred by such Company Employee in the year that includes
the Closing Date (or, if later, the year in which such Company Employee is
first eligible to participate in such Post-Closing Plan) for purposes of any
applicable deductible and annual out-of-pocket expense requirements under any
such Post-Closing Plan to the extent such expenses would have been credited
under the Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee participated
immediately prior to the Effective Time, subject to the applicable

 



\- 87 -

    

 information being provided to Parent in a form that Parent reasonably
determines is administratively feasible to take into account under its plans.
In the plan year in which the Closing occurs, Parent shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to cause such credited expenses under this _Section_ __ _
5.11(b)_ to also count toward any annual or lifetime limits, treatment or
visit limits or similar limitations that apply under the terms of a Post-
Closing Plan providing health benefits to the extent such expenses would have
been recognized under the analogous Company Benefit Plan in which such Company
Employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time. Without
limiting the foregoing, for purposes of determining the number of vacation
days and other paid time off to which each Company Employee is entitled during
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent or its
applicable Subsidiary will honor all unused vacation and other paid time off
days and not yet used, accrued or earned by such Company Employee as of the
Effective Time for the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs.

 

(c) Each Company Employee who as of immediately prior to the Effective Time is
eligible for an annual bonus for 2019 under a Company Benefit Plan for which
a description has been provided to Parent prior to the date hereof and who
remains employed with Parent or its Subsidiaries through the regular payment
date for such bonus shall receive in cash, on such regular payment date
(which shall be in calendar year 2020 but on or before April 1, 2020), the
following bonus to the extent such bonus is not otherwise paid prior to the
Effective Time: (i) for the period from January 1, 2019 through the earlier of
the Effective Time or December 31, 2019, a bonus in an amount determined
based on the level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under
such Company Benefit Plan (as provided to Parent prior to the date hereof)
measured as of such earlier date against budgeted performance for such period
(applying the budget in effect as of the date hereof), but in no event less
than 100% of the target amount of such bonus, which bonus, for the avoidance
of doubt, will be prorated to reflect the number of calendar days during such
period and (ii) if applicable, for the post-Effective Time portion of 2019, an
annual bonus opportunity prorated for the post-Effective Time portion of the
year in which the Effective Time occurs in accordance with _Section_ __ _
5.11(a)(i)_.

(d) If the Effective Time occurs in 2020, each Company Employee who as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time is eligible for an annual bonus
for 2020 under a Company Benefit Plan and who remains employed with Parent or
its Subsidiaries through the regular payment date for such bonus shall receive
in cash, on such regular payment date, the following bonus to the extent such
bonus is not otherwise paid prior to the Effective Time: (i) for the period
from January 1, 2020 through the Effective Time (or the last day of the month
immediately preceding the Effective Time, if the Effective Time does not
occur on the last day of a month) a bonus in an amount determined based on the
level of attainment of the applicable performance measures under such Company
Benefit Plan (as provided to Parent in the first quarter of 2020) measured as
of the Effective Time (or the last day of the month immediately preceding the
Effective Time, if the Effective Time does not occur on the last day of a
month) against budgeted performance for such period (applying the budget in
effect as of January 1, 2020), but in no event less than 100% of the target
amount of such bonus, which bonus, for the avoidance of doubt, will be
prorated to reflect the number of calendar days during such period and (ii)
if applicable, for the post-Effective Time portion of 2020, an annual bonus
opportunity prorated for the post-Effective Time portion of the year in which
the Effective Time occurs in accordance with  _Section_ __ _ 5.11(a)(i)_.

 



\- 88 -

    

(e) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Company to, honor all accrued and vested benefits under the Company
Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms as in effect immediately before
the Effective Time and applicable Law as such agreements and arrangements may
be modified or terminated in accordance with their terms from time to time.
The parties hereby acknowledge that a "change of control" or "change in
control" (or term of similar import) within the meaning of each of the Company
Benefit Plans identified in  _Section_ __ _ 5.11(e)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule will occur at or immediately prior to the Effective Time,
as applicable.

 

(f) At the written request of Parent provided no later than ten business days
prior to the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall, at least
one (1) business day prior to the Closing Date, adopt written resolutions (or
take other necessary and appropriate action) to terminate, any and all Company
Benefit Plans or any other benefit plan, in each case, intended to
be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code (the " _Company 401(k) Plan_
"), or participation in and sponsorship of such plan if the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries are not the primary sponsor, and to fully vest all
participants under such Company 401(k) Plan, such termination and vesting to
be effective no later than the business day preceding the Closing Date;
provided, however, that such Company 401(k) Plan termination may be made
contingent upon the Closing. The Company and its Subsidiaries shall provide
Parent with an advance copy of such proposed resolutions (and any related
documents) and a reasonable opportunity to comment thereon prior to adoption
or execution.

 

(g) Nothing in this Agreement shall confer upon any Company Employee or other
service provider or any other person any right to employment or service with
or to continue in the employ or service of Parent, the Surviving Company or
any affiliate thereof or any right to any particular term or condition of
employment or service, or shall interfere with or restrict in any way the
rights of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their respective
affiliates, which rights are hereby expressly reserved, to discharge or
terminate the services of any Company Employee at any time for any reason
whatsoever, with or without cause. In no event shall the terms of this
Agreement be deemed to (i) establish, terminate, amend, or modify any Company
Benefit Plan or any "employee benefit plan" as defined in Section 3(3) of
ERISA, or any other benefit or compensation plan, program, policy, Contract,
agreement or arrangement maintained or sponsored by Parent, the Surviving
Company, the Company or any of their respective Subsidiaries (including, after
the Closing Date, the Company and its Subsidiaries) or affiliates; or (ii)
alter or limit the ability of Parent, the Surviving Company or any of their
Subsidiaries (including, after the Closing Date, the Company and its
Subsidiaries) or affiliates to amend, modify or terminate any Company Benefit
Plan, employment agreement or any other benefit, compensation or employment
plan, program, policy, Contract, agreement or arrangement after the Closing
Date. Nothing in this _Section_ __ _ 5.11_ shall create any third party
beneficiary rights in any Company Employee or current or former service
provider of the Company or its affiliates (or any beneficiaries or dependents
thereof) or any other person (other than the parties to this Agreement).

 

Section 5.12 _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting either
partys rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand
and agree that (a) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent or
the Company, directly or indirectly, the right to control or direct the other
partys operations prior to the Effective Time and (b) prior to the Effective
Time, each of the Company and Parent shall exercise, consistent with the terms
and conditions of this Agreement, complete control and supervision over its
operations.

Section 5.13 _Section_ __ _ 16_ _Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time,
Parent and the Company shall take all such steps as may be required to cause
any dispositions of Company Common Stock (including derivative securities with
respect to Company Common Stock) or acquisitions of shares of Parent
Common Stock (including derivative securities with respect to Parent Common
Stock) resulting from the transactions contemplated by this Agreement by each
individual who is subject to the reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of
the Exchange Act with respect to the Company or will become subject to such
reporting requirements with respect to Parent, to be exempt under Rule 16b-3
promulgated under the Exchange Act.

 

Section 5.14 _Transaction Litigation_. Subject to applicable Law, the Company
shall give Parent the opportunity to participate in the Companys defense or
settlement of any shareholder litigation against the Company or its directors
or executive officers relating to the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including the Merger. The Company agrees that, except to the
extent permitted pursuant to _Section_ __ _ 5.1(b_ _)(_ _O)_ , it shall not
settle or offer to settle any litigation commenced prior to or after the date
of this Agreement against the Company or its directors, executive officers or
similar persons by any shareholder of the Company relating to this Agreement,
the Merger or any other transaction contemplated hereby without the prior
written consent of Parent (not to be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed). 

Section 5.15 _Reorganization_. The parties shall cooperate and use their
respective reasonable best efforts in order for Parent and the Company to
obtain the tax opinions referenced in _Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_ and _Section_ __
_ 6.3(d)_, whether from the named law firm or, if the named law firm is
unable to issue such opinion, from such other reputable law firm, and any Tax
opinions required to be filed with the SEC in connection with the filing of
the Form S-4. Parent and the Company shall execute and deliver to each of
Baker Botts L.L.P., counsel to the Company, and Kirkland and Ellis LLP, counsel
to Parent, or such other reputable law firm as may be asked to give such
opinion, certificates substantially in the forms attached hereto as Exhibits C
and D, in each case, with any modifications thereto that are reasonably
requested by counsel, at such time or times as reasonably requested by each
such law firm in connection with its delivery of the opinion referred to in
_Section_ __ _ 6.2(d)_,  _Section_ __ _ 6.3(d)_ or any Tax opinions
required to be filed with the SEC in connection with the filing of the Form
S-4 as the case may be. The parties to this Agreement adopt this Agreement as
a "plan of reorganization" within the meaning of Treasury Regulation Section
1.368-2(g). Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of the
Company, Surviving Company or Parent will take, or omit to take, any action
that would, or could reasonably be expected to, prevent or impede the Merger
from qualifying as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code. The parties will take the position for all Tax purposes that the
Merger qualifies as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of
the Code, unless a contrary position is required by a final determination
within the meaning of Section 1313 of the Code.

Section 5.16 _Listing_. Parent shall cause the shares of Parent Common Stock

pursuant to applicable Law and the rules and regulations of NASDAQ to cause
(a) the delisting of the Company Common Stock from NASDAQ as promptly as
practicable after the Effective Time and (b) the deregistration of the Company
Common Stock pursuant to the Exchange Act as promptly as practicable after
such delisting.

Section 5.18 _Financing Cooperation_.

 

(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other with respect to
customary actions for transactions of this type that are reasonably requested
by Parent to be taken by the Company or its Subsidiaries under any of the

with the Merger; provided that none of the Company, its Subsidiaries or their
Representatives shall be required to execute or deliver, or agree to any
change or modification of, any agreement or document that is effective prior
to the Closing or that would be effective if the Closing does not occur.

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement and through the earlier of the
Effective Time and the date on which this Agreement is terminated in
accordance with _Article VII_ , the Company shall, and shall cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, use its and their reasonable best efforts to, and cause its
and their Representatives to, provide, after a request from Parent or any of
its Representatives to do so, on a timely basis, such customary assistance and
cooperation as is reasonably requested by Parent to assist Parent in the
arrangement, syndication and consummation of bank or capital markets or
institutional debt financing transactions anticipated to be consummated in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the "
_Financing_ "), including (i) providing the Company Reserve Reports, lease

regarding the Companys business, and making available such personnel, as
Parent may reasonably request in order to assist Parent in connection with any
activities relating to any Financing. All non-public information exchanged

5.18_, in connection with the Financing or any other action contemplated by
this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_, (i) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any
of their respective Representatives shall be required to take any action

Representatives shall become bound by any terms of the Financing or any other

which it is not indemnified by or on behalf of Parent in connection with
the Financing or any other action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_
prior to the Effective Time; (v) none of the Company or its Subsidiaries or
any of their respective Representatives shall be required to disclose
or provide any information in connection with the Financing or any other
action contemplated by this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_, the disclosure of which, in
the reasonable good faith judgment of the Company, is restricted by Contract
with an unaffiliated third party or applicable law, is subject to attorney-
client privilege (except that such person shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to disclose such information in a way that would not jeopardize such
privilege) or would result in the disclosure of any trade secrets or the
violation of any confidentiality obligation; (vi) none of the Company or its

prepared by the Company or its Subsidiaries in the ordinary course of their

obligor with respect to the Financing.

(d) Parent shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Company,
its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives (the " _Section_ __ _
5.18 Indemnified Parties_") from and against any and all losses, damages,
claims, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees), interest,
awards, judgments and penalties suffered or incurred by them in connection
with (i) any action taken by them at the request of Parent pursuant to this

this Agreement is terminated, subject to the obligation to repay such
reimbursement upon an Adverse Determination. The obligations of Parent under
this _Section_ __ _ 5.18_ shall not be terminated, amended or modified in any
manner so as to adversely affect any Section 5.18 Indemnified Party (including
their successors, heirs and legal representatives) to whom this _Section_ __
_ 5.18_ applies without the consent of such Section 5.18 Indemnified Party.
It is expressly agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this

and legal representatives against Parent and its successors and assigns.

(e) The Company shall, and shall cause each of its applicable Subsidiaries to
deliver to Parent and the administrative agent under any Payoff Indebtedness,
at least three business days prior to the Closing, all reasonably requested
notices (provided that any notice with respect to the termination of

any Payoff Indebtedness may be conditioned upon the Closing or the entrance
into a new credit facility on the Closing Date) and documentation and take all
reasonably requested other actions to facilitate the repayment and termination
on the Closing Date of any Payoff Indebtedness of the Company, including
using reasonable best efforts to obtain customary payoff letters from each
holder of Payoff Indebtedness that will be outstanding immediately prior to
the Closing, in form reasonably satisfactory to Parent, setting forth the

therewith, or be bound by the terms of the Preferred Redemption, in each
case, that is effective prior to the time that Parent or the Company makes the

5.19_ or that would be effective if either the Preferred Deposit or the
Effective Time does not occur.

(c) None of the Company or its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
Representatives shall be required in connection with the Preferred Redemption
to (i) pay any fee or incur any other cost or expense for which it has not
received simultaneous or prior reimbursement or, with respect to immaterial
costs or expenses, for which it is not indemnified under _Section_ __ _
5.18(d)_ by or on behalf of Parent or (ii) cause any director, officer,
employee, stockholder or representative of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries to incur any personal liability.

Company shall have no obligations to effect the Preferred Redemption or to
take the other actions under this _Section_ __ _ 5.19_, and the Company Board
of Directors shall have no obligation to approve any such action, if the
Company Board of Directors at any time determines that (i) after giving
effect to the Preferred Redemption (including the Preferred Deposit), the
Company would reasonably be expected to be Insolvent, (ii) the surplus of the
Company prior to the Preferred Redemption would reasonably be expected to be
less than the amount of the Preferred Redemption or (iii) funds are otherwise

Redemption, including providing in the form reasonably requested by
Parent, information regarding the Company and its Subsidiaries (including
providing the information and documents contemplated by Section 21.314 of the
TBOC) whether requested of the Company or its Representatives and which shall
include financial and other information that assumes the completion of the
Merger, the Preferred Redemption and the transactions contemplated hereby.

compensate Parent in the circumstances in which such Company Termination Fee
or Parent Expense Reimbursement is due and payable and which do not involve
fraud or willful and material breach, for the efforts and resources expended

(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, if the Parent
Termination Fee shall become due and payable in accordance with this
_Section_ __ _ 7.3_, from and after such termination and payment of the
Parent Termination Fee pursuant to and in accordance with this _Section_ __ _
7.3_, Parent shall have no further liability of any kind for any reason in
connection with this Agreement or the termination contemplated hereby other
than as provided under this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, except in the case of fraud
or a willful and material breach by Parent of this Agreement. Each of the
parties hereto acknowledges that the Parent Termination Fee and the Company
Expense Reimbursement are not intended to be a penalty, but rather are
liquidated damages in a reasonable amount that will compensate the Company in
the circumstances in which such Parent Termination Fee or Company Expense
Reimbursement is due and payable and which do not involve fraud or willful and
material breach, for the efforts and resources expended and opportunities
foregone while negotiating this Agreement and in reliance on this Agreement
and on the expectation of the consummation of the transactions contemplated

precision. In no event shall the Company be entitled to more than one payment
of the Parent Termination Fee or more than one payment of the Company Expense

 Reimbursement. If the Company receives a Parent Termination Fee, then the
Company will not be entitled to also receive a payment for the Company Expense
Reimbursement and if the Parent Termination Fee is payable at such time as
the Company has already received payment or concurrently receives payment from
Parent in respect of the Company Expense Reimbursement, the amount of the
Company Expense Reimbursement actually received by the Company shall be
deducted from the Parent Termination Fee.

(j) Each of the Company and Parent acknowledges that the agreements contained
in this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_ are an integral part of the transactions
contemplated hereby, and that, without these agreements, the Company and
Parent would not enter into this Agreement. Accordingly, if the Company or
Parent, as applicable, fails to pay in a timely manner any amount due pursuant
to this _ Section 7.3_, then (i) the Company or Parent, as applicable, shall
reimburse the other for all costs and expenses (including disbursements and
reasonable fees of counsel) incurred in the collection of such overdue amount,
including in connection with any related Actions commenced and (ii) the
Company or Parent, as applicable, shall pay to the other interest on
such amount from and including the date payment of such amount was due to but
excluding the date of actual payment at the prime rate set forth in _The_ __ _
Wall Street Journal_ in effect on the date such payment was required to
be made plus 2%.

(k) Solely for the purpose of this _Section_ __ _ 7.3_, "Company Takeover
Proposal" and "Parent Takeover Proposal" shall have the relevant meaning
ascribed thereto in _Section_ __ _ 8.16(b)_, except in each case that
references to 25% shall be changed to 50%.
