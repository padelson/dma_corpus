Effective Time. Subject to the satisfaction or waiver of all conditions to
closing contained in Article IX hereof, the Closing will occur no later than
ten business days following the latest to occur of (i) the receipt of all

of Merger are filed with the Maryland Department, or at such later time as the
Parties agree and specify in the Articles of Merger, in accordance with the
MGCL (the date and time the Merger becomes effective being the "Effective
Time"). 2.3. Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws. The Articles of

to the Effective Time will be the Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the
Surviving Company, until thereafter amended as provided therein and by
applicable law. 2.4. Directors and Officers of Surviving Company. Except as

2.5. Additional Director. Northwest Bancshares and Northwest Bank will take

of this Agreement and until the Closing, each party hereto will use its
reasonable best efforts to cause the Merger to qualify, and will not knowingly
take any action, cause any action to be taken, fail to take any action or
cause any action to fail to be taken which action or failure to act could
prevent the Merger from qualifying as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of
the Code. Following the Closing, neither Northwest Bancshares, MutualFirst
Financial nor any of their affiliates will knowingly take any action, cause
any action to be taken, fail to take any action or cause any action to fail to

qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code. Northwest
Bancshares and MutualFirst Financial each hereby agrees to deliver
certificates substantially in compliance with IRS published advance ruling

contained in this Agreement and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article IX, prior to the Effective Time Northwest Bancshares will
be entitled to revise the structure of the Merger described in Section 2.1
hereof, provided that (i) such modification does not prevent the rendering of
the opinions contemplated by Sections 9.2.5 and 9.3.5; (ii) the consideration
to be paid to the holders of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock under this
Agreement is not thereby changed in kind, value or reduced in amount; and
(iii) such modification will not delay materially or jeopardize receipt of any
required regulatory approvals or other consents and approvals relating to the
consummation of the Merger. The parties hereto agree to appropriately amend
this Agreement and any related documents in order to reflect any such revised
structure. 2.8. Additional Actions. If, at any time after the Effective Time,
Northwest Bancshares shall consider or be advised that any further deeds,
assignments or assurances in law or any other acts are necessary or desirable
to (i) vest, perfect or confirm, of record or otherwise, in Northwest
Bancshares its right, title or interest in, to or under any of the rights,
properties or assets of MutualFirst Financial or MutualBank, or (ii) otherwise
carry out the purposes of this Agreement, MutualFirst Financial, MutualBank
and their officers and directors shall be deemed to have granted to 11  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf016.jpg) 

Northwest Bancshares and Northwest Bank an irrevocable power of attorney to
execute and deliver all such deeds, assignments or assurances in law or any
other acts as are necessary or desirable to (a) vest, perfect or confirm, of

follow the Effective Time of the Merger, at which time the Bank Merger shall
be consummated. ARTICLE III CONVERSION OF SHARES 3.1. Conversion of
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock; Merger Consideration. At the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of Northwest
Bancshares, MutualFirst Financial or the holders of any of the shares of
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock, the Merger will be effected in accordance
with the following terms: 3.1.1. Each share of Northwest Bancshares Common
Stock that is issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
will remain issued and outstanding following the Effective Time and shall be
unchanged by the Merger. 3.1.2. All shares of MutualFirst Financial Common
Stock held in the treasury of MutualFirst Financial and each share of
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock owned by Northwest Bancshares or any direct
or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of Northwest Bancshares or of MutualFirst
Financial immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares held in a
fiduciary capacity or in connection with debts previously contracted)
("Treasury Stock"), will, at the Effective Time, cease to exist, and the
certificates for such shares will be canceled as promptly as practicable
thereafter, and no payment or distribution shall be made in consideration
therefor. 3.1.3. Each share of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Treasury
Stock) shall become and be converted into, as provided in and subject to the
limitations set forth in this Agreement, the right to receive 2.4 shares (the
"Exchange Ratio") of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock (the "Merger
Consideration"). 3.1.4. After the Effective Time, shares of MutualFirst
Financial Common Stock will no longer be outstanding and will automatically be
canceled and will cease to exist, and 12  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf017.jpg) 

shall thereafter by operation of this section have no rights except the right
to receive the Merger Consideration. 3.1.5. In the event Northwest Bancshares
changes (or establishes a record date for changing) the number of, or provides
for the exchange of, shares of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock issued and
outstanding prior to the Effective Time as a result of a stock split, stock
dividend, recapitalization, reclassification, or similar transaction with
respect to the outstanding Northwest Bancshares Common Stock and the record
date therefor shall be prior to the Effective Time, the Exchange Ratio will be
proportionately and appropriately adjusted; provided, that no such adjustment
will be made with regard to Northwest Bancshares Common Stock if Northwest
Bancshares issues additional shares of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock and
receives fair market value consideration for such shares. 3.2. No Fractional
Shares. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
certificates or scrip representing fractional shares of Northwest Bancshares
Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange of Certificates,
no dividend or distribution with respect to Northwest Bancshares Common Stock
will be payable on or with respect to any fractional share interest, and such
fractional share interests will not entitle the owner thereof to vote or to
any other rights of a stockholder of Northwest Bancshares. In lieu of issuing
any fractional shares, Northwest Bancshares will pay to each former holder of
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock who otherwise would be entitled to receive
a fractional share of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock, an amount in cash,
rounded to the nearest cent and without interest, equal to the product of (i)
the fraction of a share to which such holder would otherwise have been
entitled and (ii) the average of the daily closing sales prices of a share of
Northwest Bancshares Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq for the ten
consecutive trading days ending three trading days preceding the Closing Date.
In determining any fractional share interest, all shares of MutualFirst
Financial Common Stock owned by a MutualFirst Financial stockholder shall be
combined so as to calculate the maximum number of whole shares of Northwest
Bancshares Common Stock issuable to such MutualFirst Financial stockholder.
3.3. Procedures for Exchange of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock. 3.3.1.
Northwest Bancshares to Make Merger Consideration Available. At or prior to
the Effective Time, Northwest Bancshares will deposit, or will cause to be
deposited, with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock, for exchange in accordance with this
Section 3.3, certificates representing the shares of Northwest Bancshares
Common Stock sufficient to pay the aggregate amount of the Merger
Consideration, or at Northwest Bancshares' option, evidence of shares in book
entry form, and an aggregate amount of cash sufficient to pay the aggregate
amount of cash payable pursuant to this Article III (which amount of cash will
be paid in lieu of fractional shares of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock)
(such cash and certificates for shares of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock,
together with any dividends or distributions with respect thereto (without any
interest thereon) being hereinafter referred to as the "Exchange Fund"). 13  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf018.jpg) 

3.3.2. Exchange of Certificates. Northwest Bancshares will take all steps
necessary to cause the Exchange Agent, within five (5) business days after the
Effective Time, to mail to each holder of a Certificate or Certificates, a
form letter of transmittal for return to the Exchange Agent and instructions
for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the
Merger Consideration and cash in lieu of fractional shares into which the
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock represented by such Certificates will have
been converted as a result of the Merger, if any. The letter of transmittal
(which shall be subject to the reasonable approval of MutualFirst Financial)
will specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange
Agent. Upon proper surrender of a Certificate for exchange and cancellation to
the Exchange Agent, together with a properly completed letter of transmittal,
duly executed, the holder of such Certificate will be entitled to receive in
exchange therefor the Merger Consideration to which such holder of MutualFirst
Financial Common Stock will have become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1.3
hereof, and the Certificate so surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. No
interest will be paid or accrued on any Merger Consideration or any cash
payable in lieu of fractional shares or any unpaid dividends and
distributions, if any, payable to holders of Certificates. 3.3.3. Rights of
Holders of Certificates after the Effective Time. The holder of a Certificate
that prior to the Merger represented issued and outstanding MutualFirst
Financial Common Stock shall have no rights, after the Effective Time, with
respect to such MutualFirst Financial Common Stock except to surrender the
Certificate in exchange for the Merger Consideration as provided in this
Agreement. No dividends or other distributions declared after the Effective
Time with respect to Northwest Bancshares Common Stock will be paid to the
holder of any unsurrendered Certificate until the holder thereof surrenders
such Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3. After the surrender of a
Certificate in accordance with this Section 3.3, the record holder thereof
will be entitled to receive any such dividends or other distributions, without
any interest thereon, which previously had become payable with respect to
shares of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock represented by such Certificate.
3.3.4. Surrender by Persons Other than Record Holders. If the Person
surrendering a Certificate and signing the accompanying letter of transmittal
is not the record holder thereof, then a condition to the payment of the
Merger Consideration will be that: (i) such Certificate is properly endorsed
to such Person or is accompanied by appropriate stock powers, in either case
signed exactly as the name of the record holder appears on such Certificate,
and is otherwise in proper form for transfer, or is accompanied by appropriate
evidence of the authority of the Person surrendering such Certificate and
signing the letter of transmittal to do so on behalf of the record holder; and
(ii) the Person requesting such exchange pays to the Exchange Agent in advance
any transfer or other taxes required by reason of the payment to a Person
other than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or required
for any other reason, or establishes to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent
that such tax has been paid or is not payable. 3.3.5. Closing of Transfer
Books. From and after the Effective Time, there shall be no transfers on the
stock transfer books of MutualFirst Financial of the MutualFirst Financial
Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time.
If, after the Effective Time, Certificates representing such shares are
presented for transfer to the Exchange 14  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf019.jpg) 

Agent, they shall be exchanged for the Merger Consideration and canceled as
provided in this Section 3.3. 3.3.6. Return of Exchange Fund. At any time
following the twelve (12) month period after the Effective Time, Northwest
Bancshares will be entitled to require the Exchange Agent to deliver to it any
portions of the Exchange Fund which had been made available to the Exchange
Agent and not disbursed to holders of Certificates (including, without
limitation, all interest and other income received by the Exchange Agent in
respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter such holders will
be entitled to look to Northwest Bancshares (subject to abandoned property,
escheat and other similar laws) with respect to any Merger Consideration that
may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held by them.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither Northwest Bancshares nor the Exchange
Agent shall be liable to any holder of a Certificate for any Merger
Consideration delivered in respect of such Certificate to a public official
pursuant to any abandoned property, escheat or other similar law. 3.3.7. Lost,
Stolen or Destroyed Certificates. In the event any Certificate is lost, stolen
or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person
claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and the posting by
such Person of a bond in such amount as the Exchange Agent may reasonably
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will issue in exchange for such lost,
stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration deliverable in
respect thereof. 3.3.8. Withholding. Northwest Bancshares or the Exchange
Agent will be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise
payable pursuant to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby to
any holder of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock such amounts as Northwest
Bancshares or the Exchange Agent are required to deduct and withhold with
respect to the making of such payment under the Code, or any applicable
provision of U.S. federal, state, local or non-U.S. tax law. To the extent
that such amounts are properly withheld by Northwest Bancshares or the
Exchange Agent, such withheld amounts will be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the MutualFirst Financial
Common Stock in respect of whom such deduction and withholding were made by
Northwest Bancshares or the Exchange Agent. 3.4. Reservation of Shares.
Northwest Bancshares shall reserve for issuance a sufficient number of shares
of the Northwest Bancshares Common Stock for the purpose of issuing shares of
Northwest Bancshares Common Stock to the MutualFirst Financial stockholders in
accordance with this Article III. 3.5. Treatment of MutualFirst Financial
Stock Options. 3.5.1 At the Effective Time, each MutualFirst Financial Stock
Option then outstanding will vest in full and then cease to represent an
option to purchase shares of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock and will be
converted automatically into the right to receive an amount of cash equal to
the product of (i) the difference (if positive) between (A) $39.89, minus (B)
the exercise price of such MutualFirst Financial Stock Option, multiplied by  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf020.jpg) 

(ii) the number of shares of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock subject to
said MutualFirst Financial Stock Option. 3.5.2 MutualFirst Financial
Disclosure Schedule 3.5 sets forth each MutualFirst Financial Stock Option
outstanding as of the date of this Agreement, which schedule includes the name
of the individual grantee, the date of grant, the vesting schedule, and as to
MutualFirst Financial Stock Options, the exercise price and the expiration

MutualFirst Financial Stock Plan as of the Effective Time. ARTICLE IV

Material Adverse Effect on MutualFirst Financial and the MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, except as otherwise disclosed in any
MutualFirst Financial Report. 4.9. Material Contracts; Leases; Defaults.

than $100,000 annually or for the payment of more than $250,000 over its
remaining term, which is not terminable without cause on 60 days' or less
notice without penalty or payment; or (v) any agreement (other than this
Agreement), contract, arrangement, commitment or understanding (whether
written or oral) that restricts or limits in any material way the conduct of
business by MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary (it
being understood that any non- compete or similar provision shall be deemed
material). 4.9.2. Each real estate lease is freely transferrable to Northwest
Bancshares, and those real estate leases that will require the consent of the
lessor or its agent as a result of the Merger by virtue of the terms of any
such lease, is listed in MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule 4.9.2 and
such schedule identifies the section of any lease that contains a prohibition
or restriction on transfer. Subject to any consents that may be required as a
result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, to its Knowledge,
neither MutualFirst Financial nor any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary is in
default in any material respect under any material contract, agreement,
commitment, arrangement, lease, insurance policy or other instrument to which
it is a party, by which its assets, business, or operations may be bound or
affected, or under which it or its assets, business, or operations receive
benefits, and there has not occurred any event that, with the lapse of time or
the giving of notice or both, would constitute such a default. 4.9.3. True and
correct copies of agreements, contracts, arrangements and instruments referred
to in Section 4.9.1 and 4.9.2 have been made available to Northwest Bancshares
on or before the date hereof, and are listed on MutualFirst Financial
Disclosure Schedule 4.9.1 (which schedule includes the termination date of
such contract and the approximate cost of terminating such contract prior to
the end of its term) and are in full force and effect on the date hereof.
Except as set forth in MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3, no
plan, contract, employment agreement, termination agreement, or similar
agreement or arrangement to which MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiary is a party or under which MutualFirst Financial or any
MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary may be liable contains provisions which
permit an employee or independent contractor to terminate it without cause or
for good reason and continue to accrue future benefits thereunder. Except as
set forth in MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule 4.9.3, no such
agreement, plan, contract, or arrangement (x) provides for acceleration in the
vesting of benefits or payments due thereunder upon the occurrence of a change
in ownership or control of MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary or upon the occurrence of a subsequent event; or (y) requires
MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary to provide a
benefit in the form of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock or determined by
reference to the value of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock. 4.9.4. Except as
set forth in MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule 4.9.4, since December
31, 2018, through and including the date of this Agreement, neither
MutualFirst Financial nor any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary has (i) made
any material change in the credit policies or procedures of MutualFirst
Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary, the effect of which was or
is to make any such policy or procedure less restrictive in any material
respect, (ii) made any material acquisition or disposition of any assets or
properties, or entered into any contract for any such acquisition or
disposition, other than loans and loan commitments in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice; (iii) entered into any lease of real  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf029.jpg) 

or personal property requiring annual payments in excess of $100,000, other
than in connection with foreclosed property or in the ordinary course of
business consistent with past practice, or (iv) changed any accounting
methods, principles or practices of MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiary affecting its assets, liabilities or businesses,
including any reserving, renewal or residual method, practice or policy. 4.10.
Ownership of Property; Insurance Coverage. 4.10.1. MutualFirst Financial and
each MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary have good and, as to real property,
marketable title to all material assets and properties owned by MutualFirst
Financial or each MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary in the conduct of its
businesses, whether such assets and properties are real or personal, tangible
or intangible, including assets and property reflected in the balance sheets
contained in the MutualFirst Financial Financial Statements or acquired
subsequent thereto (except to the extent that such assets and properties have
been disposed of in the ordinary course of business, since the date of such
balance sheets), subject to no material encumbrances, liens, mortgages,
security interests or pledges, except (i) those items which secure liabilities
for public or statutory obligations or any discount with, borrowing from or
other obligations to the FHLB of Indianapolis, inter-bank credit facilities,
reverse repurchase agreements or any transaction by MutualFirst Financial or a
MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary acting in a fiduciary capacity, (ii)
mechanics liens and similar liens for labor, materials, services or supplies
provided for such property and incurred in the ordinary course of business for
amounts not yet delinquent or which are being contested in good faith, and
(iii) statutory liens for amounts not yet delinquent or which are being
contested in good faith. MutualFirst Financial and each MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary, as lessee, have the right under valid and existing leases of real
and personal properties used by MutualFirst Financial and the MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiaries in the conduct of their businesses to occupy or use all
such properties as presently occupied and used by each of them. 4.10.2. With
respect to all material agreements pursuant to which MutualFirst Financial or
any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary has purchased securities subject to an
agreement to resell, if any, MutualFirst Financial or such MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiary, as the case may be, has a lien or security interest
(which to MutualFirst Financial's Knowledge is a valid, perfected first lien)
in the securities or other collateral securing the repurchase agreement, and
the value of such collateral equals or exceeds the amount of the debt secured
thereby. 4.10.3. MutualFirst Financial and each MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary currently maintain insurance considered by MutualFirst Financial to
be reasonable for their respective operations. Neither MutualFirst Financial
nor any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary has received notice from any
insurance carrier that (i) such insurance will be canceled or that coverage
thereunder will be reduced or eliminated, or (ii) premium costs with respect
to such policies of insurance will be substantially increased. There are
presently no material claims pending under such policies of insurance and no
notices have been given by MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary of any material claims under such policies. All such insurance is
valid and enforceable and in full force and effect (other than insurance that
expires in accordance with its terms), and within the last three years
MutualFirst Financial and each MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary have received
each type of insurance coverage for which they have applied and during such
periods have not been denied indemnification for any material 25  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf030.jpg) 

claims submitted under any of their insurance policies. MutualFirst Financial
Disclosure Schedule 4.10.3 identifies all policies of insurance maintained by
MutualFirst Financial and each MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary as well as the
other matters required to be disclosed under this Section 4.10.3. 4.11. Legal
Proceedings. Except as set forth on MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule
4.11, neither MutualFirst Financial nor any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary
is a party to any, and there are no pending or, to the Knowledge of
MutualFirst Financial, threatened, material legal, administrative, arbitration
or other material proceedings, claims (whether asserted or unasserted),
actions or governmental investigations or inquiries of any nature, (i) against
MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary, (ii) to which
MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary's assets are or
may be subject, (iii) challenging the validity or propriety of any of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, or (iv) which could adversely
affect the ability of MutualFirst Financial to perform under this Agreement.
4.12. Compliance With Applicable Law. 4.12.1. To the Knowledge of MutualFirst
Financial, MutualFirst Financial and each MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary is
in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal, state,
local and foreign statutes, laws, regulations, ordinances, rules, judgments,

their employees, including, without limitation, the USA PATRIOT Act, the Equal
Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Community Reinvestment Act
of 1977, the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act, the Bank Secrecy Act and all other
applicable fair lending laws and other laws relating to discriminatory
business practices, and neither MutualFirst Financial nor any MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiary has received any written notice to the contrary. The
Board of Directors of MutualBank has adopted and MutualBank has implemented an
anti-money laundering program that meets the requirements of Sections 352 and
326 of the USA PATRIOT Act and the regulations thereunder and has received no
written notice from any Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator that such
program (i) does not contain adequate and appropriate customer identification
verification procedures, or (ii) has been deemed ineffective. 4.12.2.
MutualFirst Financial and each MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary have all
material permits, licenses, authorizations, orders and approvals of, and has
made all filings, applications and registrations with, all Bank Regulators and
Governmental Entities that are required to permit it to own or lease its
properties and to conduct its business as presently conducted; all such
permits, licenses, certificates of authority, orders and approvals are in full
force and effect and, to the Knowledge of MutualFirst Financial, no suspension
or cancellation of any such permit, license, certificate, order or approval is
threatened or will result from the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, subject to obtaining the Regulatory Approvals.
4.12.3. Except as set forth in MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule
4.12.3, for the period beginning January 1, 2018, neither MutualFirst
Financial nor any MutualFirst 26  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf031.jpg) 

Financial Subsidiary has received any written notification or, to the
Knowledge of MutualFirst Financial, any other communication from any Bank
Regulator: (i) asserting that MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening
to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization which
is material to MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary;
(iii) requiring or threatening to require MutualFirst Financial or any
MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary, or indicating that MutualFirst Financial or
any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary may be required, to enter into a cease
and desist order, agreement or memorandum of understanding or any other
agreement with any federal or state governmental agency or authority which is
charged with the supervision or regulation of banks or engages in the
insurance of bank deposits restricting or limiting, or purporting to restrict
or limit, in any material respect the operations of MutualFirst Financial or
any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary, including without limitation any
restriction on the payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or
limiting, or purporting to direct, restrict or limit, in any material manner
the operations of MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the payment of
dividends (any such notice, communication, memorandum, agreement or order
described in this sentence is hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory
Agreement"). Neither MutualFirst Financial nor any MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary has consented to or entered into any currently effective Regulatory
Agreement. The most recent regulatory rating given to MutualFirst Financial as
to compliance with the CRA is "Satisfactory" or better. 4.13. Employee Benefit
Plans. 4.13.1 MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule 4.13.1 includes a list
of all existing bonus, incentive, deferred compensation, supplemental
executive retirement plans, pension, retirement, profit-sharing, thrift,
savings, employee stock ownership, stock bonus, stock purchase, restricted
stock, stock option, stock appreciation, phantom stock, severance, welfare
benefit plans (including paid time off policies and other material benefit
policies and procedures), split dollar life insurance, fringe benefit plans,
employment, consulting, settlement and change in control agreements and all
other material benefit practices, policies and arrangements maintained by
MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary in which any
employee or former employee, consultant or former consultant or director or
former director participates or to which any such employee, consultant or
director is a party or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits (the
"MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plans"). Neither MutualFirst
Financial nor any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary has any commitment to
create any additional MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan or
to materially modify, change or renew any existing MutualFirst Financial
Compensation and Benefit Plan (any modification or change that increases the
cost of such plans would be deemed material), except as required to maintain
the qualified status thereof or otherwise comply with applicable law.
MutualFirst Financial has made available to Northwest Bancshares true and
correct copies of the MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plans.
4.13.2 Except as set forth in MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule
4.13.2, Each MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and, in all material respects, with applicable law, including, but not
limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the 27  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf032.jpg) 

Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA and any
regulations or rules promulgated thereunder, and all material filings,
disclosures and notices required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and
any other applicable law have been timely made or any interest, fines,
penalties or other impositions for late filings have been paid in full. Each
MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee
pension benefit plan" within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is
intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a
favorable determination or opinion letter from the IRS, and MutualFirst
Financial is not aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely to
result in revocation of any such favorable determination or opinion letter.
There is no material pending or, to the Knowledge of MutualFirst Financial,
threatened action, suit or claim relating to any of the MutualFirst Financial
Compensation and Benefit Plans (other than routine claims for benefits).
Neither MutualFirst Financial nor any of its Subsidiaries has engaged in a
transaction, or omitted to take any action, with respect to any MutualFirst
Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to
subject MutualFirst Financial or any of MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary to a
material unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or
Section 502 of ERISA. 4.13.3. No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been
incurred by MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary with
respect to any MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan which is
subject to Title IV of ERISA ("MutualFirst Financial Pension Plan") currently
or formerly maintained by MutualFirst Financial or any entity which is
considered one employer with MutualFirst Financial under Section 4001(b)(1) of
ERISA or Section 414 of the Code (an "MutualFirst Financial ERISA Affiliate")
since the effective date of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and, to
the Knowledge of MutualFirst Financial, no condition exists that presents a
material risk to MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial ERISA
Affiliate of incurring a liability under such Title. No MutualFirst Financial
Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the
most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof; the fair market value
of the assets of each MutualFirst Financial Pension Plan exceeds the present
value of the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of
ERISA) under such MutualFirst Financial Pension Plan as of the end of the most
recent plan year with respect to the respective MutualFirst Financial Pension
Plan ending prior to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial
assumptions used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such MutualFirst
Financial Pension Plan as of the date hereof; there is not currently pending
with the PBGC any filing with respect to any reportable event under Section
4043 of ERISA nor has any reportable event occurred as to which a filing is
required and has not been made (other than as might be required with respect
to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby). Neither
MutualFirst Financial nor any MutualFirst Financial ERISA Affiliate has
contributed to any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA.
Neither MutualFirst Financial, nor, to the Knowledge of MutualFirst Financial,
any MutualFirst Financial ERISA Affiliate, nor any MutualFirst Financial
Compensation and Benefit Plan, including any MutualFirst Financial Pension
Plan, nor any trust created thereunder, nor, to the Knowledge of MutualFirst
Financial, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction
in connection with which MutualFirst Financial, any MutualFirst Financial
ERISA Affiliate, and any MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan,
including any MutualFirst Financial Pension Plan or any such trust or any
trustee or administrator thereof, 28  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf033.jpg) 

would reasonably be expected to be subject to either a material civil
liability or penalty pursuant to Section 409, 502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or a
material tax imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of the Code. 4.13.4 All material
contributions required to be made under the terms of any MutualFirst Financial
Compensation and Benefit Plan have been timely made, and all anticipated
contributions and funding obligations have been accrued on MutualFirst

Bancshares Subsidiary is not in material compliance with any of the statutes,
regulations or ordinances which such Bank Regulator enforces; (ii) threatening
to revoke any license, franchise, permit or governmental authorization which

any material respect the operations of Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest
Bancshares Subsidiary, including without limitation any restriction on the
payment of dividends; or (iv) directing, restricting or limiting, or

hereinafter referred to as a "Regulatory Agreement"). Neither Northwest
Bancshares nor any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary has consented to or entered
into any currently effective Regulatory Agreement. The most recent regulatory
rating given to Northwest Bank as to compliance with the CRA is
"Satisfactory." 5.12. Employee Benefit Plans. 5.12.1 Northwest Bancshares

Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary in which any
employee or former employee, consultant or former consultant or director or
former director participates or to which any such employee, consultant or
director is a party or is otherwise entitled to receive benefits (each a
"Northwest Bancshares Compensation and Benefit Plan"). Northwest Bancshares
has made available to MutualFirst Financial true and correct copies of the
Northwest Bancshares Compensation and Benefit Plans. 45  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf050.jpg) 

5.12.2 Each Northwest Bancshares Compensation and Benefit Plan has been
operated and administered in all material respects in accordance with its
terms and, in all material respects, with applicable law, including, but not
limited to, ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA, HIPAA and any regulations or rules
promulgated thereunder, and all material filings, disclosures and notices
required by ERISA, the Code, the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act, COBRA and HIPAA and any other applicable law
have been timely made or any interest, fines, penalties or other impositions
for late filings have been paid in full. Each Northwest Bancshares
Compensation and Benefit Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan"
within the meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA and which is intended to be
qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code has received a favorable
determination or opinion letter from the IRS, and Northwest Bancshares is not
aware of any circumstances which are reasonably likely to result in revocation
of any such favorable determination or opinion letter. There is no material
pending or, to the Knowledge of Northwest Bancshares, threatened action, suit
or claim relating to any of the Northwest Bancshares Compensation and Benefit
Plans (other than routine claims for benefits). Neither Northwest Bancshares
nor any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary has engaged in a transaction, or
omitted to take any action, with respect to any Northwest Bancshares
Compensation and Benefit Plan that would reasonably be expected to subject
Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary to a material
unpaid tax or penalty imposed by either Section 4975 of the Code or Section
502 of ERISA. 5.12.3 No liability under Title IV of ERISA has been incurred by
Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary with respect to
any Northwest Bancshares Compensation and Benefit Plan which is subject to
Title IV of ERISA ("Northwest Bancshares Pension Plan") currently or formerly
maintained by Northwest Bancshares or any entity which is considered one
employer with Northwest Bancshares under Section 4001(b)(1) of ERISA or
Section 414 of the Code (an "Northwest Bancshares ERISA Affiliate") since the
effective date of ERISA that has not been satisfied in full, and, to the
Knowledge of Northwest Bancshares, no condition exists that presents a
material risk to Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares ERISA
Affiliate of incurring a liability under such Title. No Northwest Bancshares
Pension Plan had an "accumulated funding deficiency" (as defined in Section
302 of ERISA), whether or not waived, as of the last day of the end of the
most recent plan year ending prior to the date hereof; except as set forth in
Northwest Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 5.12.3, the fair market value of the
assets of each Northwest Bancshares Pension Plan exceeds the present value of
the "benefit liabilities" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(16) of ERISA) under
such Northwest Bancshares Pension Plan as of the end of the most recent plan
year with respect to the respective Northwest Bancshares Pension Plan ending
prior to the date hereof, calculated on the basis of the actuarial assumptions
used in the most recent actuarial valuation for such Northwest Bancshares
Pension Plan as of the date hereof; there is not currently pending with the
PBGC any filing with respect to any reportable event under Section 4043 of
ERISA nor has any reportable event occurred as to which a filing is required
and has not been made (other than as might be required with respect to this
Agreement and the transactions contemplated thereby). Neither Northwest
Bancshares nor any Northwest Bancshares ERISA Affiliate has contributed to any
"multiemployer plan," as defined in Section 3(37) of ERISA. Neither Northwest
Bancshares, nor, to the Knowledge of Northwest Bancshares, any Northwest
Bancshares ERISA Affiliate, nor any Northwest Bancshares Compensation and
Benefit Plan, including any Northwest Bancshares Pension Plan, nor any trust
created thereunder, nor, to the knowledge of Northwest 46  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf051.jpg) 

Bancshares, any trustee or administrator thereof has engaged in a transaction
in connection with which Northwest Bancshares, any Northwest Bancshares ERISA
Affiliate, and any Northwest Bancshares Compensation and Benefit Plan,
including any Northwest Bancshares Pension Plan or any such trust or any
trustee or administrator thereof, would reasonably be expected to be subject
to either a material civil liability or penalty pursuant to Section 409,
502(i) or 502(l) of ERISA or a material tax imposed pursuant to Chapter 43 of
the Code. 5.12.4 All material contributions required to be made under the
terms of any Northwest Bancshares Compensation and Benefit Plan have been
timely made, and all anticipated contributions and funding obligations have
been accrued on Northwest Bancshares' consolidated financial statements to the
extent required by and in accordance with GAAP. Northwest Bancshares and each
of its Subsidiaries has expensed and accrued as a liability the present value
of future benefits under each applicable Northwest Bancshares Compensation and
Benefit Plan for financial reporting purposes in accordance with applicable
laws and GAAP. 5.12.5 Neither Northwest Bancshares nor any Northwest
Bancshares Subsidiary has any obligations to provide retiree health, life
insurance, or disability insurance, or any retiree death benefits under any
Northwest Bancshares Compensation and Benefit Plan, other than benefits
mandated by Section 4980B of the Code. There has been no communication to
employees by Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary that
would reasonably be expected to promise or guarantee such employees retiree
health, life insurance, or disability insurance, or any retiree death
benefits, other than as set forth in Northwest Bancshares Disclosure Schedule
5.12.5. 5.12.6 With respect to each Northwest Bancshares Compensation and
Benefit Plan, if applicable, Northwest Bancshares has provided or made
available upon request to MutualFirst Financial copies of the: (A) trust
instruments and insurance contracts; (B) most recent annual reports or IRS
Form 5500; (C) most recent actuarial reports and financial statements; (D)
most recent summary plan description; (E) most recent determination or opinion
letter issued by the IRS; (F) any Form 5310 or Form 5330 filed with the IRS
within the last three years; and (G) most recent nondiscrimination tests
performed under ERISA and the Code (including 401(k) and 401(m) tests). 5.12.7
All deferred compensation plans, programs or arrangements have (i) been
operated in all material respects in good faith compliance with Section 409A
of the Code, the Treasury Regulations and other guidance issued thereunder and
(ii) since January 1, 2009 (or such later date permitted under applicable
guidance), been in documentary compliance in all material respects with
Section 409A of the Code and IRS regulations and guidance thereunder. All
Northwest Bancshares Options and stock appreciation rights granted by
Northwest Bancshares to any current or former employee or director have been
granted with a per share exercise price or reference price at least equal to
the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date the option or stock
appreciation right was granted (as defined in the relevant Northwest
Bancshares Stock Benefit Plans), within the meaning of Section 409A of the
Code and associated guidance. 47

5.13. Environmental Matters. 5.13.1. To the Knowledge of Northwest Bancshares,
other than as set forth in Northwest Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 5.13,
neither the conduct nor operation of their business nor any condition of any
property currently or previously owned or operated by any of them (including,
without limitation, in a fiduciary or agency capacity), or on which any of
them holds a lien, results or resulted in a violation of any Environmental
Laws that is reasonably likely to impose a material liability (including a
material remediation obligation) upon Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest
Bancshares Subsidiary. To the Knowledge of Northwest Bancshares, no condition
has existed or event has occurred with respect to such property that, with
notice or the passage of time, or both, is reasonably likely to result in any
material liability to Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares
Subsidiary by reason of any Environmental Laws. Neither Northwest Bancshares
nor any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary has received any written notice from
any Person that Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary or
the operation or condition of any property ever owned, operated, or held as
collateral or in a fiduciary capacity by any of them are currently in
violation of or otherwise are alleged to have financial exposure under any
Environmental Laws or relating to Materials of Environmental Concern
(including, but not limited to, responsibility (or potential responsibility)
for the cleanup or other remediation of any Materials of Environmental Concern
at, on, beneath, or originating from any such property) for which a material
liability is reasonably likely to be imposed upon Northwest Bancshares or any
Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary. 5.13.2. There is no suit, written claim,
action, demand, executive or administrative order, directive, investigation or
proceeding pending or, to the Knowledge of Northwest Bancshares, threatened,
before any court, governmental agency or other forum against Northwest
Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary (x) for alleged
noncompliance (including by any predecessor) with, or liability under, any
Environmental Law or (y) relating to the presence of or release into the
environment of any Materials of Environmental Concern (as defined herein),
whether or not occurring at or on a site owned, leased or operated by
Northwest Bancshares or any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary. 5.13.3. To the

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf062.jpg) 

MutualFirst Financial shall not be required to take any action that would
provide access to or to disclose information where such access or disclosure,
in MutualFirst Financial's reasonable judgment, would interfere with the
normal conduct of MutualFirst Financial's business or would violate or
prejudice the rights or business interests or confidences of any customer or
other person or would result in the waiver by it of the privilege protecting
communications between it and any of its counsel or with regard to which
disclosure to Northwest Bancshares is prohibited by law or regulation.
MutualFirst Financial shall provide and shall request its auditors and tax
accountants to provide Northwest Bancshares with such historical financial
information regarding it (and related audit reports and consents) as Northwest
Bancshares may reasonably request for Securities Law disclosure purposes.
Northwest Bancshares and Northwest Bank shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to minimize any interference with MutualFirst Financial's regular
business operations during any such access to MutualFirst Financial's
property, books and records. 6.3.2. MutualFirst Financial shall permit
Northwest Bancshares, at Northwest Bancshares' expense, to cause a "Phase I
Environmental Site Assessment" (the "Phase I") (in conformance with American
Society for Testing Materials ("ASTM") Standard 1527-13, as amended) to be
performed at each branch office and other properties owned by MutualFirst
Financial, and, to the extent permitted by any lease governing MutualFirst
Financial's lease of any branch, at each branch leased by MutualFirst
Financial, at any time prior to the expiration of 30 days from the date of
this Agreement, and to the extent such Phase I recommends performance of a
Phase II Environmental Site Assessment (the "Phase II") prior to the
expiration of 60 days from the date of issuance of the Phase I only to the
extent that the Phase II is within the scope of additional testing recommended
by the Phase I to be performed as a result of a "Recognized Environmental
Condition" (as such term is defined by the ASTM) that was discovered in the
Phase I and provided that as to any Phase II performed at a Branch which
MutualFirst Financial leases the landlord pursuant to the applicable lease has
consented to such Phase II if such consent is necessary pursuant to the lease.
MutualFirst Financial will use its commercially reasonable efforts (at no cost
to MutualFirst Financial) to obtain such landlord consent. Prior to performing
any Phase II, Northwest Bancshares will provide MutualFirst Financial with a
copy of its proposed work plan and Northwest Bancshares will cooperate in good
faith with MutualFirst Financial to address any comments or suggestions made
by MutualFirst Financial regarding the work plan. Northwest Bancshares and its
environmental consultant shall conduct all environmental assessments pursuant
to this Section 6.3.2 at mutually agreeable times and so as to eliminate or
minimize to the greatest extent possible interference with MutualFirst
Financial's operation of its business, and Northwest Bancshares shall maintain
or cause to be maintained reasonably adequate insurance with respect to any
assessment conducted hereunder. Northwest Bancshares shall be required to
restore each property to substantially its pre-assessment condition. All costs
and expenses incurred in connection with any Phase I or Phase II and any
restoration and clean up, shall be borne solely by Northwest Bancshares.
6.3.3. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.3,
in no event will Northwest Bancshares have access to any information that,
based on advice of MutualFirst Financial's counsel, would (a) reasonably be
expected to waive any material legal privilege, (b) result in the disclosure
of any trade secrets of third parties or (c) violate any obligation of
MutualFirst Financial with respect to confidentiality so long as, with respect  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf063.jpg) 

confidentiality, to the extent specifically requested by Northwest Bancshares,
MutualFirst Financial has made commercially reasonable efforts to obtain a
waiver regarding the possible disclosure from the third party to whom it owes
an obligation of confidentiality; it being understood that Northwest
Bancshares will not conduct any environmental sampling without the prior
written consent of MutualFirst Financial, which consent may not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed. All requests made pursuant to this Section
6.3 will be directed to an executive officer of MutualFirst Financial or such
Person or Persons as may be designated by MutualFirst Financial. All
information received pursuant to this Section 6.3 will be governed by the
terms of the Confidentiality Agreement. 6.4. Financial and Other Statements.

Northwest Bancshares copies of each annual, interim or special internal or
external audit of the books of MutualFirst Financial and each MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiary made by MutualFirst Financial, its independent auditors
or other auditors, and copies of all internal control reports submitted to
MutualFirst Financial by auditors in connection with each annual, interim or
special internal or external audit of the books of MutualFirst Financial and
the MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries made by its auditors. 6.4.2.

Department, or any other Governmental Entity or Bank Regulator, except as
legally prohibited thereby. Within 15 days after the end of each month,
MutualFirst Financial will deliver to Northwest Bancshares a list and
description of loans originated by MutualFirst Financial since the prior month
end. 6.4.3. MutualFirst Financial will advise Northwest Bancshares promptly of
the receipt of any examination report of any Bank Regulator with respect to
the condition or activities of MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiary. 6.4.4. With reasonable promptness, MutualFirst Financial
will furnish to Northwest Bancshares such additional financial data that
MutualFirst Financial possesses and as Northwest Bancshares may reasonably
request, including without limitation, detailed monthly financial statements
and loan reports. 6.5. Maintenance of Insurance. MutualFirst Financial will
maintain, and cause the MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries to maintain,
insurance in such amounts as are reasonable to cover such risks as are
customary in relation to the character and location of its properties and the
nature of its business. 6.6. Disclosure Supplements. From time to time prior
to the Effective Time, MutualFirst Financial will promptly supplement or amend
the MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection herewith
with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing, occurring or
known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to be set forth
or described in such 59  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf064.jpg) 

MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule or which is necessary to correct any
information in such MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule which has been
rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No supplement or amendment to such
MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule will have any effect for the purpose
of determining satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Article IX. 6.7.
Consents and Approvals of Third Parties. MutualFirst Financial will use all
commercially reasonable efforts, and will cause each MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary to use all commercially reasonable efforts to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other persons necessary or
desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, MutualFirst
Financial will utilize the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm to
provide assistance in obtaining the stockholder vote required to be obtained
by it hereunder. 6.8. All Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, MutualFirst Financial agrees to use, and agrees to
cause each MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary to use, all commercially
reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and to do, or
cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable
laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 6.9. Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the
event that MutualFirst Financial determines that a condition to its obligation
to complete the Merger cannot be fulfilled and that it will not waive that
condition, it will promptly notify Northwest Bancshares. 6.10. No
Solicitation. 6.10.1. MutualFirst Financial shall not, and shall cause the
MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries and the respective officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, financial advisors, attorneys, accountants,
consultants, affiliates and other agents (collectively, the "MutualFirst
Financial Representatives") not to, directly or indirectly, (i) initiate,
solicit, induce or knowingly encourage, or take any action to facilitate the
making of, any inquiry, offer or proposal which constitutes, or could
reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Proposal; (ii) participate
in any discussions or negotiations regarding any Acquisition Proposal or
furnish, or otherwise afford access, to any Person (other than Northwest
Bancshares) any information or data with respect to MutualFirst Financial or
any of the MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an
Acquisition Proposal; (iii) release any Person from, waive any provisions of,
or fail to enforce any confidentiality agreement or standstill agreement to
which MutualFirst Financial is a party; or (iv) enter into any agreement,
agreement in principle or letter of intent with respect to any Acquisition
Proposal or approve or resolve to approve any Acquisition Proposal or any
agreement, agreement in principle or letter of intent relating to an
Acquisition Proposal. Any violation of the foregoing restrictions by
MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Representative, whether or
not such Representative is so authorized and 60  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf065.jpg) 

whether or not such MutualFirst Financial Representative is purporting to act
on behalf of MutualFirst Financial or otherwise, shall be deemed to be a
breach of this Agreement by MutualFirst Financial. MutualFirst Financial and
MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries shall, and shall cause each of the
MutualFirst Financial Representatives to, immediately cease and cause to be
terminated any and all existing discussions, negotiations, and communications
with any Persons with respect to any existing or potential Acquisition
Proposal. For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Proposal" means any
inquiry, offer or proposal (other than an inquiry, offer or proposal from
Northwest Bancshares), whether or not in writing, contemplating, relating to,
or that could reasonably be expected to lead to, an Acquisition Transaction.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Acquisition Transaction" means (A) any
transaction or series of transactions, including by way of merger,
consolidation, recapitalization, share exchange, liquidation, dissolution or
similar transaction, involving MutualFirst Financial or any of the MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiaries and representing, in the aggregate, twenty-five percent
(25%) or more of the assets of MutualFirst Financial and the MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (B) any transaction pursuant
to which any third party or group acquires or would acquire (whether through
sale, lease or other disposition), directly or indirectly, any assets of
MutualFirst Financial or any of the MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries
representing, in the aggregate, twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
assets of MutualFirst Financial and the MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries on
a consolidated basis; (C) any issuance, sale or other disposition of
(including by way of merger, consolidation, share exchange or any similar
transaction) securities (or options, rights or warrants to purchase or
securities convertible into, such securities) representing twenty-five percent
(25%) or more of the total voting power of MutualFirst Financial or any of the
MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries in the election of directors; (D) any
tender offer or exchange offer that, if consummated, would result in any third
party or group beneficially owning twenty-five percent (25%) or more of the
total voting power of MutualFirst Financial or any of the MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiaries in the election of directors; or (E) any transaction
which is similar in form, substance or purpose to any of the foregoing
transactions, or any combination of the foregoing. 6.10.2. Notwithstanding
Section 6.10.1, MutualFirst Financial may take any of the actions described in
clause (ii) of Section 6.10.1 only if, (i) MutualFirst Financial has received
a bona fide unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal prior to the MutualFirst
Financial Stockholders Meeting that did not result from a breach of this
Section 6.10; (ii) the MutualFirst Financial Board of Directors determines in
good faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of its
outside legal counsel and an independent financial advisor, that such
Acquisition Proposal constitutes or is reasonably likely to lead to a Superior
Proposal; (iii) MutualFirst Financial has provided Northwest Bancshares with
at least one (1) Business Day's prior notice of such determination; and (iv)
prior to furnishing or affording access to any information or data with
respect to MutualFirst Financial or any of the MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiaries or otherwise relating to an Acquisition Proposal, MutualFirst
Financial receives from such Person a confidentiality agreement with terms no
less favorable to MutualFirst Financial than those contained in the
Confidentiality Agreement dated August 26, 2019 (the "Confidentiality
Agreement"). MutualFirst Financial shall promptly provide to Northwest
Bancshares any non-public information regarding MutualFirst Financial or the
MutualFirst Financial Subsidiaries provided to any other Person that was not
previously provided to 61  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf066.jpg) 

Northwest Bancshares, such additional information to be provided no later than
twenty-four (24) hours from provision of such information to such other party.
For purposes of this Agreement, "Superior Proposal" shall mean any bona fide
written proposal (on its most recently amended or modified terms, if amended
or modified) made by a third party to enter into an Acquisition Transaction on
terms that the MutualFirst Financial Board of Directors determines in its good
faith judgment, after consultation with and having considered the advice of
outside legal counsel and a financial advisor (i) would, if consummated,
result in the acquisition of at least fifty percent (50%) of the issued and
outstanding shares of MutualFirst Financial Common Stock or all, or
substantially all, of the assets of MutualFirst Financial and the MutualFirst
Financial Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis; (ii) would result in a
transaction that (A) involves consideration to the holders of the shares of
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock that is more favorable, from a financial
point of view, than the consideration to be paid to the MutualFirst Financial
Stockholders pursuant to this Agreement, considering, among other things, the
nature of the consideration being offered, the percentage of the outstanding
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock proposed to be acquired, and any material
regulatory approvals or other risks associated with the timing of the proposed
transaction beyond or in addition to those specifically contemplated hereby,
and which proposal is not conditioned upon obtaining additional financing and
(B) is, in light of the other terms of such proposal, more favorable to the
MutualFirst Financial Stockholders than the Merger and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement; and (iii) is reasonably likely to be completed
on the terms proposed, in each case taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory and other aspects of the proposal; provided that, for the purposes
of the definition of Superior Proposal, the references to twenty-five percent
(25%) in the definition of Acquisition Proposal shall be fifty percent (50%).
6.10.3. MutualFirst Financial shall promptly (and in any event within twenty-
four (24) hours) notify Northwest Bancshares in writing if any proposals or
offers are received by, any information is requested from, or any negotiations
or discussions are sought to be initiated or continued with, MutualFirst
Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Representatives, in each case in
connection with any Acquisition Proposal, and such notice shall indicate the
name of the Person initiating such discussions or negotiations or making such
proposal, offer or information request and the material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers (and, in the case of written materials relating to
such proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussion,
providing copies of such materials (including e-mails or other electronic
communications). MutualFirst Financial agrees that it shall keep Northwest
Bancshares informed, on a current basis, of the status and terms of any such
proposal, offer, information request, negotiations or discussions (including
any amendments or modifications to such proposal, offer or request). 6.10.4.
Subject to Section 6.10.5, neither the MutualFirst Financial Board of
Directors nor any committee thereof shall (i) withdraw, qualify or modify, or
propose to withdraw, qualify or modify, in a manner adverse to Northwest
Bancshares in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(including the Merger), the MutualFirst Financial Recommendation (as defined
in Section 8.1), or make any statement, filing or release, in connection with
the MutualFirst Financial Stockholders Meeting or otherwise, inconsistent with
the MutualFirst Financial Recommendation (it being understood that taking a
neutral position or no position with respect to an Acquisition Proposal shall
be considered an adverse modification of the MutualFirst Financial
Recommendation); (ii) approve or recommend, or 62  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf067.jpg) 

publicly propose to approve or recommend, any Acquisition Proposal; or (iii)
enter into (or cause MutualFirst Financial or any of the MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiaries to enter into) any letter of intent, agreement in principle,
acquisition agreement or other agreement (A) related to any Acquisition
Transaction (other than a confidentiality agreement entered into in accordance
with the provisions of Section 6.10.2) or (B) requiring MutualFirst Financial
to abandon, terminate or fail to consummate the Merger or any other
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. 6.10.5. Notwithstanding Section
6.10.4, at any time prior to the approval of the Merger at the MutualFirst
Financial Stockholders Meeting, the MutualFirst Financial Board of Directors
may approve or recommend to the stockholders of MutualFirst Financial a
Superior Proposal, withdraw, qualify or modify the MutualFirst Financial
Recommendation in connection therewith (a "MutualFirst Financial Subsequent
Determination") and/or adjourn or postpone the MutualFirst Financial
Stockholders Meeting after the third (3rd) Business Day following Northwest
Bancshares' receipt of a notice (the "Notice of Superior Proposal"), from
MutualFirst Financial advising Northwest Bancshares that the MutualFirst
Financial Board of Directors has decided that a bona fide unsolicited written
Acquisition Proposal that it received (that did not result from a breach of
this Section 6.10) constitutes a Superior Proposal (it being understood that
MutualFirst Financial shall be required to deliver a new Notice of Superior
Proposal in respect of any revised Superior Proposal from such third party or
its affiliates that MutualFirst Financial proposes to accept and the
subsequent notice period shall be two (2) business days) if, but only if, (i)
the MutualFirst Financial Board of Directors has reasonably determined in good
faith, after consultation with and having considered the advice of outside
legal counsel and a financial advisor (as to financial matters), that the
failure to take such actions would more likely than not violate its fiduciary
duties to MutualFirst Financial's stockholders under applicable law, and (ii)
at the end of such three (3) Business Day period or the two (2) Business Day
Period (as the case may be), after taking into account any such adjusted,
modified or amended terms as may have been committed to in writing by
Northwest Bancshares since its receipt of such Notice of Superior Proposal
(provided, however, that Northwest Bancshares shall not have any obligation to
propose any adjustments, modifications or amendments to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement), the MutualFirst Financial Board of Directors
has again in good faith made the determination (A) in clause (i) of this
Section 6.10.5, and (B) that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the changing, qualifying or modifying
of the MutualFirst Financial Recommendation or the making of a MutualFirst
Financial Subsequent Determination by the MutualFirst Financial Board of
Directors shall not change the approval of the MutualFirst Financial Board of
Directors for purposes of causing any applicable "moratorium," "control
share," "fair price," "takeover," "interested stockholder" or similar law to
be inapplicable to this Agreement and the MutualFirst Financial Voting
Agreements and the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby, including the
Merger. 6.11. Board of Directors and Committee Meetings. Following the receipt
of all Regulatory Approvals (without regard to any waiting periods associated
therewith), MutualFirst Financial shall permit no more than two
representatives of Northwest Bancshares or Northwest Bank to attend any
meeting of its Board of Directors or the Executive and Loan Committees thereof
as an observer, subject to the Confidentiality Agreement, provided that
MutualFirst Financial shall not be required to permit the representative to
remain present during any confidential discussion of this Agreement and the
transactions 63  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf068.jpg) 

contemplated hereby or any third party proposal to acquire control of
MutualFirst Financial or during any other matter (i) that the respective Board
of Directors has reasonably determined to be confidential with respect to the
participation of Northwest Bancshares or Northwest Bank, or (ii) that
MutualFirst Financial would not be required to disclose under Section 6.3.3
hereof. 6.12. MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan. If requested by Northwest
Bancshares in writing no later than sixty (60) days prior to the Effective
Time, and subject to the occurrence of the Effective Time, MutualFirst
Financial shall cause to be adopted prior to the Effective Time resolutions of
the Board of Directors of MutualFirst Financial to terminate the MutualFirst
Financial 401(k) Plan and any amendments to such 401(k) Plan necessary to
effect a termination, immediately prior to the Effective Time or cease all
contributions to the MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan maintained or sponsored
by MutualFirst Financial or MutualBank, and to prohibit the entry of new
participants to the MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan as of the day preceding
the Closing Date. In the sole discretion of Northwest Bancshares, the
MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan may be merged into the Northwest Bancshares
401(k) Plan or terminated immediately prior to the Effective Time. The form
and substance of such resolutions and any necessary amendments to the
MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan shall be subject to the review and approval
of Northwest Bancshares, which shall not be unreasonably withheld. MutualFirst
Financial will deliver to Northwest Bancshares an executed copy of such
resolutions and any necessary amendments as soon as practicable following
their adoption by the Board of Directors of MutualFirst Financial and will
fully comply with such resolutions and any necessary amendments. If, in
accordance with this Section 6.12, Northwest Bancshares requests in writing
that MutualFirst Financial freeze entry of new participants into the
MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan, (but does not immediately terminate or
merge the 401(k) Plan), MutualFirst Financial will take such actions as
Northwest Bancshares may reasonably require in furtherance of the assumption
of the MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan by Northwest Bancshares, including,
but not limited to, adopting such amendments to the 401(k) Plan as may be
necessary to effect such assumption. If Northwest Bancshares requests that
MutualFirst Financial terminate the MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan,
MutualFirst Financial will, prior to the Closing Date, submit a request to the
IRS for a favorable determination letter as to the MutualFirst Financial
401(k) Plan's tax-qualified status under Code Section 401(a) on termination.
After the Effective Time, Northwest Bancshares will be responsible for any
procedures necessary for winding down the MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan,
including, without limitation, preparing any further filings with the IRS,
locating plan participants, distributing plan accounts and establishing
individual retirement accounts to receive plan distributions, if necessary. In
addition, as soon as practicable after the receipt of such favorable
determination letter, Northwest Bancshares will allow Continuing Employees to
rollover the assets of their accounts in the MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan
(including any loans and promissory notes) to the Northwest Bancshares 401(k)
Plan and, if necessary, make any amendments to the Northwest Bancshares 401(k)
Plan to effectuate such rollovers. 6.13. Trust Preferred Securities.
MutualFirst Financial will take all necessary steps to permit the outstanding
Junior Subordinated Debentures issued or assumed by MutualFirst Financial in
conjunction with the 64  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf069.jpg) 

sale of $10.0 million of MutualFirst Trust Preferred Securities through the
MutualFirst Trusts to transfer to Northwest Bancshares at the Effective Time.
6.14. Rule 16b-3. MutualFirst Financial will take all steps, as may be
necessary or appropriate, to cause the transactions contemplated by Article
III and any other dispositions of equity securities of MutualFirst Financial
(including derivative securities) or acquisitions of equity securities of
Northwest Bancshares in connection with the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement to be exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under
the Exchange Act. 6.15. WARN Act Cooperation. To the extent applicable,
MutualFirst Financial and MutualBank will take all such actions as may be
required or as Northwest Bancshares may reasonably request in order to fully
and timely comply with the requirements of the federal Worker Adjustment and
Retraining Notification Act of 1988 ("WARN Act"), including providing notices
to MutualFirst Financial's and MutualBank's employees. ARTICLE VII COVENANTS
OF NORTHWEST BANCSHARES 7.1. Conduct of Business. During the period from the
date of this Agreement to the Effective Time, Northwest Bancshares will, and
it will cause each Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary to, use commercially
reasonable efforts to preserve intact its business organization and assets and
maintain its rights and franchises; and voluntarily take no action that would:
(i) adversely affect the ability of the parties to obtain the Regulatory
Approvals or materially increase the period of time necessary to obtain such
approvals; (ii) materially adversely affect its ability to perform its
covenants and agreements under this Agreement; or (iii) result in the
representations and warranties contained in Article V of this Agreement not
being true and correct on the date of this Agreement or at any future date on
or prior to the Closing Date or in any of the conditions set forth in Article
IX hereof not being satisfied. 7.2. Disclosure Supplements. From time to time
prior to the Effective Time, Northwest Bancshares will promptly supplement or
amend the Northwest Bancshares Disclosure Schedule delivered in connection
herewith with respect to any matter hereafter arising which, if existing,
occurring or known at the date of this Agreement, would have been required to
be set forth or described in such Northwest Bancshares Disclosure Schedule or
which is necessary to correct any information in such Northwest Bancshares
Disclosure Schedule which has been rendered materially inaccurate thereby. No
supplement or amendment to such Northwest Bancshares Disclosure Schedule will
have any effect for the purpose of determining satisfaction of the conditions
set forth in Article IX. 65  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf070.jpg) 

7.3. Consents and Approvals of Third Parties. Northwest Bancshares will use
all commercially reasonable efforts, and will cause each Northwest Bancshares
Subsidiary to use all commercially reasonable efforts, to obtain as soon as
practicable all consents and approvals of any other persons necessary or
desirable for the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Northwest
Bancshares will use the services of a professional proxy soliciting firm to
provide assistance in obtaining the stockholder vote required to be obtained
by it hereunder. 7.4. All Reasonable Efforts. Subject to the terms and
conditions herein provided, Northwest Bancshares agrees to use all
commercially reasonable efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all action and
to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable under
applicable laws and regulations to consummate and make effective the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Northwest Bancshares will not,
and will not permit any Northwest Bancshares Subsidiary to, take any action or
knowingly fail to take any reasonable action that would, or would be
reasonably likely to, prevent, impede, or delay the Merger from qualifying as
a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code. 7.5.
Failure to Fulfill Conditions. In the event that Northwest Bancshares
determines that a condition to its obligation to complete the Merger cannot be
fulfilled and that it will not waive that condition, it will promptly notify
MutualFirst Financial. 7.6. Employee Benefits; Advisory Board. 7.6.1 Except as
set forth in a MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule or as otherwise
provided in Section 6.12 or this Section 7.6.1 of this Agreement, as of or
after the Effective Time, and at Northwest Bancshares' election and subject to
the requirements of the Code, the MutualFirst Financial Compensation and
Benefit Plans may continue to be maintained separately, consolidated, frozen
or terminated. If reasonably requested by Northwest Bancshares in writing not
later than ten (10) days before the Closing Date and provided that Northwest
Bancshares has indicated in writing that the conditions to its obligations set
forth in Section 9.2 hereof have been satisfied or waived, MutualFirst
Financial will take such steps within its power to effectuate a freeze or
termination of any MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan as of
the Effective Time (other than the MutualFirst Financial Pension Plan),
provided that the MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan can be
frozen or terminated within such period under the terms of such plan and any
applicable laws and regulations. In the event of a consolidation of any or all
of such plans or in the event of termination of any MutualFirst Financial
Compensation and Benefit Plan, except as otherwise set forth in this Section
7.6.1, employees of MutualFirst Financial or MutualBank who continue as
employees of Northwest Bancshares or Northwest Bank after the Effective Time
("Continuing Employees") will be eligible to participate in any Northwest Bank
employee plan of similar character immediately upon such consolidation or as
of the first entry date coincident with or immediately following 66  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf071.jpg) 

such termination. Continuing Employees will receive credit for service with
MutualFirst Financial or MutualBank for purposes of determining eligibility
and vesting but not for purposes of accruing or computing benefits under: (i)
any similar existing Northwest Bancshares benefit plan except that Continuing
Employees, in eligible roles for the following benefits, will be treated as
new employees under the Northwest Bancshares Pension Plan, the Northwest Bank
holiday bonus plan, Northwest Bank's management bonus plan and all other
Northwest Bancshares Stock Benefit Plans, or (ii) any new Northwest Bancshares
benefit plan in which Continuing Employees or their dependents would be
eligible to enroll. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Continuing Employees will
receive credit for years of service with MutualFirst Financial and any
MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary for purposes of determining leave days under
Northwest Bank's paid time off ("PTO") leave policy and for calculation of
severance benefits if later terminated by Northwest Bank. Such service will
also apply for purposes of satisfying any waiting periods, actively-at-work
requirements and evidence of insurability requirements. Continuing Employees
will have no rights in Northwest Bank's terminated post-retirement health
benefit plan. This Agreement shall not be construed to limit the ability of
Northwest Bancshares or Northwest Bank to terminate the employment of any
MutualFirst Financial employee or the employment of any MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary or to review any MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit
Plan from time to time and to make such changes (including terminating any
such plan) as they deem appropriate. 7.6.2 Northwest Bancshares will honor the
contractual terms of all employment, consulting, change in control, and
severance agreements and MutualFirst Financial Non-Qualified Agreements, if
any, listed on MutualFirst Financial Disclosure Schedule 4.13.13, except to
the extent any such agreement is superseded or terminated as of, or following,
the Effective Time of the Bank Merger, or as otherwise set forth herein.
Northwest Bancshares, or at Northwest Bancshares request, MutualFirst
Financial or MutualBank, will provide to the individuals listed in MutualFirst
Financial Disclosure Schedule 7.6.2 who remain employees of MutualFirst
Financial or MutualBank until the Effective Time, payment of the amounts that
would be payable under such employees employment or change in control or
severance agreement as if such individual's employment was terminated at the
Effective Time, even if such individual remains employed by Northwest
Bancshares or Northwest Bank following the Effective Time; provided, however
that to the extent that any such payment, when aggregated with any other
payments contingent on a change in control of MutualFirst Financial or
MutualBank would constitute a "parachute payment" (as such term is defined in
Section 280G of the Code), such payments and/or benefits will be reduced to
the extent necessary to avoid penalties under Sections 280G and 4999 of the
Code. The estimated amounts payable under such employment and change in
control agreements are set forth in the MutualFirst Financial Disclosure
Schedule 4.13.13. Contemporaneously with the execution of this Agreement,
Northwest Bancshares and/or Northwest Bank will enter into employment
agreements with executives David W. Heeter, Christopher L. Caldwell and
Christopher D. Cook, in the form set forth in Disclosure Schedule 7.6.2 and
effective as of the Effective Time, subject to cancellation or termination of
their existing employment agreements with MutualFirst Financial. To the extent
any payments are made at Closing under any MutualFirst Financial employment
agreements and/or change in control agreements in connection with such
agreements cancellation or termination, without the requirement of a
separation from service, such executive shall be required to enter into a
settlement agreement substantially in the form attached at Northwest
Bancshares Disclosure Schedule 7.6.2 contemporaneously with the execution of  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf072.jpg) 

Agreement. Northwest Bancshares shall consider whether to offer any Continuing
Employee an employment or change in control agreement or to offer an employee
whose employment is terminated in connection with the Merger a consulting
agreement or to request that an employee enter into a non-compete and/or non-
solicitation agreement, for appropriate consideration, if applicable. 7.6.3
Any employee of MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary
who does not have an employment agreement, change in control agreement or
severance agreement and who is not eligible for and entitled to a severance
benefit under any other severance plan or program maintained by or with
MutualFirst Financial or its Subsidiaries, who is not offered employment with
Northwest Bancshares or one of its Subsidiaries or whose employment is
terminated by Northwest Bancshares or one of its Subsidiaries (other than for
cause); including because such employee is not offered employment or is
terminated as a result of customary background screening by Northwest Bank at
or within twelve (12) months after the Closing Date, will (i) receive a cash
payment equal to two weeks of such employee's current base salary (or average
hourly wage over a two (2) week period) for each year of service with
MutualFirst Financial, MutualBank or any predecessor to MutualFirst Financial
or MutualBank, with a minimum payment of four (4) weeks base pay and a maximum
of twenty-six (26) weeks base pay payable to each such employee, and (ii) be
entitled to continue to receive the same or substantially similar medical
insurance coverage to which such employee and his or her eligible dependents
were enrolled as of the Closing Date (on the basis of the same employee
contribution rate) for a period equal to the number of weeks' pay to which
such employee is entitled pursuant to clause (i) hereof, subject to the
execution of a release of claims by such employee in a form satisfactory to
Northwest Bancshares. Notwithstanding the forgoing, at the written direction
of Northwest Bancshares to MutualFirst Financial prior to the Closing,
MutualFirst Financial will pay such cash severance benefit to any MutualFirst
Financial employee or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary employee whose
employment is terminated at Closing. Nothing set forth herein shall be
construed to limit the period of continued health care coverage that such
employee would be entitled under COBRA. 7.6.4 Immediately prior to the
Closing, MutualFirst Financial will pay the cash value of any accrued but
unused vacation and sick leave to its employees, whether such employees are
terminated in connection with the Merger or are Continuing Employees. 7.6.5 In
the event of any termination of any MutualFirst Financial health plan or
consolidation of any such plan with any Northwest Bancshares or Northwest Bank
health plan, Northwest Bancshares will make available to Continuing Employees
and their eligible dependents employer-provided health coverage on the same
basis as it provides such coverage to Northwest Bancshares employees. Unless a
Continuing Employee affirmatively terminates coverage under a MutualFirst
Financial health plan prior to the time that such Continuing Employee becomes
eligible to participate in the Northwest Bancshares health plan, no coverage
of any of the Continuing Employees or their dependents will terminate under
any of the MutualFirst Financial health plans prior to the time such
Continuing Employees and their dependents become eligible to participate in
the health plans, programs and benefits common to all employees of Northwest
Bancshares and their dependents. In the event of a termination or
consolidation of any MutualFirst Financial health plan, terminated MutualFirst
Financial 68  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf073.jpg) 

employees and qualified beneficiaries will have the right to continued
coverage under group health plans of Northwest Bancshares in accordance with
COBRA. 7.6.6 Northwest Bancshares agrees to take all such actions related to
the MutualFirst Financial 401(k) Plan as stated in Section 6.12 of this
Agreement. 7.6.7 Effective as of the Closing Date, Northwest Bancshares will
establish the MutualFirst Financial Advisory Board and each person who
currently serves on the MutualFirst Financial Board of Directors (excluding
the MutualFirst Financial board member who will serve on the Northwest
Bancshares and Northwest Bank Boards of Directors) shall be offered membership
on the MutualFirst Financial Advisory Board. Members of the MutualFirst
Financial Advisory Board shall serve for an initial term of one (1) year from
the Effective Time of the Merger. The annual compensation of the MutualFirst
Financial Advisory Board shall not exceed the customary amount of compensation
generally provided by Northwest Bancshares to members of its other similar
advisory boards. 7.6.8 Retention Pool/Stay Bonus. Northwest Bancshares will
establish a retention pool/stay bonus providing for retention/stay bonuses to
be paid to Continuing Employees who remain employed with Northwest Bancshares
or Northwest Bank after the Closing (other than employees who are subject to
employment contracts or other contracts providing for severance) for a period
specified by Northwest Bancshares or Northwest Bank. The amount and payment
date of the retention/stay bonus for each such employee will be determined by
Northwest Bancshares in consultation with MutualFirst Financial. 7.6.9
Northwest Bancshares will use commercially reasonable efforts to (i) waive all
limitations as to preexisting conditions, exclusions and waiting periods with
respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to the
Continuing Employees and their family members under the health and welfare
plans of Northwest Bancshares and its Affiliates (each a "Northwest Bancshares
Welfare Plan") to the extent waived or otherwise satisfied under the
applicable corresponding MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plan
immediately prior to the Closing Date and (ii) provide each Continuing
Employee and his or her eligible dependents with credit under the Northwest
Bancshares Welfare Plans for any co-payments and deductibles paid under
corresponding MutualFirst Financial Compensation and Benefit Plans prior to
the Closing Date in the calendar year in which the Closing Date occurs for
purposes of satisfying any applicable deductible or out of-pocket requirements
under any Northwest Bancshares Welfare Plans in which the Continuing Employees
are eligible to participate after the Closing Date. 7.7. Directors and
Officers Indemnification and Insurance. 7.7.1. Northwest Bancshares will
maintain, or will cause Northwest Bank to maintain, in effect for six (6)
years following the Effective Time, the current directors' and officers'
liability insurance policies maintained by MutualFirst Financial (provided,
that Northwest Bancshares may substitute therefor policies of at least the
same coverage containing terms and conditions which are not materially less
favorable) with respect to matters occurring prior to the Effective Time;
provided, however, that in no event will Northwest Bancshares be required to
expend pursuant to this Section 7.7.1, in the aggregate for such policy or
policies, 69  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf074.jpg) 

more than 150% of the annual cost currently expended by MutualFirst Financial
with respect to such insurance (the "Maximum Amount"); provided, further, that
if the amount of the annual premiums necessary to maintain or procure such
insurance coverage exceeds the Maximum Amount, Northwest Bancshares will
maintain the most advantageous policies of directors' and officers' insurance
obtainable for an annual premium equal to the Maximum Amount. In connection
with the foregoing, MutualFirst Financial agrees in order for Northwest
Bancshares to fulfill its agreement to provide directors and officers
liability insurance policies for six (6) years to provide such insurer or
substitute insurer with such representations as such insurer may request with
respect to the reporting of any prior claims. 7.7.2. In addition to Section
7.7.1, after the Effective Time, Northwest Bancshares will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless each person who is now, or who has been at any time before
the date hereof or who becomes before the Effective Time, an officer or
director of MutualFirst Financial or a MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary
(including, solely to the extent required by the Agreement and Plan of Merger,
dated as of October 4, 2017, by and between MutualFirst Financial and
Universal Bancorp, the "Universal Indemnified Parties", as defined in the
Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of October 4, 2017, by and between the
Universal Indemnified Parties, with such indemnification expiring on February
28, 2024) (the "Indemnified Parties") against all losses, claims, damages,
costs, expenses (including attorneys' fees), liabilities or judgments or
amounts that are paid in settlement (which settlement shall require the prior
written consent of Northwest Bancshares, which consent will not be
unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed) of or in connection with any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, or
administrative (each a "Claim"), in which an Indemnified Party is, or is
threatened to be made, a party or witness in whole or in part on or arising in
whole or in part out of the fact that such person is or was a director,
officer or employee of MutualFirst Financial or a MutualFirst Financial
Subsidiary if such Claim pertains to any matter of fact arising, existing or
occurring before the Effective Time (including, without limitation, the Merger
and the other transactions contemplated hereby), regardless of whether such
Claim is asserted or claimed before, or after, the Effective Time (the
"Indemnified Liabilities"), to the fullest extent as would have been permitted
by MutualFirst Financial under MutualFirst Financial's Articles of
Incorporation and Bylaws, to the extent not prohibited by applicable law.
Northwest Bancshares will pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of
any such action or proceeding to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law (to the extent not prohibited by federal law) upon
receipt of an undertaking to repay such advance payments if the Indemnified
Party is adjudicated or determined to be not entitled to indemnification in
the manner set forth below. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim
indemnification under this Section 7.7.2 upon learning of any Claim, shall
notify Northwest Bancshares (but the failure so to notify Northwest Bancshares
will not relieve Northwest Bancshares from any liability which it may have
under this Section 7.7.2, except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices Northwest Bancshares) and shall deliver to Northwest Bancshares the
undertaking referred to in the previous sentence. In the event of any such
Claim (whether arising before or after the Effective Time) (1) Northwest
Bancshares will have the right to assume the defense thereof (in which event
the Indemnified Parties will cooperate in the defense of any such matter) and
upon such assumption Northwest Bancshares will not be liable to any
Indemnified Party for any legal expenses of other counsel or any other
expenses subsequently incurred by any Indemnified Party in connection with the
defense thereof, except that if Northwest Bancshares elects not to assume such
defense, or counsel for the 70  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf075.jpg) 

Indemnified Parties reasonably advises the Indemnified Parties that there are
or may be (whether or not any have yet actually arisen) issues which raise
conflicts of interest between Northwest Bancshares and the Indemnified
Parties, the Indemnified Parties may retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
them, and Northwest Bancshares will pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
such counsel for the Indemnified Parties, (2) except to the extent otherwise
required due to conflicts of interest, Northwest Bancshares shall be obligated
pursuant to this paragraph to pay for only one firm or counsel for all
Indemnified Parties and the reasonable fees and expenses of such law firm
shall be paid promptly as statements are received unless there is a conflict
of interest that necessitates more than one law firm, (3) Northwest Bancshares
shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its prior written
consent (which consent will not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or
delayed), and (4) no Indemnified Party will be entitled to indemnification
hereunder with respect to a matter as to which (x) he has been adjudicated in
any proceeding not to have acted in good faith and in a manner he reasonably
believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of MutualFirst
Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary, or (y) in the event that a
proceeding is compromised or settled so as to impose any liability or
obligation upon an Indemnified Party, if there is a determination that with
respect to said matter said Indemnified Party did not act in good faith and in
a manner he reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of MutualFirst Financial or any MutualFirst Financial Subsidiary. If
Northwest Bancshares or any of its successors or assigns consolidates with or
merges into any other entity and is not the continuing or surviving entity of
such consolidation or merger or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets to any other entity, then and in each case, proper provision will be
made so that the successors and assigns of Northwest Bancshares assume the
obligations set forth in this Section 7.7. 7.7.3. The obligations of Northwest
Bancshares provided under this Section 7.7 are intended to be enforceable
against Northwest Bancshares directly by the Indemnified Parties and shall be
binding on all respective successors and permitted assigns of Northwest
Bancshares. Northwest Bancshares will pay all reasonable costs, including
attorneys' fees, as incurred and in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation by any Indemnified Party in
successfully enforcing the indemnity and other obligations provided for in
this Section 7.7 to the fullest extent permitted under applicable law;
provided, however such payment of costs shall be immediately reimbursed to
Northwest Bancshares by such Indemnified Party if the Indemnified Party is not
entitled to the indemnification or other obligations provided for in this
Section 7.7. The rights of each Indemnified Party hereunder are in addition to
any other rights such Indemnified Party may have under applicable law. 7.8.
Stock Listing. Northwest Bancshares agrees to list on the Nasdaq (or such
other national securities exchange on which the shares of the Northwest
Bancshares Common Stock shall be listed as of the Closing Date), subject to
official notice of issuance, the shares of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock
to be issued in the Merger. 7.9. Stock and Cash Reserve. Northwest Bancshares

declarations of trust related thereto. 7.11. Rule 16b-3. Northwest Bancshares
will take all steps, as may be necessary or appropriate, to cause the
transactions contemplated by Article III and any other dispositions of equity
securities of MutualFirst Financial (including derivative securities) or
acquisitions of equity securities of Northwest Bancshares in connection with
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be
exempt under Rule 16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act. 7.12. WARN Act
Compliance. In the event that Northwest Bank terminates or lays off a
sufficient number of employees following the Effective Date, or MutualFirst
Financial or Mutual First Bank terminates or lays off a sufficient number of
employees prior to the Effective Date at the request of Northwest Bancshares
or Northwest Bank that collectively would trigger a notice requirement under
the WARN Act or any similar applicable Law with respect to (i) MutualFirst
Financial Employees employed during the 90-day period preceding the Effective
Time, and (ii) MutualFirst Financial Employees employed by Northwest
Bancshares or Northwest Bank during the 90 day period after the Effective

Act. MutualFirst Financial and MutualBank will, pursuant to Section 6.15
hereof, cooperate in providing information reasonably requested by Northwest

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf084.jpg) 

Bancshares Stockholders Meeting (as it may be adjourned and reconvened) and
such vote shall not have been sufficient to approve the issuance of the
Northwest Bancshares Common Stock in connection with the Merger (but only to
the extent such vote is required by Nasdaq rules); 11.1.6. By either party if
(i) final action has been taken by a Bank Regulator whose approval is required
in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby,
which final action (x) has become unappealable and (y) does not approve this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby, (ii) any Bank Regulator
whose approval or nonobjection is required in connection with this Agreement
and the transactions contemplated hereby has stated in writing that it will
not issue the required approval or nonobjection, or (iii) any court of
competent jurisdiction or other governmental authority shall have issued an
order, decree, ruling or taken any other action restraining, enjoining or
otherwise prohibiting the Merger and such order, decree, ruling or other
action shall have become final and unappealable; 11.1.7. By the Board of
Directors of either party (provided, that the terminating party is not then in
material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or other agreement
contained herein) in the event that any of the conditions precedent to the
obligations of such party to consummate the Merger cannot be satisfied or
fulfilled by the date specified in Section 11.1.4 of this Agreement; 11.1.8.
By Northwest Bancshares, if the MutualFirst Financial Board of Directors does
not publicly recommend in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus for the MutualFirst
Financial Stockholders Meeting that the MutualFirst Financial Stockholders
approve and adopt this Agreement or if, after making the MutualFirst Financial
Recommendation in the Proxy Statement-Prospectus for the MutualFirst Financial
Stockholders Meeting, the MutualFirst Financial Board of Directors makes a
MutualFirst Financial Subsequent Determination; 11.1.9. By Northwest
Bancshares if MutualFirst Financial has received a Superior Proposal and the
Board of Directors of MutualFirst Financial has entered into an acquisition
agreement with respect to the Superior Proposal, terminated this Agreement,
withdrawn its recommendation of this Agreement, has failed to make such
recommendation or has modified or qualified its recommendation in a manner
adverse to Northwest Bancshares; 11.1.10. By MutualFirst Financial, at any
time prior to the adoption and approval of this Agreement by MutualFirst
Financial's stockholders, to enter into an agreement with respect to a
Superior Proposal, but only if (i) MutualFirst Financial's Board of Directors
has determined in good faith based on the advice of legal counsel that failure
to take such action would, more likely than not, cause the Board of Directors
to violate its fiduciary duties under applicable law, and (ii) MutualFirst
Financial has complied with and has not breached its obligations under Section
6.10; or 11.1.11. By MutualFirst Financial, at any time during the five-day
period commencing with the Determination Date, if both of the following
conditions are satisfied: (i) The number obtained by dividing the Average
Closing Price by the Starting Price (as defined below) (the "Purchaser Ratio")
shall be less than 0.80; and 80  

  

 ![](ex21mergeragreementexecf085.jpg) 

(ii) (x) the Purchaser Ratio shall be less than (y) the number obtained by
dividing the Final Index Price by the Index Price on the Starting Date (each
as defined below) and subtracting 0.20 from the quotient in this clause (ii)
(y) (such number in this clause (ii) (y) being referred to herein as the
"Index Ratio"); subject, however, to the following three sentences. If
MutualFirst Financial elects to exercise its termination right pursuant to
this Section 11.1.11, it shall give written notice to Northwest Bancshares
(provided that such notice of election to terminate may be withdrawn at any
time within the aforementioned five-day period). During the five-day period
commencing with its receipt of such notice, Northwest Bancshares shall have
the option to increase the consideration to be received by the holders of
MutualFirst Financial Common Stock hereunder, by adjusting the Exchange Ratio
(calculated to the nearest one one-thousandth) to equal the lesser of (x) a
number (rounded to the nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A)
the product of the Starting Price, 0.80 and the Exchange Ratio (as then in
effect) by (B) the Average Closing Price and (y) a number (rounded to the
nearest one one-thousandth) obtained by dividing (A) the product of the Index
Ratio and the Exchange Ratio (as then in effect) by (B) the Purchaser Ratio;
provided, however, that any such increase in the Exchange Ratio pursuant this
Section 11.1.11 shall be paid to the holders of MutualFirst Financial Common
Stock in cash, determined on a per share basis by multiplying the increase in
the Exchange Ratio by the Average Closing Price. If Northwest Bancshares so
elects within such five-day period, it shall give prompt written notice to
MutualFirst Financial of such election and the revised Exchange Ratio,
whereupon no termination shall have occurred pursuant to this Section 11.1.11
and this Agreement shall remain in effect in accordance with its terms (except
as the Exchange Ratio shall have been so modified). For purposes of this
Section 11.1.11 the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
"Average Closing Price" means the average closing price of Northwest
Bancshares Common Stock as reported on the Nasdaq for the twenty (20)
consecutive trading days ending on the trading day immediately prior to the
Determination Date. "Determination Date" shall mean the 20th day prior to the
Closing Date, provided that if shares of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock are
not actually traded on the Nasdaq on such day, the Determination Date shall be
the immediately preceding day to the 20th day prior to the Closing Date on
which shares of Northwest Bancshares Common Stock actually trade on The Nasdaq
Stock Market, LLC. "Final Index Price" shall mean the average of the Index
Prices for the 20 consecutive full trading days ending on the Determination
Date. "Index Price" shall mean the closing price on such date of the NASDAQ
Bank Index. "Starting Date" shall mean the last trading day immediately

"Starting Price" shall mean the closing price of a share of Northwest
Bancshares Common Stock on the Nasdaq (as reported in The Wall Street Journal,

Agreement pursuant to any provision of Section 11.1, this Agreement shall
forthwith become void and have no further force, except that the provisions of
Sections 11.2, 12.1, 12.2, 12.4, 12.5, 12.6, 12.9, 12.10, 12.12 and any other
Section which, by its terms, relates to post-termination rights or
obligations, shall survive such termination of this Agreement and remain in
full force and effect. 11.2.2. If this Agreement is terminated, expenses and
damages of the parties hereto shall be determined as follows: (A) Except as
provided below or as otherwise specifically set forth in this Agreement,
whether or not the Merger is consummated, all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement shall be paid by the party incurring such expenses. (B) In the event
of a termination of this Agreement because of a Willful Breach of any
representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement,
the breaching party shall remain liable for any and all damages, costs and
expenses, including all reasonable attorneys' fees, sustained or incurred by
the non- breaching party as a result thereof or in connection therewith or
with respect to the enforcement of its rights hereunder. Moreover, no party
shall be relieved of liability for fraud. (C) As a condition of Northwest
Bancshares' willingness, and in order to induce Northwest Bancshares to enter
into this Agreement, and to reimburse Northwest Bancshares for incurring the
costs and expenses related to entering into this Agreement and consummating
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, MutualFirst Financial hereby
agrees to pay Northwest Bancshares, and Northwest Bancshares shall be entitled
to payment of, a fee of $11.0 million (the "Northwest Bancshares Fee"), within
three business days after written demand for payment is made by Northwest
Bancshares, following the occurrence of any of the events set forth below: (i)
MutualFirst Financial terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections 11.1.10
or Northwest Bancshares terminates this Agreement pursuant to Sections 11.1.8
or 11.1.9; or (ii) The entering into a definitive agreement by MutualFirst
Financial relating to an Acquisition Proposal or the consummation of an
Acquisition Proposal involving MutualFirst Financial within twelve (12) months
after the occurrence of any of the following: (i) the termination of the
Agreement by Northwest Bancshares pursuant to Section 11.1.2 or 11.1.3 because
of a Willful Breach (as defined below) by MutualFirst Financial or any
MutualFirst Financial 82

Subsidiary; or (ii) the failure of the stockholders of MutualFirst Financial
to approve this Agreement after the occurrence of an Acquisition Proposal. (D)

Bancshares against MutualFirst Financial and its Subsidiaries and their
respective officers and directors with respect to a termination listed under
Section 11.2.2(C)(i) or (ii). (E) Northwest Bancshares shall be reimbursed by
MutualFirst Financial for all fees, costs and other expenses incurred by
Northwest Bancshares in connection with enforcing its right to the Northwest
Bancshares Fee. "Willful Breach" shall mean a material breach that is a
consequence of an act undertaken by a party with the knowledge that the taking
of the act would, or under circumstances in which the party should reasonably
have known would, be expected to cause a breach of this Agreement. 11.3.

hereto by action of their respective Boards of Directors, may (a) amend this
Agreement, (b) extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations
or other acts of any other party hereto, (c) waive any inaccuracies in the
representations and warranties contained herein or in any document delivered
pursuant hereto, or (d) waive compliance with any of the agreements or

be, without further approval of such stockholders, any amendment of this
Agreement which reduces the amount or value, or changes the form of, the
Merger Consideration to be delivered to MutualFirst Financial's stockholders
pursuant to this Agreement. This Agreement may not be amended except by an
instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto. Any
agreement on the part of a party hereto to any extension or waiver shall be
valid only if set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of such
party, but such waiver or failure to insist on strict compliance with such
obligation, covenant, agreement or condition shall not operate as a waiver of,
or estoppel with respect to, any subsequent or other failure. Any termination
of this Agreement pursuant to Article XI may only be effected upon a vote of a
majority of the entire Board of Directors of the terminating party. ARTICLE
