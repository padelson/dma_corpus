Shares (which form a portion of the Founder Stock Consideration) shall be
subject to additional terms of forfeiture as set forth in this Agreement.
The Holdback Shares shall be available to compensate the Indemnified Parties

for which they are entitled to recovery pursuant to Article 9, all as set
forth in Section 9.5.

2.4 _Escrow Fund, Net Working Capital Expense Fund and Expense Fund_.

 

(a) At the Closing, Buyer, the Sellers Representative and the Escrow Agent
shall enter into an escrow agreement in substantially the form attached
hereto as _Exhibit K_ (the " _Escrow Agreement_ "). The Cash Escrow Deposit,
together with any interest or dividends accrued thereon, is sometimes referred
to herein collectively as the " _Escrow Fund_ _._ " The Escrow Fund shall be
available to satisfy any indemnity claims made by the Indemnified Parties
prior to the date that is fifteen (15) months after the Closing Date (the "
_End Date_ ") pursuant to Section 9\. The Sellers shall be treated for tax
purposes as the owners of the Escrow Fund and all interest and earnings earned
by the Cash Escrow Deposit.

 

(b) The Founder shall be registered as the owner of the Holdback Shares and
will have all rights with respect to the Holdback Shares attributable to the
Founder (including the right to vote such shares and the right to be paid
dividends with respect to such shares, _provided_ , _however_ , that non-
taxable stock dividends, if any, shall become Holdback Shares), except (i)
the right of possession thereof and (ii) the right to sell, assign, pledge,
hypothecate or otherwise dispose of or encumber such shares or any interest
therein.

 

(c) Promptly following the final determination of any claim made by any
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9, Buyer and the Sellers
Representative (subject to Section 9.2(f)) shall direct the Escrow Agent to
distribute from the Escrow Fund an amount equal to the amount finally
determined to be payable to such Indemnified Party in connection with such
claim, if any, in each case in accordance with, and subject to the conditions
set forth in, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement. No later than ten (10)
days following the End Date, the Escrow Agent shall distribute any remaining
portion of the Escrow Fund, in accordance with, and subject to the conditions
of, this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, to the Paying Agent for
distribution to each Indemnifying Party, which shall be allocated as follows:

 



-7- (i) if the amount of the Founders share of the remaining Escrow Fund
(not including interest or dividends accrued thereon) is less than the
Founders Cash Escrow Contribution, then the remaining amount shall be
allocated to the Outside Sellers in accordance with their respective pro rata
shares (based on the aggregate Outside Consideration received by each Outside

negotiate in good faith to mutually agree upon acceptable estimates, and the
Company shall consider in good faith any proposed comments or changes that
Buyer may reasonably suggest; _provided_ , _however_ , that neither the
Companys failure to include any changes proposed by Buyer, nor the

Representative a statement (the " _Buyer Post-Closing Statement_ ") setting
forth in reasonable detail Buyers calculation of (i) the Closing Working
Capital Amount and (ii) the Closing Transaction Expenses. If the Buyer does
not give Sellers Representative a Buyer Post-Closing Statement within such

Amount and (ii) the Closing Transaction Expenses set forth in the Closing
Certificate shall be deemed conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto.

GAAP as in effect as of the Closing Date applying the Accounting Principles

objection and the basis therefor and the Sellers Representatives
calculation and determination of the amounts in question, and any amounts not
so specified shall be deemed to be agreed to by the Sellers Representative
and shall be conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto. If the Sellers
Representative does not give Buyer an Objection Notice within such thirty

conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto (such Buyer Post-Closing
Statement determined pursuant hereto or, in the event of a timely Objection
Notice, as finally determined pursuant to Section 2.5(e), the " _Final
Adjustment Statement_ "). During the thirty (30) day period following the
delivery of the Buyer Post-Closing Statement, at reasonable times during
normal business hours and upon reasonable notice provided to Buyer, Buyer
shall permit the Sellers Representative or such Seller Representatives
representatives (who shall have executed a confidentiality agreement in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Buyer) to make such inspections of
books and records, agreements, internal work papers, schedules and
calculations as it may reasonably require, and to discuss such matters with
the appropriate personnel of Buyer, to the extent reasonably necessary to the
exercise of the Sellers Representatives right to object to the Buyer Post-
Closing Statement. The Sellers Representative agrees that it shall hold all
information acquired during such examination in strict confidence and shall
use such information solely for determining whether or not (i) the Closing
Working Capital Amount and (ii) the Closing Transaction Expenses have been
properly determined.

(e) _Audit Review_. In the event that the Sellers Representative timely
delivers an Objection Notice, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall use
all reasonable endeavors to

 



-10-  reach agreement on the disputed items and amounts in order to determine the
final (i) Closing Working Capital Amount and (ii) Closing Transaction
Expenses. If Buyer and the Sellers Representative resolve the dispute, their
agreement shall be binding and conclusive on all parties hereto. If Buyer and
the Sellers Representative fail to agree on the adjustments set forth in an
Objection Notice within sixty (60) days after delivery of the Objection
Notice (the _"Adjustment Agreement Period"_ ), then (i) upon the election of
either the Sellers Representative or Buyer, the Sellers Representative and
Buyer shall retain PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (or such other independent
accounting firm of recognized standing in the United States and United Kingdom

final determination of (A) the Closing Working Capital Amount and (B) the
Closing Transaction Expenses in accordance with the terms of this Agreement
within the thirty (30)-day period immediately following the Adjustment
Agreement Period, and (ii) Buyer and the Sellers Representative each shall
provide the Independent Auditor with their respective determinations of (A)
the Closing Working Capital Amount and (B) the Closing Transaction Expenses.

and make a determination of only those items and amounts in Buyers and the
Sellers Representatives respective determinations that are identified to
the Independent Auditor as being items and amounts to which Buyer and the
Sellers Representative have been unable to agree, and in all instances, the
Independent Auditors determinations (such determinations, the _"Independent
Auditor s Determinations"_) must be within the range asserted by Buyer and
the Sellers Representative. The Independent Auditor (who shall have executed
a confidentiality agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
Buyer) shall have full and complete access to all internal Buyer work papers,
books and records and all additional information of Buyer reasonably necessary
to resolve any disputed items. The Independent Auditors Determinations and
the procedures set forth herein shall be conclusive and binding upon all
parties hereto and, along with the items and amounts that Buyer and the
Sellers Representative have previously agreed upon (as referred to above),
shall constitute the _"Final Adjustment Statement"_ setting forth (i) the
_"Final Working Capital Amount"_ and (ii) the _"Final Closing
Transaction Expenses_ ," __respectively. The Independent Auditor s
Determinations shall not be subject to appeal of any kind. The Independent
Auditor shall allocate its costs and expenses between Buyer on the one hand
and the Sellers Representative, on behalf of the Founder and Outside
Sellers, on the other hand, based on the percentage of the contested amount
submitted to the Independent Auditor that is ultimately awarded to Buyer on
the one hand or the Founder and Outside Sellers on the other hand, such that
Buyer bears a percentage of such costs and expenses equal to the percentage of
the contested amount awarded to the Founder and the Outside Sellers, and the

equal to the percentage of the contested amount awarded to Buyer.

Closing Transaction Expenses  _exceeds_ (ii) (A) the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment Amount _minus_ (B) the Closing Estimated Transaction Expenses, by

promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5) Business Days
following determination of the Final Adjustment Statement, Buyer shall pay to
the Paying Agent an amount equal to the Net Positive Adjustment Amount (for
distribution to the Sellers by the Paying Agent in proportion to their
respective Pro Rata Share);  _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Buyer be required to pay pursuant to this Section 2.5(f)(i) an amount greater
than the absolute value of the Closing Adjustment Amount.

 

(ii) If (i) (A) the Closing Working Capital Adjustment Amount minus (B) the
Closing Estimated Transaction Expenses _exceeds_ (ii) (A) the Final Working
Capital Adjustment Amount _minus_ (B) the Final Closing Transaction Expenses,
by an amount greater than zero (the _"Net Negative Adjustment Amount_ " __),
then, as promptly as practicable and in any event within five (5) Business
Days following determination of the Final Adjustment Statement, the Sellers
Representative (on behalf of Founder and the Outside Sellers) shall release
an amount to Buyer equal to the Net Negative Adjustment Amount.

(iii) Such amounts shall be paid, in immediately available funds, pursuant to
the instructions previously delivered by Buyer or the Sellers Representative,
as applicable.

Governmental Authority.

 

(ii) _Employees and Contractors_. Each Person who is or was an employee or
contractor of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and each Person who is
or was involved in the creation or development of any Company Product or the

irrevocable assignment to the Company of Intellectual Property Rights
pertaining to such Company Product or the Company IP to the Company and
confidentiality provisions protecting such Company IP. No current or former
shareholder, director, company secretary, manager, employee or contractor of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has any claim, right (whether or not
currently exercisable), or interest to or in any Company IP. To the Knowledge
of the Company, no employee or contractor of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries is (a) bound by or otherwise subject to any Contract restricting
him or her from performing his or her duties for the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or (b) in breach of any Contract with any former employer or
other Person concerning Intellectual Property Rights or confidentiality.

the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their current or former
employees is, or has ever been, a participant, member or promoter of, or a

organization or similar organization that requires or obligates the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, or could require or obligate Buyer, to grant or
offer to any other Person any license or right to any Company IP or covenant
not to sue another Person with respect to the Company IP.

(vii) _Sufficiency_. The Company and its Subsidiaries own or otherwise have
valid and enforceable rights, licenses or permissions to, and immediately
after the Closing shall own or otherwise have valid and enforceable rights,
licenses or permissions to, all Intellectual Property Rights, including the
Company IP, as would reasonably be expected to be necessary to conduct the
business of the Company and its Subsidiaries as currently conducted.

(g) _Valid and Enforceable_. All Company IP is subsisting, and to the
Knowledge of the Company is valid and enforceable (except for applications
where actual registrations would be necessary for enforceability) and shall
continue to be subsisting, and to the Knowledge of the Company valid and
enforceable, immediately after the Closing. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing:

Subsidiaries has engaged in patent or copyright misuse or any fraud or
inequitable conduct in connection with any Registered IP on or prior to the

service mark, trade name or trade dress (collectively, " _Trademark_ ")
owned, used or applied for by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conflicts
or interferes with any Trademark or trade name owned, used or applied for by
any other Person. No event or circumstance (including a failure to exercise
adequate quality controls and an assignment in gross without the accompanying
goodwill) has occurred or exists that

 



-23-  has resulted in, or could reasonably be expected to result in, the
abandonment of any Trademark owned, used or applied for by the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. None of the goodwill associated with or inherent in any
Trademark in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has or purports to
have an ownership interest has been impaired.

 

(iii) _Legal Requirements and Deadlines_. Each item of the Company IP that is
Registered IP is and at all times has been in compliance with all Legal
Requirements and all filings, payments and other actions required to be made
or taken to maintain such item of the Company IP in full force and effect have
been made by the applicable deadline. No application for a patent or a
copyright or trademark registration or any other type of Registered IP filed
by or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been abandoned,
allowed to lapse or rejected. _Part 4.8(g)(iii)_ of the Company
Disclosure Schedule accurately identifies and describes each action, filing
and payment that must be taken or made on or before the date that is one
hundred twenty (120) days after the Execution Date in order to maintain each
such item of the Company IP in full force and effect.

(iv) _Interference Proceedings and Similar Claims_. No interference,
derivation, opposition, reissue, reexamination, inter partes review, post-
grant review or other Proceeding of any nature is or has been pending or, to
the Companys Knowledge, threatened, in which the scope, validity, or
enforceability of any Company IP is being, has been, or could reasonably be
expected to be contested or challenged. To the Knowledge of the Company, there
is no basis for a claim that any Company IP is invalid or unenforceable.

of any Company IP (including cease and desist letter and invitations to take a
license), and provides a brief description of the current status of the matter
referred to in such letter, communication or correspondence.

(i) _Effects of This Transaction_. None of the execution, delivery or

Company IP; (B) a breach of or default under any Company IP Contract; (C) the
release, disclosure, or delivery of any Company IP by or to any escrow agent
or other Person; or (D) the grant, assignment, or transfer to any other Person

Intellectual Property Right of any other Person or engaged in unfair
competition. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

(i) _Infringement by the Company Product or the Company IP_. No Company
Product, and no method or process used in the manufacturing, distribution or

use of any Intellectual Property Right of, or contains any Intellectual
Property misappropriated from, any other Person, and, to the Companys

reimbursed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to such
claim or Proceeding. Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has ever
received any notice or other communication (in writing or otherwise) relating

provide, benefits (including death or medical benefits), whether or not
insured, with respect to any Company Employee, or any spouse or dependent of
any such Company Employee, beyond such Company Employees retirement or other
termination of employment with the Company other than coverage mandated by
Part 6 of Title I of ERISA or Section 4980B of the Code or similar law.

require the Company (a) to permit any inspection, or to disclose any
information, that in the reasonable judgment of the Company would result in
the disclosure of any trade secrets of third parties or violate any of its
obligations with respect to confidentiality if the Company shall have used all

6.4 _Employee Benefits_.

 

(a) Until December 31, 2014, Parent shall provide the Company Employees who
continue in the employ of the Company (the " _Continuing Employees_ ") with
employee benefits that are substantially comparable, in the aggregate, to
benefits provided to such employees under the applicable Benefit Plans prior
to the Closing Date.

 

(b) Parent shall use all reasonable endeavors to cause any employee benefit
plans which the Continuing Employees are eligible to participate in to take
into account for purposes of eligibility, vesting and level of benefit
thereunder (but not for purposes of benefit accrual under any defined benefit
pension plan or to the extent it would result in a duplication of benefits),
service by the Continuing Employees with the Company as if such service were
with Parent or the Company, to the same extent such service was credited under
a comparable Benefit Plan prior to the Closing Date.

 

(c) To the extent any Continuing Employees become eligible to participate in
any employee benefit plans of Parent or the Company, Parent or the Company,
as applicable, shall use all reasonable endeavors to waive (or, where such
benefits are insured by third parties, shall use all reasonable endeavors to
procure the waiver of) limitations on benefits relating to any pre-
existing conditions of the Continuing Employees and their eligible spouses
and dependents, to the extent such limitations and conditions had been
satisfied under a Benefit Plan. Parent, Buyer or the Company, as applicable,
shall use all reasonable endeavors to recognize for purposes of annual
deductible and out-of-pocket limits under any health plan of Parent or the
Company in which Continuing Employees are eligible to participate, deductible
and out-of-pocket expenses paid by Continuing Employees and their respective
spouses and dependents under a Benefit Plan in the calendar year in which the
Closing Date occurs.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing contained herein shall: (i) be
treated as an amendment of any particular employee benefit plan; (ii) give any
Continuing Employee or any other third party any right to enforce the
provisions of this Section 6.4; or (iii) obligate Parent or any of its
Affiliates to (A) maintain any particular employee benefit plan or (B) retain
the employment of any particular employee.

 



-51- (e) The Company and each Seller shall procure that (i) each Seller receiving
Parent Shares or an interest therein, or a Buyer Loan Note, in respect of
which elections under Section 431(1) of ITEPA can be made and (ii) at Parents
reasonable request, each Option Holder who exercises any Company Options,
shall enter into one or more elections, in a timely manner, and in a form
specified by Parent, pursuant to Section 431(1) ITEPA and in any event within
fourteen (14) days after the Closing.

 

6.5 _Company Options_. Subject to the consummation of the Equity Plan
Amendment:

 

(a) During the five (5) Business Day period ending the Business Day prior to
the Closing Date (the _"Exercise Period_ " __), each outstanding Company
Option that is vested in accordance with its terms, as of and during the
Exercise Period, shall be exercisable for the duration of the Exercise Period,
subject to the terms and conditions of the Company Equity Plan and any award
agreements that are applicable to such Company Options. Any Ordinary Shares
and X Shares received upon exercise of such Company Option shall be sold to
the Buyer free and clear of any Encumbrance and with full title guarantee and
shall receive the consideration described in Section 2.3(c), as applicable,
upon the Closing Date. Any and all Company Options that are vested as of and
during the Exercise Period but are not exercised during the Exercise Period
shall be canceled for no consideration and shall cease to exist effective as
of the Closing.

(b) Each outstanding Company Option that is issued but not vested and
exercisable as of and during the Exercise Period shall, as of the Closing, not
be exercisable, and shall, one Business Day following the Closing, provided
the holder thereof has so agreed (failing which such Company Option shall
lapse), instead be replaced with an option to purchase a number of shares of
Class A Common Stock of Parent equal to the product (rounded down to the
nearest whole number) of (i) the number of Ordinary Shares or X Shares, as
applicable, subject to such issued but unvested Company Option immediately
prior to the Closing and (ii) the Option Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price
per share (rounded up to the nearest whole cent) equal to (A) (1)
the exercise price per share of Ordinary Shares or X Shares, as applicable,
subject to such Company Option _multiplied_ by (2) the Exchange Rate, divided
by (B) the Option Exchange Ratio; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that, in the
case of U.S. taxpayers, the exercise price and the number of shares of Class A
Common Stock purchasable pursuant to the Company Options shall be determined
in a manner consistent with the requirements of Section 409A of the Code
and, in the case of any Company Option to which Section 422 of the Code
applies, the exercise price and the number of shares of Class A Common Stock
purchasable pursuant to such option shall be determined in accordance with the
foregoing, subject to such adjustments as are necessary in order to satisfy
the requirements of Section 424(a) of the Code; and _provided_ _,_ _further_
_,_ that each Company Option shall remain subject to the same vesting schedule
and other relevant terms and conditions in effect immediately prior to the
Closing. For purposes of this Section 6.5, the " _Option Exchange Ratio_ "
means the Per Common Share Price (in the case of Company Options with
respect to Ordinary Shares) or Per X Share Price (in the case of Company
Options with respect to X Shares) _divided_ by the 30 Day Average Price.

 

(c) For the purposes of this Section 6.5, any Company Options which may become
exercisable only as a result of the operation of Rule 7.9 of The
NaturalMotion Limited Option Plan 2012 shall be deemed not to be vested or
exercisable.

 



-52- (d) Parent agrees to take the actions set forth on Schedule 6.5(d).

 

6.6 _Issuance of Restricted Stock Units_. At the next regularly scheduled
meeting of the Compensation Committee of Parent, Parent will grant the
Continuing Employees listed on _Schedule 6.6_ hereto an aggregate number of
ZSUs equal to the quotient of (a) the Aggregate Post-Closing ZSU Value divided
by (b) the 30 Day Average Price.

 

6.7 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.

 

(a) For a period of six (6) years from and after the Execution Date, Parent
agrees that all rights existing as of the Execution Date pursuant to the
Company Organizational Documents or any indemnification agreements with the
Companys Officers or directors identified in the Company Disclosure Schedule
for acts or omissions which occurred at or prior to the Closing Date
shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their terms and
shall provide that the Company or any successor thereto shall comply with and
satisfy such rights and related obligations. Parent will not, and will cause
Buyer not to, amend or modify the provisions in the Company Organizational
Documents in effect on the Closing Date, with respect to indemnification,
exculpation or advancement of expenses in a manner that adversely affects the
rights of the Officers or directors or terminate such provisions prior to the
sixth (6th) anniversary of the Execution Date. Any claims for indemnification
made under this Section 6.7(a) on or prior to the sixth (6th) anniversary of
the Execution Date shall survive such sixth (6th) anniversary until the final
resolution thereof.

 

(b) The provisions of this Section 6.7 are intended to be for the benefit of,
and shall be exclusively enforceable by, each of the members of the board of
directors and officers of the Company as of the Execution Date (to the extent
applicable thereto) and their heirs and estates.

 

6.8 _Tail Insurance_. Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase an
extended reporting period endorsement under the Companys existing directors
and officers liability insurance coverage (the _"Tail Insurance Coverage_ "
__) for the Company s board of directors and Officers in a form acceptable to
Parent, which shall provide such board of directors and Officers with
insurance coverage for six (6) years following the Closing Date and shall have
a scope substantially similar to the existing coverage under, and have other
terms not materially less favorable to the insured persons than the terms of,
the directors and officers liability insurance coverage currently maintained
by the Company and disclosed to Parent. Parent shall not cancel the Tail
Insurance Coverage without providing replacement insurance which shall
provide the Target DandO Indemnified Parties coverage for any remaining portion
of the original six (6) year period in an amount not less than the coverage
provided under the Tail Insurance Coverage and with other terms not less
favorable than the terms in such Tail Insurance Coverage.

6.9 _Tax Matters_.

 

(a) _Tax Returns_. Buyer shall prepare or cause to be prepared and file or
cause to be filed all Tax Returns for the Company and its Subsidiaries for
all periods ending on or prior to the Closing Date that are filed after the
Closing Date. Such Tax Returns shall be prepared in accordance with past
practice of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, unless 

 



-53-  otherwise required by applicable Legal Requirements. Buyer shall permit
Sellers Representative to review and comment on each such Tax Return 10
Business Days prior to filing and shall make such revisions to such Income
Tax Returns as are reasonably requested by Sellers concerning any matter which
could require the Sellers to make a payment under this Agreement.

 

(b) _Amendment of Tax Returns_. Buyer shall not amend any Tax Return of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Tax period or portion
thereof ending on or prior to the Closing Date without the consent of Sellers
Representative, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed,
if such amendment would result in indemnification under Section 9\.

(c) _Tax Sharing Agreements_. All Tax sharing agreements, Tax allocation
agreements or similar agreements and all powers of attorney with respect to
or involving the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (other than such
agreements or powers relating solely to the Company and/or any of its
Subsidiaries) shall be terminated prior to the Closing Date and, after
the Closing, the Company and any of its Subsidiaries shall not be bound
thereby or have any Liability thereunder.

(d) _Tax Disputes_. After the Closing, Buyer shall have the authority to
control any audit or examination of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any successor thereto by any Tax Authority and any administrative appeal or
judicial proceeding related to any issue raised in any such audit or
examination; _provided_ , that (i) Buyer shall allow the Sellers
Representative, on behalf of the Sellers, to participate at the Sellers
expense in any audits, examinations or administrative or judicial proceedings
to the extent that such audits, examinations or proceedings could require the
Company or the Sellers to make a payment under this Agreement, and (ii) Buyer
shall not settle any such audit, examination or administrative or judicial
proceeding in a manner which would adversely affect the Company or any Seller
without the prior written consent of the Sellers Representative, on behalf of
the affected Seller, which consent shall not unreasonably be withheld
or delayed.

(e) _Option Matters_. The Company and Parent shall take reasonable steps
consistent with the terms of this Agreement to ensure that, where a Company
Option is a qualifying option for the purposes of Chapter 9, Part 7 and
Schedule 5 of ITEPA, any replacement hereunder of that option shall satisfy
paragraphs 41 to 43 of Schedule 5 of ITEPA. In addition, the Company
and Parent shall file in a timely manner full and accurate Tax Returns in
respect of the grant of any replacement option to the extent required by Legal
Requirements.

 

(f) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Subject to Sections 6.9(a)  (e) and Section
9.3, Buyer and the Sellers Representative shall cooperate fully and
promptly, as and to the extent reasonably requested by any of the other
parties, in connection with any Tax matters relating to the Company (including
by the provision of reasonably relevant records or information), subject,
where applicable, to the signature of the holder of the replacement option.
For the avoidance of doubt, Buyer shall provide the Sellers Representative
with any information reasonably requested to permit the Sellers to determine
the Tax consequences of the purchase and sale of Company Shares pursuant to
this Agreement and of their ownership of the Company Shares, and to comply
with any Tax reporting obligations relating thereto.

 



-54- 6.10 _Registration Statement_.

 

(a) Parent will file with the SEC within one (1) Business Day following the
Closing Date and cause to become effective as soon as practicable thereafter
(and shall use all reasonable endeavors to keep effective for the earlier of
(i) six months from the Closing Date or (ii) until the Parent Shares issued to
the Outside Sellers pursuant to this Agreement no longer constitute
Registrable Shares) a registration statement on Form S-3 as provided in
General Instruction I.D. to Form S-3 (the _"Resale Registration Statement_ "
__) for the registration of the resale of the Registrable Shares. The Resale
Registration Statement shall include a description of the potential manner of
resales of the Registrable Shares as is requested by the holders of the
Registrable Shares and is not inconsistent with the requirements of Form
S-3;  _provided_ , that in no circumstances shall Parent be required to
effect an underwritten offering. To the extent necessary to properly sell any
Registrable Shares under the Resale Registration Statement, Parent shall
deliver to each holder of Registrable Shares, without charge, as many copies
of the prospectus forming part of the Resale Registration Statement (the
_"Prospectus_ " __) and any amendments or supplements thereto as such holder
may reasonably request in order to permit the offering and sale of the
Registrable Shares, but only while Parent shall be required under the
provisions hereof to cause the Resale Registration Statement to remain
effective, and Parent consents (except during a suspension period permitted
by this Agreement) to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto by the holder in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Shares covered by the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. Holders of the
Registrable Shares shall not use the Resale Registration Statement to resell
Registrable Shares except in accordance with the Resale Registration Statement
and subject to the terms, conditions and restrictions set forth in this
Section 6.10.

(b) Parent shall have the right to suspend at any time, and the holders of
Registrable Shares shall suspend, the use of the Resale Registration Statement
for resales of Registrable Shares upon prior written notice from Parent to the
Sellers Representative, for periods of time not to exceed 45
consecutive days or 90 days total, if either: (i) Parent is or may be in
possession of material non-public information, the failure of which to
disclose in the Resale Registration Statement could result in a violation of
securities laws; or (ii) there is a contemplated financing, acquisition,
disposition, corporate reorganization, merger, or other similar transaction or
other material event or circumstance affecting Parent or its securities.

 

(c) In the event: (i) of any request by the SEC or any other federal or state
governmental authority during the period of effectiveness of the Resale
Registration Statement for amendments or supplements to the Resale
Registration Statement or Prospectus or for additional information; (ii) of
the issuance by the SEC or any other federal or state governmental authority
of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the Resale Registration
Statement or the initiation of any proceedings for that purpose; (iii) of the
receipt by Parent of any notification with respect to the suspension of the
qualification or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable
Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of any
proceeding for such purpose; (iv) of any event or circumstance which, upon the
advice of Parents counsel, necessitates the making of any changes in the
Resale Registration Statement or the Prospectus, or any document incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, so that neither the Resale
Registration Statement nor the Prospectus will contain any untrue statement
of a material

 



-55-  fact or omit to state a material fact requested by Parent to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; or (v) of any event
or circumstance of the type described in Section 6.10(b), then Parent shall
promptly deliver a certificate in writing to the Sellers Representatives a
_"Suspension Notice_ " __) and, upon receipt of such Suspension Notice, each
holder of Registrable Shares will refrain from selling any Registrable Shares
pursuant to the Resale Registration Statement (a  _"Suspension_ " __) until
such holder s receipt of copies of a supplemented or amended prospectus
prepared and filed by Parent, or until it is advised in writing by Parent that
the Suspension is no longer in effect. Parent agrees to use all reasonable
endeavors to respond to requests and resolve issues as promptly as
practicable. No filing of, or amendment or supplement to the Resale
Registration Statement (other than the filing of reports under the Exchange
Act or the rules promulgated thereunder) will be made by Parent without
providing the Sellers Representative reasonable opportunity to review and
comment thereon. Parent will notify Sellers Representative promptly of the
receipt of any comments from the SEC or its staff, of any request by the SEC
or its staff for amendments or supplements to Resale Registration Statement or
for additional information, or any other information with respect to any event
which could result in a Suspension Notice ( _it being understood_ that Parent
shall be under no obligation to provide any non-public information), and will
supply Sellers Representative with copies of all correspondence between it or
any of its representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or its staff, on the
other hand, with respect thereto and will respond as promptly as practicable
to any such comments or requests.

 

(d) No holder of Registrable Shares shall use, distribute or otherwise
disseminate any free writing prospectus, as defined in Rule 405 under the
Securities Act, in connection with the sale of Registrable Shares under the
Resale Registration Statement, without the prior written consent of Parent.

 

6.11 _Registrable Shares Indemnification_.

 

(a) Parent shall indemnify and hold harmless each holder of Registrable
Shares, such holders directors and officers and partners and members, each
broker or dealer who participates in the offering of such Registrable Shares,
each agent of such a holder and each Person, if any, who controls (within the
meaning of the Securities Act) such holder (collectively, the  _"Holder
Indemnified Parties_ " __), against any losses, claims, damages or
liabilities, joint or several, to which they may become subject under
applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign securities Legal Requirements or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
Proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any untrue
or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in the
Resale Registration Statement (including any amendments or supplements
thereto); (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading; or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the
indemnifying party of applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign securities
Legal Requirements, and shall reimburse each such Holder Indemnified Party for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by them in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or Liability as such
expenses are incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the obligations in this
Section 6.11(a) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such
loss, claim, damage or liability if such settlement is effected without the
consent of Parent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,

 



-56-  conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _further_ , that Parent shall not be
liable to any Holder Indemnified Party in any such case for any such loss,
claim, damage or liability to the extent that it arises out of or is based
upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission made in connection with the Resale Registration Statement or
amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished expressly for use in connection with such
registration by any such holder of Registrable Shares. The obligations set
forth in this Section 6.11(a) shall remain in full force and effect regardless
of any investigation made by or on behalf of any such Holder Indemnified
Party and shall survive the transfer of such Registrable Shares by any holder
of Registrable Shares.

 

(b) Each holder of Registrable Shares severally and not jointly shall
indemnify and hold harmless Parent, each of its directors and officers, each
person, if any, who controls (within the meaning of the Securities Act) Parent
and each agent of Parent (including legal counsel and accountants)
(collectively, the _"Issuer Indemnified Parties_ " __) against any losses,
claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they may become
subject, under applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign securities Legal
Requirements or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or Proceedings in respect thereof) arise solely out of or are
based solely upon (i) any untrue or alleged untrue statement of any material
fact contained in the Resale Registration Statement (including any amendments
or supplements thereto), (ii) the omission or alleged omission to state by a
holder of Registrable Shares to Parent a material fact required to be stated
or necessary to make the statements made by a holder of Registrable Shares to
Parent not misleading or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the
indemnifying party of applicable U.S. federal and state or foreign securities
Legal Requirements, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission or violation or alleged violation was made in the Resale Registration
Statement or amendments or supplements thereto, in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished by or on behalf of such holder
expressly for use in connection with such registration; and each such older
shall reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by an Issuer
Indemnified Party with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage
or liability as such expenses are incurred; _provided_ , _however_ , that the
obligations in this Section 6.11(b) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any such loss, claim, damage or liability if such settlement is
effected without the consent of such holder of Registrable Shares (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed);
_provided_ , _further_ , that the liability of each holder of Registrable
Shares under this Section 6.11(b) and Section 6.11(d) shall be limited to the
proceeds received by such holder of Registrable Shares from the sale of
Registrable Shares covered by the Resale Registration Statement. Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of any such Issuer Indemnified Party, and
shall survive the transfer of such Registrable Shares by any holder of
Registrable Shares.

 

(c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section 6.11 of
notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party shall, if a
claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under
this Section 6.11, notify the Sellers Representative and the indemnifying
party in writing of the commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall
have the right to participate in and assume the defense thereof; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel, with all fees

 



-57-  and expenses thereof to be paid by such indemnified party, and to be
apprised of all progress in any proceeding the defense of which has been
assumed by the indemnifying party.

 

(d) Except as otherwise limited by Section 6.11(b), to the extent any
indemnification by an indemnifying party is prohibited or limited by
applicable Legal Requirements, the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying
such indemnified party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
indemnifying party and indemnified party in connection with the actions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying
party and indemnified party shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any action in question, including any untrue or alleged untrue
statement of material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such
indemnifying party or indemnified party, and the parties relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
action. The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities referred to above shall be deemed to include
any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party
in connection with any investigation or proceeding. The parties hereto agree
that it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this
Section 6.11(d) were determined by pro rata allocation or by any other method
of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in this Section 6.11(d). No Person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. The liability of each holder of Registrable
Shares hereunder by way of contribution under this Section 6.11(d) and
indemnification under Section 6.11(b) shall be limited to the proceeds
received by such holder of Registrable Shares from the sale of Registrable
Shares covered by the Resale Registration Statement.

 

6.12 _Public Announcements_. The initial press release regarding the
Transactions shall be issued by Parent (after consultation with the Company)
and thereafter the Company, Parent and Buyer each shall consult with each
other prior to issuing any press releases or otherwise making public
announcements with respect to the Transactions, except as may be required by
any Legal Requirement or by obligations pursuant to any listing agreement
with or rules of any national securities exchange or interdealer quotation
service or by the request of any Governmental Authority.

 

6.13 _Listing_. Prior to the Closing, Parent shall use all reasonable
endeavors to obtain conditional approval of the listing and posting for
trading on NASDAQ of the Parent Shares comprising the Stock Consideration,
subject only to notice of official issuance.

6.14  _Restrictions on Transfer_. Each Seller, severally and not jointly with
respect to the Company Shares held by it, agrees that prior to the earlier of
the Closing and the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 8.1,
such Seller shall not, directly or indirectly:

(a) sell, convey, transfer, pledge or otherwise encumber or dispose of any of
the Company Shares held by such Seller or any interest therein, except
pursuant to this Agreement;

 



-58- (b) deposit any such Company Shares into a voting trust or enter into a voting
agreement or arrangement with respect to any such Company Shares or grant any
proxy with respect thereto; or

(c) enter into any Contract with respect to the direct or indirect
acquisition or sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition of any Company
Shares.

6.15 _Compliance with Regulation S_. Parent shall not register any transfer

the Indemnified Parties shall not be entitled to recover Losses incurred by
the Indemnified Parties with respect to any inaccuracy in or breach of any

Parties exceeds, on a cumulative basis, $3,000,000 (the "_ _Threshold Amount_
"), in which case the Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover all
Losses (including those Losses that are less than the Threshold Amount).

(f) _Officer s Certificate_. For purposes of this Section 9, " _Officer s

recoveries from third parties pursuant to contractual indemnification or
contribution provisions (net of any actual collection costs and reserves as

obligate any Indemnified Person to seek or continue to pursue recovery under
any insurance policy or contractual provision with respect to any amount of
Losses.

(a) _Straddle Period_. For any taxable period that includes (but does not end
on) the Closing Date (a " _Straddle Period_ "), with respect to Taxes
(including VAT) measured by net income or gain, revenues or gross receipts,
the Taxes attributable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period portion of such Straddle
Period shall be determined based on an interim closing of the books as of the
close of business on the Closing Date. The amount of Taxes for a Straddle
Period not described in the preceding sentence which relate to the Pre-Closing
Tax Period portion of such Straddle Period shall be deemed to be the amount
of such Taxes for the entire taxable period _multiplied_ by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the number of days in the taxable period ending on the
Closing Date and the denominator of which is the number of days in such
Straddle Period.

(b) _Certain Taxes and Fees_. Buyer shall pay when due all stamp duty or stamp
duty reserve tax on the sale and purchase of the Company Shares.

(c) _No Duplication_. The Indemnifying Parties shall not be held liable more
than once (for example, under this Section 9.3 and Section 9.2) for the same
Losses. Losses shall not include any Liabilities included in the Closing
Working Capital Amount set forth on the Estimated Closing Date Statement (as
modified by the Final Adjustment Statement). 

(d) _Section 338(g) Election_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
this Agreement, the Indemnifying Parties shall not be required to indemnify
any Indemnified Party for any Losses resulting from any election made by the
Buyer or any Affiliate pursuant to Section 338(g) of the Code (or any similar
election under U.S. state or local law) with respect to the Transactions.

(e) _Passive Foreign Investment Company_. If the Company is treated as a
passive foreign investment company (within the meaning of Section 1297(a) of
the Code) (" _PFIC_ ") for its taxable year that includes the Closing Date by
reason of the Company and/or its 25%-owned subsidiaries generating passive
income, or owning assets that produce passive income, after the Closing, and
as a result of such treatment any Seller (or, in the case of a Seller that is
a partnership or other pass-through entity for U.S. federal Tax purposes, any
direct or indirect interest holder in such Seller) that is subject to U.S.
federal income tax on a net income basis (a " _U.S. Seller_ ") incurs,
sustains or accrues any Losses, Buyer shall pay an amount to the Sellers
Representative equal to an amount equal to (i) the Losses that would be
incurred by U.S. Sellers, in the aggregate, assuming that the Company was a
PFIC for its taxable year that includes the Closing Date, less (ii) the Losses
that would have been incurred by the U.S. Sellers, in the aggregate, assuming
that the Company was not a PFIC for its taxable year that includes the Closing
Date, and assuming, for each of clause (i) and (ii), that U.S. Sellers
constitute, in the aggregate, the lesser of (a) 25% of the total shareholders
of the Company immediately prior to the Closing, and (b) a percentage equal
to the actual percentage of U.S. Sellers to the total

 



-67-  shareholders of the Company immediately prior to the Closing; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that Buyer shall not be obligated to make any payment under this
Section 9.3(e) if (i) the Buyer or any Affiliate makes an election under
Section 338(g) of the Code to treat the purchase and sale of Company Shares
contemplated by this Agreement as an acquisition of the assets of the Company,
or (ii) the Buyer or any Affiliate makes an election or causes the Company to
make an election under U.S. Treasury Regulations Section 301.7701-3 to change
the classification of the Company to an entity disregarded as a separate
entity from its sole owner effective the day after the Closing Date, the
election results in the closing of the Companys Taxable year for U.S. federal
income Tax purposes, and neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
engage in any transactions outside the ordinary course of business after the
Closing on the Closing Date.

9.4 _Effect of Waiver of Condition_. An Indemnified Partys right to indemnity
pursuant to this Section 9 shall not be adversely affected by its waiver of a
condition to the Closing set forth in Section 7 unless Parent or Buyer makes
clear by the terms of its waiver that it is foreclosing its right to indemnity
with respect to the matter that is the subject of the waiver.

9.5 _Escrow Arrangements_.

 

(a) _Escrow Fund_. By virtue of this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement and as
partial security for the indemnity obligations provided for in Section 9.2
and Section 9.3, on the Closing Date, the Cash Escrow Deposit shall be

Fund, together with the Holdback Shares, shall be available to compensate the
Indemnified Parties for any claims which they are entitled to recovery under
this Section 9\. Except for (i) amounts indemnifiable pursuant to Section
9.2(b), (ii) Losses as a result of, arising out of or relating to a breach of

Company on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) Losses as a result of, arising
out of or relating to any breach or inaccuracy in the Fundamental
Warranties, (iv) Losses as a result of, arising out of or relating to any
breach or inaccuracy in Section 4.14 ( _Tax Matters_ ), or (v) claims for
indemnification brought pursuant to Section 9.2(a)(ii)-(vii) or Section 9.3,
the maximum obligation of the Sellers to indemnify Buyer from and against
Losses and the maximum amount of indemnification pursuant hereto shall not
exceed the amount of funds then remaining in the Escrow Fund plus the Holdback
Shares; _provided_ ,  _however_ , that in the event that any Net Negative
Adjustment Amount is recovered from the Escrow Fund pursuant to Section
2.4(d), if Losses for which the Indemnified Parties are entitled to recovery
under this Section 9 exceed the amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund and
the Holdback Shares, the Indemnified Parties may recover Losses directly from
the Indemnifying Parties up to the amount recovered from the Escrow Fund
pursuant to Section 2.4(d), whether or not such Losses relate to claims
described in clauses (i)  (v) of this Section 9.5(a).

immediately following the Closing and shall terminate at 5:00 p.m., Pacific
time on the date that is ten (10) days following the End Date (the " _Escrow
Period_ "); _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Escrow Period shall not
terminate with respect to any amount which Buyer informs the Escrow Agent in
writing is necessary, in the good faith reasonable judgment of Buyer, to
satisfy any unsatisfied claims specified in any Officers Certificate
delivered prior to the termination of the Escrow Period (such claims, the "
_Unsatisfied Claims_ ") and the Escrow Agent shall retain possession of such

 



-68-  amount in accordance with the terms of the Escrow Agreement. Promptly
following the termination of the Escrow Period, the Escrow Agent shall
distribute any amounts then remaining in the Escrow Fund (less any amount
required to satisfy any Unsatisfied Claims) to the Paying Agent for
distribution to each Indemnifying Party as set forth in Section 2.4(b).
Promptly following resolution of any Unsatisfied Claim, Buyer and
the Sellers Representative shall instruct the Escrow Agent to distribute the
remainder of the Escrow Fund (if any) as provided in the resolution of such
Unsatisfied Claim. Following the Escrow Period, and subject to any amounts
necessary, in the good faith reasonable judgment of Buyer, to satisfy any
Unsatisfied Claim, any Holdback Shares not withheld by Parent pursuant to
Section 9.5(c)(iii) shall be released to Founder pursuant to the terms of the
Restricted Stock Award Agreement described in Section 2.3(e)(ii), _provided_
that the initial tranche of Parent Shares subject to the one-year vesting
period has vested thereunder. No Holdback Shares shall be released from the
forfeiture restrictions to the extent they did not vest in accordance with
the terms of the Restricted Stock Agreement.

(c) _Claims for Indemnification by Indemnified Parties_.

(i) In order to seek indemnification under this Section 9, an Indemnified
Party shall deliver an Officers Certificate to the Sellers Representative
prior to the expiration of the applicable survival period. With respect to
each Officers Certificate, upon compliance with the provisions of Sections
9.5(d) and 9.5(e), the amount of the Escrow Fund and Holdback Shares (if
applicable) with value equal to the amount of Losses agreed upon pursuant to
Sections 9.5(d) and 9.5(e) shall be delivered to Buyer (and any applicable
Holdback Shares shall be withheld) and used to satisfy the Indemnifying
Parties indemnification obligations hereunder. The amount delivered to Buyer
pursuant to the preceding sentence shall be deemed to reduce each applicable
Indemnifying Partys interest in the Escrow Fund in accordance with his, her
or its Indemnifiable Pro Rata Share of the Base Escrow Amount, with all such
reductions to be calculated and deemed made immediately prior to any time at
which amounts are to be distributed from the Escrow Fund pursuant to
this Section 9.5(c), _it_ _being_ _understood_ that Holdback Shares shall not
be forfeited until such time as the Founders share of the amount remaining in
the Escrow Fund is less than the Founders Cash Escrow Contribution. In the
event such claim for indemnification is indemnifiable pursuant to Section
9.2(b) or relates to Losses arising from a breach of a warranty that involves
fraud or willful breach of this Agreement by the Company or a Seller on or
prior to the Closing Date of or by an Indemnifying Party, Buyer may seek a
recovery for such Losses against the relevant Indemnifying Party or
Indemnifying Parties directly.

 

(ii) In the absence of amounts sufficient to compensate the Indemnified Party
for some or all of the Losses to which it is entitled at the time of
determination of such entitlement, the Indemnifying Parties shall each, in
accordance with their Indemnifiable Pro Rata Share and subject to the
provisions of Sections 9.5(d) and 9.5(e), deliver to Buyer, as promptly
as practicable, an amount of cash, equal to such Losses that exceed the sum
of any available amounts in the Escrow Fund (after applying the applicable
Cap, to the extent applicable to such Losses).

 



-69- (iii) Notwithstanding clause (i) of this Section 9.5(c), at such time when
the Founders share of the amount remaining in the Escrow Fund (not taking
into account any interest or dividends accrued thereon) is less than the
Founders Cash Escrow Contribution, then any additional indemnifiable Losses
shall be satisfied from the Escrow Fund and the Holdback Shares in accordance
with the following: (A) an amount from the Escrow Fund equal to the Outside
Sellers aggregate Indemnifiable Pro Rata Share and shall be delivered to
Buyer and (B) Parent shall withhold an amount of Holdback Shares equal to the
quotient of (1) the Founders Indemnifiable Pro Rata Share of such
indemnifiable Loss _divided_ by (2) the 30 Day Average Price; _provided_
that (x) Founder shall have the option of remitting an amount in cash in
immediately available funds within 10 Business Days of such determination to
the applicable Indemnified Parties equal to the Founders Indemnifiable Pro
Rata Share of such Loss in lieu of recovery against the Holdback Shares, (y)
if the initial tranche of the Founder Stock Consideration does not vest in
accordance with its terms, the Founder shall, at the later of (1) the time
when any such indemnifiable Loss is determined hereunder and (2) when the
Founders employment has terminated with Parent or the Company such that his
initial tranche shall not vest, immediately pay to the applicable Indemnified
Parties cash in immediately available funds in an amount equal to the
Founders Indemnifiable Pro Rata Share of any such Loss and (z) if at the time
that any recovery against the Holdback Shares would be made hereunder the then
preceding 30-day average closing price of the Class A Common Stock as
reported on the NASDAQ (as reported in the Eastern Edition of The Wall Street
Journal or, if not reported thereby, another authoritative source) (the
_"Trading Price_ " __) is less than the 30 Day Average Price, Founder shall
within 10 Business Days pay to the applicable Indemnified Parties an amount in
cash in immediately available funds equal to the difference between (x) the
Founders Indemnifiable Pro Rata Share of the applicable Loss and (y) the
product of the amount of the Holdback Shares that are subject to withholding
_multiplied_ by the Trading Price. Any Holdback Shares withheld or recovered
against hereunder shall be retained by Parent and shall not be deliverable to
Founder.

(d) _Objections to Indemnification Claims_. If the Sellers Representative
does not object to Buyer in writing within the thirty (30)-day period after
delivery by any Indemnified Party of any Officers Certificate, such failure
to so object shall constitute an irrevocable acknowledgment by the Sellers
Representative and Indemnifying Parties that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to the full amount of the claim for Losses set forth in such
Officers Certificate. In case the Sellers Representative shall object in
writing to Buyer to any claim or claims made in any Officers Certificate to
recover Losses within the thirty (30)-day period after delivery of such
Officers Certificate, the Sellers Representative and Buyer shall attempt in
good faith to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with respect to
each of such claims. If the Sellers Representative and Buyer should so agree,
a memorandum setting forth any agreement reached by Buyer and the Sellers
Representative and with respect to such claim shall be prepared and signed by
Buyer and the Sellers Representative, and the Indemnified Party shall be
entitled to the amount set forth in such memorandum for satisfaction in
accordance with Section 9.5(c).

 



-70- (e) _Resolution of Conflicts_.

 

(i) If within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of an Officers
Certificate, the Sellers Representative does not contest such Officers
Certificate in writing to the Indemnified Party (pursuant to Section 9.5(d)),
then the Sellers Representative shall be conclusively deemed to have
consented, on behalf of all Indemnifying Parties, to the recovery by the
Indemnified Party on the full amount of the Losses specified in the Officers
Certificate and without further notice, to have stipulated to the entry of a
final judgment for Losses against the Indemnifying Parties for such amount
pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 10.8.

(ii) If the Sellers Representative gives the Indemnified Party written
notice (pursuant to Section 9.5(d)) contesting all or any portion of an
Officers Certificate (such contested portion, a _"Contested Claim_ " __)
within such twenty (20) calendar day period, such Contested Claim shall be
resolved either (i) by a written settlement agreement executed by the
Indemnified Party and the Sellers Representative or (ii) in the absence of
such a written settlement agreement, pursuant to the procedures set forth in
Section 10.8.

(f) _Third-Party Claims_.

 

(i) In the event an Indemnified Party becomes aware of a third-party claim
which such Indemnified Party reasonably believes may result in a demand for
indemnification pursuant to this Section 9, such Indemnified Party shall
notify the Sellers Representative of such claim, and the Sellers
Representative shall be entitled on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties, at
its expense, to participate in (upon consent of Buyer, which shall not be
unreasonably withheld), but not to determine or conduct, the defense of such
claim. At the request of the Sellers Representative and at the
Sellers Representatives expense, Parent and/or the applicable Indemnified
Party shall consult with the Sellers Representative in a reasonable manner
and at reasonable times regarding the status of any such third-party claim,
and shall furnish all documents reasonably requested by that party, to the
extent that such communications and receipt of such documents does not affect
any privilege or other protection relating to defense of the third-party
claim.

 

(ii) If there is a third party claim that an Indemnified Party reasonably and
in good faith concludes would reasonably be likely to, if adversely
determined, give rise to a right of recovery for Losses hereunder, then any
amounts incurred or accrued by the Indemnified Parties in defense of such
third-party claim, regardless of the outcome of such claim, and any
amounts incurred to settle any such claim (subject in the case of settlement
amounts to the remainder of this clause (f)), shall be deemed Losses
hereunder. Buyer shall have the right in its sole discretion to conduct the
defense of, and to settle, any such claim; _provided_ , _however_ , that
Buyer shall notify the Sellers Representative prior to settling any claim for
money damages, and except with the consent of the Sellers Representative, no
settlement of any such claim with third party claimants shall be
determinative of the amount of Losses relating to such matter (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld, or delayed). In the event

 



-71-  that the Sellers Representative has consented to any such settlement, the
Indemnifying Parties shall have no power or authority to object under any
provision of this Section 9 to the amount of such claim by Buyer against the
Escrow Fund and the Holdback Shares with respect to such settlement

(iii) If such third-party claim is for money damages only (and not for
injunctive, equitable, or other non-monetary relief), and if Parent reasonably
determines that any potential Losses (including defense costs) associated with
such third-party claim do not exceed the total value of the sum of (A) the
amount then remaining in the Escrow Fund _plus_ (B) the product of (1) the
number of Holdback Shares then remaining available to satisfy indemnification
claims _multiplied_ by (2) the 30 Day Average Price _plus_ (C) the total of
all other then outstanding unsatisfied indemnification claims made pursuant to
Section 9 (such amount, as calculated and determined at the applicable time,
the " _Remaining Escrow Amount_ "), then the Sellers Representative may
elect, by written notice delivered to Parent within thirty (30) days (or such
shorter period as may be required to timely respond to such third-party
claim) after receiving notice of such third-party claim, to assume the
defense thereof. For any third-party claim that initially satisfies the terms
of the preceding sentence but subsequently no longer satisfies such terms, the
Sellers Representative shall immediately notify Parent in writing and Parent
may at any time thereafter by written notice to the Sellers Representative
re-assume the defense thereof.

 

(iv) If the Sellers Representative assumes or accepts the defense of any
third-party claim pursuant to the preceding paragraph (iii) of this Section
9(f), (A) the Sellers Representative shall conduct such defense actively and
diligently, and shall be entitled to withdraw funds from the Escrow Funds to
pay any reasonable fees, costs or expenses incurred resulting from or arising
out the defense of such third party claims, including the reasonable fees and
expenses of any legal counsel retained by the Sellers Representative; (B) the
Sellers Representative shall have the right to settle or compromise any such
third-party claim without the consent of Parent or any Indemnified Party,
provided that such settlement is only with respect to monetary damages and in
no event shall such settlement or compromise exceed the Remaining Escrow
Amount (as calculated at the time of such settlement or compromise) unless the
Indemnifying Parties indemnify the Indemnified Parties for such excess; and
(C) the Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification for the full
amount of any settlement or compromise of such third-party claim and for any
Losses resulting from or arising from such third-party claim pursuant to
Section 9.2(a). Any legal counsel retained by the Sellers Representative
for purposes of conducting the defense of such third party claim shall be
subject to Parents or an Indemnified Partys consent, not to be unreasonably
withheld.

 

(v) If the Sellers Representative assumes or accepts the defense of any
third-party claim pursuant to paragraph (iii) of this Section 9(f), Parent or
any Indemnified Party may retain separate counsel to monitor the defense of
such third-party claim, but all fees and expenses of any kind associated with
retention of such counsel shall be borne exclusively by Parent or such
Indemnified Party and shall not constitute Losses under this Agreement. At the
request of Parent or any Indemnified

 



-72-  Party, the Sellers Representative shall consult with that party in a
reasonable manner and at reasonable times regarding the status of any such
third-party claim, and shall furnish all documents reasonably requested by
that party, to the extent that such communications and receipt of such
documents do not affect any privilege or other protection relating to defense
of the third-party claim, _provided_ that at the reasonable request of Parent
or any Indemnified Party, the Sellers Representative shall enter into a joint
defense agreement with Parent or such Indemnified Party. Parent and any
Indemnified Party must, at the Sellers Representatives request and expense,
fully cooperate in the defense of the third-party claim and provide full
access to documents, assets, properties, books, records, and other information
reasonably requested by the Sellers Representative, including by
making available all officers, directors and employees reasonably requested
by the Sellers Representative for investigation, depositions, and trial, _it_
_being_ _understood_ that Parent and the Indemnified Parties shall not
be required to take actions that (i) they would not take if they were
conducting the defense of the third-party claim or (ii) that would affect any
privilege or other protection relating to defense of the third-party claim.

 

9.6 _Exclusive Remedy_. Except in the case of fraud or willful breach, if the
Closing occurs, the monetary remedies set forth in this Section 9 and the
specific performance remedy referenced in Section 10.10 shall provide the sole
and exclusive remedy for breaches of any warranty or covenant made in this
Agreement by the Company (as it relates to pre-Closing matters) or the
Sellers.

9.7 _Sellers  Representative_.

 

(a) At the Closing, each of the Indemnifying Parties, shall appoint
Shareholder Representative Services LLC as its agent and attorney-in-fact and
as the Sellers Representative for and on behalf of the Indemnifying Parties
to give and receive notices and communications (including to Buyer), to
authorize payment to Buyer from the Escrow Fund in satisfaction of claims by
Parent or Buyer, to object to such payments, to agree to, negotiate, enter
into settlements and compromises of, and comply with orders of courts with
respect to such claims, and to take all other actions that are either (i)
necessary or appropriate in the judgment of the Sellers Representative for
the accomplishment of the foregoing or (ii) specifically mandated by the terms
of this Agreement. Such agency may be changed by the Indemnifying Parties from
time to time upon not less than thirty (30) days prior written notice to
Buyer; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Sellers Representative may resign at
any time, and may not be removed unless holders whose aggregate Pro Rata Share
is a majority of the Aggregate Cash Consideration and the aggregate Stock
Consideration payable hereunder agree to such removal and to the identity of
the substituted agent. No bond shall be required of the Sellers
Representative, and the Sellers Representative shall not receive any
compensation for its services other than pursuant to the terms of that certain
Engagement Agreement to be entered into by and among Shareholder
Representative Services LLC, the Company and certain of the Sellers. After the
Closing, notices or communications to or from the Sellers Representative
shall constitute notice to or from the Indemnifying Parties.

(b) The Sellers Representative shall not be liable for any act done or
omitted hereunder as the Sellers Representative while acting in good faith
and without gross negligence.

 



-73-  The Sellers shall indemnify the Sellers Representative and hold the
Sellers Representative harmless against any loss, liability, damages, claims,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, actions, fees, costs or expenses arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of the Sellers
Representatives duties hereunder, including the reasonable fees and expenses
of any legal counsel retained by the Sellers Representative, the expenses of
the Paying Agent arising from its obligations with respect to Sections 2.4(d)
and (e), and expenses incurred pursuant to this Section 9 ( _"Sellers 
Representative Expenses_" __), in each case as such Sellers  Representative
Expense is incurred; _provided_ , that in the event that any such Sellers
Representative Expense is finally adjudicated to have been directly caused by
the gross negligence or bad faith of the Sellers Representative, the Sellers
Representative will reimburse the Sellers the amount of such indemnified
Sellers Representative Expense to the extent attributable to such
gross negligence or bad faith. Following the Closing, the Sellers
Representative shall have the right to recover Sellers Representative
Expenses first, from the Expense Fund and finally from the Founder and the
Outside Sellers according to their respective Pro Rata Share (including from
amounts that otherwise would have been payable to Founder and the Outside
Sellers from the Escrow Fund); _provided_ , that while this section allows the
Sellers Representative to be paid from the Expense Fund and upon release of
the Escrow Fund to the Indemnifying Parties, this does not relieve the Founder
and the Outside Sellers from their obligation to promptly pay such Sellers
Representative Expenses as they are suffered or incurred, nor does it prevent
the Sellers Representative from seeking any remedies available to it at law
or otherwise. In no event will the Sellers Representative be required to
advance its own funds on behalf of the Sellers or otherwise. The Sellers
acknowledge and agree that the foregoing indemnities will survive the
resignation or removal of the Sellers Representative or the termination of
this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Sellers Representatives
right to recover Sellers Representative Expenses shall not prejudice Buyers
right to recover the full amount of indemnifiable Losses that Buyer is
entitled to recover as provided in this Section 9.

 

(c) A decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative,
shall constitute a decision of the Sellers and shall be final, binding and
conclusive upon the Sellers; and Parent and Buyer may rely upon any such
decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative as being
the decision, act, consent or instruction of the Sellers. Parent and
Buyer are hereby relieved from any liability to any Person for any acts done
by it or its Affiliates or Representatives in accordance with such decision,
act, consent or instruction of the Sellers Representative.

 

9.8 _Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments_.

 

(a) All indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 9 will be
treated as an adjustment to the Aggregate Cash Consideration and Stock
Consideration payable hereunder unless otherwise required by Legal
Requirements.

(b) All indemnification payments made pursuant to this Section 9 will be made
free and clear of set-off or counterclaim.

Agreement and violate this provision or any other provision of Article 5 of
the Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards,
either party shall be entitled to petition any relevant court to resist

10.9 _Successors and Assigns_. This Agreement shall be binding upon: the
Company and its successors and assigns (if any); the Sellers and their
respective successors and assigns (if any); Parent and its successors and
assigns (if any); Buyer and its successors and assigns (if any) and the

performance of any obligations under this Agreement. Neither the Company nor
any Seller shall, without the prior written consent of Parent and Buyer,
assign or delegate any or all of its rights or obligations under this
Agreement, in whole or in part, to any other Person, and any attempted

of no force or effect.

 

10.10 _Remedies Cumulative; Specific Performance_. The rights and remedies of
the parties hereto shall be cumulative (and not alternative). The parties to
this Agreement agree that, in the event of any breach or threatened breach by
any party to this Agreement of any covenant, obligation or other provision set

(a) No failure on the part of any Person to exercise any power, right,
privilege or remedy under this Agreement, and no delay on the part of any
Person in exercising any power, right, privilege or remedy under this
Agreement, shall operate as a waiver of such power, right, privilege or
remedy; and no single or partial exercise of any such power, right, privilege
or remedy shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or of any
other power, right, privilege or remedy.

(b) No Person shall be deemed to have waived any claim arising out of this
Agreement, or any power, right, privilege or remedy under this Agreement,
unless the waiver of such claim, power, right, privilege or remedy is
expressly set forth in a written instrument duly executed and delivered
on behalf of such Person; and any such waiver shall not be applicable or have
any effect except in the specific instance in which it is given. It is
understood that any waiver executed by the Sellers Representative, as
applicable, shall be deemed to be delivered on behalf of the Sellers and
shall be binding on such Persons.

10.12 _Amendments_. This Agreement may not be amended, modified, altered or
supplemented other than by means of a written instrument duly executed and
delivered: (a) prior to the Closing Date, on behalf of all parties hereto; and

Representative.

10.13 _Severability_. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is invalid
or unenforceable in any situation in any applicable jurisdiction shall not
affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions
hereof or the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in
any other situation or in any other jurisdiction. If the final judgment of a
court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or provision hereof is
invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto agree that the court making such
determination shall have the power to limit the term or provision, to delete
specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or unenforceable term or
provision with a term or provision that is valid and enforceable and that

unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement shall be enforceable as
so modified. In the event such court does not exercise the power granted to it
in the prior sentence, the parties hereto agree to replace such invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a valid and enforceable term or
provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the economic, business
and other purposes of such invalid or unenforceable term.

 

10.14 _Parties in Interest_. Except for the provisions of Section 6.7, Section
6.8, Section 9.1, Section 9.2, Section 9.3, Section 9.4, Section 9.5 and

privileged communications made prior to the Closing among Fenwick andWest LLP (

the Sellers  Representative, on the other hand, that reasonably relate to
the Transactions ( _"Privileged Communications_ _"_ __), the attorney-client
privilege and the 

 



-80-  exception of client confidence belongs solely to the Sellers Representative
and may be controlled only by the Sellers Representative and shall not pass
to or be claimed by Parent or Buyer (including the Company as its predecessor
in interest), because the interests of Parent and its Affiliates were directly
adverse to the Company, the Sellers and/or Sellers Representative at the time
such communications were made. This right to the attorney-client privilege
shall exist even if such communications may exist on Buyers computer system
or in documents in Buyers possession. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the
event that a dispute arises after the Closing between Parent, Buyer, and a
Person other than a party to this Agreement, Buyer may assert the attorney-
client privilege to prevent disclosure to such third party of Privileged
Communications; _provided_ , _however_ , that Buyer may not waive such
privilege with respect to Privileged Communications without the prior written
consent of Sellers Representative, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld, delayed or conditioned. For the avoidance of doubt, Parent, Buyer
and the Company shall have access to and shall have the right to use any
Privileged Communications for the purpose of defending Parent, Buyer, the
Company or their respective Affiliates against any claims from the Sellers,
Sellers Representative or any other Person.

10.16 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement (including the Company Disclosure
Schedule and Exhibits and Schedules hereto) and the other agreements referred
to herein set forth the entire understanding of the parties hereto relating to
the subject matter hereof and thereof and supersede all prior agreements and
understandings among or between any of the parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof; _provided_ _,_ _however_ , that the Confidentiality
Agreement and the No-Shop Agreement shall not be superseded by this Agreement
and shall remain in effect in accordance with their terms until the earlier
of: (a) the Closing; or (b) the date on which the Confidentiality Agreement or
the No-Shop Agreement are terminated in accordance with their respective
terms. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in the
Confidentiality Agreement, following the Closing (i) all confidential
information of the Company shall constitute confidential information of
Parent, irrespective of whether such information was identified or otherwise
designated as "confidential," and the Company shall be deemed the recipient
or receiving party in respect of such information and Buyer the disclosing
party with respect thereto; and (ii) Parent shall have no obligations
whatsoever under the Confidentiality Agreement with respect to such
information. The parties hereto acknowledge the warranties set forth in
Section 3, Section 4 and Section 5 are the only warranties made by each of the
parties hereto and that each such warranty shall be construed as a separate
and independent warranty and not limited by the terms of any other warranty
(except where expressly provided to the contrary); _provided_ , _however_ ,
that none of the foregoing shall operate to limit the liability of a party
hereto in respect of any claim or cause of action based on or arising out of
fraud.

10.17  _Schedules_. The schedules form part of this Agreement and shall have
effect accordingly.

(a) each of Parent, Buyer, the Company and the Sellers Representative shall
sign a copy of this Agreement with all schedules attached in complete form;

(b) each Seller shall sign a copy of this Agreement and Schedule A attached
in complete form and each Key Employee and Founder shall sign a copy of this

Representative further agrees as follows:

(i) subject to Section 10.17(c)(ii), other than Schedule A and Schedule 2
(copies of which shall be provided in accordance with the Section 10.17(b),
each Schedule shall be kept strictly confidential as between Parent, Buyer,
the Company and the Sellers Representative; and

 

(ii) in relation to _Schedule 1_ , each Seller will be given prior to Closing
an individual schedule which shall only show the details pertaining to that
Seller and no Seller shall be entitled to be provided with details of the
Company Shares held by any other Seller or any other information set out in
Schedule 1 pertaining to any other Seller.

 

(d) For the avoidance of doubt, each Seller shall be bound by all terms of
this Agreement notwithstanding this Section 10.17 and/or due to the fact that
the Sellers have only received those Schedules referred to in Section 10.17(b)
and in relation to Schedule 1 as provided for in Section 10.17(c)(ii).

 



-82- IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
