and, provided further that, notwithstanding the foregoing, the Closing may
occur on any other date agreed upon in writing by the Company, MergerCo and

Section 3.1. _Payment with respect to Shares of Company Stock_.

governed by the terms hereof and the terms of an escrow agreement to be
entered into by and among Parent, the Equity Holders Representative and the
Escrow Agent, such escrow agreement to be substantially in the form attached

held in escrow and shall be available to settle certain contingencies as
provided in  _Sections 3.8_ and _9.2_ of this Agreement and will be
distributable to the Equity Holders and/or Parent in accordance with the
Escrow Agreement.

(b) Prior to the Closing Date, Parent shall deliver or mail to each holder of
record of a Certificate or Certificates that immediately prior to
the Effective Time will represent outstanding shares of Company Stock the
following: (A) a letter of transmittal which shall specify that delivery shall
be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only
upon proper delivery of the Certificates to Parent; and (B) instructions for
use in surrendering the Certificates to the Equity Holders Representative,
for further delivery to Parent at or after Closing in exchange for the Closing
Cash Merger Consideration applicable to the shares of Company Stock
represented by the Certificates.

(c) At or following the Effective Time, and upon surrender of a Certificate
representing Series A Preferred Stock, Series B Preferred Stock, Class A
Common Stock or Common Stock to Parent for cancellation, together with a
letter of transmittal properly completed and duly executed, and such other
documents as may be required pursuant to such instructions, Parent shall pay
to the holder of such Certificate, as applicable:

(i) the Series A Per Share Closing Cash (as defined in _Section 11.6_) for
each share of Series A Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate;

(ii) the Series B Merger Price Per Share (as defined in _Section 11.6_) for
each share of Series B Preferred Stock represented by such Certificate; and



 

4 (iii) the Common Per Share Closing Cash (as defined in _Section 11.6_) for
each share of Class A Common Stock or each share of Common Stock represented
by such Certificate.

Any Certificate duly surrendered under this  _Section 3.1(c) _shall
forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or accrued on any of the Total
Merger Consideration payable to holders of the Certificates.

(d) Until surrendered in accordance with this _Section 3.1_, each such
Certificate (other than Certificates representing shares of Common Stock to
be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(b)_ and Dissenting Shares (as
defined in _Section 3.4(a)_)) shall represent solely the right to receive the
Total Merger Consideration relating thereto (subject to applicable abandoned
property, escheat, and similar laws). If the Total Merger Consideration
relating thereto (or any portion thereof) is to be delivered to any person
other than the person in whose name the Certificate surrendered therefor is
registered, it shall be a condition to such right to receive such Total Merger
Consideration relating thereto that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the
person surrendering such Certificate shall pay to Parent any Transfer Taxes
(as defined in _Section 7.6_) or other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of any portion of the Total Merger Consideration to a person other
than the registered holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish
to the satisfaction of Parent that such Tax has been paid or is not
applicable.

(e) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be
closed, and thereafter, there shall be no further registration or transfers of
shares of Company Stock on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of any shares of Company Stock that were outstanding immediately
prior to the Effective Time. On or after the Effective Time, any Certificates
formerly representing shares of Company Stock presented to the Surviving
Corporation or Parent shall be surrendered and canceled in return for the
payment of the Total Merger Consideration relating thereto, as provided in
this _Article III_.

(f) None of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or the Equity Holders
Representative or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates shall
be liable to any person in respect of any cash delivered to a public official
pursuant to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar law.

(g) If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the
making and delivery of an affidavit of that fact and an indemnity in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent by the person claiming such
Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent in its
discretion from any holder of more than five percent (5%) of the capital stock
of the Company (on an as-if-converted to Common Stock basis), a bond in form
and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, Parent will issue the
applicable Total Merger Consideration in exchange for such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate in accordance with this _Article III_.

(h) If Parent is required to make a payment pursuant to _Section 3.8(e)_,
Parent shall promptly distribute all such amounts to the Equity Holders
(other than holders of the Series B Preferred Stock) pro rata in the
proportion that the amount of the Closing Cash Merger Consideration received
by each of them bears to the Closing Cash Merger Consideration received by all
of such Equity Holders in the aggregate.



 

5 (i) Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the Total Merger Consideration or other amounts payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any Equity Holder such amounts as Parent or the
Surviving Corporation is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any provision of United States
federal, state or local Tax laws, and shall instead pay such amount to the
applicable Governmental Authority. To the extent that amounts are so withheld
by Parent or the Surviving Corporation, such amounts withheld shall be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Equity
Holder in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by Parent
or the Surviving Corporation.

Section 3.2. _Options_.

(a)  _Vested Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of
the Company shall have made a determination pursuant to Section 10.2 of the
Plan (as defined in _Section 4.2(a)_) to pay cash in retirement of
all vested Options (as defined in _Section 4.2(a)_) that are outstanding and
unexercised immediately prior to the Effective Time (each such vested Option,
a " _Vested Option_ ," and each holder of a Vested Option, individually, an "
_Optionholder_ " and, collectively, the " _Optionholders_ ") in accordance
with this _Section 3.2_. At the Effective Time, the Company shall pay to each
holder of a Vested Option that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time an amount of cash for each share of Common Stock
then issuable upon exercise of such Vested Option equal to the amount payable
pursuant to Section 10.2 of the Plan, which shall be (i) the Common Per Share
Closing Cash _less_ (ii) the exercise price of such Vested Option _less_ (iii)
any required employment and other withholding Taxes applicable or relating to
the exercise of, or any other action relating to, such Vested Options. Each

Share payable in respect of shares of Common Stock hereunder when, as and if
paid pursuant to the terms hereof _less_ any required employment and other
withholding Taxes applicable or relating to the exercise of, or any other
action relating to, such Vested Options.

(b) _Unvested Options_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have
taken all actions necessary such that, as of the Effective Time, no unvested
Options will be outstanding, and no agreements with respect to any such
unvested Options will be binding on the Company.

(c)  _Treatment as Compensation_. All consideration to be received by the
Optionholders pursuant to this _Section 3.2_ (as well as any amounts paid to
the Optionholders under _Sections 3.8_, _7.6_ , _ 9.2_ and/or pursuant to
the Escrow Agreement or the Equity Holders Agreement) shall be treated as
compensation by the Company and shall be net of any applicable Taxes.

Section 3.3. _Warrants_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall have
provided notice to the Warrantholders (as defined below) of the Merger and
this Agreement in accordance with the terms of the Warrant (as defined below),
and the Warrantholders shall have elected to receive the Common Per Share
Closing Cash _less_ the applicable exercise price of such Warrants in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement. At the Effective Time, the
Company shall pay



 

6  to each holder of a warrant that is outstanding and unexercised immediately
prior to the Effective Time (each such warrant, a " _Warrant_ ," and each
holder of a Warrant, individually, a " _Warrantholder_ " and, collectively,
the " _Warrantholders_ ") an amount of cash for each share of Common Stock
then issuable upon exercise of such Warrant (each such share, a " _Warrant
Share_ ") equal to (i) the Common Per Share Closing Cash _less_ (ii) the
exercise price of such Warrant. Each Warrantholder shall thereafter be
entitled to receive in respect of each such share of Common Stock any
additional amounts of Common Stock Merger Price Per Share payable in respect
of shares of Common Stock hereunder when, as and if paid pursuant to the terms
hereof. In consideration of receiving the Common Stock Merger Price Per Share
in accordance with this Agreement, each Warrantholder shall have entered into
agreements with the Company canceling and terminating the Warrants.

Section 3.4. _Appraisal Rights_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, any shares of
Company Stock (collectively, the " _Dissenting Shares_ ") that are issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and that are held by
stockholders of the Company who have not executed the Written Consent (as
defined in  _Section 7.1(a)_) and who shall have demanded properly in
writing appraisal for such shares in accordance with Section 262 of the DGCL
(the " _Appraisal Rights Provisions_ ") will not be converted as described
in  _Section 2.1_, but will thereafter constitute only the right to receive
payment of the fair value of such shares of Company Stock in accordance with
the Appraisal Rights Provisions; provided, however, that all shares of
Company Stock held by Equity Holders who shall have failed to perfect or who
effectively shall have withdrawn or lost their rights to appraisal of such
shares of Company Stock under the Appraisal Rights Provisions shall thereupon
be deemed to have been canceled and to have been converted, as of the
Effective Time, into the right to receive the applicable portion of the Total
Merger Consideration, without interest, in the manner provided in _Sections
2.1_ and _3.1_. Persons who have perfected statutory rights with respect to
Dissenting Shares as aforesaid will not be paid by the Surviving Corporation
as provided in this Agreement and will have only such rights as are provided
by the Appraisal Rights Provisions with respect to such Dissenting Shares.
The Company shall give Parent and MergerCo prompt notice of any demands
received by the Company for the exercise of appraisal rights with respect to
shares of Company Stock, withdrawals of such demands, and any other
instruments served pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company, and
Parent shall have the right to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to such demands.

(b) Each dissenting stockholder who becomes entitled under the Appraisal
Rights Provisions to payment for Dissenting Shares shall receive
payment therefor after the Effective Time from the Surviving Corporation (but
only after the amount thereof shall have been agreed upon or finally
determined pursuant to the Appraisal Rights Provisions), and such shares of
Company Stock shall be canceled. 

Section 3.5. _Payments at Closing for Indebtedness_. As of the Closing Date,
Parent shall repay, by wire transfer of immediately available funds, all
indebtedness then outstanding under those certain agreements, instruments, and
facilities entered into by and among the Company and various lending
institutions, all of such agreements, instruments and facilities being as
described on _Schedule 3.5_ attached hereto (collectively, the "
_Indebtedness_ "); provided that the Company has provided payoff letters from
the lenders of such Indebtedness. Parent and



 

7  MergerCo, on the one hand, and the Company, on the other hand, will
cooperate in arranging for such repayment and shall take such reasonable
actions as may be necessary to facilitate such repayment and to facilitate
the release, in connection with such repayment, of any mortgages, pledges,
liens, security interests, encumbrances, claims, charges, conditional sale
agreements and restrictions of any kind or character (collectively, "
_Encumbrances_ ") securing such Indebtedness and the delivery of payoff
letters to Parent or Parents lenders.

Section 3.6. _Payments at Closing for Expenses_. As of the Closing Date,
Parent and MergerCo shall provide sufficient funds to the Surviving
Corporation to enable the Surviving Corporation to pay all outstanding fees
and expenses of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries in connection with
the negotiation and the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement that have not been paid on or prior to the Closing Date (the "
_Company Expenses_ ").

Section 3.7. _Estimated Working Capital Adjustment; EBITDA Adjustment
Amount_. 

(a) At least ten (10) Business Days prior to the Closing Date, the Company
shall deliver to Parent and MergerCo a good faith estimate of the Companys
Net Working Capital as of the close of business on the Closing Date (the "
_Company s Estimated Working Capital_"), together with supporting
documentation for such estimate and any additional information relating
thereto reasonably requested by Parent or MergerCo. Parent and its accountants
and advisors shall be given full access to all of the Companys and its
Subsidiaries books and records for purposes of evaluating the accuracy and
completeness of the Companys Estimated Working Capital. If Parent believes,
in good faith, that the Companys Estimated Working Capital is in error,
Parent may challenge the amount of the Companys Estimated Working Capital
within six (6) Business Days following delivery by delivering a written notice
of disagreement to the Company. If Parent does not timely deliver a notice of
disagreement to the Company, the amount of the Closing Cash
Merger Consideration to be paid at the Effective Time shall be based on the
Companys Estimated Working Capital as delivered to Parent. If Parent timely
delivers a written notice of disagreement to the Company, Parent and the
Company shall use their good faith efforts to resolve any disputes with
respect to the Companys Estimated Working Capital prior to the Closing Date,
and the amount of Closing Cash Merger Consideration to be paid at the
Effective Time shall be based on the Estimated Working Capital (as defined
below) as mutually agreed to in writing by Parent and the Company. If Parent
timely delivers a notice of disagreement to the Company but Parent and the
Company are unable to resolve their dispute regarding the Companys Estimated
Working Capital within four (4) Business Days of the delivery by Parent to the
Company of such notice of disagreement, then the amount of Closing Cash Merger
Consideration to be paid at the Effective Time shall be based on the amount
of working capital set forth in such notice of disagreement. " _Estimated
Working Capital_ " shall mean the estimate of the Companys Net Working
Capital at the close of business on the Closing Date as determined by the
parties pursuant to this _Section 3.7(a)_.

(b) " _Target Working Capital_ " means $285,980.00 in Net Working Capital.
The " _Estimated Working Capital Adjustment_ " shall be an amount equal to the
Estimated Working Capital, as determined in accordance with _Section 3.7(a)_,
_less_ the Target Working Capital. 



 

8 (c) Concurrently with the delivery of the Audited Financial Statements to
Parent as contemplated by  _Section 7.9_ of this Agreement, the Company
shall deliver to Parent a calculation of the Companys EBITDA (as defined
below) for the Companys fiscal year ended December 31, 2006 (the " _FY
2006 EBITDA_ ") which shall be derived from and based solely upon the
elements of EBITDA that are set forth in such Audited Financial Statements. If
FY 2006 EBITDA is less than $33,300,000 (the " _Target EBITDA_ "), then the
Purchase Price shall be reduced by a dollar amount (the " _EBITDA Adjustment
Amount_ ") equal to (i) the difference between the Target EBITDA _minus_ the
FY 2006 EBITDA, with such difference then being _multiplied by_  (ii) 7.658.
The term " _EBITDA_ " shall mean the Companys total revenues, less the
Companys total expenses, each for the Companys fiscal year ended December
31, 2006, except for its interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization
expenses for such period. Such expenses shall also exclude the items set forth
on _Schedule 3.7(c)_.

_Section 3.8. Post Closing Adjustments_.

(a) Within sixty (60) days following the Closing Date, Parent shall prepare
and deliver to the Equity Holders Representative a consolidated balance sheet
of the Company and its Subsidiaries as of the close of business on the Closing
Date (the " _Closing Balance Sheet_ "), which will include Parents
calculation of the Companys actual Net Working Capital as of the close of
business on the Closing Date (the " _Closing Working Capital_ ") and a
certificate based on such Closing Balance Sheet setting forth Parents
calculation of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment (as defined in _Section
3.8(b)_) (such Closing Balance Sheet, statement of Net Working Capital, and
certificate, collectively, are referred to herein as, the " _Closing
Statement_ "). The Closing Balance Sheet shall be prepared in accordance with
GAAP (as defined in _Section 11.6_), consistent with the practices, policies
and procedures used in preparation of the Base Balance Sheet (as defined in
_Section 4.5(a)(ii)_), and shall be certified by an authorized officer of
Parent. The preparation of the Closing Statement shall be for the sole purpose
of determining the Closing Working Capital Adjustment. The Equity Holders
Representative shall have twenty (20) Business Days following its receipt of
the Closing Statement (the " _Review Period_ ") to review the same. On or
before the expiration of the Review Period, the Equity Holders
Representative shall deliver to Parent a written statement accepting or
objecting to the Closing Statement. If the Equity Holders Representative
objects to the Closing Statement, such statement shall include an itemization
of the Equity Holders Representatives objections and the reasons therefor.
If the Equity Holders Representative does not deliver such statement to
Parent within the Review Period, the Equity Holders Representative shall be
deemed to have accepted the Closing Statement.

(b) The " _Closing Working Capital Adjustment_ " shall mean (i) if the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment was zero, then an amount equal to the
Target Working Capital _minus_ the Closing Working Capital; (ii) if the
Estimated Working Capital Adjustment was positive, then an amount equal
to the Target Working Capital _plus_ the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment
_minus_ the Closing Working Capital; or (iii) if the Estimated Working Capital
Adjustment was negative, then an amount equal to the Target Working Capital 
_minus_ the absolute value of the Estimated Working Capital Adjustment _minus_
the Closing Working Capital.

(c) The Closing Working Capital Adjustment set forth on the Closing
Statement, as accepted or deemed accepted under _Section 3.8(a)_ or, if
applicable, as determined in accordance with _Section 3.8(d)_ below, shall
constitute the " _Final Closing Adjustment_ " for purposes of determining any
adjustment to the Total Merger Consideration.



 

9 (d) If the Equity Holders Representative objects to the Closing Statement
within the Review Period, Parent and the Equity Holders Representative shall
promptly and in good faith attempt to resolve such objections. Any such
objections that cannot be resolved between Parent and the Equity Holders
Representative within thirty (30) days following Parents receipt of the
Equity Holders Representatives statement of objections shall be resolved in
accordance with this _Section 3.8(d)_. Any such unresolved objections shall
be submitted to Grant Thornton, LLP (the " _Accounting Referee_ ") for review
and resolution, with instructions to complete the same as promptly as
practicable, but in any event within thirty (30) days of its engagement, and
to make any calculations in accordance with GAAP, consistent with the
practices, policies and procedures used in preparation of the Base Balance
Sheet. Such Accounting Referee shall deliver a statement setting forth its own
calculation of the Closing Working Capital Adjustment within thirty (30) days
of the submission of the matter to such firm, which calculation, absent
manifest error, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties and not subject
to appeal. The fees and costs of the Accounting Referee, if one is required,
shall be payable (i) out of the Escrow Fund on behalf of the Equity Holders,
on the one hand, and (ii) by Parent, on the other hand, on the basis, for each
such party, of the ratio of (A) the positive difference between the amount of
Closing Working Capital Adjustment submitted by such party and the
determination of the actual Closing Working Capital Adjustment made by the
Accounting Referee to (B) the difference between the Closing Working Capital
Adjustment amounts submitted by each party.

(e) If the Final Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, Parent shall receive
(out of the Escrow Fund) an amount in cash equal to the Final Closing
Adjustment, including all interest earned thereon. In the event the Final
Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then Parent shall pay to the Equity
Holders an amount in cash equal to the Final Closing Adjustment, _plus_
interest on such amount, from the Closing Date until the date of determination
of the Final Closing Adjustment, earned at the same rate of interest as was
earned on the Escrow Fund for the same period of time, and shall distribute
such amount proportionally to the Equity Holders based on each such Equity
Holders Pro Rata Portion of such amount. Any payment made under this _Section
3.8(e)_ shall be made within five (5) Business Days of the final
determination of the Final Closing Adjustment.

Section 3.9. _Holdback Amount_. At the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to
be delivered to the Equity Holders Representative an amount in cash equal to
the Holdback Amount. The distribution of the Holdback Amount to the Equity
Holders Representative shall be governed by the terms hereof and the terms
of an agreement to be entered into by and among the Equity Holders
Representative and the Equity Holders party thereto, such agreement to be
substantially in the form attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ (the " _Equity
Holders Agreement_ "). The Holdback Amount shall be held in escrow by the
Equity Holders Representative and shall be available to pay the fees and
expenses of the Equity Holders Representative in connection with the
consummation of the Closing and the obligations of the Equity Holders
Representative hereunder and under the Escrow Agreement. Any portion of the
Holdback Amount not used to pay such fees and expenses shall be distributed to
the Equity Holders in accordance with the terms of the Equity Holders
Agreement; it being understood and agreed that Parents sole obligation to the
Equity Holders with respect to the Holdback Amount shall be Parents



 

10  obligation to pay the Holdback Amount to the Equity Holders Representative
in accordance with this _Section 3.9_ at the Closing, and following such
payment, Parent shall have no further obligation with respect to the payment
or delivery of such Holdback Amount to the Equity Holders.

Section 3.10. _Increase in Transaction Price_. In the event that the Closing
occurs after the later of (i) the date which is sixty (60) days following
delivery to Parent of the Audited Financial Statements (as defined in
_Section 7.9_) and (ii) June 1, 2007 (the later of such dates, the " _Price
Increase Start Date_ "), then the initial Transaction Price set forth in
_Section 2.1(d)_ shall be increased by an amount equal to one percent (1%)
per annum, based on a 360-day year, of such initial Transaction Price, pro-
rated for the number of days beginning on and including the Price Increase
Start Date and ending on and including the day immediately prior to the
Closing Date; _provided_ , that if on the Price Increase Start Date all of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than the
condition set forth in  _Section 8.2(p)_) are not satisfied, or could not be
satisfied subject only to consummation of the Closing, then the increase in
the Transaction Price shall be calculated based on the number of days
beginning on and including the first date on which all of the conditions to
the Closing set forth in _Article VIII_ (other than the condition set forth
in _Section 8.2(p)_) are satisfied, or could be satisfied subject only to
consummation of the Closing, and ending on and including the day immediately
prior to the Closing Date; _provided further_ , _however_ , that if at any
time after any Price Increase Start Date any of the conditions to the Closing
set forth in  _Article VIII_ (other than the condition set forth in _Section
8.2(p)_) is no longer satisfied or capable of being satisfied subject only to
consummation of the Closing (the " _Stop Date_ "), then the increase in the
Transaction Price pursuant to this _Section 3.10_ shall be terminated and all
increases accrued prior to the Stop Date shall be ignored and have no effect,
but if thereafter all of the conditions to the Closing set forth in  _Article
VIII_ (other than the conditions set forth in _Section 8.2(p)_) again become
satisfied, or could be satisfied subject only to consummation of the Closing,
then a new Price Increase Start Date shall be deemed to have occurred on such
date with the increase in the Transaction Price being calculated based on the
number of days beginning on and including the date on which each of the
conditions to the Closing set forth in _Article VIII _(other than the
condition set forth in _Section 8.2(p)_) again become satisfied, or could be
satisfied subject only to consummation of the Closing, and ending on and
including the day immediately prior to the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if Audited Financial Statements that comply with _Section 7.9(c)_
have not been delivered to Parent on or before March 31, 2007, then this
_Section 3.10_ will be null and void, and no increase to the Transaction
Price shall accrue or be payable hereunder.

(a) _Schedule 4.9(a)_ sets forth a list of all Company Plans (as defined
below) sponsored or maintained by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
within the past seven (7) years or with respect to which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries has made or has had any obligation to make contributions or
provide benefits within the past seven (7) years. For purposes of
this Agreement, " _Company Plans_ " shall mean any "employee benefit plan",
as defined in Section 3(3) of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of
1974, as amended (" _ERISA_ ") and any other profit-sharing, bonus, stock
option, stock purchase, stock ownership, phantom stock, pension, retirement,
employment, severance, deferred compensation, excess benefit, supplemental
unemployment, post-retirement medical or life insurance, welfare, incentive,
sick leave, disability, medical hospitalization, vision, dental, life
insurance, cafeteria, flexible spending account, or other insurance or benefit
plan, trust, arrangement, policy, practice, arrangement or understanding
(whether written or, if material, oral) (1) that are sponsored, maintained or
to which contributions are made (now or within the past seven (7) years) by
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries for the benefit of current or former
employees, directors, officers, leased employees, independent contractors or
agents of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or their current or former
spouses, dependents, or other beneficiaries, or (2) with respect to which the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any ERISA Affiliate of the Company
could have any liability. For purposes of the preceding sentence, the term "
_ERISA Affiliate_ " means any trade or business (whether or not incorporated)
that together with the Company is treated as a single employer pursuant to
Sections 414(b), (c), (m) or (o) of the Code. Except as disclosed on _Schedule
4.9(a)_, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries, ERISA Affiliates, or
sponsors maintains or contributes to (or is obligated to contribute to) (now
or within the past seven (7) years) any "employee pension plan," as defined in
Section 3(2) of ERISA, that is subject to Title IV of ERISA or Section 412 of
the Code, any "multiple employer welfare arrangement," as defined in Section
3(40) of ERISA, or any "multiemployer plan," as defined in Sections 3(37) or
4001(a)(3) of ERISA. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.9(a)_, none of the
Company Plans provides benefits for any individual who, at the time the
benefit is to be provided, is a former director, officer, or employee of, or
other provider of services to, the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, except
as may be required under the Consolidate Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of
1985, as amended (or similar state law) and at the expense of the participant
or the participants beneficiary, or except for any Company Plan which meets
the qualification requirements of Section 401(a) of the Code.

(b) The Company Plans have been administered in all material respects in
accordance with the applicable provisions of ERISA and the Code, and all
applicable laws. Each Company Plan that is intended to qualify under Section
401(a) of the Code has (A) either (1) received a favorable determination from
the IRS regarding its qualification thereunder, or the expiration of the
requisite period under applicable regulations promulgated by the IRS under the
Code or IRS pronouncements in which to apply for such determination letter and
to make any amendments necessary to obtain a favorable determination has not
occurred, or (2) has been established under a prototype plan for which an IRS
opinion letter has been obtained by the plan sponsor and is valid as to the
adopting employer, and (B) to the knowledge of the Company, nothing has
occurred or could reasonably be expected to occur that has caused or would
reasonably be expected to cause the loss of such qualification or the
imposition of any penalty or Tax.



 

19 (c) There is neither any pending litigation, suit, or proceeding nor, to the
knowledge of the Company, any litigation, suit or proceeding threatened in
writing against the Company related to the Company Plans which would be
reasonably likely to have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company
Material Adverse Effect. Other than claims for benefits arising in the
ordinary course of business of the Company Plans, to the knowledge of the
Company, no claims, investigations, lawsuits, arbitrations or other
controversies are pending or threatened against the Company Plans, or any
trustee, fiduciary, custodian, administrator or other person holding or
controlling assets of any Company Plan and, to the knowledge of the Company,
no basis for any such claim exists.

(d) Except as expressly contemplated by this Agreement or as set forth on
_Schedule 4.9(d)_, neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement nor
the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will (i) result in
any payment becoming due to any Employee (as defined in _Section 4.11(c)_) of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or under any Company Plan, (ii)
increase any benefits otherwise payable under any Company Plan or (iii) result
in the acceleration of the time of payment or vesting of any such benefits
under any Company Plan.

(e) No non-exempt "prohibited transaction" (within the meaning of Section 4975
of the Code and/or Section 406 of ERISA) has occurred with respect to any
Company Plan. The Company and its Subsidiaries have not been notified that any
Company Plan is under audit or investigation by any Governmental Authority,
and no Company Plan is subject to, or has in the past been subject to,
any voluntary compliance, amnesty, closing agreement or other similar
program.

(f) Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.9(f)_, each Company Plan may, without
any liability (other than liability for benefits already accrued under such
Company Plan) be amended, terminated or otherwise discontinued at any time.

(g) Neither the Company nor any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to make any
parachute payments as such term is defined in Section 280G of the Code,
and neither is a party to any agreement that would reasonably be likely to
obligate it, or any successor in interest, to make any parachute payments that
will not be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. Neither the Company nor
any ERISA Affiliate is obligated to make reimbursement or gross-up payments
to any person in respect to excess parachute payments. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, no economic benefit that could be received
(whether in cash or property or the vesting of property) as a result of the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, the consummation of the Merger or
the consummation of any other transaction contemplated by this Agreement,
including as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of any Options or
the termination of employment on or following the Effective Time, by or for
the benefit of any director, officer, employee or consultant of the Company or
any of its Affiliates who is a "disqualified individual" (within the meaning
of the Treasury Regulation Section 1.280G-1) would be characterized as an
"excess parachute payment" (within the meaning of Section 280G(b)(1) of the
Code). No "disqualified individual" is entitled to receive any additional
payment from the Company, any of its Subsidiaries, the Surviving Corporation
or any other Person in the event that the excise tax required by Section
4999(a) of the Code is imposed on such "disqualified individual." 



 

20 (h) Each Company Plan that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as
defined in Section 409A(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) and was in
existence prior to October 3, 2004, has not been "materially modified" (within
the meaning of Section 885(d)(2)(B) of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
and any applicable guidance issued thereunder) since October 3, 2004, in a
manner which would cause amounts deferred in taxable years beginning before
January 1, 2005 under such plan to be subject to Section 409A of the Internal
Revenue Code. Except as set forth on _Schedule 4.9(h)_ , each Company Plan
that is a "nonqualified deferred compensation plan" (as defined in Section
409A(d)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code) and which has not been terminated has
been operated in good faith compliance with the provisions of Section 409A of
the Internal Revenue Code and Notice 2005-1 since January 1, 2005, and no
amount payable or benefit available under any Company Plan is taxable to any
individual by reason of Section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code.

that the Company or any of its Subsidiaries are responsible to make. The
Company or one of its Subsidiaries is in physical possession and actual and
exclusive occupation of the whole of each of the Owned Real Properties and

(a) Each of the Company, Parent and MergerCo shall use their respective
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the authorizations, consents,
orders and approvals necessary for their execution and delivery of, and the
performance of their obligations pursuant to, this Agreement. If required by
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended, and the

(the " _FTC_ "), the Antitrust Division of the United States Department of
Justice (the " _DOJ_ ") or any  



 

38  other Governmental Authority, as applicable, for the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated hereby; provided, however, that notwithstanding any
other provision of this Agreement, Parent shall not be required, as a
condition to obtaining such approval, to divest or hold separate or otherwise
take or commit to take any action or enter into any agreement that limits its
freedom of action with respect to all or any portion of Parents or any of
its Subsidiaries assets, businesses or lines of business, and neither the
Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall make any such divestiture or take
any such action or make any such commitment with respect to the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries business or assets in connection with obtaining any
such approval without Parents prior written consent.

(b) Each of the parties shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to take,
or cause to be taken, all appropriate action to do, or cause to be done, all
things necessary, proper or advisable under applicable law or otherwise to
consummate and make effective the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and all other agreements contemplated hereby as promptly as practicable,
including to (i) obtain the consents and approvals of the third parties and
Governmental Authorities listed on _Schedule 4.4_ and (ii) promptly make all

including FCC Forms 394 or other appropriate forms required to be filed (i)
with the FCC and (ii) with any other Governmental Authority that are necessary
for the transfer of control of the Franchises in connection with the
consummation of the Merger. Parent shall provide to the Company all
information deemed reasonably necessary by the Company for the completion of
the FCC Forms 394 required to be filed in order to obtain the approvals
necessary to transfer the Franchises (including information reasonably
required by the terms of the Franchises and requested by the Company), and
agrees to cooperate reasonably, diligently, and in good faith with the Company
in the preparation of such FCC Forms 394 to permit the filing of such FCC
Forms 394\. Following the execution hereof, until the Closing, the Company
shall timely send or cause to be sent all required renewal letters with
respect to the Franchises pursuant to Section 626(a) of the Cable Act to the
proper Governmental Authority. The Company shall not and shall cause its
Subsidiaries to not, without Parents prior written consent, agree or accede
to any material modifications or amendments to, or in connection with, or the
imposition of any material condition to the renewal of, any of the Franchises
that, individually or in the aggregate, will impose a material obligation on
Parent following the Closing. The Company shall, to the extent reasonably
practicable, notify Parent of all meetings, hearings and other
discussions before or with Governmental Authorities in connection with the
renewal or extension of any Franchise, any governmental authorization relating
to a Franchise or the granting of a Required Consent (as defined in _Section
8.2(f)_) such that Parents representatives can participate to the extent
reasonably practicable in such proceedings.

(d)  _Section 7.4(b)_ notwithstanding, the Company and its Subsidiaries
shall use commercially reasonable efforts to prepare and file, or cause to be
prepared and filed, within 30 Business Days after the date of this Agreement,
all applications required to be filed with the FCC and with any other
Governmental Authority that are necessary for the transfer of control of any
Company Licenses in connection with the consummation of the Merger. Parent
shall provide to  



 

39  the Company all information deemed reasonably necessary by the Company for
the completion of the applications necessary to obtain the approvals necessary
to transfer the Company Licenses (including information reasonably required
by the terms of the Company Licenses and requested by the Company), and agrees
to cooperate reasonably, diligently, and in good faith with the Company in the
preparation of such applications to permit the filing of such applications.
From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, upon Parents request,
the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an extension
or renewal of any Company License that has expired or will expire prior to
July 31, 2007, and such extension or renewal shall be for a term reasonably
requested by Parent and shall otherwise be on substantially the same or on
other commercially reasonable terms that are reasonably acceptable to Parent.
The Company shall not and shall cause its Subsidiaries to not, without
Parents prior written consent, agree or accede to any material modifications
or amendments to, or in connection with, or the imposition of any material
condition to the renewal of, any of the Company Licenses that, individually or
in the aggregate, will impose a material obligation on Parent following the
Closing. The Company shall, to the extent reasonably practicable, notify
Parent of all meetings, hearings and other discussions before or with
Governmental Authorities in connection with the renewal or extension of any
Company License or the granting of a Required Consent such that Parents
representatives can participate to the extent reasonably practicable in such
proceedings.

(e) Upon Parents reasonable request, the Company shall deliver with each FCC
Form 394 a proposed Franchise transfer resolution, which will include a
request to extend, for a term of 36 months following the Closing, on
substantially the same or on other commercially reasonable terms that are
reasonably acceptable to Parent, any Franchise that has expired or will
expire after the date hereof and prior to the date which is 30 months after
the Closing Date in accordance with its terms. From the date of this Agreement
until the Closing, upon Parents reasonable request the Company shall seek to
obtain any such extension or renewal of any Franchise that has expired or will
expire after the date hereof and prior to the date which is 30 months after
the Closing Date in accordance with its terms in the ordinary course of
business, provided, that, in any event, the Company will use commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain such extension or renewal (i) with a term of 36
months following the Closing and (ii) on substantially the same or on other
commercially reasonable terms that are reasonably acceptable to Parent.

(f) From the date of this Agreement until the Closing Date, upon Parents
request, the Company shall use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain an
extension or renewal of any lease set forth on _Schedule 7.4(f)_, and such
extension or renewal shall be for a term of up to 36 months (as so requested
by Parent) and shall otherwise be on substantially the same or on other
commercially reasonable terms that are reasonably acceptable to Parent;
_provided_ , _however_ , that no such extension or renewal shall require the
Company to incur or pay any extension or renewal fees; _provided_ _further_ ,
_however_ , that no ordinary course rental increase will be considered an
extension or renewal fee.

(g) The Company shall not, and shall not permit any Subsidiary to, agree,
without Parents prior written consent to any material change to the terms of
any Franchise, Company License or Material Contract as a condition to
obtaining any consent or approval related to such Franchise, Company License
or Material Contract. If in connection with obtaining any consent or approval,
a Governmental Authority or other third party seeks to impose any condition
or  



 

40  adverse change to any Franchise, Company License or Material Contract to
which such consent or approval relates as a requirement for granting such
consent or approval, the Company shall promptly notify Parent of such fact,
and the Company shall not agree to such condition or adverse change unless
Parent shall, in its reasonable discretion, consent to such condition or
change in writing.

(h) Each of Parent and MergerCo shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
assist the Company in obtaining the Required Consents, including (i)
providing to such third parties and Governmental Authorities such financial
statements and other financial information as such third parties or
Governmental Authority may reasonably request and (ii) agreeing to
commercially reasonable adjustments to the terms of the Franchises, Company
Licenses and Material Contracts with such third parties and Governmental
Authorities (provided that neither party hereto shall be required to agree to
any adjustment increasing the amount payable with respect thereto).

Section 7.5. _Officers  and Directors Indemnification_.

(a) In the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, whether civil, criminal or administrative,
including, without limitation, any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation in which any Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to
the date hereof, or who becomes prior to the Effective Time, a director,
officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries (the " _Indemnified Parties_ ") is, or is threatened to be, made
a party based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of,
or pertaining to (i) the fact that he or she is or was a director, officer,
employee, fiduciary or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or is
or was serving at the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, employee, fiduciary or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust or other enterprise or (ii) the negotiation,
execution or performance of this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after
the Effective Time, the Company, Parent and MergerCo agree to cooperate and
use their reasonable best efforts to defend against and respond thereto. It is
understood and agreed that the Company shall indemnify and hold harmless, and
after the Effective Time the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall indemnify
and hold harmless, as and to the full extent permitted by applicable law, each
Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses), judgments,
fines and amounts paid in settlement in connection with any such threatened or
actual claim, action, suit, demand, proceeding or investigation, and in the
event of any such threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether asserted or arising before or after the Effective
Time), (A) the Company, and the Surviving Corporation and Parent after the
Effective Time, shall promptly pay expenses incurred by each Indemnified
Party as the same are incurred in advance of the final disposition of any
claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to such Indemnified Party, (B) the
Indemnified Parties may retain counsel satisfactory to them, and the
Company, Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall pay all fees and expenses
of such counsel for the Indemnified Parties within thirty (30) days after
statements therefor are received and (C) the Company, Parent and the Surviving
Corporation will use their respective reasonable best efforts to assist in
the vigorous defense of any such matter; provided, however, that none of the
Company, the Surviving Corporation or Parent shall be liable for any
settlement effected without its prior written consent (which consent shall
not be unreasonably  



 

41  withheld); and provided further that the Company, Surviving Corporation and
Parent shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified Party when and if
a court of competent jurisdiction shall ultimately determine, and such
determination shall have become final and non-appealable, that indemnification
of such Indemnified Party in the manner contemplated hereby is prohibited by
applicable law. Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
this _Section 7.5_, upon learning of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding
or investigation, shall notify the Company and, after the Effective Time, the
Surviving Corporation and Parent thereof; provided that the failure to so
notify shall not affect the obligations of the Company, the Surviving
Corporation and Parent except to the extent such failure to notify materially
prejudices such party.

(b) Parent and MergerCo agree that all rights to indemnification or
exculpation existing in favor of, and all limitations on the personal
liability of, each present and former director, officer, employee, fiduciary
and agent of the Company and its Subsidiaries provided for in their respective
charters or by-laws or otherwise in effect as of the date hereof shall
continue in full force and effect for a period of six (6) years from the
Effective Time; provided, however, that all rights to indemnification in
respect of any claims asserted or made within such period shall continue until
the disposition of such claim. From and after the Effective Time, Parent and
the Surviving Corporation also agree to indemnify and hold harmless the
present and former officers and directors of the Company and its Subsidiaries
in respect of acts or omissions occurring prior to the Effective Time to the
extent provided in any written indemnification agreements between the Company
and/or one or more of its Subsidiaries.

(c) At the Effective Time, Parent shall purchase an extended reporting period
endorsement under the Companys existing directors and officers liability
insurance coverage for the Companys and its Subsidiaries directors and
officers in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company that shall provide
such directors and officers with coverage for six (6) years following the
Effective Time of not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not
materially less favorable to, the insured Persons than the directors and
officers liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company.
Parent shall maintain such policy in full force and effect, and continue to
honor the obligations thereunder. 

(d) The obligations under this _Section 7.5_ shall not be terminated or
modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any Indemnified Party to
whom this _Section 7.5_ applies without the consent of such Indemnified Party
(it being expressly agreed that the Indemnified Parties to whom this _Section
7.5_ applies shall be third party beneficiaries of this _Section 7.5_ and
shall be entitled to enforce the covenants contained herein).

(e) In the event Parent or the Surviving Corporation or any of their
respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any
other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or
entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of its properties and assets to any person, then, and in
each such case, to the extent necessary proper provision shall be made so that
the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Corporation, as the
case may be, assume the obligations set forth in this _Section 7.5_.



 

42 Section 7.6. _Tax Matters_.

(a) _Preparation and Filing of Tax Returns_.

(i) Parent shall prepare and file, or shall cause to be prepared and filed,
all Tax Returns of the Company and its Subsidiaries with respect to Pre-
Closing Periods which are due after the Closing Date; provided, that Parent
shall provide each such Tax Return to the Equity Holders Representative for
its review and comment at least fifteen (15) Business Days prior to the date
on which such Tax Return is to be filed, and Parent shall make changes to each
such Tax Return as are reasonably requested by Equity Holders Representative
so long as such changes are permitted by applicable law. Such Tax Returns
shall be prepared in a manner consistent with past practices except as
required by changes in applicable law. Parent shall cause any amounts shown to
be due on such Tax Returns to be remitted to the applicable taxing
authorities no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the due date of such
Tax Returns.

(ii) Parent (and its Subsidiaries and Affiliates) shall not amend any Tax
Returns of the Company or its Subsidiaries for any Pre-Closing Period without
the prior written consent of the Equity Holders Representative, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

(b) _Closing Date Course of Business_. For the remainder of the Closing Date
after the time of Closing, other than transactions expressly contemplated
hereby, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries to
carry on its business only in the ordinary course in the same manner as
heretofore conducted.

(c) _End of Tax Year_. Parent and the Surviving Corporation shall not take any
action, or permit any action to be taken, that may prevent the tax year of
the Company and its Subsidiaries from ending for federal and applicable state,
local and foreign income tax purposes at the end of the day on the Closing
Date.

(d) _Cooperation on Tax Matters_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
_Sections 9.4_ and _9.5_ , Parent, the Surviving Corporation and the Equity
Holders Representative shall cooperate fully, as and to the extent reasonably
requested by the other parties, in connection with the filing of Tax Returns
or any amended Tax Returns, any Tax audits, Tax proceedings or other Tax-
related claims, the authorization and execution of any appropriate powers of
attorney to accomplish the foregoing, allowing the Equity Holders
Representative to review Tax Returns to determine or verify the
proper amounts payable thereunder, and any mechanisms or payment processes
reasonably requested by the Equity Holders Representative to pay any Tax
refunds to the Equity Holders to the extent, but only to the extent, that the
Equity Holders are entitled thereto pursuant to _Section 7.6(f)_ hereof.
Such cooperation shall include, upon the Equity Holders Representatives
request, providing records and information that are reasonably relevant to any
such matters, making employees available on a mutually convenient basis to
provide additional information, and explaining any materials provided pursuant
to this _Section 7.6_. Parent, the Surviving Corporation and their respective
Subsidiaries and Affiliates shall not destroy or dispose of any Tax
workpapers, schedules or other materials and documents supporting Tax Returns
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for Pre-Closing Periods until the seventh
(7th) anniversary of the Closing Date without the prior written consent of
Equity  



 

43  Holders Representative and, before any disposition or destruction of such
materials at any time, Parent shall give Equity Holders Representative the
opportunity to take possession of such materials and documents.

(e) _Transfer Taxes_. All transfer, value added, excise, stock transfer,
stamp, recording, registration and any similar Taxes (including penalties and
interest thereon, " _Transfer Taxes_ ") that become payable in connection with
the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby shall be borne 50% by
Parent and 50% by the Company. The applicable parties shall cooperate in
filing such forms and documents as may be necessary to permit any such
Transfer Tax to be assessed and paid on or prior to the Closing Date in
accordance with any available pre-sale filing procedure, and to obtain any
exemption or refund of any such Transfer Tax.

(f) _Tax Refunds_. The Equity Holders shall be entitled to receive from the
Surviving Corporation (or its Affiliates) all Tax refunds, other than federal,
state or local income Tax refunds, for Taxes paid with respect to Pre-Closing
Periods.

Section 7.7. _Books and Records_. Parent and MergerCo shall, and shall cause
the Surviving Corporation and each of the Surviving Corporations
Subsidiaries to, until the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date,
retain all books, records and other documents pertaining to the business of
the Company and its Subsidiaries in existence on the Closing Date and to make
the same available for inspection and copying by the Equity Holders and the
Equity Holders Representative at the expense of the Equity Holders
Representative during the normal business hours of Parent, MergerCo, the
Surviving Corporation or such Subsidiary, as applicable, upon reasonable
request and upon reasonable notice. No such books, records or documents shall
be destroyed after the seventh (7th) anniversary of the Closing Date without
first advising the Equity Holders Representative in writing and giving the
Equity Holders Representative a reasonable opportunity to obtain possession
thereof.

Section 7.8. _Employment Matters_.

(a) As of the Effective Time, the Company shall have terminated all Company
Plans except for those Company Plans that Parent requests not be terminated.
Parent shall take all necessary action so that, after the Effective Time, any
current or former employee of the Company who is eligible to participate in a
Company Plan as of the Effective Time shall either be eligible to continue
his or her participation in such Company Plan or participate in a
corresponding employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries, subject to the terms of such corresponding plan. Unless
otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties, within thirty (30) days prior
to the Closing Date, Parent shall provide written notification to Company of
the Company Plans to be terminated and Company plans to be maintained post-
Closing. Parent shall have the sole discretion to determine which current or
former employees of the Company will continue participation in a Company Plan
after the Effective Time and which will commence participation in a
corresponding employee benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its
subsidiaries after the Effective Time and, with respect to current or former
employees who transfer participation to such a corresponding plan, when such
transfer will occur. Parent need not treat all current and former employees
of the Company (including those who are similarly situated) in the same manner
with respect to which plans they participate in and when, if at all, they
transfer participation from a Company Plan to a corresponding employee
benefit plan maintained by Parent or any of its subsidiaries. Parent may take
such actions (or cause its



 

44  subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation to take such actions) as are
necessary or advisable to accomplish the foregoing, including, without
limitation, amending the eligibility provisions of the employee benefit plans
maintained by Parent, its subsidiaries or the Surviving Corporation.

(b) Except as otherwise provided in this _Section 7.8_, nothing in this
Agreement shall be interpreted as limiting the power of the Surviving
Corporation to amend or terminate any particular Company Plan or any other
particular employee benefit plan, program, agreement or policy or as
requiring the Surviving Corporation or Parent to offer to continue (other than
as required by its terms) any Company Plan or any written employment contract

matter, event or condition. Any such supplemental or amended disclosure with
respect to those matters, events or conditions arising or discovered after the

_ARTICLE IX - SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; INDEMNIFICATION_

Section 9.1.  _Survival of Representations, Warranties and Covenants_.

(a) All covenants in this Agreement shall survive the Closing and remain in
full force and effect indefinitely (unless any such covenant by its terms
terminates as of an earlier date). Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each of the representations and warranties contained in _Article
IV_ and  _Article V_ will terminate, without further action, on the date
which is  



 

51  the twelve (12) month anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Anniversary
Date_ ") except for (i) _Sections 4.1_, _4.2_ , _4.8_ , _4.10(a)_ ,
_4.10(d)_ , _4.16_ , _5.1_ , _5.2_ and _5.5_ , which representations and
warranties shall continue until expiration of their respective statutes of
limitations and (ii) _Section 4.14_ , which representations and warranties
shall terminate on the date which is five (5) years following the Closing Date
(the " _Environmental Expiration Date_ ").

(b) The indemnification contained in this _Article IX_ will survive the
Closing and shall remain in effect:

(i) to the expiration of the applicable statute of limitations with respect to
any indemnifiable claim related to the breach of any covenant or the breach
of any representation or warranty that pursuant to _Section 9.1(a)_ survives
until the expiration of its applicable statute of limitations; _provided_ , 
_however_ , that claims for indemnification for pre-Closing breaches of
covenants shall expire on the Anniversary Date,

(ii) until the Environmental Expiration Date for any indemnifiable claims that
are specified in _Section 9.1(a)(ii)_,

(iii) until the Anniversary Date for any indemnifiable claims that are not
specified in _Section 9.1(b)(i)_ or _Section 9.1(b)(ii)_, and

(iv) until the Anniversary Date for any indemnifiable claims that are
specified in _Section 9.2(a)(v)_.

Unless a claim for indemnification with respect to any alleged breach of any
representation or warranty is asserted by notice given as herein
provided that identifies a particular breach and the underlying facts
relating thereto, which notice is given within the applicable period of
survival for such representation or warranty, such claim may not be pursued
and is irrevocably waived after such time. Without limiting the generality or
effect of the foregoing sentence, no claim for indemnification with respect to
any representation or warranty will be deemed to have been properly made
except (i) to the extent it is based upon a Third Party Claim (as defined in
_Section 9.4(a)_) or (ii) to the extent based on Indemnifiable Losses (as
defined in _Section 9.3(a)(iv)_) incurred by an Indemnitee (as defined in 
_Section 9.3(a)(ii)_), and such indemnification claim is made or brought
prior to the expiration of the survival period for such representation or
warranty. For purposes of clarity, claims asserted in writing before the
applicable period of survival for such representation or warranty terminates
shall be deemed timely made regardless of whether litigation or arbitration
proceedings are commenced by such date. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, if either party makes a claim for indemnification
in writing and in accordance with the terms of this Agreement with respect to
any matter for which indemnification is provided under _Section 9.2(a)_ or 
_Section 9.2(b)_ prior to the applicable expiration date as provided in
_Section 9.1(b)_, the indemnification contained in this _Article IX_ with
respect to such claim shall survive until such claim is finally resolved in
accordance with the terms hereof.

Section 9.2. _Indemnification_.

(a) Following the Closing, and subject to the other sections of this _Article
IX_, the Equity Holders, from the Escrow Fund as contemplated by the final
sentence of _Section 9.3(d)_,  



 

52  and to the extent the Escrow Fund is insufficient, the Indemnifying Equity
Holders, severally and not jointly, will indemnify, defend and hold
harmless Parent and its Affiliates and their respective directors, officers,
and agents from and against all Indemnifiable Losses, relating to, resulting
from or arising out of:

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations and warranties
made by the Company in _Article IV_ and the certificate provided pursuant to
_Section 8.2(a)_ of this Agreement;

contained in this Agreement; and

paid under the PrairieWave Communications, Inc. Retiree Medical Insurance
Plan, or (3) the FCC letter of inquiry regarding Customer Proprietary Network
Information, dated October 26, 2006 (reference # EB-06-TC-3302) (collectively,
the " _Special Indemnification Matters_ "), subject to the Special
Indemnification Cap Limitation (as defined below).

(b) Following the Closing, and subject to the other sections of this _Article
IX_, Parent will indemnify, defend and hold harmless the Equity Holders and
their respective directors, officers and agents from and against all
Indemnifiable Losses relating to, resulting from or arising out of: 

(i) any inaccuracy in or breach of any of the representations or warranties
made by Parent or MergerCo in  _Article V_ and the certificate provided
pursuant to _Section 8.3(a)_ of this Agreement; and

(ii) a breach by Parent or MergerCo of any covenant or agreement of Parent or
MergerCo contained in this Agreement.

(c) All payments made on behalf of the Equity Holders (including out of the
Escrow Fund), by Parent or by MergerCo (or any of their respective
Affiliates), as the case may be, to or for the benefit of other parties
pursuant to _Section 3.8_ or _Section 7.6_ or this _Article IX_ shall be
treated as adjustments to the Total Merger Consideration for tax purposes, and
such agreed treatment shall govern for purposes of this Agreement. Parent,
MergerCo and the Company shall file all Tax Returns consistent with such
treatment. As between Parent and the Equity Holders Representative, upon the
settlement or resolution of any claim for indemnification by Parent or Merger
Co while the Escrow Fund remains held by the Escrow Agent, Parent and the
Equity Holders Representative agree to provide joint written instructions to
the Escrow Agent regarding the disbursement of funds to the applicable party,
all in accordance with the Escrow Agreement.

any Person or entity with respect thereto and (y) excluding any such losses,
liabilities, damages, costs and expenses to the extent that the underlying

misconduct of the Indemnitee; _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall
Indemnifiable Losses include any such losses, liabilities, damages, costs and
expenses arising out of or relating to the availability or use of any Tax
attributes of the Company and its Subsidiaries following the Closing.

(b) As between the Company, any Affiliate of the Company and the Equity
Holders Representative, on the one hand, and Parent and any Affiliate of

set forth in this Agreement, except with respect to matters of fraud.
Without limiting the foregoing, as a material inducement to entering into
this Agreement, to the fullest extent permitted by law, each of the parties

54  Indemnifiable Losses incurred by such Indemnitee exceeds $500,000 (all
amounts up to and including such amount, the " _Basket Amount_ "); 
_provided_ , _however_ , that in determining whether the Basket Amount has
been exceeded, there shall not be included any Losses arising from any claim
with respect to which the total Losses are less than $10,000; _provided_ , 
_further_ , that it is expressly understood that claims for indemnification
under _Section 9.2(a)(v)_ shall not be subject to the Basket Amount.

(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the indemnification

Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($250,000) (the " _Special Indemnification
Cap Limitation_ "). The Equity Holders shall be obligated to provide
indemnification from the Escrow Fund as contemplated by the final sentence of
_Section 9.3(d)_, and to the extent the Escrow Fund is insufficient,
the Indemnifying Equity Holders shall be required to provide indemnification
severally and not jointly, for all Indemnifiable Losses that may be asserted
pursuant to _Section 9.2(a)_, subject to the terms and conditions hereof.
Parent shall be obligated to provide indemnification for all Indemnifiable
Losses that may be asserted pursuant to _Section 9.2(b)_. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in this _Article IX _or  _Section 7.6_, all
amounts due from the Equity Holders pursuant to _Article IX _or _Section
7.6_ shall be paid first out of the Escrow Fund and, if the aggregate amount
of Indemnifiable Losses exceeds the Escrow Fund, then each of the
Indemnifying Equity Holders shall, severally and not jointly, pay such
Indemnifying Equity Holders Pro Rata Portion of the amount of such excess to
Parent; _provided_ , _however_ , that (x) such Indemnifying Equity Holders
shall not be obligated to reimburse Parent for an aggregate amount greater
than the Total Merger Consideration, (y) in no event shall the liability of
the Indemnifying Equity Holders for claims of breaches of the representations
and warranties of _Section 4.14_ exceed, in the aggregate, the Environmental
Cap Limitation, and (z) in no event shall the liability of the Indemnifying
Equity Holders for the Special Indemnification Matters, including pursuant to
_Section 9.2(a)(i)_ for breaches of representations and warranties relating
to any of the Special Indemnification Matters, exceed, in the aggregate, the
Special Indemnification Cap Limitation ( _less_ any amounts related to the
Special Indemnification Matters (including for any breach of any
representation or warranty with respect to any such Special Indemnification
Matter) otherwise paid out of the Escrow Fund). 

(e) No Indemnifying Party shall be liable to or obligated to indemnify any
Indemnitee hereunder for any punitive or exemplary damages, or any
consequential, special or multiple damages, except to the extent such damages
have been recovered by a third person (including a Governmental Authority) and
are the subject of a Third Party Claim for which indemnification is available
under this  _Article IX_.



 

55 (f) The Company, Parent and the Equity Holders Representative shall cooperate
with each other with respect to resolving any claim or liability with respect
to which one Party is obligated to indemnify the other Party hereunder,
including by making commercially reasonable efforts to mitigate or resolve any
such claim or liability.

(g) No Indemnitee shall be entitled to indemnification hereunder for any
Indemnifiable Losses arising from a breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement set forth herein (and the amount of any
Indemnifiable Losses incurred in respect of such breach shall not be included
in the calculation of any limitations on indemnification set forth herein) to
the extent that such liability is included in the calculation of the
Estimated Working Capital and/or the Closing Working Capital.

(h) Any liability for indemnification under this _Section 9.3_ shall be
determined without duplication of recovery by reason of the state of facts
giving rise to such liability constituting a breach of more than one
representation, warranty, covenant, or agreement. 

Section 9.4. _Defense of Claims_.

(a) If any Indemnitee receives notice of the assertion of any claim or of the
commencement of any action or proceeding by any Third Party (a " _Third Party
Claim_ ") against such Indemnitee, with respect to which an Indemnifying
Party is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the
Indemnitee will give such Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice
thereof, but in any event not later than ten (10) calendar days after receipt
of notice of such Third Party Claim; provided, however, that the failure of
the Indemnitee to so notify the Indemnifying Party shall only relieve the
Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify the Indemnitee pursuant to
this  _Article IX_ to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is materially
prejudiced by such failure (whether as a result of the forfeiture of
substantive rights or defenses or otherwise). Upon receipt of notification of
a Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall be entitled, upon written
notice to the Indemnitee, to assume the investigation and defense thereof,
provided, however, that the Indemnifying Party shall not have the right to
control the defense if (i) the Third Party Claim relates to or arises in
connection with a criminal proceeding, action, indictment, allegation or
investigation, (ii) the Indemnifying Party has failed to defend or is failing
to defend in good faith the Third Party Claim, (iii) the Indemnifying Party
and the Indemnitee are both named parties to the Third Party Claim, and the
Indemnitee reasonably concludes based on the advice of counsel that
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be or
could reasonably be expected to become inappropriate under applicable ethical
standards due to actual or potential conflicting interests, (iv) in the case
of Losses suffered by a Parent Indemnitee, such Losses would result in
Indemnifiable Losses in excess of Twenty Million Dollars ($20,000,000), (v)
the Indemnifying Party does not, in the Indemnitees reasonable judgment, have
sufficient financial resources to satisfy the amount of any adverse judgment
that is reasonably likely to result with respect to such Third Party Claim,
or (vi) the Indemnifying Party fails to acknowledge in writing that it would
have an indemnity obligation in accordance with the terms hereof for any and
all Losses resulting from such Third Party Claim. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Party elects to assume the investigation and defense of any Third
Party Claim, the Indemnitee shall have the right to employ separate counsel  



 

56  and to participate in the investigation and defense thereof; provided,
however, that the Indemnitee shall pay the fees and disbursements of such
separate counsel unless (i) the employment of such separate counsel has been
specifically authorized in writing by the Indemnifying Party, (ii) the
Indemnifying Party has failed to assume the defense of such Third Party Claim
within a reasonable time after receipt of notice thereof, or (iii) the named
parties to the proceeding in which such claim, demand, action or cause of
action has been asserted include both the Indemnifying Party and such
Indemnitee and, in the reasonable judgment of counsel to such Indemnitee,
there exists one or more defenses that are in conflict with those available to
the Indemnifying Party. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Indemnifying Party
shall not be liable for the fees and disbursements of more than one counsel
for all Indemnitees in connection with any one proceeding or any similar or
related proceedings arising from the same general allegations or
circumstances. Without the prior written consent of the Indemnitee, the
Indemnifying Party will not enter into any settlement of any Third Party
Claim that would result in (A) the imposition of a consent order, injunction
or decree that would restrict the future activity or conduct of, or impose any
non-monetary liability, obligation or commitment on, the Indemnitee or any of
its Affiliates, (B) a finding or admission of a violation of Law or violation
of the rights of any Person by the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, (C) a
finding or admission that would have an adverse effect on other claims made
or threatened against the Indemnitee or any of its Affiliates, or (D) any
monetary liability of the Indemnitee that shall not be promptly paid or
reimbursed by the Indemnifying Party. Any such settlement or compromise shall
include as an unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant of a
release of the Indemnitee and the Indemnified Party from all liability with
respect to such Third Party Claim. If a settlement offer solely for money
damages is made by the applicable third party claimant (which offer provides
for a full and unconditional release of the Indemnitee), and the Indemnifying
Party notifies the Indemnitee in writing of the Indemnifying Partys
willingness to accept the settlement offer and pay the amount called for by
such offer without reservation of any rights or defenses against the
Indemnitee, the Indemnitee may continue to contest such claim, free of any
participation by the Indemnifying Party, and the amount of any ultimate
liability with respect to such Third Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party
has an obligation to pay hereunder shall be limited to the lesser of (1) the
amount of the settlement offer that the Indemnitee declined to accept
plus the Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitee relating to such Third Party
Claim through the date of its rejection of the settlement offer or (2) the
aggregate Indemnifiable Losses of the Indemnitee with respect to such claim.

(b) Any claim by an Indemnitee on account of an Indemnifiable Loss that does
not result from a Third Party Claim will be asserted by giving
the Indemnifying Party reasonably prompt written notice thereof, but in any
event not later than 30 calendar days after the incurrence thereof, provided,
however, that the failure of the Indemnitee to notify the Indemnifying Party
shall only relieve the Indemnifying Party from its obligation to indemnify
the Indemnitee pursuant to this _Article IX_ to the extent that the
Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced by such failure (whether as a
result of the forfeiture of substantive rights or defenses or otherwise). The
Indemnifying Party will have a period of 30 calendar days within which to
respond in writing to such claim. If the Indemnifying Party does not so
respond within such thirty (30) calendar day period, the Indemnifying Party
will be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which event the Indemnitee will
be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the Indemnitee on the
terms and subject to the provisions of this  _Article IX_.



 

57 (c) If, after the making of any Indemnification Payment, the amount of the
Indemnifiable Loss to which such payment relates is reduced by actual
recovery, settlement or otherwise under any insurance coverage, or pursuant to
any claim, recovery, settlement or payment by or against any other entity, the
amount of such reduction (less any costs, expenses, premiums or Taxes
incurred in connection therewith) will promptly be repaid by the Indemnitee to
the Indemnifying Party. Upon making any Indemnification Payment, the
Indemnifying Party will, to the extent of such Indemnification Payment, be
subrogated to all rights of the Indemnitee against any third party that is not
an Affiliate of the Indemnitee in respect of the Indemnifiable Loss to which
the Indemnification Payment relates; provided that (i) the Indemnifying Party
shall then be in compliance with its obligations under this Agreement in
respect of such Indemnifiable Loss, and (ii) until the Indemnitee recovers
full payment of its Indemnifiable Loss, all claims of the Indemnifying Party
against any such third party on account of said Indemnification Payment will
be subrogated and subordinated in right of payment to the Indemnitees rights
against such third party. Without limiting the generality or effect of any
other provision of this  _Article IX_, each such Indemnitee and Indemnifying
Party will duly execute upon request all instruments reasonably necessary to
evidence and perfect the above-described subrogation and subordination rights.

Section 9.5. _No Indemnifiable Claims Resulting From Governmental Authority
Action_. No party has any indemnifiable or otherwise compensable claim that
any of the other parties representations or warranties is inaccurate, or that
any covenant or agreement has been breached, if such claim is predicated on
any new law or any action or order enacted or taken by a
Governmental Authority after the Closing and that is effective retroactively
for periods of time prior to the Closing; provided that the first party had no
knowledge of such law, action or order prior to the Closing.

Section 9.6. _Equity Holders  Representative_.

(a) _Powers_. The Equity Holders Representative shall have full power and
authority to take all actions under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and
any other agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement that are to be taken by the Equity
Holders Representative, and Parent shall not be required to obtain the
consent of any or all Equity Holders in connection with such matters; it
being understood and agreed that Parent shall be entitled to rely in all
respects upon the decisions and actions of the Equity Holders Representative
with respect thereto. The Equity Holders Representative shall be authorized

this Agreement, including, without limitation, executing the Escrow Agreement

all indemnity claims, conducting negotiations with Parent and its agents
regarding such claims,  



 

58  dealing with Parent and the Escrow Agent under this Agreement and the Escrow

this Agreement and the Escrow Agreement, and engaging counsel, accountants or
other representatives in connection with the foregoing matters. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Equity Holders Representative
shall have the full power and authority to interpret on behalf of the Equity
Holders all the terms and provisions of this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement
and any other agreement entered into or document delivered in connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and to consent to any
amendment hereof or thereof on behalf of the Equity Holders in its capacity as
Equity Holders Representative.

(b) _Access to Information_. The Equity Holders Representative shall have
reasonable access to information of and concerning any indemnity claim and
which is in the possession, custody or control of Parent or the

Surviving Corporations officers and employees for purposes of performing the
Equity Holders Representative duties and exercising its rights under this
Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other agreement entered into or
document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, including for the purpose of evaluating any indemnity claim against
the Escrow Fund; provided that the Equity Holders Representative shall treat
confidentially and not, except in connection with enforcing its rights under
this Agreement, the Escrow or any other agreement entered into or document
delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
disclose any nonpublic information from or concerning any indemnity claim to
anyone (except to the Equity Holders Representatives attorneys, accountants
or other advisers, to the Equity Holders and to any other Person on a need-
to-know basis, but only if such other Person agrees to keep such information
confidential).

(c) _Reasonable Reliance_. In the performance of its duties and exercise of
its rights under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement and any other agreement
entered into or document delivered in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, the Equity Holders Representative shall be
entitled to rely upon any document or instrument reasonably believed to be
genuine, accurate as to content and signed by any party to this Agreement, the
Escrow Agreement, any other agreement entered into or document delivered in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Equity
Holder. The Equity Holders Representative may assume that any Person
purporting to give any notice in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement or any other agreement entered into or
document delivered in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement has been duly authorized to do so.

(d) _Orders_. The Equity Holders Representative is authorized, in its sole
discretion, to comply with final, non-appealable orders or decisions issued
or process entered by any court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator with
respect to the Escrow Fund. If any portion of the Escrow Fund is disbursed to
the Equity Holders Representative and is at any time attached, garnished or
levied upon under any court order, or in case the payment, assignment,
transfer, conveyance or delivery of any such property shall be stayed or
enjoined by any court order, or in case any order, judgment or decree shall be
made or entered by any court affecting such property or any part thereof,
then and in any such event, the Equity Holders Representative is authorized,
in its sole discretion, but in good faith, to rely upon and comply with any
such order, writ, judgment or decree which it is advised by legal counsel
selected by it is binding upon it without  



 

59  the need for appeal or other action; and if the Equity Holders

Agreement, the powers of the Equity Holders Representative hereunder are
irrevocable, and any action taken by the Equity Holders Representative
pursuant to the authority granted in the Equity Holders Agreement shall be
effective and absolutely binding as the action of the Equity Holders.

respect any of its representations, warranties, covenants or other agreements
set forth in this Agreement, or if any representations or warranties of the

by an instrument in writing signed on behalf of each of the parties hereto at
