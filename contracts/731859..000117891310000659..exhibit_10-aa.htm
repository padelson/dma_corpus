ACQUISITION  OF ASSETS; ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

    
---|--- 
 

 



 

2.1 Purchase of Assets. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Seller shall, and the Seller shall cause its
Affiliates (to the extent necessary) to, sell, assign, transfer and convey to
the Purchaser, and the Purchaser shall purchase and acquire, assume and
accept, all right, title and interest of Seller or its Affiliates in and to
all of the Acquired Assets, free and clear from any Security Interests (for
the avoidance of doubt, including necessary consents from financial
institutions), other than Permitted Liens.

 



 

2.2. Assumed Liabilities. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, at the Closing, the Purchaser shall assume and agree to pay,
discharge or perform, as appropriate, the Assumed Liabilities and the Seller
shall have no other obligations in connection therewith.

 



 

2.3   Excluded Assets and Retained Liabilities. The Seller shall not
transfer, or be deemed to transfer, the Excluded Assets and the Purchaser
shall not assume, or be deemed to have assumed, the Retained Liabilities.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

8  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.4 Non-Transferable Assets. To the extent that Seller's rights to any
Acquired Assets may not be sold or assigned to the Purchaser without the
consent of another person that has not been obtained at or prior to Closing
or if such sale or assignment would constitute a violation of any contract
constituting or relating to an Acquired Asset, or a violation of any Legal
Requirement, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to sell or
assign the same, and such Acquired Asset shall remain in the Seller's
ownership and shall not be sold, assigned, transferred, conveyed or delivered
hereunder, nor shall any liability constituting or relating to such Acquired
Asset be assumed by Purchaser. Any such Acquired Asset shall be referred to
herein as a "Non-Transferable Asset". In such event:

 

 

2.4.1 Both before and after the Closing Date, the parties shall exercise
their reasonable best efforts to obtain any consents so as to transfer each
such Non-Transferable Asset to Purchaser without modifying, amending or
burdening such Non-Transferable Asset in any material respect.

 



 

2.4.2 To the extent that on the Closing Date there is any Non-Transferable
Asset outstanding, the Seller shall, from and after the Closing Date, use
its reasonable commercial efforts to obtain any such required consents as
promptly as possible, with any expenses involved to be borne by the Party
handling the matter. If any such Consent shall not be obtained or if any
attempted assignment would be ineffective in whole or in part, Seller shall
cooperate with Purchaser in any reasonable and lawful arrangement designed to
provide the Purchaser the benefits and use of such asset for which the
consent was not obtained. Such arrangements may include, with the consent of
Purchaser, terminating the Non-Transferable Asset between the Seller and the
relevant third party and the entry into a new contract by Purchaser with such
third party on substantially the same terms or a subcontract of the Non-
Transferable Asset to Purchaser. In particular, with regard to contracts
which are Non-Transferable Assets, Seller will, to the extent practicable and
subject to applicable law: (i) provide to the Purchaser all of the benefits
of the applicable contract; (ii) cooperate in any reasonable and lawful
arrangement designed to provide such benefits to the Purchaser; and (iii)
enforce at the request of the Purchaser and for the account of Purchaser, any
rights of the Seller arising from any such contract. In addition, with regard
to liabilities falling within the definition of Assumed Liabilities that
cannot be assigned or assumed, Purchaser shall indemnify Seller for all such
liabilities as set forth in Section 12 hereto.

 



 

2.4.3 In the event that Purchaser is provided all of the benefits received by
the Seller under any contract pursuant to the foregoing paragraph, the
Purchaser shall perform and discharge when due the obligations, and assume
the liabilities of the Seller under such contract to the extent arising out
of relating to the Business.

 



 

2.4.4 For the avoidance of doubt, the Non-Transferable Assets, if any, shall
not include any of the consents that are required closing conditions set
forth in Section 5.

 



 

2.5 Further Assurances. From time to time after the Closing, Seller
shall execute and deliver such other instruments of transfer and documents
related thereto and take such other action as may be necessary or reasonably
requested by Purchaser in order to more effectively transfer to Purchaser,
and to place Purchaser in possession and control of, the Acquired Assets.
Purchaser shall take such actions as may be necessary or reasonably requested
by Seller in order to assure Purchaser's assumption of the Assumed
Liabilities.

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

9  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

2.6 Effect of Absence of Consent. Other than the closing conditions set forth
in Section 5 (including without limitation Section 5.2) and without
derogating from Section 2.4 and Section 6.8, the absence of any consent,
approval or authorization of any third party for the transaction contemplated
hereby shall not constitute a condition precedent for Closing, a ground for
terminating or not consummating this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or a breach of this Agreement, and the
Purchaser fully accepts upon itself all risks in connection with the absence
of any such consent, approval or authorization.

 



 

3. CONSIDERATION AND PAYMENT

 



 

3.1. Purchase Price. As consideration for the sale of the Acquired Assets and
the assumption of the Assumed Liabilities by Purchaser, at the Closing, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account designated in writing by Seller, NIS 1,200,000,000 (One
Billion Two Hundred Million New Israeli Shekels) (the "Purchase Price").

 



 

3.2 VAT. VAT shall be added to the Purchase Price, as applicable, and shall
be paid by Purchaser against an invoice issued by the Seller. The parties
will use commercially reasonable efforts to cooperate with each other to
obtain any available reduction or exemption from such VAT or other Taxes
(including, by way of example, assistance with regard to production of any
applicable resale certificate, resale purchase exemption certificate or other
certificate or document of exemption required or appropriate to reduce or
eliminate such VAT or other Taxes) or any available refund of such VAT or
other Taxes. For the avoidance of doubt, obtaining any such reduction or
exemption shall not be a condition to the Closing.

 



 

3.3 Tax Withholding. Purchaser shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from
any consideration payable or otherwise deliverable pursuant to this Agreement
to Seller such amounts as may be required to be deducted or withheld
therefrom under any applicable law, including the Israeli Tax Ordinance,
unless Purchaser received from Seller a certificate or ruling from the ITA
providing for an exemption or other reduction from such withholding or
deduction which can be relied upon by Purchaser and which is presented at
least seven days prior to the time that the applicable payment of
consideration is due to be made. To the extent such amounts are so deducted
or withheld, such amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement
as having been delivered and paid to Seller and Purchaser shall provide to
Seller reasonably requested documentation evidencing such deduction or
withholding.

 



 

3.4   Cash Adjustments. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
and derivative instruments (collectively, "Cash") of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries as of the Cut-off Date shall be retained by Seller as part of
the Excluded Assets (the "Retained Cash"). Any income or losses, including
Cash, of the Business after the Cut-off Date shall be for the account of
the Purchaser. Without derogating from the foregoing, the Purchaser
(i) understands that outside of the operations in the ordinary course of
the Business, the Seller will continue to collect cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities and derivative instruments for the purpose of
consummating the Bezeq Transaction, including, without limitation, through
shareholder loans, shareholder investments and financial loans, (ii)
acknowledges that it has no rights to any such assets (and has no liability
for any liabilities related thereto), and (iii) all such assets shall be part
of the Excluded Assets.

If during the period from the Cut-off Date until the Closing the Business
generates a positive Cash amount, then the Seller shall transfer such
positive amount to the Purchaser as part of the Acquired Assets ("Positive
Cash Amount"). If during the period from the Cut-off Date until the Closing
the Business generates a negative Cash amount and hence such amounts were
financed by the Seller during such period, the Purchaser will transfer such
amount to the Seller within 14 days after the Closing. At Purchaser\'s
request, if the Acquired Assets include cash of less than NIS 10,000,000, the
Seller will provide Purchaser at Closing with a non-interest bearing loan of
up to an amount required to bring such cash to NIS 10,000,000 ("Seller
Loan"), and such loan shall be repaid by Purchaser to Seller within fourteen
(14) days after Closing.

 

 

 

For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 3.4 shall not be deemed to derogate
from Seller\'s obligation under Section 6.1(xi).

EMPLOYEE  MATTERS

    
---|--- 
 

 



 

9.1 Promptly following the date hereof, Purchaser shall make an offer of
continued employment ('haavara beretzef' in Hebrew), effective as of the
Closing Date, to each of the Seller Employees that Purchaser desires to
retain (other than to those employees set forth in Schedule 9.1 who shall
continue to be employed by the Seller), in the form to be agreed between the
Parties (such form and any ancillary document thereto shall be
hereinafter referred to as the "EmployeeNotice"). The Employees who receive
such Employee Notice (and do not lawfully object thereto or, at the request
of either Party, countersign such Notice) are hereinafter referred to as
"Assumed Employees." The Seller shall use its reasonable commercial efforts
to assist the Purchaser in retaining such Assumed Employees.

 



 

9.2 At Closing, Seller shall (a) consent to the transfer of each of the
Assumed Employees to Purchaser and each such employee shall become an
employee of Purchaser, and (ii) transfer and assign to Purchaser, for the
benefit of the Assumed Employees, all education funds (keren hishtalmut),
managers' insurance policies (bituach menahalim) and/or pension funds,
severance pay funds and any other funds, that have been reserved or
contributed by Seller (whether required by applicable law, custom or
agreement) with respect to any of such Employees (the "Seller Existing
Funds") and all of Sellers' rights with regard thereto, and subject to the
following sentence, the Seller shall not have any obligation to complete any
such Funds. It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that to the extent that any
of the Seller Existing Funds at Closing are not sufficient to cover all such
funds to which any Assumed Employee who has chosen not to continue his
employment with the Purchaser is entitled through the Closing Date (by
applicable law or agreement), Seller shall, without any consideration or
adjustment of the Purchase Price, transfer cash equal to the balance required
to complete any such funds to the Seller Existing Funds. Prior to the
Closing, Purchaser shall make (and Seller shall cooperate with Purchaser to
the extent required) the appropriate filings with the ITA for the transfer of
the Seller Existing Funds from Seller to Purchaser and Seller shall submit
all required documents to the Assumed Employees' funds and insurance
policies. Promptly following its receipt of all requisite approvals from the
ITA, and after the Closing, Seller will transfer to Purchaser all its rights
and interests in and to the Seller Existing Funds.

 



 

9.3 The employment agreements of the Assumed Employees and their Funds shall
be assigned from Seller to Purchaser, and the Assumed Employees shall
transfer to Purchaser, as applicable, with continuity of rights, and whilst
taking their employment with Seller in account for purposes of the
calculation of their rights and entitlements.

 



 

9.4 Notwithstanding any non-compete obligations of any Assumed Employee to
Seller, or any Affiliates thereof, all Assumed Employees shall be permitted,
on and after the Closing Date, to engage in the Business only on behalf of
Purchaser and its Affiliates.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

25

benefits as is required by applicable Law, custom or agreement, as well as
liability with respect to any accrued but unpaid vacation pay or benefits,
any withholding or employment Taxes, any other mandatory payments to social
security or otherwise) concerning the Assumed Employees, whereas Seller shall
retain all such liabilities concerning any other employees and will be liable
for all severance expenses of Assumed Employees who resign and are entitled
to receive such severance due to the transaction..

    |  

(c)

    |  

without  derogating from the provisions of Section 11.5, by either Party, if
the  other Party has materially breached any covenant or agreement contained
in  this Agreement; provided, however, that the non-breaching Party may not 
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c) unless  such breach

and any such breach has not been cured within fifteen (15)  Business Days
after written notice by the non-breaching Party to the  breaching Party

terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section 10.1(c) if it is  then in
material breach of the terms of this  Agreement.

 10.2 Procedure upon Termination. In the event the Purchaser or the Seller,
or both, as the case may be, elect to terminate this Agreement pursuant to

terminate without further action of the Parties.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

26  

 

 

 

 

 

 

10.3 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this Agreement as
provided in Section 10.1, this Agreement shall forthwith become void and all
further obligations and liabilities of each party to the other party under
this Agreement shall terminate; provided, however, that (a) neither party
shall be relieved of any obligation or liability arising from any prior
willful and material breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or
agreement in this Agreement that occurred prior to the date of termination;
and (b) the parties shall, in all events, remain bound by and continue to be
subject to Sections 7.2 (Announcements), Section 10.2 (Procedure
upon Termination), this Section 10.3 (Effect of Termination), and Section 15
shall survive any such termination and shall be enforceable hereunder.

 

 



 

10.4 Undertaking to Consummate. The Parties acknowledge and agree that,
except as otherwise provided herein, their obligation to consummate the
transactions contemplated hereby constitutes an unconditional obligation to
procure performance and consummation of the transaction. It is hereby
clarified, that nothing in this Section 10 shall be deemed in any way as
preventing the Seller from seeking specific performance of this Agreement.

SELLER\'S  INDEMNIFICATION

    
---|--- 
 

 



 

11.1 The representations and warranties made by Seller (i) in Section 7
(other than the Fundamental Representations (as defined below)) or in any
other Transaction Document shall survive the Closing and shall expire
eighteen (18) months following the Closing Date and (ii) in Sections 7.1,
7.5, and 6.12 (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall
survive the Closing and shall expire twenty-four (24) months following the
Closing Date (as applicable, the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that
if, at any time prior to the applicable Termination Date, any Purchaser
Indemnitee delivers to Seller a written notice alleging a breach of any of
the representations and warranties made by it (and setting forth in
reasonable detail the basis for its belief that such an incompleteness,
inaccuracy or breach may exist) and asserting a claim for recovery under this
Section 11, then the claim asserted in such notice shall survive the
Termination Date.

 



 

11.2 The Seller shall defend, indemnify, and hold the Purchaser and its
affiliates and their respective employees, directors, officers, shareholders
and agents (the "Purchaser Indemnitees") harmless from and against, and
reimburse the Purchaser Indemnitees with respect to, any Damages incurred by
the Purchaser Indemnitees by reason of or arising out of or in connection
with (i) any breach or inaccuracy of representation made by the Seller as set
forth in Section 7 or in any other Transaction Document, (ii) any failure to
comply with or breach of any covenant or obligation of Seller hereunder or in
any other Transaction Document; or (iii) any claims against Purchaser with
respect to any of the Excluded Assets or the Retained Liabilities, regardless
of when or with respect to which period incurred.

 



 

11.3 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 11 but solely
with respect to clauses 11.2 (i) and (ii) above, the Purchaser Indemnitees
shall be entitled to indemnification only if the aggregate indemnifiable
amounts exceed 25,000,000 (Twenty Five Million) New Israeli Shekels (the
"Threshold Amount") whereupon indemnification may be sought by the Purchaser
Indemnitees from the first NIS.

 



 

11.4 Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Section 11 (including
Section 11.3), with respect to the matters addressed in part I of Schedule
11,4, the compensation provisions set forth in Schedule 11.4 will apply. For
the avoidance of doubt, if a matter would give rise to a right of
indemnification by Purchaser under Section 11 and a right of compensation
under Schedule 11.4, only the compensation provisions of Schedule 11.4 will
apply.

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

27  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

11.5 The Indemnification set forth in this Section 11 shall be
the Purchaser\'s sole and exclusive remedy for the Damages for any breach
of representation. For the avoidance of doubt, breach of a representation by
Seller under Section 7 shall not be grounds for termination or delay of
consummation of this Agreement.

8A.1 (collectively, the "Fundamental Representations") shall survive the
Closing and shall expire twenty-four (24) months following the Closing Date
(as applicable, the "Termination Date"); provided, however, that if, at any
time prior to the applicable Termination Date, any Seller Indemnitee delivers
to Purchaser a written notice alleging a breach of any of the representations
and warranties made by it (and setting forth in reasonable detail the basis
for its belief that such an incompleteness, inaccuracy or breach may exist)
and asserting a claim for recovery under this Section 12, then the claim
asserted in such notice shall survive the Termination Date.

 



 

12.2 Without derogating from any other provision herein, including Section
12.3, in the event the Closing occurs, the Purchaser will indemnify, defend
and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates and each of their respective
shareholders, directors, officers, employees, agents, successors and
permitted assigns (collectively, the "Seller Indemnitees") from and against
(i) any breach or inaccuracy of representation made by the Purchaser or
Guarantor as set forth in Section 8 or Section 8A or in any other Transaction
Document, (ii) any failure to comply with or breach of any covenant or
obligation of Purchaser hereunder or in any other Transaction Document;
or (iii) any claims against Seller with respect to any of the Acquired Assets
or the Assumed Liabilities, regardless of when or with respect to which
period incurred.

 



 

12.3 Notwithstanding any other provision in this Section 12 but solely
with respect to clauses 12.2 (i) and (ii) above, the Seller Indemnitees shall
be entitled to indemnification only if the aggregate indemnifiable amounts
exceed the Threshold Amount whereupon indemnification may be sought by the
Purchaser Indemnitees from the first NIS. For the avoidance of doubt,
any default on the Seller Loan shall not be deemed to be subject to the
Threshold Amount.

 



 

12.4 The Indemnification set forth in this Section 12 shall be the Seller\'s
sole and exclusive remedy for the Damages for any breach of representation.
For the avoidance of doubt, breach of a representation by Purchaser or
Guarantor under Section 8 or 8A shall not be grounds for termination or delay
of consummation of this Agreement.

---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

13.1

    |  

If  a Party seeks indemnity under Section 11 or Section 12 (the
"Indemnified  Party"), it will give written notice (a "Claim Notice")  to
the other party (the "Indemnifying  Party"). The Claim Notice must contain
(i) a  description and, if known, estimated amount (the "Claimed  Amount")
of any Damages incurred or reasonably expected to be  incurred by the
Indemnified Party, (ii) a reasonable explanation of  the basis for the Claim
Notice to the extent of facts then known by the  Indemnified Party, and (iii)
a demand for payment of those  Damages.

    |  

13.2

    |  

Response to Notice of  Claim. Within 30 days after delivery of a Claim
Notice,  the Indemnifying Party will deliver to the Indemnified Party a
written  response (the "Response") in  which the Indemnifying Party
will either:

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(a)

    |  

agree  that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive all of the Claimed 
Amount, and, within five business days of the Indemnified Party's receipt  of
the Response, the Indemnifying Party will pay the Claimed Amount to the 
Indemnified Party in accordance with a payment and distribution method 
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party;

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(b)

    |  

agree  that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive part, but not all,
of  the Claimed Amount (such portion, the "Agreed  Portion"), and, within
five Business Days of the Indemnified  Party's receipt of the Response, the
Indemnifying Party will pay the  Agreed Portion of the Claimed Amount to the
Indemnified Party in  accordance with a payment and distribution method
reasonably acceptable to  the Indemnified Party; or

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(c)

    |  

dispute  that the Indemnified Party is entitled to receive any of the
Claimed  Amount.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

13.3

    |  

If  no Response is delivered by the Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified 
Party within such 30-day period, the Indemnifying Party is deemed to have 
agreed that an amount equal to the entire Claimed Amount will be payable  to
the Indemnified Party within five business days after the expiration of  such
30-day period in accordance with a payment and distribution method 
reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

13.4

    |  

Contested  Claims. In the event that the Indemnifying Party  disputes the
Claimed Amount (or the portion of the Claimed Amount not  comprising the
Agreed Portion), such dispute will be governed by, and  subject to the terms
of, [Section 15.10]  hereof.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

13.5

    |  

Third Party  Claims.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(a)

    |  

In  the event that the Indemnified Party receives notice or otherwise
learns  of the assertion of any claim with respect to which the Indemnifying
Party  may be obligated to provide indemnification under Section 11 or 12 (a
"Third Party  Claim"), the Indemnified Party will provide a Claim Notice to
the  Indemnifying Party as soon as practicable but in no event later than 
five business days thereafter. Such Claim Notice will be  accompanied by
reasonable supporting documentation submitted by such third  party (to the
extent then in the possession of the Indemnified Party) and  will describe in
reasonable detail the facts constituting the basis for  such suit or
proceeding and the amount of the claimed damages (in each  event to the
extent known or reasonably ascertainable by the Indemnified  Party);
provided, however, that  no delay or deficiency on the part of the
Indemnified Party in so  notifying the Indemnifying Party will relieve the
Indemnifying Party of  any liability or obligation hereunder except if such
delay or deficiency  materially prejudices the defense of such claim or
otherwise materially  and adversely affects the rights of the Indemnifying
Party with respect  thereto, and then in each such case only to the extent of
such material  prejudice. Within 20 days after delivery of such
notification,  the Indemnifying Party may, upon written notice to the
Indemnified Party,  assume control of the defense of such suit or proceeding
with counsel  reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party, strictly at
its own cost  and expense; provided, however, that  the Indemnifying Party
may not assume control of the defense of a suit or  proceeding (A) involving
criminal liability or (B) to the extent the suit  or proceeding seeks an
injunction or equitable relief against the  Indemnified Party. If the
Indemnifying Party does not so assume  control of such defense, the
Indemnified Party will control such  defense.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

 

 

 

 

 

 

29  

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

      

 

    |  

(b)

    |  

The  party not controlling such defense (the "Non-controlling  Party") may
participate therein at its own expense. The  party controlling such defense
(the "Controlling  Party") will keep the Non-controlling Party reasonably
advised of  the status of such suit or proceeding and the defense thereof and
will  consider in good faith recommendations made by the Non-controlling
Party  with respect thereto. The Non-controlling Party will furnish  the
Controlling Party with such information as it may have with respect to  such
suit or proceeding (including copies of any summons, complaint or  other
pleading which may have been served on such party and any written  claim,
demand, invoice, billing or other document evidencing or asserting  the same)
and will otherwise cooperate with and, at the request of the  Controlling
Party, assist the Controlling Party in the defense of such  suit or
proceeding.

    
---|---|--- 
 

 



 

      

 

    |  

(c)

    |  

The  Indemnifying Party will not agree to any settlement of, or the entry
of  any judgment arising from, any such suit or proceeding without the
prior  written consent of the Indemnified Party, which will not be
unreasonably  withheld, delayed or conditioned; provided, however, that  the
consent of the Indemnified Party will not be required if the  Indemnifying
Party agrees in writing to pay any amounts payable pursuant  to such
settlement or judgment and such settlement or judgment includes a  full,
complete and unconditional release of the Indemnified Party from  further
Liability with respect to such claim. The Indemnified  Party will not agree
to any settlement of, or the entry of any judgment  arising from, any such
suit or proceeding without the prior written  consent of the Indemnifying
Party, which will not be unreasonably  withheld, delayed or conditioned.

(d)

    |

the breach of  the Bezeq Transaction, the Seller shall be entitled to defend
such claim  independently without derogating from its rights as an
Indemnified Party  hereunder.
