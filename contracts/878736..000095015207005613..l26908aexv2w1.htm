 AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER (this " _Agreement_ ") dated as of July 2, 2007, between MCHCR-CP MERGER SUB INC., a Delaware corporation (" _MergerCo_ "), and MANOR CARE, INC., a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "). 

  

 WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of the Company and MergerCo has approved and declared advisable this Agreement and the merger of MergerCo with and into the Company (the " _Merger_ "), upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, whereby each issued and outstanding share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ "), other than (a) shares of Company Common Stock directly owned by the Company, as treasury stock, or by MergerCo or MergerCos sole stockholder and (b) the Appraisal Shares, will be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration (as defined below) in cash; and 

   

 WHEREAS, MergerCo and the Company desire to make certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the Merger and also to prescribe various conditions to the Merger. 

   

 NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this Agreement, and subject to the conditions set forth herein, the parties hereto agree as follows:

 _The Merger_  

   

 SECTION 1.01. _Merger._ Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, and in accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the " _DGCL_ "), MergerCo shall be merged with and into the Company at the Effective Time. Following the Effective Time, the separate corporate existence of MergerCo shall cease, and the Company shall continue as the surviving corporation in the Merger (the " _Surviving Corporation_ "). 

   

 SECTION 1.02. _Closing._ The closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") will take place at 10:00 a.m., New York time, on the later of (i) the second business day after satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI (other than those conditions that by their terms are to be satisfied at the Closing, but subject to the satisfaction or (to the extent permitted by Law) waiver of those conditions) and (ii) a date specified by MergerCo on not less than three business days notice to the Company, which date shall not be later than the last day of the Marketing Period, at the offices of Cravath, Swaine and Moore LLP, Worldwide Plaza, 825 Eighth Avenue, New York, New York 10019, unless another time, date or place is agreed to in writing by MergerCo and the Company. The date on which the Closing occurs is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Closing Date_ ".  ##### 

 

 

2    

 SECTION 1.03. _Effective Time._ Subject to the provisions of this Agreement, as promptly as practicable on the Closing Date, the parties shall file a certificate of merger (the " _Certificate of Merger_ ") in such form as is required by, and executed and acknowledged in accordance with, the relevant provisions of the DGCL and shall make all other filings and recordings required under the DGCL. The Merger shall become effective at such date and time as the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware or at such subsequent date and time as MergerCo and the Company shall agree and specify in the Certificate of Merger. The date and time at which the Merger becomes effective is referred to in this Agreement as the " _Effective Time_ ".

 SECTION 1.05. _Certificate of Incorporation and Bylaws._ (a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as amended (the " _Company Certificate of Incorporation_ "), shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit A, with such changes thereto as may be agreed to in writing by the Company and MergerCo, and, as so amended, shall be the Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law. 

   

 (b) The Amended and Restated Bylaws of the Company (the " _Company Bylaws_ ") shall be amended at the Effective Time to be in the form of Exhibit B, with such changes thereto as may be agreed to in writing by the Company and MergerCo, and, as so amended, shall be the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation until thereafter changed or amended as provided therein or by applicable Law.

ARTICLE II 

   

 _Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock of the_ 
  _Constituent Corporations; Exchange Fund;_ 
  _Company Equity Awards_  

   

 SECTION 2.01. _Effect on Capital Stock._ At the Effective Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder of any shares of Company Common Stock or any shares of capital stock of MergerCo:  ##### 

 

 

3    

 (a) _Capital Stock of MergerCo._ Each share of capital stock of MergerCo issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Surviving Corporation. 

   

 (b) _Cancelation of Treasury Stock and MergerCo-Owned Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock that is directly owned by the Company, as treasury stock, or by MergerCo or MergerCos sole stockholder immediately prior to the Effective Time shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and no consideration shall be delivered in exchange therefor. 

   

 (c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock._ Each share of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including shares of Company Restricted Stock, but excluding shares to be canceled in accordance with Section 2.01(b) and, except as provided in Section 2.01(d), the Appraisal Shares) shall be converted into the right to receive $67.00 in cash, without interest (the " _Merger Consideration_ "). At the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of a certificate that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Certificate_ ") shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration and any dividends declared in compliance with Section 4.01(a)(i) with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. 

   

 (d) _Appraisal Rights._ Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, shares (the " _Appraisal Shares_ ") of Company Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time that are held by any holder who is entitled to demand and properly demands appraisal of such shares pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with, the provisions of Section 262 of the DGCL (" _Section 262_") shall not be converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c), but instead such holder shall be entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. At the Effective Time, the Appraisal Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist, and each holder of Appraisal Shares shall cease to have any rights with respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such shares in accordance with the provisions of Section 262\. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any such holder shall fail to perfect or otherwise shall waive, withdraw or lose the right to appraisal under Section 262 or a court of competent jurisdiction shall determine that such holder is not entitled to the relief provided by Section 262, then the right of such holder to be paid the fair value of such holders Appraisal Shares under Section 262 shall cease and such Appraisal Shares shall be deemed to have been converted at the Effective Time into, and shall have become, the right to receive the Merger Consideration as provided in Section 2.01(c). The Company shall give prompt notice to MergerCo of any demands for appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the DGCL received by the Company, and MergerCo shall have the right to participate in and direct all negotiations and proceedings  ##### 

 

 

4 

   

with respect to such demands. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
not, without the prior written consent of MergerCo (which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed), voluntarily make any payment with
respect to, or settle or offer to settle, any such demands, or agree to do or
commit to do any of the foregoing.

   

 SECTION 2.02. _Exchange Fund._ (a) _Paying Agent._ Prior to the Closing Date, MergerCo shall appoint a bank or trust company reasonably acceptable to the Company to act as paying agent (the " _Paying Agent_ ") for the payment of the Merger Consideration and the Equity Award Amounts in accordance with this Article II and, in connection therewith, shall enter into an agreement with the Paying Agent in the form reasonably acceptable to the Company. At or immediately subsequent to the Effective Time, MergerCo (or the Surviving Corporation) shall deposit with the Paying Agent, cash in an amount sufficient to pay the aggregate Merger Consideration and the aggregate Equity Award Amount, in each case as required to be paid pursuant to this Agreement (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ "). 

   

 (b) _Certificate Exchange Procedures._ As promptly as practicable after the Effective Time, but in any event within two business days thereafter, the Surviving Corporation shall cause the Paying Agent to mail to each holder of record of a Certificate (i) a letter of transmittal (which shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates to the Paying Agent and which shall otherwise be in customary form) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration. Each holder of record of a Certificate shall, upon surrender to the Paying Agent of such Certificate, together with such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may reasonably be required by the Paying Agent, be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the amount of cash which the number of shares of Company Common Stock previously represented by such Certificate shall have been converted into the right to receive pursuant to Section 2.01(c), and the Certificate so surrendered shall forthwith be canceled. In the event of a transfer of ownership of Company Common Stock which is not registered in the transfer records of the Company, payment of the Merger Consideration may be made to a person other than the person in whose name the Certificate so surrendered is registered if such Certificate shall be properly endorsed or otherwise be in proper form for transfer and the person requesting such payment shall pay any fiduciary or surety bonds or any transfer or other similar taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger Consideration to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate or establish to the reasonable satisfaction of the Surviving Corporation that such tax has been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this Section 2.02(b), each Certificate shall be deemed at any time after the Effective Time to represent only the right to receive upon such surrender the Merger Consideration which the holder thereof has the right to receive in respect of such Certificate pursuant to this Article II and any dividends declared in compliance with Section 4.01(a)(i) with a record date prior to the Effective Time that remain unpaid at the Effective Time and that are due to such holder. No interest shall be paid or will accrue on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of this Article II.  ##### 

 

 

5    

 (c) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Common Stock._ All cash paid upon the surrender of Certificates in accordance with the terms of this Article II shall be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to the shares of Company Common Stock formerly represented by such Certificates, _subject_ , _however_ , to the Surviving Corporations obligation to pay all dividends that may have been declared by the Company and that remain unpaid at the Effective Time. At the close of business on the day on which the Effective Time occurs, the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective Time, any Certificate is presented to the Surviving Corporation for transfer, it shall be canceled against delivery of cash to the holder thereof as provided in this Article II. 

   

 (d) _Termination of the Exchange Fund._ Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the holders of the Certificates for 12 months after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation, upon demand, and any holders of the Certificates who have not theretofore complied with this Article II shall thereafter look only to the Surviving Corporation for, and the Surviving Corporation shall remain liable for, payment of their claims for the Merger Consideration pursuant to the provisions of this Article II. 

   

 (e) _No Liability._ None of MergerCo, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be liable to any person in respect of any cash from the Exchange Fund delivered to a public official in compliance with any applicable state, Federal or other abandoned property, escheat or similar Law. If any Certificate shall not have been surrendered prior to the date on which the related Merger Consideration would escheat to or become the property of any Governmental Entity, any such Merger Consideration shall, to the extent permitted by applicable Law, immediately prior to such time become the property of the Surviving Corporation, free and clear of all claims or interest of any person previously entitled thereto. 

   

 (f) _Investment of Exchange Fund._ The Paying Agent shall invest the cash in the Exchange Fund as directed by MergerCo, or, if after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation;  _provided_ , _however_ , that such investments shall be in obligations of or guaranteed by the United States of America or any agency or instrumentality thereof and backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and Poors Corporation, respectively, in certificates of deposit, bank repurchase agreements or bankers acceptances of commercial banks with capital exceeding $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial statements of such bank that are then publicly available) or in money market funds that are eligible under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. Any interest and other income resulting from such investments shall be paid solely to MergerCo or, if after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation. Nothing contained herein and no investment losses resulting from investment of the Exchange Fund shall diminish the rights of any holder of Certificates to receive the Merger Consideration or any holder of a  ##### 

 

 

6 

   

Company Stock Option, Company Performance Share Award or Non-Deferred Company
RSU to receive the Option Amount, Performance Share Amount or Non-Deferred
RSU Amount, as applicable, in each case as provided herein.

   

 (g) _Lost Certificates._ If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by the Surviving Corporation, the posting by such person of a bond or surety in such reasonable amount as the Surviving Corporation may direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying Agent shall deliver in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the applicable Merger Consideration with respect thereto. 

   

 (h) _Withholding Rights._ The Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of shares of Company Common Stock or any holder of Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company SARs, Company Performance Share Award, Deferred Company RSUs, Non-Deferred Company RSUs or Stock Equivalent Amount such amounts as the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent are required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the " _Code_ "), or any provision of state, local or foreign tax Law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld and paid over to the appropriate taxing authority by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holder of the shares of Company Common Stock or the holder of the Company Stock Options, Company Restricted Stock, Company SARs, Company Performance Share Award, Deferred Company RSUs or Non-Deferred Company RSUs, as the case may be, in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent. 

   

 SECTION 2.03. _Company Equity Awards._ (a) As soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in any event prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering any Company Stock Plan) shall adopt such resolutions and take such other actions as may be required to provide that, at the Effective Time, except as otherwise agreed by MergerCo and the holder thereof: 

    

 (i) each unexercised Company Stock Option and Company SAR, whether vested or unvested, that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder of each such Company Stock Option or Company SAR becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to (A) the excess, if any, of (1) the Merger Consideration over (2) the exercise price per share of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or Company SAR, multiplied by (B) the number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Stock Option or Company SAR (such amount, the " _Option Amount_ ");  ##### 

 

 

7   

 (ii) each share of Company Restricted Stock that is outstanding as of the Effective Time shall become fully vested, with the holder of each such share of Company Restricted Stock becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration; 

   

 (iii) each Company Performance Share Award that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be canceled, with the holder of each such Company Performance Share Award becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration multiplied by the maximum number of shares of Company Common Stock subject to such Company Performance Share Award as of the Effective Time (such amount, the " _Performance Share Amount_ "); and 

   

 (iv) each Non-Deferred Company RSU that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (including any Non-Deferred Company RSU resulting from dividend equivalents) shall be canceled, with the holder of each such Non-Deferred Company RSU becoming entitled to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _Non-Deferred RSU Amount_ "). 

  

For purposes of this Agreement, the term " _Equity Award Amounts_ " shall mean
the sum of the aggregate Option Amounts, aggregate Performance Share Amounts
and aggregate Non-Deferred RSU Amounts. All amounts payable pursuant to this
Section 2.03(a) shall be paid as promptly as practicable following the
Effective Time, without interest.

   

 (b) As of the Effective Time, each Company RSU (including any Company RSU resulting from dividend equivalents) that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time and is governed by terms providing that the shares of Company Common Stock covered thereby shall not be delivered until the retirement of the holder of such Company RSU (each Company RSU governed by such terms, a " _Deferred Company RSU_ ", and each other Company RSU, a " _Non-Deferred Company RSU_ ") (including any such Deferred Company RSU resulting from dividend equivalents) shall be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _Deferred RSU Amount_ "). In the event that the Effective Time occurs prior to January 1, 2008, each holder of a Deferred Company RSU that is outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive such holders Deferred RSU Amount upon the earlier of (i) such holders separation from service (within the meaning of Section 409A(a)(2)(A)) or (ii) the first business day of calendar year 2008. In the event that the Effective Time occurs on or following January 1, 2008, each holder of a Deferred Company RSU that is outstanding as of the Effective Time shall be entitled to receive such holders Deferred RSU Amount within 10 business days following the Effective Time. Immediately following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall deposit the Deferred RSU Amounts into an interest bearing money market account and pay such Deferred RSU Amounts in accordance with this Section 2.03(b) together with interest credited thereon from the Effective Time until the date of payment. Prior to the Effective Time, the Board of Directors of the Company (or, if appropriate, any committee administering the Company Stock Plan under which the  ##### 

 

  

8 

   

Deferred Company RSUs were granted) shall adopt such resolutions and take such
other action reasonably necessary to give effect to this Section 2.03(b).

   

 (c) As of the Effective Time, each Company Stock Equivalent issued under a Specified Deferred Compensation Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall cease to represent the right to the equivalent in value and rate of return to a share of Company Common Stock and shall instead be converted into the right to receive an amount in cash equal to the Merger Consideration (such amount, the " _Stock Equivalent Amount_ "). Following the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall credit such Stock Equivalent Amounts, which credits may then be notionally reinvested, in each case in accordance with the terms of the applicable Specified Deferred Compensation Plan.

set forth in the Confidentiality Agreement and which shall contain a
standstill provision no less favorable in the aggregate to the Company,
and ending contemporaneously with, the standstill provision set forth in the
Confidentiality Agreement;  _provided_ that all such information has

substantially concurrently with the time it is provided to such person, and
(B) participate in discussions and negotiations with the person making such
Takeover Proposal (and its Representatives) regarding such Takeover
Proposal.

 The term " _Superior Proposal_ " means any written bona fide Takeover Proposal that if consummated would result in a person or group (or the shareholders of any person) owning, directly or indirectly, (A) 50% or more of any class of equity securities of the Company or of the surviving entity in a merger or the resulting direct or indirect parent of the Company or such surviving entity or (B) 50% or more (based on the fair market value thereof, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Company) of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, which the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its financial advisor and outside counsel) is more favorable to the stockholders of the Company from a financial point of view than the Merger, taking into account all financial (including the financing terms of any such proposal), legal, regulatory and other aspects of such proposal and of this Agreement (including any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by MergerCo to the Company in response to such proposal or otherwise). 

   

 (b) Neither the Board of Directors of the Company nor any committee thereof shall (i)(A) withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to MergerCo), or publicly propose to withdraw (or modify in a manner adverse to MergerCo), the approval, recommendation or declaration of advisability by the Board of Directors or any such committee of this Agreement or the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) recommend the approval or adoption of, or approve or adopt, or publicly propose to recommend, approve or adopt, any Takeover Proposal (any action described in this clause (i) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ")  #####

cause or permit the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to execute or enter
into, any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in

referred to in Section 4.02(a). Notwithstanding the foregoing or anything
else in this Agreement to the contrary, at any time prior to obtaining the
Stockholder Approval and subject to compliance with Section 5.06(b), the
Board of Directors of the Company may, if, after consultation with its
outside counsel, it determines that the failure to take such action would be
inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, (1) make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or (2) if the Company shall have received a
Takeover Proposal that constitutes a Superior Proposal, cause or permit the
Company to terminate this Agreement;  _provided_ , _however_ , that the Board
of Directors of the Company shall not make an Adverse Recommendation Change,
and the Company may not terminate this Agreement pursuant to clause (2)
above, until after the third day following MergerCos receipt of written
notice (a " _Notice of Superior Proposal_ ") from the Company advising
MergerCo that the Board of Directors of the Company intends to take such
action and specifying the reasons therefor, including the material terms and
conditions of, and the identity of the persons making, any Superior Proposal
that is the basis of the proposed action by such Board of Directors (it being
understood and agreed that (I) any amendment to the financial terms of such
Superior Proposal shall require a new Notice of Superior Proposal and a new
three day period and (II) in determining whether to make an
Adverse Recommendation Change or to cause or permit the Company to so
terminate this Agreement, the Board of Directors of the Company shall take
into account any changes to the financial terms of this Agreement proposed by
MergerCo to the Company in response to a Notice of Superior Proposal
or otherwise). 

   

 (c) In addition to the obligations of the Company set forth in Sections 4.02(a) and 4.02(b), the Company shall as promptly as practicable, and in any event within two business days after receipt, advise MergerCo orally and in writing of the receipt of any Takeover Proposal after the date of this Agreement, the material terms and conditions of any such Takeover Proposal and the identity of the person making any such Takeover Proposal.

The Company shall not take any action to exempt any person (other than MergerCo, MergerCos sole stockholder and their respective Affiliates) from the restrictions on "business combinations" contained in Section 203 of the DGCL (or any similar provision of any other Takeover Law) or otherwise cause such restrictions not to apply, or agree to do any of the foregoing, in each case unless (i) such actions are taken substantially concurrently with a termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (ii) such actions are taken following an Adverse Recommendation Change. 

   

 (d) The Company (i) shall request the prompt return or destruction of all confidential information furnished since April 2007 to any person that previously engaged in discussions with the Company or any of its representatives or Affiliates with  #####

respect to any Takeover Proposal and (ii) shall not terminate, waive, amend
or modify any provisions of any confidentiality or standstill agreement in
its or any of its Subsidiaries favor to which it or any of its Subsidiaries
is a party. 

   

 (e) Nothing contained in this Section 4.02 or elsewhere in this Agreement shall prohibit the Company from (i) taking and disclosing to its stockholders a position contemplated by Rule 14d-9 or Rule 14e-2(a) promulgated under the Exchange Act or (ii) making any disclosure to its stockholders if the Board of Directors of the Company determines in good faith (after consultation with its outside counsel) that failure to do so would be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties under applicable Law, it being understood, however, that any such disclosure (other than a "stop, look and listen" letter or a similar communication of the type contemplated by Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act) shall be deemed to be an Adverse Recommendation Change unless the Board of Directors of the Company expressly and publicly reconfirms its Recommendation at least two business days prior to the Stockholders Meeting.

The Company shall promptly notify MergerCo upon the receipt of any comments from the SEC or the staff of the SEC or any request from the SEC or the staff of the SEC for amendments or supplements to the Proxy Statement, and shall provide MergerCo with copies of all correspondence between the Company and its Representatives, on the one hand, and the SEC or the staff of the SEC, on the other hand.

The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly as practicable to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect to the Proxy Statement and to cause the Proxy Statement to be cleared by the SEC and mailed to the stockholders of the Company as promptly as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement. Prior to filing or mailing the Proxy Statement (or any amendment or supplement thereto) or responding to any comments of the SEC or the staff of the SEC with respect thereto, the Company shall provide MergerCo a reasonable opportunity to review and to propose comments on such document or response. If at any time prior to the Stockholders Meeting, any information should be discovered by any party hereto  ##### 

 

 

37   

which should be set forth in an amendment or supplement to the Proxy
Statement so that the Proxy Statement would not include any misstatement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, the party which
discovers such information shall promptly notify the other parties hereto and,
to the extent required by applicable Law, as determined in good faith by the
Board of Directors of the Company after consultation with its outside

Subject to the ability of the Board of Directors of the Company to make an Adverse Recommendation Change pursuant to Section 4.02(b), the Company shall, through its Board of Directors, recommend to its stockholders adoption of this Agreement (the " _Recommendation_ ") and shall include such Recommendation in the Proxy Statement. 

   

 SECTION 5.02. _Access to Information; Confidentiality._ The Company shall afford to MergerCo, and to MergerCos officers, employees, accountants, counsel, consultants, financial advisors and other Representatives, reasonable access during normal business hours during the period prior to the Effective Time or the termination of this Agreement to all of its and its Subsidiaries properties, books and records and to those employees of the Company to whom MergerCo reasonably requests access, and, during such period, the Company shall furnish, as promptly as practicable, to MergerCo all information concerning its and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as MergerCo may reasonably request (it being agreed, however, that the foregoing shall not permit MergerCo or any such Representatives to conduct any environmental testing or sampling). Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide access to or disclose information where the Company reasonably determines that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (it being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such violation or jeopardization; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the parties hereto nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to make monetary payments or concessions or incur any other liability in connection with the foregoing). Except for disclosures expressly permitted by the terms of the confidentiality letter agreement dated as of April 20, 2007, between MergerCos Affiliate, Carlyle Investment Management L.L.C., and the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ "), MergerCo shall hold, and shall cause its officers, employees, accountants, counsel, financial advisors and other Representatives to hold, all information received from the Company or its  #####

Representatives, directly or indirectly, in confidence in accordance with the
Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 SECTION 5.03. _Reasonable Best Efforts._ (a) Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement, each of the parties hereto agrees to use its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and to do, or cause to be done, and to assist and cooperate with the other parties in doing, all things necessary, proper or advisable to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious manner practicable, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including using reasonable best efforts to accomplish the following: (i) the taking of all acts necessary to cause the conditions to Closing to be satisfied as promptly as practicable, (ii) the obtaining of all necessary actions or nonactions, waivers, consents and approvals from Governmental Entities and the making of all necessary registrations and filings (including filings with Governmental Entities) and the taking of all steps as may be necessary to obtain an approval or waiver from, or to avoid an action or proceeding by, any Governmental Entity, (iii) the obtaining of consents, approvals and waivers from third parties reasonably requested by MergerCo to be obtained in connection with the Merger under the Specified Contracts and Real Property Leases, _provided_ , _however_ , that in no event shall the Company or any of its Subsidiaries be required to pay any fee, penalty or other consideration to any landlord or other person to obtain any such consent, approval or waiver, and (iv) the execution and delivery of any additional instruments necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated by, and to fully carry out the purposes of, this Agreement.

 (c) With respect to any "employee benefit plan", as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA, maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries (including any vacation, paid time-off and severance plans), for all purposes, including determining eligibility to participate, level of benefits, vesting, benefit accruals and early retirement subsidies, each Company Employees service with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (as well as service with any predecessor employer of the Company or any such Subsidiary, to the extent service with the predecessor employer is recognized by the Company or such Subsidiary) (" _Pre-Closing Service_ ") shall be treated as service with the Surviving Corporation or any of its Subsidiaries; _provided_ , _however_ , that such service need not be recognized to the extent that such recognition would result in any duplication of benefits. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Surviving Corporation and its Subsidiaries shall only be required to provide service credit for Pre-Closing Service under a defined benefit pension plan if such plan is a Company Benefit Plan or if such plan has assumed the assets or liabilities of a Company Benefit Plan. 

   

 (d) The Surviving Corporation shall waive any pre-existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and waiting periods under any welfare benefit plan maintained by the Surviving Corporation or any of its Affiliates in which Company Employees (and their eligible dependents) will be eligible to participate  #####

from and after the Effective Time, except to the extent that such pre-
existing condition limitations, exclusions, actively-at-work requirements and
waiting periods would not have been satisfied or waived under the comparable
Company Benefit Plan immediately prior to the Effective Time. The Surviving
Corporation shall recognize the dollar amount of all co-payments, deductibles
and similar expenses incurred by each Company Employee (and his or her
eligible dependents) during the calendar year in which the Effective Time

limitations under the relevant welfare benefit plans in which they will be

 (e) The Surviving Corporation shall take all actions described in Section 5.04(e) of the Company Disclosure Letter. 

   

 (f) The provisions of this Section 5.04 shall not (i) create in any current or former employee of the Company of any ERISA Affiliate any right to employment or continued employment with MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates or any right to any specific terms or conditions of employment or (ii) limit the right of MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Subsidiaries or Affiliates to terminate the employment of any such employee at any time and for any reason.

MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation and the Company acknowledge and agree that all provisions contained in this Section 5.04 with respect to Company Employees are included for the sole benefit of MergerCo, the Surviving Corporation and the Company, and that nothing herein, whether express or implied, shall create any third-party beneficiary or other rights (1) in any other Person, including, without limitation, any Company Employees, former employees of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, any participant in any Company Benefit Plan or Company Benefit Agreement or any dependent or beneficiary thereof or (2) to continued participation in any Company Benefit Plan, Company Benefit Agreement or Surviving Corporation Plan.

 SECTION 5.05. _Indemnification, Exculpation and Insurance._ (a) All rights to indemnification and exculpation from liabilities for acts or omissions occurring  ##### 

 

 

41   

at or prior to the Effective Time and rights to advancement of expenses
relating thereto now existing in favor of any person who is or prior to the
Effective Time becomes, or has been at any time prior to the date of this
Agreement, a director, officer, employee or agent (including as a fiduciary
with respect to an employee benefit plan) of the Company, any of its
Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors (each, an "
_Indemnified Party_ ") as provided in the Company Certificate of
Incorporation, the Company Bylaws, the organizational documents of any
Subsidiary of the Company or any indemnification agreement between such
Indemnified Party and the Company or any of its Subsidiaries (in each case, as
in effect on the date hereof or, with respect to any indemnification
agreement entered into after the date hereof, to the extent the terms thereof
are no more favorable in any material respect to the Indemnified Party that
is the beneficiary thereof than the terms of any indemnification
agreement included as an exhibit in the Filed SEC Documents) shall survive
the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified in any
manner that would adversely affect any right thereunder of any such
Indemnified Party. 

   

 (b) Without limiting Section 5.05(a) or any rights of any Indemnified Party pursuant to any indemnification agreement, from and after the Effective Time, in the event of any threatened or actual claim, action, suit, proceeding or investigation (a " _Claim_ "), whether civil, criminal or administrative, based in whole or in part on, or arising in whole or in part out of, or pertaining to (i) the fact that the Indemnified Party is or was a director (including in a capacity as a member of any board committee), officer, employee or agent of the Company, any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective predecessors or (ii) this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby, whether in any case asserted or arising before or after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation shall indemnify and hold harmless, as and to the fullest extent permitted by Law, each such Indemnified Party against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys fees and expenses in advance of the final disposition of any claim, suit, proceeding or investigation to each Indemnified Party to the fullest extent permitted by Law upon receipt of any undertaking required by applicable Law), judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement of or in connection with any such threatened or actual Claim. The Surviving Corporation shall not settle, compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment in any threatened or actual Claim for which indemnification could be sought by any Indemnified Party hereunder without the consent of such Indemnified Party (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld), unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from all liability arising out of such Claim or such Indemnified Party otherwise consents in writing to such settlement, compromise or consent. The Surviving Corporation shall cooperate with each Indemnified Party in the defense of any matter for which such Indemnified Party could seek indemnification hereunder. The Surviving Corporations obligations under this Section 5.05(b) shall continue in full force and effect for a period of six years from the Effective Time; _provided_ , _however_ , that all rights to indemnification in respect of any Claim asserted or made within such period shall continue until the final disposition of such Claim. 

   

 (c) The Company shall obtain, at or prior to the Effective Time, prepaid (or "tail") directors and officers liability insurance policies in respect of acts or  ##### 

 

 

42   

omissions occurring at or prior to the Effective Time for six years from the
Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with respect to such
coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such policies in effect
on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ , that, without the
prior written consent of MergerCo, the Company may not expend therefor in
excess of 400% of the amount (the " _Annual Amount_ ") paid by the Company
for coverage for the period of 12 months beginning on October 1, 2006. In
the event the Company does not obtain such "tail" insurance policies, then,
for a period of six years from the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall maintain in effect the Companys current directors and officers
liability insurance policies in respect of acts or omissions occurring at or
prior to the Effective Time, covering each Indemnified Party on terms with
respect to such coverage and amounts no less favorable than those of such
policies in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Surviving Corporation may substitute therefor policies of a
reputable and financially sound insurance company containing terms, including
with respect to coverage and amounts, no less favorable to any Indemnified
Party;  _provided_ _further_ , _however_ , that in satisfying its obligation
under this Section 5.05(c) the Surviving Corporation shall not be obligated
to pay for coverage for any 12-month period aggregate premiums for insurance
in excess of 250% of the Annual Amount, it being understood and agreed that
the Surviving Corporation shall nevertheless be obligated to provide such
coverage as may be obtained for the Annual Amount. 

   

 (d) In the event that the Surviving Corporation or any of its successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other person and is not the continuing or surviving corporation or entity of such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers or conveys all or a substantial portion of its properties and other assets to any person, then, and in each such case, the Surviving Corporation shall cause proper provision to be made so that the applicable successors and assigns or transferees expressly assume the obligations set forth in this Section 5.05. 

   

 (e) The provisions of this Section 5.05 are intended to be for the benefit of, and will be enforceable by, each Indemnified Party, his or her heirs and his or her representatives, and are in addition to, and not in substitution for, any other rights to indemnification or contribution that any such person may have by contract or otherwise. 

   

 SECTION 5.06. _Fees and Expenses._ (a) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 5.06, all fees and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement, the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Financing, shall be paid by the party incurring such fees or expenses, whether or not the Merger is consummated. 

   

 (b) In the event that this Agreement is terminated (i) by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(f) or (ii) by MergerCo pursuant to Section 7.01(e), then the Company shall pay MergerCo a fee equal to $175 million (the " _Termination Fee_ ") as directed in writing by MergerCo (A) in the case of a payment required by clause (i) above, on the date of termination of this Agreement, and (B) in the case of a payment required by clause (ii) above, as promptly as possible (but in any event within two business days) following termination of this Agreement, in each case, by wire transfer of  ##### 

 

 

43   

same day funds as directed by MergerCo. In the event that, after the date of
this Agreement, (x) a Takeover Proposal shall have been publicly disclosed or
made directly to the stockholders of the Company generally or shall have
otherwise become publicly known and, in the case of any termination pursuant
to Section 7.01(b)(i) or Section 7.01(b)(iii), not publicly withdrawn, (y)
thereafter, this Agreement is terminated by MergerCo pursuant to Section
7.01(c) or by either MergerCo or the Company pursuant to Section
7.01(b)(i) (but only if the Stockholders Meeting has not been held) or
Section 7.01(b)(iii) and (z) within nine months after such termination, the
Company enters into a definitive agreement with respect to a Takeover
Proposal and such Takeover Proposal is subsequently consummated, then the
Company shall pay MergerCo the Termination Fee (less any MergerCo Expenses
previously reimbursed by the Company to MergerCo pursuant to Section 5.06(c))
as directed in writing by MergerCo as soon as reasonably practicable (but in
any event within three business days) after the date of the consummation of
the Takeover Proposal referred to in clause (z) above, in each case, by wire
transfer of same day funds as directed by MergerCo. For the purpose of the
immediately preceding sentence, the term "Takeover Proposal" shall have the
meaning assigned to such term in Section 4.02(a), except that all references
to 20% therein shall be deemed to be references to 50%. The parties understand
and agree that in no event shall the Company be required to pay the
Termination Fee on more than one occasion. 

   

 (c) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by MergerCo or the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii) or pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(i) at a time when this Agreement was terminable pursuant to Section 7.01(b)(iii), the Company shall promptly as possible (but in any event within three business days) following receipt of an invoice therefor pay all of MergerCos and its Affiliates actual and reasonably documented out-of-pocket fees and expenses (including reasonable legal and other third party advisors fees and expenses) actually incurred by MergerCo and its Affiliates on or prior to the termination of this Agreement in connection with the transaction contemplated by this Agreement (the " _MergerCo Expenses_ ") as directed by MergerCo in writing, which amount shall not be greater than $15 million; _provided_ , that payment of the MergerCo Expenses pursuant to this Section 5.06(c) shall not relieve the Company of its payment obligations under Section 5.06(b), if applicable. 

   

 (d) In the event that this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant to Section 7.01(g), then MergerCo shall pay to the Company an aggregate amount equal to $175 million (the " _MergerCo Termination Fee_ ") as promptly as reasonably practicable (and, in any event, within two business days following such termination) by wire transfer of same-day funds as directed in writing by the Company. 

   

 (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, (i) in the circumstances in which MergerCo becomes obligated to pay the MergerCo Termination Fee, then the Companys termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.01(g) and receipt of payment of the MergerCo Termination Fee pursuant to Section 5.06(d) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of the Company and its Subsidiaries against MergerCo and any of its former, current or future general or limited partners, members or stockholders or against any of their respective former, current or future directors, officers, employees, Affiliates, general or limited partners, stockholders, managers, members or agents (each,  ##### 

 

 

44   

a " _Specified Person_ ") for any loss or damage suffered as a result of the
breach of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained in
this Agreement by MergerCo and the failure of the Merger to be consummated,
and upon payment of the MergerCo Termination Fee in accordance with Section
5.06(d), none of MergerCo or any of its Specified Persons shall have any
further liability or obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement
or the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) in the
circumstances in which the Company becomes obligated to pay the Termination
Fee as the result of a termination of this Agreement by MergerCo pursuant to
Section 7.01(e), receipt of payment of the Termination Fee pursuant to
Section 5.06(b) shall be the sole and exclusive remedy of MergerCo and its
Specified Persons against the Company and any of its Specified Persons for
any loss or damage suffered as a result of the breach of any representation,
warranty, covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement by the Company or
the failure of the Merger to be consummated, and upon payment of
the Termination Fee in accordance with Section 5.06(b), none of the Company
or any of its Specified Persons shall have any further liability or
obligation relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) in no event, whether or not
this Agreement shall have been terminated, shall the Company and its
Subsidiaries, as a group, on the one hand, or MergerCo and the Guarantor, as
a group, on the other, be subject to damages in excess of $250 million (less,
in the case of the Company, the Termination Fee if paid pursuant to
Section 5.06(b) and the MergerCo Expenses if paid pursuant to Section 5.06(c)
or, in the case of MergerCo, the MergerCo Termination Fee if paid pursuant to
Section 5.06(d)) in the aggregate for each such group, respectively, for all
losses and damages (including, in the case of any claim by the Company, lost
stockholder premium) arising from or in connection with breaches by MergerCo,
on the one hand, or the Company, on the other, of their respective
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements contained in this
Agreement or arising from any other claim or cause of action, and none of the
Company, MergerCo, the Guarantor or any of their respective Specified Persons
shall have any further liability or obligation to the other parties or
otherwise relating to or arising out of this Agreement or the transactions
contemplated hereby. 

   

 (f) Each of the Company and MergerCo acknowledges and agrees that the agreements contained in this Section 5.06 are an integral part of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and that, without these agreements, neither the Company nor MergerCo would have entered into this Agreement. If the Company or MergerCo, as the case may be, fails promptly to pay the Termination Fee, the MergerCo Termination Fee or the MergerCo Expenses, as the case may be, due pursuant to this Section 5.06 when due, and, in order to obtain such payment, MergerCo or the Company commences a suit that results in a judgment against the other party for any Termination Fee, the MergerCo Termination Fee or the MergerCo Expenses, as the case may be, the Company or MergerCo, as the case may be, shall pay to the other party its costs and expenses (including attorneys fees and expenses) in connection with such suit, together with interest on the amount of the Termination Fee, the MergerCo Termination Fee or the MergerCo Expenses, as the case may be, due pursuant to this Section 5.06 from the date such payment was required to be made until the date of payment at the prime rate of Citibank, N.A. in effect on the date such payment was required to be made.  ##### 

 

 

45    

 SECTION 5.07. _Public Announcements._ MergerCo and the Company shall consult with each other before issuing, and give each other the opportunity to review and comment upon, any press release or other public statements with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, including the Merger and the Financing, and shall not issue any such press release or make any such public statement prior to such consultation, except as may be required by applicable Law, court process or the rules and regulations of any national securities exchange or national securities quotation system and except for any matters referred to in Section 4.02. The parties agree that the initial press release to be issued with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be in the form heretofore agreed to by the parties. 

   

 SECTION 5.08. _Stockholder Litigation._ In the event that any stockholder litigation related to this Agreement, the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement is brought, or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened, against the Company and/or its directors prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall reasonably promptly notify MergerCo of any such stockholder litigation brought, or threatened, against the Company and/or its directors and keep MergerCo reasonably informed with respect to the status thereof. The Company shall give MergerCo the opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any stockholder litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and no such settlement shall be agreed to without MergerCos prior written consent (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed). 

   

 SECTION 5.09. _Financing._ (a) MergerCo shall use, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the general partner of Guarantor to use, its reasonable best efforts to take, or cause to be taken, all actions and to do, or cause to be done, all things necessary, proper or advisable to arrange the Financing on the terms and conditions described in the Financing Commitments, including using its reasonable best efforts to (i) negotiate and enter into the definitive agreements with respect thereto on the terms and conditions contained in the Financing Commitments or on other terms acceptable to MergerCo ( _provided_ , that such other terms (x) shall not expand upon the conditions precedent to the Financing as set forth in the Financing Commitments or (y) would not reasonably be expected to impair or delay or otherwise adversely affect the ability of MergerCo to consummate the Merger or the Financing or delay the Merger or the Financing), (ii) satisfy (or cause its Affiliates to satisfy) on a timely basis all conditions applicable to MergerCo set forth therein and (iii) consummate the Debt Financing contemplated by the Debt Financing Commitments at the Closing, including using its reasonable best efforts to satisfy the conditions to funding of the Debt Financing required to consummate the Merger at the Closing and to instruct the lenders and the other persons providing such Debt Financing to provide such Debt Financing at the Closing upon satisfaction of such conditions. In the event that any portion of the Financing becomes unavailable on the terms and conditions set forth in the Financing Commitments, MergerCo shall promptly notify the Company and shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain any such portion from alternative sources, on terms that will still enable MergerCo to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and on terms not less favorable to MergerCo with respect to conditions precedent to the Financing than the terms of the Financing, as promptly as practicable following the  ##### 

 

 

46   

occurrence of such event. MergerCo shall deliver to the Company true and
complete copies of all agreements (excluding any fee letters and engagement
letters which, by their terms are confidential, except to the extent any such
letters contain conditions to the consummation of the Debt Financing
(including pursuant to so-called "flex" provisions)) pursuant to which any
such alternative source shall have committed to provide MergerCo with any
portion of the Financing. MergerCo shall refrain from taking, directly or
indirectly, any action that would reasonably be expected to result in a
failure of any of the conditions contained in the Financing Commitments or in
any definitive agreement related to the Financing. MergerCo shall not agree to
or permit any amendment, supplement or other modification of, or waive any of
its rights under, any Financing Commitments or the definitive agreements
relating to the Financing if such amendment, supplement or modification (i)
reduces the aggregate amount of the Debt Financing or Equity Financing,
(ii) expands the conditions to drawdown on the Debt Financing or Equity
Financing, on the Closing Date, (iii) can reasonably be expected to delay the
Closing or (iv) can otherwise reasonably be expected to impair or delay or
otherwise adversely affect the ability of MergerCo to consummate the
Debt Financing or Equity Financing or the Merger, in each case, without the
Companys prior written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed). MergerCo shall give the Company prompt notice of any
material breach by any party of the Financing Commitments or any termination
of the Financing Commitments of which it (or its sole stockholder or
Guarantor) becomes aware, and MergerCo shall keep the Company reasonably
informed of the status of their efforts to obtain the Financing. Subject to
the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Sections 6.01 and 6.02, in
the event that all conditions to the Financing Commitments (other than the
availability of funding of the Equity Financing) have been satisfied,
MergerCo shall drawdown on the Debt Financing required to consummate the
Merger no later than the last day of the Marketing Period. 

   

 (b) The Company shall provide, shall cause its Subsidiaries to provide and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause its and their Representatives to provide such reasonable cooperation in connection with the arrangement of the Debt Financing as may be reasonably requested by MergerCo, including (i) participation in meetings, road shows, presentations, drafting sessions, due diligence sessions and rating agency presentations, (ii) furnishing MergerCo and its financing sources with financial and other pertinent information regarding the Company as may be reasonably requested by MergerCo to consummate the Debt Financing (the " _Required Financial Information_ "), (iii) obtaining the CMBS Deliveries with respect to the CMBS Properties, (iv) assisting MergerCo and its financing sources in the preparation of (A) offering documents and other informational and marketing materials and documents for any portion of the Debt Financing, (B) materials for rating agency presentations and (C) business projections and pro forma financial statements reasonably necessary in connection with the Financing; _provided_ that any such offering documents shall contain disclosure and financial statements with respect to the Company or the Surviving Corporation reflecting the Surviving Corporation and/or its Subsidiaries as the obligor, (v) reasonably cooperating with the marketing efforts of MergerCo and its financing sources for any portion of the Debt Financing, (vi) in connection with the CMBS Facility and Bridge Facility (as such terms are defined in the commitment letter with respect to the Debt Financing), allow MergerCo, its Affiliates or its Representatives and MergerCos financing sources to  ##### 

 

 

47   

perform reasonable and customary due diligence related to such properties,
including appropriate appraisals, surveys, and Phase 1 environmental
assessments and other reasonable inspections and diligence (and
documentation), including as shall be reasonably necessary to comply with any
necessary rating agencies requirements, (vii) reasonably facilitating the
execution and delivery of definitive financing documents and customary
deliverables, (viii) taking all actions reasonably necessary to (A) permit
the prospective lenders involved in the Financing to evaluate the Companys
current assets, cash management and accounting systems, policies and
procedures relating thereto for the purpose of establishing collateral
arrangements, and (B) if reasonably required in connection with the Debt
Financing, establish bank and other accounts and blocked account agreements
and lock box arrangement in connection with the foregoing, (ix) if required
in connection with the Debt Financing, use reasonable best efforts to obtain
waivers, consents, estoppels and approvals from other parties to material
leases, encumbrances and contracts to which the Company or any Subsidiary is
a party and to arrange discussions among MergerCo and its Financing sources
with other parties to material leases, encumbrances and contracts, (x) taking
all corporate actions, subject to the occurrence of the Closing, reasonably
necessary to permit the consummation of the Debt Financing and to permit the
proceeds thereof to be made available to the Surviving Corporation
immediately following the Effective Time, (xi) reasonably facilitating
the pledging of collateral and execution and delivery of definitive financing
documents and customary deliverables and (xii) using reasonable best efforts
to obtain legal opinions, surveys, certificates and title insurance as
reasonably requested by MergerCo; _provided_ that (w) none of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to pay any commitment or
other similar fee or make any monetary payment or concession or incur any
other liability in connection with the Debt Financing prior to the Effective
Time, (x) such requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries, (y) no incurrence of
indebtedness or other obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
under the Debt Financing shall be effective until the Effective Time and (z)
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries shall be required to provide
access to or disclose information where the Company reasonably determines
that such access or disclosure would jeopardize the attorney-client
privilege of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or contravene any Law or
any Contract to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is a party (it
being agreed that the parties shall use their reasonable best efforts to
cause such information to be provided in a manner that does not cause such
violation or jeopardization; _provided_ , _however_ , that none of the
parties hereto nor any of their Affiliates shall be required to make monetary
payments or concessions or incur any other liability in connection with the
foregoing). MergerCo shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse
the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries in connection with such cooperation (as incurred).
MergerCo shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and
their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims
damages, liabilities, costs, expense, judgments, fines and other amounts
suffered or incurred by them in connection with the arrangement of the Debt
Financing and any information utilized in connection therewith. Subject to
Section 5.09(c), all non-public or otherwise confidential information
regarding the Company obtained by MergerCo or its Representatives  ##### 

 

 

48   

pursuant to this Section 5.09(b) shall be kept confidential in accordance
with the Confidentiality Agreement. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding any provision of the Confidentiality Agreement to the contrary (i) MergerCo and its Affiliates may enter into discussions, negotiations, arrangements and/or understandings with third parties with respect to the Equity Financing in connection with the Merger (including exclusivity agreements with potential equity co-investors) to add other equity providers and, subject to the execution of customary confidentiality agreements or arrangements (the " _Equity Confidentiality Agreements_ ") between such parties and MergerCo, may provide to such third parties such information as is reasonably necessary to effectuate such negotiations, arrangements and/or understandings and (ii) in connection with the syndication of the Debt Financing, MergerCo may distribute confidential bank books, bank presentations, Rule 144A offering memoranda, rating agency presentations and similar materials containing information concerning the Company and its Subsidiaries as is customarily included in such bank books, presentations, offering memoranda and similar materials; _provided_ , _however_ , that, in each case under clause (i) or (ii), MergerCo and such Affiliates shall keep the Company reasonably informed with respect to each of the foregoing and shall promptly respond to inquiries from the Company with respect to each of the foregoing. MergerCo shall be responsible to the Company for any breach of any such Equity Confidentiality Agreement as though MergerCo had committed such breach itself, and MergerCo shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, judgments, fines and other amounts suffered or incurred by them in connection with any such breach. 

   

 SECTION 5.10. _Restructuring in Connection with CMBS Financing._ (a) The Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, with the reasonable assistance of MergerCo, use their reasonable best efforts to effect the restructuring described in Exhibit C hereto (the " _CMBS Restructuring_ ") and prepare all documentation and do all such other acts and things as are reasonably necessary or desirable to give effect to such CMBS Restructuring immediately prior to the Effective Time. 

   

 (b) The parties shall use reasonable best efforts to develop the specific steps necessary to implement the CMBS Restructuring and to minimize potential incurrence or imposition of cost, expense or taxes as a result of the CMBS Restructuring, and to otherwise reduce any material negative effect of the CMBS Restructuring on the Company and its business and operations. If either party proposes a potential modification to, or more specific plan to effect, the CMBS Restructuring (a " _Proposed Modification_ "), the other party shall consider such Proposed Modification in good faith, and such Proposed Modification shall be implemented if consented to in writing by the other party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, conditioned or delayed); _provided_ , _however_ , that either party may withhold its consent to any Proposed Modification if such Proposed Modification results in any materially adverse economic or legal consequences to such party (it being understood that, (A) in the case of MergerCo, any such Proposed Modification will be considered to have a materially adverse economic consequence to MergerCo in the event that such Proposed  ##### 

 

 

49   

Modification would be reasonably likely to (i) impede the ability of MergerCo
to complete any portion of the Debt Financing (including the CMBS financing
contemplated by the Financing Commitments), (ii) result in an increase in the
cost to MergerCo or the Surviving Corporation of any portion of the Debt
Financing (including the pricing of and/or any fees relating to any
portion of the Debt Financing (including the CMBS financing contemplated by
the Financing Commitments)) or result in any change of any material term of
any portion of the Debt Financing or (iii) result in any adverse tax
consequences to MergerCo or the Surviving Corporation or any of its
Subsidiaries, and (B) in the case of the Company, any such Proposed
Modification shall not be considered to have an adverse economic or legal
consequence to the Company if such adverse economic or legal consequence
would occur only following the Closing or if such economic or legal
consequence is indemnified or subject to reimbursement by MergerCo). If any
Proposed Modification to the CMBS Restructuring proposed by either party
pursuant to this Section 5.10(b) is consented to by the other party as
contemplated, the term " _CMBS Restructuring_ " as used herein shall be
deemed to refer to the CMBS Restructuring as so modified by such Proposed
Modification. 

   

 (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the implementation of the CMBS Restructuring shall not (i) be considered in determining whether a representation, warranty or covenant of the Company hereunder has been breached (other than the covenants set forth in Section 5.09 and this Section 5.10), (ii) be consummated until MergerCo confirms that it is prepared to proceed with the Closing promptly upon consummation of the CMBS Restructuring unless (A) such implementation can be reversed or unwound without imposing significant or meaningful economic harm on the Company or (B) MergerCo agrees to indemnify the Company for the economic harm to the Company resulting from such implementation, (iii) be consummated or effective (in whole or in part) prior to the commencement of the Marketing Period unless (A) such implementation can be reversed or unwound without imposing significant or meaningful economic harm on the Company or (B) MergerCo indemnifies the Company for the economic harm to the Company resulting from such implementation, or (iv) require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to take any action under this Section 5.10 that would reasonably be expected to cause, individually or in the aggregate, the Company and its Subsidiaries to suffer significant or meaningful economic harm or materially and adversely affect the operations or business of the Company and its Subsidiaries unless MergerCo agrees to indemnify the Company for such harm. MergerCo shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with actions taken at the request of MergerCo to implement or effect the CMBS Restructuring (it being understood that such expenses shall not include expenses incurred in connection with the cooperation described in Section 5.10(a), expenses incurred in responding to MergerCos reasonable information requests made in connection with MergerCos efforts to develop with the Company the specific steps necessary to implement the CMBS Restructuring or MergerCos effort to minimize the costs of the CMBS Restructuring or internal cost allocations) and, in the event the Merger is not consummated, shall be responsible for expenses of the Company and its Subsidiaries in reversing or unwinding  ##### 

 

 

50   

(in the event this Agreement is terminated) the CMBS Restructuring that was
effected at the request of MergerCo. 

   

 SECTION 5.11. _Actions with Respect to Existing Debt._ (a) If requested by MergerCo in writing, as promptly as reasonably practicable after the request of MergerCo, the Company shall commence a solicitation of the consents of holders of a majority in principal amount of each or any series of the Company Notes designated by MergerCo (each, a " _Consent Solicitation_ ") to an amendment to the indenture governing the terms of such series of Company Notes or waiver or amendment of any registration rights associated therewith as may be reasonably requested by MergerCo pursuant to this Section 5.10 (the " _Requested Consents_ ") and/or tender offer for all or part of the outstanding notes with respect to each or any series of Company Notes designated by MergerCo (each, a " _Debt Tender Offer_ "), and shall reasonably cooperate with MergerCo in connection with one or more Consent Solicitation(s) and/or Debt Tender Offer(s) by MergerCo, on such terms and conditions as may be reasonably proposed from time to time by MergerCo.

 (c) Upon the request of MergerCo, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the Requested Consents in connection with any Consent Solicitation. Promptly upon receipt of the Requested Consents permitting an amendment of the indenture governing any series of Company Notes or any registration rights agreement related thereto and upon the request of MergerCo, the Company shall enter into a supplemental indenture or amended registration rights agreement reflecting the amendments to such indenture or registration rights agreement approved by such Requested Consents and shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the indenture trustee to promptly enter into such supplemental indenture or registration rights agreement;  ##### 

 

 

51   

 _provided_ , that the amendments contained in such supplemental indenture or
registration rights agreement shall become effective upon signing, but not
operative until the Closing and, if applicable, the acceptance of the
applicable Debt Tender Offer. The closing of any Debt Tender Offer shall be
conditioned on the simultaneous occurrence of the Closing. Simultaneously with
the Closing and in accordance with the terms of any Consent Solicitation or
Debt Tender Offer, if the Company shall have undertaken such Consent
Solicitation or Debt Tender Offer at the request of MergerCo, MergerCo shall
provide the Company the funds reasonably necessary to consummate such
Debt Tender Offer and/or Consent Solicitation (including the payment of all
applicable premiums, consent fees and all related fees and expenses) and the
Company, if applicable, shall accept for purchase and use such funds to
purchase the Company Notes tendered in such Debt Tender Offer.

 (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, nothing in this Section 5.11 (x) shall require the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to make any monetary payments or concessions or incur any other liability under this Section 5.11 prior to the Effective Time (except to the extent MergerCo agrees to reimburse the Company for the amount of any such payment), (y) may unreasonably interfere with the ongoing operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries or (z) shall impair or delay or otherwise adversely affect the ability of MergerCo to consummate the Financing or the Merger or delay the Financing or the Merger. MergerCo shall, promptly upon request by the Company, reimburse the Company for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in connection with any action by the Company undertaken pursuant to this Section 5.11 (as incurred). MergerCo shall indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its Subsidiaries and their respective Representatives from and against any and all losses, claims damages, liabilities, costs, expenses, judgments, fines and other amounts suffered or incurred by them in connection with any action undertaken pursuant to this Section 5.11.  #####

Merger or the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby), in which
event all references herein to MergerCo shall be deemed references to such
other Affiliate, except that all representations and warranties made herein
