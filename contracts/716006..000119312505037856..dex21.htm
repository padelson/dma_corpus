corporation (" _Parent_ "), Yankee II LLC, a Delaware limited liability
company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent (" _Merger Sub_ "), and USF

_Constituent Entities_ ".

 



RECITALS



WHEREAS, the respective boards of directors of each of Parent and the Company
and the sole member of Merger Sub have approved the merger of the Company
with and into Merger Sub (the " _Merger_ ") and approved the Merger upon the
terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;



WHEREAS, it is intended that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
the Merger will qualify as a reorganization under the provisions of Section
368(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "); and



WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Merger Sub desire to make
certain representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection
with this Agreement.



NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, and of the representations,
warranties, covenants and agreements contained herein, the parties hereto
agree as follows:



ARTICLE I



The Merger; Closing; Effective Time



 

1.1. _The Merger_. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Agreement, at the Effective Time (as defined in Section 1.3) the Company
shall be merged with and into Merger Sub and the separate corporate existence
of the Company shall thereupon cease. Merger Sub shall be the surviving entity
in the Merger (sometimes hereinafter referred to as the " _Surviving Entity_
"), and the separate corporate existence of Merger Sub with all its rights,
privileges, immunities, powers and franchises shall continue unaffected by the
Merger. The Merger shall have the effects specified in the Delaware
General Corporation Law, as amended (the " _DGCL_ ") and the Delaware Limited
Liability Company Act, as amended (the " _DLLCA_ ").

 1.2. _Closing_. Unless otherwise mutually agreed in writing between the
Company and Parent, the closing of the Merger (the " _Closing_ ") shall take
place at the offices of Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P., 666 Fifth Avenue, New
York, New York 10103-3198, at 9:00 A.M. (Eastern Time) on the first business
day (the " _Closing Date_ ") following the day on which the last to be
fulfilled or waived of the conditions set forth in Article VII (other than
those conditions that by their nature are to be satisfied at the Closing, but
subject to the fulfillment or waiver of those conditions) shall be satisfied
or waived in accordance with this Agreement.



1.3. _Effective Time_. As soon as practicable following the Closing, the
Company and Parent will cause a Certificate of Merger (the " _Delaware
Certificate of Merger_ ") to be executed and filed with the Secretary of
State of the State of Delaware as provided in Section 257 of the DGCL and
Section 18-209 of the DLLCA. The Merger shall become effective at the time
when the Delaware Certificate of Merger has been duly filed with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware or at such later time as may be agreed by
the parties and specified in the Delaware Certificate of Merger (the "
_Effective Time_ ").



ARTICLE II



Certificate of Formation and

Limited Liability Company Agreement of the Surviving Entity



2.1. _The Certificate of Formation_. The certificate of formation of Merger
Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective Time shall be the
certificate of formation of the Surviving Entity (the " _Certificate of
Formation_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein or by applicable
Law (as defined in Section 5.1(j)), except that the Certificate of Formation
shall be amended to change the name of the Surviving Entity to "USF LLC".



2.2. _Limited Liability Company Agreement_. The limited liability company
agreement of Merger Sub as in effect at the time Effective Time shall be the
limited liability company agreement of the Surviving Entity (the " _Limited
Liability Company Agreement_ "), until thereafter amended as provided therein
or by applicable Law.



ARTICLE III



Officers and Managers

of the Surviving Entity



3.1. _Managers_. From and after the Effective Time, the persons set forth on
Exhibit A-1 attached hereto shall be the managers of the Surviving Entity
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Limited Liability Company Agreement.



 

-2- 3.2. _Officers_. From and after the Effective Time, the persons set forth on
Exhibit A-2 attached hereto shall be the officers of the Surviving Entity,
with each such person having the offices set forth opposite his or her name,
until their successors have been duly elected or appointed and qualified or
until their earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with the
Limited Liability Company Agreement.



ARTICLE IV



Effect of the Merger on the Capital Stock and

Membership Interests of the Constituent Entities; Exchange of Certificates



4.1. _Effect on Capital Stock and Membership Interests_. As of the Effective
Time, by virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of any
holder thereof:



(a)  _Membership Interests of Merger Sub_. Each issued and outstanding
membership interest of Merger Sub shall be converted into and become an
equivalent fully paid and nonassessable membership interest of the Surviving
Entity.



(b) _Cancellation of Excluded Shares_. Each share of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company (" _Company Common Stock_ ") that is owned
directly or indirectly by the Company as treasury stock or by Parent, Merger
Sub or any other wholly owned Subsidiary (as defined in Section 5.1(a))
of Parent and in each case not held on behalf of third parties (such shares,
collectively with Dissenters Shares (as defined in Section 4.10), the "
_Excluded Shares_ ") shall be canceled, and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.



(c) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to the provisions of
Section 4.4, each share of Company Common Stock, together with the associated
Rights (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) (each share of Company Common Stock
together with the associated Right, a " _Share_ " or, collectively, "
_Shares_ "), issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(other than the Excluded Shares) shall be converted, at the option of the
holder thereof, into the right to receive (x) 0.9024 (the " _Exchange Ratio_
") fully paid, non-assessable shares of Parent Common Stock (as defined below)
(the " _Stock Consideration_ ") or (y) upon a valid Cash Election (as defined
in Section 4.1(d)), $45.00 in cash from Parent (the " _Cash Consideration_ "
and, together with the Stock Consideration, the " _Merger Consideration_ "),
subject to the limitations set forth in Sections 4.1(d), 4.1(e) and 4.1(g).
For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Common Stock_ " shall mean the
common stock, $1.00 par value per share, of Parent.



(d) _Cash Election_. Subject to the immediately following sentence and to
Sections 4.1(e) and 4.1(g), each record holder of Shares immediately prior to
the Effective Time shall be entitled to elect, with respect to each Share, to
receive cash (a " _Cash Election_ "). Notwithstanding the foregoing, subject
to Section 4.1(g) below, the maximum aggregate Cash Consideration shall be
the product of the Cash Consideration  



 

-3-  multiplied by the Cash Election Number. For purposes of this Agreement, the
" _Cash Election Number_ " shall be the amount equal to the product of 50%
multiplied by the aggregate number of shares of Shares outstanding at 5:00
P.M. (Eastern Time) on the second Trading Day (as defined below) prior to the
Effective Time. For purposes of this Agreement, " _Trading Day_ " means a day
on which the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. National Market
(" _Nasdaq National Market_ ") is open for trading. To the extent not covered
by a properly given Cash Election, all Shares issued and
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, except as provided
in Section 4.1(b) and Section 4.1(e), be converted solely into shares of
Parent Common Stock.



(e) _Cash Election Adjustments_. If the aggregate number of Shares covered by
Cash Elections (the " _Cash Election Shares_ ") exceeds the Cash Election
Number, each Cash Election Share shall be converted into (i) the right to
receive an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the product of (A) the
Cash Consideration and (B) a fraction (the " _Cash Fraction_ "), the
numerator of which shall be the Cash Election Number and the denominator of
which shall be the total number of Cash Election Shares, and (ii) a number of
shares of Parent Common Stock equal to the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio
and (B) an amount equal to one minus the Cash Fraction. If the Cash Election
Shares are less than the Cash Election Number, then the right to receive a
share of Parent Common Stock included in the Stock Consideration shall
be converted into (x) the right to receive an amount in cash, without
interest, equal to the product of (A) the Cash Consideration and (B) a
fraction (the " _Stock Fraction_ ") the numerator of which is the excess of
(1) the number of Shares that are not Cash Election Shares (the " _Stock
Election Shares_ ") included in the Stock Consideration over (2) the Cash
Election Number, and the denominator of which is the total number of shares of
Stock Election Shares, and (y) the number of shares of Parent Common Stock
equal to the product of (A) the Exchange Ratio and (B) an amount equal to one
minus the Stock Fraction.



(f) _Computation of Conversion Rates_. The Exchange Agent (as defined in
Section 4.2(a)), in consultation with Parent and the Company, shall make
all computations to give effect to this Section 4.1.



(g)  _Reduction in Cash Consideration_. If, after having made the
calculations under Section 4.1(e), the value of Parent Common Stock (excluding
fractional shares to be paid in cash) to be issued in the Merger, valued at
the average of the high and low trading prices of Parent Common Stock on the
day before the date of the Closing as reported on the Nasdaq National Market
(the " _Parent Closing Price_ "), is less than 45% of the total consideration
to be paid in exchange for the Shares (including, without limitation, the
amount of cash to be paid in lieu of fractional shares or for Dissenters
Shares and any other payments required to be considered in determining whether
the continuity of interest requirements applicable to reorganizations under
Section 368 of the Code have been satisfied) (the " _Total Consideration_ "),
then the Cash Consideration to be paid with respect to Cash Election Shares
shall be reduced and the number of shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued
with respect to the Cash Election Shares shall be increased such that (1) the
aggregate increase in the value of Stock Consideration (as determined pursuant
to this Section 4.1(g)) equals the aggregate  



 

-4-  reduction in the Cash Consideration and (2) the aggregate value of the Stock
Consideration equals 45% of the Total Consideration. The additional shares
of Parent Common Stock to be issued as a result of the adjustment described
in the preceding sentence shall be distributed pro rata among the Cash
Election Shares. For purposes of this Section 4.1(g), the cash to be paid for
any Dissenters Share shall be deemed to have a value equal to the quotient
of (x) the Aggregate Non-Dissenter Value (as defined below) and (y) the total
number of Non-Dissenters Shares (as defined below). " _Non-Dissenters 
Shares_" means the number of Shares minus any Dissenters Shares and the "
_Aggregate Non-Dissenter Value_ " means the aggregate value of (1) the cash
consideration paid for Non-Dissenter Shares plus (2) the product of the number
of shares of Parent Common Stock issued in exchange for Non-Dissenter Shares
and Parent Closing Price. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that
before the Closing Date final U.S. Treasury Regulations that are applicable to
the Merger describing the continuity of interest requirements applicable to
reorganizations under Section 368 of the Code provide that the percentage of
the consideration in a Section 368 reorganization that consists of stock for
purposes of determining whether the continuity of interest test has been
satisfied is to be tested based on the fair market value of the acquiring
corporations stock on or about the date the merger agreement is signed
(rather than on the Closing Date), then no adjustment to the cash and
stock described in this Section 4.1(g) shall be made.



(h)  _Adjustments to Prevent Dilution_. In the event that the Company changes
the number of Shares or securities convertible or exchangeable into or
exercisable for Shares, or Parent changes the number of shares of Parent
Common Stock or securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable
for shares of Parent Common Stock, issued and outstanding prior to the
Effective Time as a result of a reclassification, stock split (including a
reverse split), stock dividend or distribution, recapitalization, merger,
subdivision, combination, issuer exchange offer or other similar transaction,
appropriate and proportionate adjustments, if any, to the Stock Consideration
and the Exchange Ratio will be made to reflect such reclassification, stock
split (including a reverse split), stock dividend or distribution,
recapitalization, merger, subdivision, combination, issuer exchange offer or
similar transaction and all references to the Stock Consideration and
Exchange Ratio in this Agreement shall be deemed to be the Stock
Consideration and Exchange Ratio as so adjusted. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, nothing contained in this Section 4.1(h) shall prohibit Parent from
(i) purchasing shares of Parent Common Stock in the open market in accordance
with Rule 10b-18 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Exchange Act_ "),
(ii) issuing shares of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of its
convertible notes outstanding on the date hereof or (iii) taking shares of
Parent Common Stock as payment of withholding and other taxes with respect to
the exercise of options or the granting or vesting of restricted
stock granted under any Parent Stock Plan (as defined in Section 5.2(e)), and
none of such actions shall result in any adjustment to the Stock Consideration
or the Exchange Ratio.



 

-5- 4.2. _Surviving Entity To Make Certificates Available_.



(a) _Exchange of Certificates_. The Company and Parent shall authorize UMB
Bank, N.A. (or such other bank or trust company in the United States as shall
be reasonably acceptable to the Company and Parent) to act as the exchange
agent hereunder (the " _Exchange Agent_ "). At the Effective Time, Merger
Sub shall deposit with the Exchange Agent for the benefit of the holders of
certificates, which immediately prior to the Effective Time represented Shares
(the " _Certificates_ "), the Cash Consideration, without interest, and
certificates representing the shares of Parent Common Stock (such Cash
Consideration and shares of Parent Common Stock, together with any dividends
or distributions with respect thereto payable as provided in Section 4.3,
being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ") issuable pursuant
to Section 4.1(c) in exchange for outstanding Shares.



(b) _Election and Exchange Procedures._



(i) The Exchange Agent will mail not fewer than 20 business days prior to the
date of the Closing, or cause to be mailed with the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined in Section 6.3(a)), a form of election
(the " _Form of Election_ "), which will include a Form W-9, to holders of
record of Shares (as of a record date as close as practicable to the date of
mailing and mutually agreed to by Parent and the Company). In addition, the
Exchange Agent will use its best efforts to make the Form of Election
available to any Person (as defined below) who becomes a stockholder of the
Company during the period between such record date and the Election Deadline
(as defined below). Any election to receive Cash Consideration contemplated by
Section 4.1(d) will have been properly made only if the Exchange Agent shall
have received at its designated office or offices, by 4:00 P.M. (Eastern
Time), on the Trading Day that is the fourth Trading Day prior to the date of
the Closing (such time being the " _Election Deadline_ "), a Form of Election
properly completed and accompanied by one or more Certificates to which such
Form of Election relates, duly endorsed in blank or otherwise acceptable for
transfer on the books of the Company (or an appropriate guarantee of
delivery), as set forth in such Form of Election. An election may be
revoked only by written notice received by the Exchange Agent prior to the
Election Deadline. In addition, all elections shall automatically be revoked
if the Exchange Agent is notified by Parent and the Company that the Merger
has been abandoned. If an election is so revoked, the Certificate(s) (or
guarantee of delivery, as appropriate) to which such election relates shall be
promptly returned to the Person (as defined below) who submitted the same to
the Exchange Agent. Parent shall have the power, which it may delegate in
whole or in part to the Exchange Agent, to determine, in its reasonable good
faith judgment, whether Forms of Election have been properly completed, signed
and submitted or revoked pursuant to this Section 4.2, and to disregard
immaterial defects in Forms of Election. For the purposes of this Agreement,
the term " _Person_ " or " _person_ " shall mean any individual, corporation
(including not-for-profit), general or limited partnership, limited liability
company, joint venture, estate, trust, association,  



 

-6-  organization, Governmental Entity (as defined in Section 5.1(d)(i)) or other
entity of any kind or nature.



(ii) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time, the
Exchange Agent will mail to each holder of record of a Certificate whose
Shares were converted into the right to receive the Merger Consideration
(other than with respect to Certificates subject to a valid Form of Election),
(A) a letter of transmittal (which will specify that delivery will be
effected, and risk of loss and title to the Certificates will pass, only upon
proper delivery of the Certificates to the Exchange Agent and will be in such
form and have such other provisions as Parent and the Company may specify
consistent with this Agreement) and (B) instructions for use in effecting the
surrender of the Certificates in exchange for the Merger Consideration.



(iii) After the Effective Time, upon surrender in accordance with this Section
4.2(b) of a Certificate for cancellation to the Exchange Agent, together with
such letter of transmittal, duly executed, and such other documents as may
reasonably be required by the Exchange Agent, the holder of such Certificate
will be entitled to receive in exchange therefor the Merger Consideration
that such holder has the right to receive therefor pursuant to the provisions
of this Article IV, certain dividends or other distributions, if any, in
accordance with Section 4.3 and cash in lieu of any fractional share of
Parent Common Stock in accordance with Section 4.4, and the Certificate so
surrendered will forthwith be cancelled. In the event of a transfer of
ownership of Shares that are not registered in the transfer records of the
Company, payment may be issued to a Person other than the Person in whose
name the Certificate so surrendered is registered (the " _Transferee_ ") if
such Certificate is properly endorsed or otherwise in proper form for transfer
and the Transferee pays any transfer or other taxes required by reason of
such payment to a person other than the registered holder of such Certificate
or establishes to the satisfaction of the Exchange Agent that such tax has
been paid or is not applicable. Until surrendered as contemplated by this
Section 4.2(b), each Certificate will be deemed at any time after the
Effective Time to represent only the right to receive, upon such surrender,
the Merger Consideration that the holder thereof has the right to receive
in respect of such Certificate pursuant to the provisions of this Article IV,
together with certain dividends or other distributions, if any, in accordance
with Section 4.3 and cash in lieu of any fractional share of Parent Common
Stock in accordance with Section 4.4. No interest will be paid or will accrue
on any cash payable to holders of Certificates pursuant to the provisions of
this Article IV.



4.3. _Dividends; Transfer Taxes_. No dividends or other distributions that are
declared on or after the Effective Time on Parent Common Stock or are payable
to the holders of record thereof on or after the Effective Time shall be paid
to Persons entitled by reason of the Merger to receive certificates
representing Parent Common Stock until such Persons surrender their
Certificates, as provided in Section 4.2, and no Cash Consideration or cash
payment in lieu of fractional shares shall be paid to any such holder pursuant
to Section 4.4, until such holder of such Certificate shall so surrender such
Certificate. Subject to the effect of applicable Law, there shall be paid to
the record  



 

-7-  holder of the certificates representing such Parent Common Stock (a) at the
time of such surrender or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount
of any dividends or other distributions theretofore paid with respect to
whole shares of such Parent Common Stock and having a record date on or after
the Effective Time and a payment date prior to such surrender and (b) at the
appropriate payment date or as promptly as practicable thereafter, the amount
of dividends or other distributions payable with respect to whole shares of
Parent Common Stock and having a record date on or after the Effective Time
but prior to surrender and a payment date subsequent to surrender. In no
event shall the Person entitled to receive such dividends or other
distributions be entitled to receive interest on such dividends or other
distributions. If any cash or certificate representing shares of Parent
Common Stock is to be paid to or issued in a name other than that in which
the Certificate surrendered in exchange therefor is registered, it shall be a
condition of such exchange that the Certificate so surrendered shall be
properly endorsed and otherwise in proper form for transfer and that the
Person requesting such exchange shall pay to the Exchange Agent any transfer
or other taxes required by reason of the issuance of certificates for such
shares of Parent Common Stock in a name other than that of the registered
holder of the Certificate surrendered, or shall establish to the satisfaction
of the Exchange Agent that such tax has been paid or is not applicable.



4.4. _No Fractional Shares_. No certificates or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates pursuant to this Article IV, and no Parent dividend or other
distribution or stock split or combination shall relate to any fractional
security, and such fractional interests shall not entitle the owner thereof
to vote or to any rights of a security holder of Parent. In lieu of any such
fractional securities, each holder of Shares who would otherwise have been
entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock (after
taking into account all Shares then held of record by such holder) shall
receive cash (without interest) in an amount equal to the product of such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent
Closing Price and rounded to the nearest cent. As promptly as practicable
after the determination of the amount of cash, if any, to be paid to holders
of fractional interests, the Exchange Agent shall so notify Parent, and Parent
shall deposit or cause the Surviving Entity to deposit, such amount with the
Exchange Agent and shall cause the Exchange Agent to forward payments to such
holders of fractional interests subject to and in accordance with the terms
hereof.



4.5. _Return of Exchange Fund_.



(a) Any portion of the Exchange Fund that remains undistributed to the
former stockholders of the Company for one year after the Effective Time
shall be delivered to Parent, upon demand of Parent, and any former
stockholders of the Company who have not theretofore complied with this
Article IV shall thereafter look only to Parent for payment of their claim
for Parent Common Stock, Cash Consideration, any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock and any dividends or distributions with respect
to Parent Common Stock. None of the Company, Parent or the  



 

-8-  Surviving Entity shall be liable to any holder of Shares for the Cash
Consideration, shares of Parent Common Stock (or dividends or distributions
with respect thereto) or cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common
Stock delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable abandoned
property, escheat or similar Law.



(b) The Exchange Agent shall invest any cash included in the Exchange Fund as
directed by Parent; _provided_ , that, for the two-month period immediately
following the Effective Time, such investments shall be in obligations of or
guaranteed by the United States of America, in commercial paper obligations
rated A-1 or P-1 or better by Moodys Investors Service, Inc. or Standard and
Poors Corporation, respectively, or in certificates of deposit, bank
repurchase agreements or bankers acceptance of commercial banks with capital
exceeding $1 billion. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments will be paid to Parent. Any losses resulting from such investments
shall not diminish Parents and Merger Subs obligation to pay the full amount
of the Merger Consideration.



4.6. _Further Ownership Rights in Shares_. All shares of Parent Common Stock
issued, and all Cash Consideration paid, upon the surrender for exchange of
Certificates in accordance with the terms hereof (including any cash paid
pursuant to Sections 4.3 or 4.4) shall be deemed to have been issued or paid,
as the case may be, in full satisfaction of all rights pertaining to Shares,
subject, however, to the Surviving Entitys obligation to pay any dividends or
make any other distribution with a record date prior to the Effective Time
which may have been declared or made by the Company on Shares in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement.



4.7. _Lost Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and, if required by Parent,
the posting by such person of a bond in such reasonable amount as Parent may
direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against it with respect
to such Certificate, the Exchange Agent will deliver in exchange for
such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Cash Consideration and the
number of shares of Parent Common Stock to which such person is entitled
pursuant to Section 4.1 with respect to Shares formerly represented thereby,
any cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock to which such
holders are entitled pursuant to Section 4.4 and unpaid dividends and
distributions on shares of Parent Common Stock to which such holders are
entitled pursuant to this Agreement.



4.8. _Withholding Rights_. Each of the Surviving Entity and Parent shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration otherwise payable
pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Shares and Company Options (as
defined in Section 4.11) such amounts as it is required to deduct and withhold
with respect to the making of such payment under the Code and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, or any provision of state, local or
foreign tax law. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the Surviving
Entity or Parent, as the case may be, such withheld amounts shall be treated
for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the holders of  



 

-9-  Shares and Company Options in respect of which such deduction and
withholding was made by the Surviving Entity or Parent, as the case may be.



4.9. _Closing of the Company Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time,
the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed and no transfer of
Shares shall thereafter be made. If, after the Effective Time, Certificates
are presented to the Surviving Entity, they shall be canceled and exchanged as
provided in this Article IV.



4.10. _Dissenters  Shares_. Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement
to the contrary, Shares that are issued and outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time and held by holders of such Shares who exercise appraisal
rights with respect thereto in accordance with applicable provisions of the
DGCL, including, without limitation, Section 262 thereof (the " _Dissenters 
Shares_") will not be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, and holders of such Dissenters Shares will be entitled to
receive payment of the appraised value of such Dissenters Shares in
accordance with those provisions unless and until such holders fail to perfect
or effectively withdraw or lose their rights to appraisal and payment under
the DGCL. If, after the Effective Time, any such holder fails to perfect or
effectively withdraws or loses such rights to appraisal and payment under the
DGCL, such Dissenters Shares will thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted into and to have become exchangeable for, at the Effective
Time, the right to receive the Merger Consideration, without any interest
thereon. The Company shall give Parent prompt notice of any demands received
by the Company for appraisals of Shares. The Company shall not, except with
the prior written consent of Parent, make any payment with respect to any
demands for appraisal or offer to settle or settle any such demands.
Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if Parent or
the Company abandons or is finally enjoined or prevented from carrying out the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated under this Agreement, the right
of each holder of Dissenters Shares to receive payment of the appraised
value of Shares as provided herein shall terminate, effective as of the time
of such abandonment, injunction, prevention or rescission.



4.11. _Treatment of Stock Options, Restricted Stock and Phantom Stock Awards_.



(a) _Treatment of Stock Options_ _._ Each option to purchase Shares granted
under a Company Stock Plan (as defined in Section 5.1(b)) that is outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (a " _Company Option_ ") shall become
fully vested and fully exercisable at the Effective Time. At the Effective
Time, subject to the provisions of Section 4.4, each unexercised Company
Option with an exercise price that is less than the Deemed Per Share Merger
Consideration (as defined below) shall be cancelled and the holder of such
Company Option shall be entitled to receive cash from the Company in an
amount equal to (x) the Deemed Per Share Merger Consideration minus the
exercise price per Share under the Company Option, multiplied by (y) the
number of Shares subject to the Company Option. For purposes of this Section
4.11, the " _Deemed Per Share Merger Consideration_ " shall be equal to (x)
one-half the Cash  



 

-10-  Consideration plus (y) one-half the Exchange Ratio multiplied by the Parent
Closing Price. The Company shall withhold from such cash payment, and pay over
to the appropriate taxing authorities, all amounts the Company is required to
withhold under federal and, if applicable, state tax laws. At the Effective
Time, each Company Option with an exercise price that is equal to or greater
than the Deemed Per Share Merger Consideration shall be cancelled and the
holder of such Company Option shall not be entitled to receive any
consideration for such Company Option. As soon as practicable after the date
of this Agreement, the Company Board (as defined in Section 5.1(c)(ii)) and
any committee of the Company Board administering the Company Stock Plans shall
use their respective reasonable best efforts to take any action necessary to
accomplish the foregoing, including obtaining any required consents from any
Person.



(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_ _._ Each share of restricted stock
granted under a Company Stock Plan that is outstanding immediately prior to
the Effective Time (a " _Restricted Share_ ") shall become fully vested and
all restrictions relating to such Restricted Shares shall lapse at the
Effective Time. The holder of each Restricted Share shall receive the Form of
Election in accordance with Section 4.2(b)(i) and each Restricted Share shall
otherwise be treated as all other outstanding Shares in accordance with
Section 4.1(c) above. As soon as practicable after the date of this Agreement,
the Company Board and any committee of the Company Board administering the
Company Stock Plans shall use their respective reasonable best efforts to
take any action necessary to accomplish the foregoing, including obtaining
any required consents from any Person.



(c) _Treatment of Phantom Stock_ _._ At the Effective Time, each PSU (as
defined in Section 5.1(b)) granted under a Company Stock Plan or
under another agreement shall become fully vested and the Company shall pay
the holder of such PSU a cash amount equal to the Deemed Per Share Merger
Consideration multiplied by the number of Shares credited under each PSU.
Fractional shares may be deemed credited under the awards. The Company shall
withhold from such cash payment, and pay over to the appropriate taxing
authorities, all amounts the Company is required to withhold under federal
and, if applicable, state tax laws. As soon as practicable after the date of
this Agreement, the Company Board and any committee of the Company Board
administering the Company Stock Plans shall use their respective reasonable
best efforts to take any action necessary to accomplish the
foregoing, including obtaining required consents from any Person.



ARTICLE V



Representations and Warranties



5.1. _Representations and Warranties of the Company_. Except as set forth in
the disclosure letter delivered to Parent by the Company prior to entering
into this Agreement (the " _Company Disclosure Letter_ ") (with specific
reference to the Section or Subsection of this Agreement to which
the information stated in such disclosure relates;  



 

-11-   _provided_ , that any fact or condition disclosed in any section of the
Company Disclosure Letter in such a way as to make its relevance to
a representation or representations made elsewhere in this Agreement or
information called for by another section of the Company Disclosure Letter
reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be an exception to such representation
or representations or to be disclosed in such other section of the Company
Disclosure Letter notwithstanding the omission of a reference or cross
reference thereto) the Company hereby represents and warrants to Parent and
Merger Sub that:



(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of the Company and
its Subsidiaries (as defined below) is a corporation, limited liability
company or partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing

its properties and assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted.
Each of the Company and its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and is in
good standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the
ownership or operation of its assets or properties or conduct of its business
requires such qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in
good standing, when taken together with all other such failures, is not
reasonably likely to have a Company Material Adverse Effect (as defined
below). The Company has made available to Parent a complete and correct copy
of the Companys and its material Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation
and bylaws or the charter documents, bylaws or similar governing agreements,
each as amended to the date of this Agreement and as in full force and effect
on the date of this Agreement.



As used in this Agreement, the term (i) " _Subsidiary_ " means, with respect
to the Company, Parent or Merger Sub, as the case may be, any entity, whether
incorporated or unincorporated, of which at least a majority of the securities
or ownership interests having by their terms voting power to elect a
majority of the board of directors or other persons performing similar
functions is directly or indirectly owned or controlled by such party or by
one or more of its respective Subsidiaries and (ii) " _Company Material
Adverse Effect_ " means a material adverse effect on the financial condition,
properties, business or results of operations of the Company and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole, excluding such effects resulting from or
arising in connection with:



(A) changes that are the result of general economic, capital market,
regulatory, political or business conditions or acts of war or terrorism;



(B) changes that are the result of factors generally affecting the industries
or markets in which the Company operates to the extent such changes do not
disproportionately affect the Company and its Subsidiaries as compared to the
typical company operating in such industry or market;



(C) changes in the Companys relationships with its employees or with any
labor organization or other representative of such employees, or any adverse
change, effect or circumstance resulting from or arising in connection with
any  



 

-12-  union certification or decertification petition, union authorization
campaign, grievance or arbitration proceeding or other labor-related
proceeding or litigation, labor strike, slowdown, work stoppage or other
labor controversy that is threatened to occur or occurs after the date of this
Agreement;



(D) any adverse change, effect or circumstance resulting from entering into
this Agreement or the announcement thereof or the pendency or consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby;



(E) changes in applicable law, rule or regulations or generally accepted
accounting principles or the interpretation thereof after the date of this
Agreement; and



(F) any out of pocket expenses (including filing fees and legal expenses
specifically with respect to any litigation arising from the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement) directly incurred in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in accordance with its terms.

_PSU_ ") outstanding, each PSU reflecting the value of one Share. The Company
 



 

-13-  has no outstanding stock appreciation rights (" _SARS_ "). Except for the
issuance of shares pursuant to Company Options outstanding on February 24,
2005, between February 24, 2005 and the date of this Agreement, the Company
has not (i) issued any Shares, Company Options, PSUs or other capital stock or

capital of the Company. Except as set forth above, no shares of capital stock
or other equity or voting securities of the Company are reserved for issuance
or are outstanding. The Company Common Stock is listed on the Nasdaq National
Market. All of the outstanding Shares have been duly authorized and are, and
all Shares issuable upon the exercise of Company Options or stock awards will
be when issued thereunder, validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable and
are not subject to any preemptive rights. Each of the outstanding shares of
capital stock or other securities or ownership interests of each of the
Companys Subsidiaries is duly authorized, validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and owned of record and beneficially by the Company or by a
direct or indirect wholly owned Subsidiary of the Company, free and clear of
any lien, mortgage, pledge, security interest, charge, claim or other
encumbrance of any kind or nature (" _Lien_ ") and such shares of capital
stock or other securities were not issued in violation of any preemptive
rights or other preferential rights of subscription or purchase of any Person
other than those that have been waived or otherwise cured or satisfied.
Section 5.1(b) of the Company Disclosure Letter sets forth (x) each of the
Companys Subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the Company in each of
such Subsidiaries, as well as the ownership interest of any other Person or
Persons in each of such Subsidiaries, and (y) the Companys or its
Subsidiaries capital stock, equity interest or other direct or indirect
ownership interest in any other corporation, partnership, association, joint
venture, limited liability company or other entity, as well as the ownership
interest of any other Person or Persons in each such corporation, partnership,
association, joint venture, limited liability company or other entity. Except
as set forth above and pursuant to the Rights Agreement, there are no
preemptive or other outstanding rights, options, warrants, conversion rights,
stock appreciation rights, redemption rights, repurchase rights, agreements,
arrangements, calls, commitments or rights of any kind that obligate the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to issue, deliver or sell, or cause to be
issued, delivered or sold, any shares of capital stock or other securities of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any securities or obligations
convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for, or giving any Person a
right to subscribe for or acquire, any securities of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, and no securities or obligations evidencing such rights are
authorized, issued or outstanding. The Company does not have outstanding any
bonds, debentures, notes or other obligations the holders of which have the
right to vote (or convertible into or exercisable for securities having the
right to vote) with the stockholders of the Company on any matter (" _Voting
Debt_ "). The Company does not own, directly or indirectly, any voting
interest in any Person that may require a filing by Parent under the Hart-
Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended (the " _HSR Act_
"). Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
stockholder agreement, voting trust or other agreement with respect to the
voting of Shares.



 

-14- (c) _Corporate Authority; Approval and Fairness_. (i) The Company has all
requisite corporate power and authority and has taken all corporate action
necessary in order to execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this
Agreement, and, subject only to approval of this Agreement by the holders of a
majority of the outstanding Shares entitled to vote on such approval at the
Company Stockholders Meeting (the " _Company Stockholder Approval_ "), to
consummate the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby. This
Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Company and is a valid
and binding agreement of the Company enforceable against the Company in
accordance with its terms, subject to (i) bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent
transfer, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other
similar laws or judicial decisions now or hereafter in effect relating to or
affecting creditors rights and to general equity principles and (ii) the

to make all certifications required under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the

forth in the disclosure letter delivered to the Company by Parent prior to
entering into this Agreement (the " _Parent Disclosure Letter_ ") (with
specific reference to the Section or Subsection of this Agreement to which the

condition disclosed in any section of the Parent Disclosure Letter in such a
way as to make its relevance to a representation or representations made
elsewhere in this Agreement or information called for by another section of
the Parent Disclosure Letter reasonably apparent shall be deemed to be an
exception to such representation or representations or to be disclosed in such
other section of the Parent Disclosure Letter notwithstanding the omission of
a reference or cross reference thereto), Parent and Merger Sub each hereby
represent and warrant to the Company that:



(a) _Organization, Good Standing and Qualification_. Each of Parent and its
Subsidiaries is a corporation, limited liability company or partnership duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the Laws of its
respective jurisdiction of organization and has all requisite corporate or
similar power and authority to own, lease and operate its properties and
assets and to carry on its business as presently conducted. Each of Parent
and its Subsidiaries is qualified to do business and is in good standing as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the ownership or operation of
its assets or properties or conduct of its business requires such
qualification, except where the failure to be so qualified or in good
standing, when taken together with all other such failures, is not reasonably
likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect (as defined below). Parent
has made available to the Company a complete and correct copy of Parents and
its material Subsidiaries certificates of incorporation and bylaws or the
charter documents, bylaws or similar governing agreements, each as amended to
the date of this Agreement and as in full force and effect on the date of
this Agreement.



As used in this Agreement, the term " _Parent Material Adverse Effect_ " means
a material adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, business or
results of operations of the Parent and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole,
excluding such effects resulting from or arising in connection with:

regulatory, political or business conditions or acts of war or terrorism;

disproportionately affect Parent and its Subsidiaries as compared to the
typical company operating in such industry or market;



(iii) changes in Parents relationships with its employees or with any labor
organization or other representative of such employees, or any adverse
change, effect or circumstance resulting from or arising in connection with

related proceeding or litigation, labor strike, slowdown, work stoppage or
other labor controversy that is threatened to occur or occurs after the date
of this Agreement;



(iv) any adverse change, effect or circumstance resulting from entering into
this Agreement or the announcement thereof or the pendency or consummation of

Voting Debt_ "). Neither Parent nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to any
stockholder agreement, voting trust or other agreement with respect to the
voting of shares of Parent Common Stock.

(i) Each of Parent and Merger Sub has all requisite corporate power
and authority and has taken all corporate action necessary in order to
execute, deliver and perform its obligations under this Agreement and, subject
only to the approval of the issuance of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the
Merger (the " _Share Issuance_ ") by the

Common Stock are present in person or by proxy (the " _Parent Stockholder

the Parent Board and may not be relied on by the Company. Each director and

to permit it to issue the number of shares of Parent Common Stock required to

Agreement by Parent and Merger Sub and the consummation by Parent  



 

-32-  and Merger Sub of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby,
except those that the failure to make or obtain are not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.



(ii) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement by Parent
and Merger Sub do not, and the consummation by Parent and Merger Sub of the
Merger and the other transactions contemplated hereby and compliance with the
provisions hereof will not, constitute or result in (A) a breach or violation
of, or a default under, the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Parent,
the certificate of formation or limited liability company agreement of Merger
Sub or the charter documents, bylaws or similar governing agreements of any of
its Subsidiaries, (B) a breach or violation of, a termination (or right of
termination) or a default under, the acceleration of any obligations or the
creation of a Lien on the assets or properties of Parent or any of its
Subsidiaries (with or without notice, lapse of time or both) pursuant to any
Contracts binding upon Parent or any of its Subsidiaries or any Laws or
governmental or non-governmental permit or license to which Parent any of its
Subsidiaries is subject or (C) any change in the rights or obligations of
any party under any of such Contracts except, in the case of clause (B) or
(C) above, for any breach, violation, termination, default, acceleration or

ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement.



(iii) Each oral or written material contract required to be filed by Parent
pursuant to Item 601(a) of SEC Regulation S-K as of the date of this

this Agreement.



(f) _Parent Reports; Financial Statements_. (i) Parent has delivered to the
Company each registration statement, report, proxy statement or information
statement prepared by the Parent since December 31, 2003, or each such
document is available on the SECs website, including (i) Parents Annual

Parents Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q for the periods ended March 31, 2004,

annexes and any amendments thereto) filed with the SEC (collectively,
including any such reports filed subsequent to the date of this Agreement,

the date of such amendment), the Parent Reports did not, and any Parent
Reports filed with the SEC subsequent to the date of this Agreement will not,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements made
therein, in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not
misleading. Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or
incorporated by reference into the Parent Reports (including the related notes
and schedules) fairly  



 

-33-  presents, or will fairly present, the consolidated financial position of
Parent and its Subsidiaries as of its date and each of the consolidated

audit adjustments that will not be material in amount or effect), in each

corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq National Market.
Parents disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Sections 13a-14(c)
and 15d-14(c) of the Exchange Act) effectively enable Parent to comply with,
and the appropriate officers of Parent to make all certifications required
under, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. To the Knowledge of Parent, Parent did not, as

ordinary course of such businesses consistent with past practice and there
has not been (i) any change in the financial condition, properties, business
or results of operations of Parent and its Subsidiaries or any development or

Parent Material Adverse Effect or prevent or materially impair the ability of
Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement; (ii)
any material damage, destruction or other casualty loss with respect to any
material asset or property owned, leased or otherwise used by Parent or any of

or property in respect of the capital stock of Parent, except for dividends or
other distributions on its capital stock publicly announced prior to the date
of this Agreement and except as expressly permitted hereby; (iv) any change by
Parent in accounting principles or any material accounting practices or
methods; or (v) any action that, if it would have occurred immediately after
the date of this Agreement, would have violated or been inconsistent with,
the provisions of Section  



 

-34-  6.1(b). For purposes of this Agreement, " _Parent Balance Sheet Date_ "
means September 30, 2004.



(h) _Litigation_. There are no civil, criminal or administrative actions,
suits, claims, hearings, investigations or proceedings pending or, to the
Knowledge of Parent (as defined in Section 9.13(b)), threatened against Parent
or any of its Subsidiaries, except for those that are not, individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably likely to have a Parent Material Adverse Effect or
prevent or materially impair the ability of Parent or Merger Sub to consummate
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

that the foregoing restriction shall  



 

-48-  not apply to transactions to which the HSR Act does not apply) or $120
million in the aggregate (determined, in each case, in accordance with Section
801.10 of the regulations adopted under the HSR Act); or (III) enter into any
other transaction or take any other action that would reasonably be expected
to (x) adversely affect Parents ability to use available funds to perform all
of its obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Merger or (y)
otherwise prevent, materially delay or materially impair the ability of Parent
or Merger Sub to consummate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement;



(E) recapitalize, reorganize or completely or partially liquidate Parent or

applicable Law or GAAP; or



(H) authorize any of, or commit or agree to take any of, the foregoing
actions.



(ii) _Other Actions_. Neither Parent nor Merger Sub shall take any action or
omit to take any action that could reasonably be expected to cause any of the
representations and warranties of Parent and Merger Sub set forth in this
Agreement to become untrue in any material respect.



(c) _Interim Operations of Merger Sub_. During the period from the date of
this Agreement to the Effective Time, Merger Sub shall not engage in any
activities of any nature except as provided in or contemplated by this
Agreement. 



6.2. _Acquisition Proposals_.



(a) _No Solicitation or Negotiation_. The Company hereby covenants
that, except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, the Company shall
not, and the Company shall instruct and use its reasonable best efforts to
cause its officers, directors, employees, investment bankers, attorneys,
accountants and other advisors or representatives (such officers, directors,
employees, investment bankers, attorneys, accountants and other advisors or
representatives, collectively, " _Representatives_ ") not to, directly or
indirectly, and on becoming aware of, shall take reasonable action to stop
its Representatives from continuing to:



(i) solicit, initiate or encourage any inquiries or the making of any proposal
or offer that constitutes, or could reasonably be expected to lead to, any
Acquisition Proposal (as defined in Section 6.2(e)); or 



 

-49- (ii) enter into, or participate in any discussions or negotiations regarding,
or furnish to any Person any non-public information for the purpose of
encouraging or facilitating, any Acquisition Proposal.



The Company shall, and shall direct its Representatives to, cease immediately
and cause to be terminated all discussions and negotiations that commenced
prior to the date of this Agreement regarding any Acquisition Proposal
existing on the date of this Agreement.



Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement the
Company may, to the extent the Company Board determines in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel, that such action is likely required under
applicable Law, in response to (A) a Superior Proposal (as defined in Section
6.2(e)) or (B) a bona fide, unsolicited written Acquisition Proposal that the
Company Board determines in good faith after consultation with outside counsel
and its financial advisor could lead to a Superior Proposal (any such
Acquisition Proposal, a " _Potential Superior Proposal_ "), (1) furnish
information with respect to the Company to the Person making such Superior
Proposal or Potential Superior Proposal and its Representatives pursuant to a
customary confidentiality agreement not less restrictive of the other party
(except that it need not include any "standstill" provisions) than the
Confidentiality Agreement, dated January 13, 2005, between Parent and the
Company (the " _Confidentiality Agreement_ ") ( _provided_ , _however_ , that,
to the extent any such confidentiality agreement does not contain any
"standstill" provisions, the Confidentiality Agreement shall be automatically
amended (without any further action by the parties) such that the "standstill"
provisions in the Confidentiality Agreement restricting activities of Parent
and its Subsidiaries shall be deleted), and (2) participate in discussions or
negotiations (including solicitation of such a revised Superior Proposal or
Potential Superior Proposal) with such Person and its Representatives
regarding any such Superior Proposal or Potential Superior Proposal.



(b) _No Change in Company Recommendation or Alternative
Acquisition Agreement_. The Company Board shall not:



(i) except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, withdraw or modify (or
publicly propose to withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to Parent or
Merger Sub, the approval or recommendation by the Company Board with respect
to this Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated hereby;



(ii) except as permitted by Section 8.3(a), cause or permit the Company to
enter into any letter of intent, memorandum of understanding, agreement in
principle, acquisition agreement, merger agreement or similar agreement (an "
_Alternative Acquisition Agreement_ ") providing for the consummation of a
transaction contemplated by any Acquisition Proposal (other than a
confidentiality agreement referred to in Section 6.2(a) entered into in the
circumstances referred to in Section 6.2(a)); or 



(iii) except as expressly permitted by this Section 6.2, approve, recommend
or propose publicly to approve or recommend any Acquisition Proposal.



 

-50- Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Agreement the
Company Board may withdraw or modify its approval or recommendation with
respect to this Agreement and the Merger and other transactions contemplated
hereby, or approve or recommend any Superior Proposal made or received after
the date of this Agreement, if the Company Board determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that such action is likely required
under applicable Law (a " _Change in Company Recommendation_ "); _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Change in Company Recommendation may be made in response
to a Superior Proposal until after 72 hours following Parents receipt of
written notice from the Company (an " _Adverse Recommendation Notice_ ") (x)
advising Parent that the Company Board intends to make such Change in Company
Recommendation and the reason for such change, (y) specifying the material
terms and conditions of such Superior Proposal (including the proposed
financing for such proposal) and providing Parent with a copy of any
documents conveying such proposal and (z) identifying any party making such
Superior Proposal. During such 72-hour period, the Company will cooperate with
Parent with respect to such Superior Proposal with the intent of enabling
Parent to engage in good faith negotiations to make such adjustments to the
terms and conditions of the Merger as would enable the Company to proceed with
the Merger on such adjusted terms. In determining whether to make a Change in
Company Recommendation in response to a Superior Proposal, the Company Board
shall take into account any such changes to the terms of this Agreement
proposed by Parent (in response to an Adverse Recommendation Notice or
otherwise) in determining whether such third party Acquisition Proposal still
constitutes a Superior Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing, to the extent
that an Adverse Recommendation Notice is received on a Saturday, Sunday or
holiday, then such 72-hour period shall expire no earlier than 12:00 noon
(Eastern Time) on the second business day immediately thereafter.



(c) _No Change in Parent Recommendation_. The Parent Board shall not withdraw
or modify (or publicly propose to withdraw or modify), in a manner adverse to
the Company, the approval or recommendation by the Parent Board with respect
to the Share Issuance; _provided_ , that the Parent Board may withdraw or
modify its approval or recommendation with respect to the Share Issuance, if
the Parent Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that such action is likely required under applicable Law (a "
_Change in Parent Recommendation_ "), which the Company acknowledges and
agrees may be the result of a Material Adverse Change. For purposes of this
Section 6.2(c), " _Material Adverse Change_ " shall mean (1) a change that is
the result of general economic, capital market, regulatory, political or
business conditions or acts of war or terrorism or (2) a change that is the
result of factors generally affecting the industries or markets in which the
Company or Parent operate to the extent such change does not
disproportionately affect the Company and its Subsidiaries or Parent and its
Subsidiaries as compared to the typical company operating in such industry or
market, in each case which change is reasonably likely to have, a material
adverse effect on the financial condition, properties, business or results of
operations of (x) the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, (y)
Parent and its Subsidiaries, taken as a  



 

-51-  whole, or (z) the Company and its Subsidiaries and Parent and its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.



(d) _Certain Permitted Disclosure_. Nothing contained in this Agreement shall
be deemed to prohibit the Company from taking and disclosing to its
stockholders a position with respect to a tender offer contemplated by Rule
14d-9 or Rule 14e-2 promulgated under the Exchange Act or from making any
other disclosure to the Companys stockholders or the general public if the
Company Board determines in good faith, after consultation with outside
counsel, that such disclosure is likely required under applicable Law.



(e) _Definitions_. As used in this Agreement:



" _Acquisition Proposal_ " means (i) any proposal or offer for a merger,
consolidation, dissolution, tender offer, recapitalization, reorganization,
share exchange, business combination or similar transaction involving the
Company or (ii) any proposal or offer to acquire in any manner, directly or
indirectly, more than 20% of the equity securities or more than 20% of the
consolidated total assets (including, without limitation, equity securities of
its Subsidiaries) of the Company, in each case other than the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. 



" _Superior Proposal_ " means any bona fide written Acquisition Proposal made
by a third party to acquire more than 50% of the equity securities or more
than 50% of the assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, taken as a whole,
pursuant to a tender or exchange offer, a merger, a recapitalization, a
consolidation or a sale of its assets, which the Company Board determines in
its good faith judgment (after consultation with its financial advisor) (i) to
be more favorable from a financial point of view to the holders of Company
Common Stock than the Merger and (ii) is reasonably capable of being completed
on the terms proposed and for which financing is reasonably capable of being
obtained, taking into account all financial, regulatory, legal and other
aspects of such proposal.



6.3. _Information Supplied_. (a) As soon as practicable following the date of
this Agreement, but in no event later than April 1, 2005, Parent and the
Company shall, in consultation with each other, prepare and file with the SEC
the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus (as defined below), and Parent shall
prepare and file with the SEC the Registration Statement on Form S-4 to be
filed with the SEC by Parent in connection with the Share Issuance (including
the proxy statement and prospectus (the " _Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus_
") constituting a part thereof) (the " _S-4 Registration Statement_ ") as
promptly as practicable. Each of Parent and the Company shall provide promptly
to the other such information concerning its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers, stockholders, business and financial statements and affairs as, in
the reasonable judgment of the providing party or its counsel, may be required
or appropriate for inclusion in the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus and the
S-4 Registration Statement, or in any amendments or supplements thereto, and
to cause its counsel and auditors to cooperate with the others  



 

-52-  counsel and auditors in the preparation of the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and the S-4 Registration Statement. Parent and the
Company each shall use its reasonable best efforts to have the S-4
Registration Statement declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly
as practicable after such filing, and promptly thereafter mail the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus to the stockholders of the Company. Prior to the
effective date of the S-4 Registration Statement Parent shall take any action
(other than qualifying to do business in any jurisdiction in which it is not
now so qualified or to file a general consent to service of process) required
to be taken under any applicable state securities law or "blue sky" notice
requirements in connection with the Stock Issuance and to consummate the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and will pay all
expenses incident thereto and the Company shall furnish all information
concerning the Company and the holders of capital stock of the Company as may
be reasonably requested in connection with any such action.



(b) The Company and Parent each agrees, as to itself and its
Subsidiaries, that none of the information supplied or to be supplied by it
or its Subsidiaries for inclusion or incorporation by reference in (i) the S-4
Registration Statement will, at the time the S-4 Registration Statement is
filed with the SEC or becomes effective under the Securities Act, contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
necessary in order to make the statements made, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading, and (ii) the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto will, at the date
of mailing to stockholders and at the date of the Stockholders Meetings (as
defined in Section 6.4), contain any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary
in order to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading. No filing of, or amendment or supplement
to, or correspondence to the SEC or its staff with respect to, the S-4
Registration Statement will be made by Parent, or with respect to the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus will be made by the Company, without providing the
other party hereto a reasonable opportunity to review and comment thereon.
Parent shall advise the Company, promptly after Parent receives notice
thereof, of the time when the S-4 Registration Statement has become effective
or any supplement or amendment has been filed, the issuance of any stop
order, the suspension of the qualification of the Parent Common Stock issuable
in connection with the Merger for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, or any
request by the SEC for amendment of the S-4 Registration Statement
or comments thereon and responses thereto or requests by the SEC for
additional information. The Company shall advise Parent, promptly after the
Company receives notice thereof, of any request by the SEC for the amendment
of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus or comments thereon and responses
thereto or requests by the SEC for additional information. If at any time
prior to the Effective Time any information relating to Parent or the Company,
or any of their respective Affiliates, officers or directors, should be
discovered by Parent or the Company which should be set forth in an amendment
or supplement to either of the S-4 Registration Statement or the Joint Proxy
Statement/Prospectus, so that any of such documents would not include any
misstatement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary
to make the statements  



 

-53-  therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading, the party which discovers such information shall promptly notify
the other party or parties hereto, as applicable, and an appropriate
amendment or supplement to the S-4 Registration Statement and/or the Joint
Proxy Statement/Prospectus describing such information shall be promptly filed
with the SEC and, to the extent required by applicable Law, disseminated to
the stockholders of the Company. Each of the parties hereto shall cause the
Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus to comply as to form and substance to such
party in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the rules of the Nasdaq National Market.



6.4. _Stockholders Meetings_. Except if the Company Board determines in good
faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that taking such action would
likely constitute a breach of its obligations under applicable Law, the
Company will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate and
bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Shares (the "
_Company Stockholders Meeting_ ") as promptly as practicable after the S-4
Registration Statement is declared effective to consider and vote upon the
adoption of this Agreement. Subject to Section 6.2(b), the Company Board shall
recommend and not withdraw such adoption and shall take all reasonable and
lawful action to solicit such adoption. Except if the Parent Board determines
in good faith, after consultation with outside counsel, that taking such
action would likely constitute a breach of its obligations under applicable
Law, Parent will take, in accordance with applicable Law and its certificate
and bylaws, all action necessary to convene a meeting of holders of Parent
Common Stock (the " _Parent Stockholders Meeting_ " and, together with the
Company Stockholders Meetings, the " _Stockholders Meetings_ ") as promptly as
practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective to
consider and vote upon the approval of the Share Issuance. Subject to Section
6.2(c), the Parent Board shall recommend such approval and shall take all
lawful action to solicit such approval. The Company and Parent shall cooperate
to schedule and convene the Stockholders Meetings on the same date as soon as
practicable after the S-4 Registration Statement is declared effective under
the Securities Act.



6.5. _Filings; Other Actions; Notification; Access_.



(a) The Company and Parent shall cooperate with each other and use (and shall
cause their respective Subsidiaries to use) their respective reasonable
best efforts to take or cause to be taken all actions, and do or cause to be
done all things, necessary, proper or advisable on its part under this
Agreement and applicable Laws to consummate and make effective the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as
practicable, including preparing and filing as promptly as practicable all
documentation to effect all necessary notices, reports and other filings and
to obtain as promptly as practicable all consents, registrations, approvals,
permits and authorizations necessary or advisable to be obtained from any
third party and/or any Governmental Entity in order to consummate the Merger
or any of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Subject to
applicable laws relating to the exchange of information, Parent and the
Company shall have the right to review in advance, and to the  



 

-54-  extent practicable each will consult the other on, all the information
relating to Parent or the Company, as the case may be, and any of their
respective Subsidiaries, that appear in any filing made with, or written
materials submitted to, any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. In exercising the foregoing right, each of the Company and Parent
shall act reasonably and as promptly as practicable. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, Parent and the Company shall each file a Pre-
Merger Notification and Report Form under the HSR Act with respect to the
Merger as promptly as practicable, but in no event later than April 1, 2005.
Parent and the Company shall each request early termination of the waiting
period with respect to the Merger under the HSR Act. Each of the parties
agrees to use their respective reasonable best efforts to respond as promptly
as practicable to any request for additional information pursuant to Section
(e)(1) of the HSR Act.



(b) The Company and Parent each shall, upon request by the other, furnish the
other with all information concerning itself, its Subsidiaries, directors,
officers and stockholders and such other matters as may be reasonably
necessary or advisable in connection with any other statement, filing, notice
or application made by or on behalf of Parent, the Company or any of their
respective Subsidiaries to any third party and/or any Governmental Entity in
connection with the Merger and the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.



(c) Subject to applicable Law and the instructions of any Governmental Entity,
the Company and Parent each shall keep the other apprised of the status of
matters relating to completion of the transactions contemplated hereby,
including promptly furnishing the other with copies of notice or other
communications received by Parent or the Company, as the case may be, or any
of its Subsidiaries, from any third party and/or any Governmental Entity with
respect to the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this
Agreement. The Company and Parent each shall give prompt notice to the other
of any change that is reasonably likely to result in a Company Material
Adverse Effect or Parent Material Adverse Effect, respectively. Neither the
Company nor Parent shall permit any of its officers or any other
representatives or agents to participate in any meeting with any Governmental
Entity in respect of any filings, investigation or other inquiry unless it
consults with the other party in advance and, to the extent permitted by such
Governmental Entity, gives the other party the opportunity to attend
and participate thereat.



(d) Without limiting the generality of the undertakings pursuant to this
Section 6.5, each of the Company (in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) below)
and Parent (in all cases set forth below) agree to take or cause to be taken
the following actions: (i) the provision, as promptly as practicable, to each
and every federal, state, local or foreign court or Governmental Entity with
jurisdiction over enforcement of any applicable antitrust or competition laws
(" _Government Antitrust Entity_ ") of non-privileged information and
documents requested by any Government Antitrust Entity or that are necessary,
proper or advisable to permit consummation of the transactions  



 

-55-  contemplated by this Agreement; (ii) the use of its reasonable best efforts,
after consultation with the Company, to avoid the entry of any
permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction or other order, decree,
decision, determination or judgment that would delay, restrain, prevent,
enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (including, without limitation, the defense through litigation
on the merits of any claim asserted in any court, agency or other proceeding
by any person or entity (including, without limitation, any Governmental
Entity) seeking to delay, restrain, prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit
consummation of such transactions; _provided_ , that Parent shall not be
required to sell or otherwise dispose of, or hold separate pending such
disposition, or enter into any agreements with, or submit to any requests by,
the relevant Government Antitrust Entity with respect to, any assets,
categories of assets or businesses or other segments of the Company or Parent
or any of their respective Subsidiaries if such action would, after taking
into account the expected proceeds of such sale or other disposition,
reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition, properties, business or results of operations of Parent and its
Subsidiaries (including the Company and its Subsidiaries), taken as a whole,
after the Merger; and (iii) the use of its reasonable best efforts to take, in
the event that any permanent, preliminary or temporary injunction, decision,
order, judgment, determination or decree is entered or issued, or becomes
reasonably foreseeable to be entered or issued, in any proceeding or inquiry
of any kind that would make consummation of the Merger in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement unlawful or that would delay, restrain,
prevent, enjoin or otherwise prohibit consummation of the Merger or the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any and all steps (including,
without limitation, the appeal thereof, the posting of a bond or the taking of
the steps contemplated by clause (ii) of this paragraph, subject to the
proviso contained therein) necessary to resist, vacate, modify, reverse,
suspend, prevent, eliminate or remove such actual, anticipated or threatened
injunction, decision, order, judgment, determination or decree so as to
permit such consummation on a schedule as close as possible to that
contemplated by this Agreement.



6.6. _Access to Information_.



(a) Upon reasonable notice, and except as may otherwise be required by
applicable Law, each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall cause each of
its Subsidiaries to) afford the Representatives of the other party reasonable
access, during normal business hours throughout the period prior to the
Effective Time, to its properties, books, contracts, records and personnel
and, during such period, each of the Company and Parent shall (and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to) furnish promptly to the other all
information concerning its business, properties and personnel as may
reasonably be requested, provided that no investigation pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall affect or be deemed to modify any representation or warranty
made by any party hereto. All requests for information made pursuant to this
Section 6.6 shall be directed to an executive officer of the Company
or Parent, as the case may be, or such Person as may be designated by such
party. All such information shall be governed by the terms of the
Confidentiality Agreement.



 

-56- (b) Nothing in this Agreement shall require any party hereto to permit any
inspection, or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable judgment
of such party would result in (i) the disclosure of any trade secrets of third
parties or violate any of its obligations with respect to confidentiality if
such party shall have used commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the
consent of such third party to such inspection or disclosure, (ii) any
violation of laws relating to the sharing of information between competitors,
it being understood that the parties will provide extracts, or summaries, or
aggregations or other information to the greatest extent practicable in a
manner that does not result in any such violation or improper disclosure or
(iii) waiver of a privilege.



6.7. _Taxation_. The parties will use their reasonable best efforts to cause
the Merger to qualify as a reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code
and, subject to Section 6.2, none of the parties shall take or cause to be
taken any action, whether before or after the Effective Time, that could
disqualify the Merger as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section
368(a) of the Code. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub shall execute and
deliver to Sullivan and Cromwell LLP, special counsel to the Company, and
Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P., special counsel to Parent, customary
representation letters, substantially in the forms attached hereto as Exhibit
B and Exhibit C, at such time or times as reasonably requested by such law
firms in connection with their delivery of the respective opinions referred
to in Section 7.3(c) and Section 7.2(c). None of the Company, Parent or Merger
Sub shall take or cause to be taken any action (or fail to take or cause to be
taken any action) which reasonably would be expected to cause to be untrue
any of the representations in such representation letters.



6.8. _Affiliates_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall deliver to
Parent a list of names and addresses of those Persons who are, in the opinion
of the Company, as of the time of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, "affiliates" of the Company within the meaning of Rule 145 under the
Securities Act. The Company shall provide to Parent such information and
documents as Parent shall reasonably request for purposes of reviewing such
list. There shall be added to such list the names and addresses of any other
Person subsequently identified by either Parent or the Company as a Person who
may be deemed to be such an affiliate of the Company; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that no such Person identified by Parent shall be added to the list of
affiliates of the Company if Parent shall receive from the Company, on or
before the date of the Company Stockholders Meeting, an opinion of counsel
reasonably satisfactory to Parent to the effect that such Person is not such
an affiliate. The Company shall exercise reasonable best efforts to deliver or
cause to be delivered to Parent, prior to the date of the Company Stockholders
Meeting, from each affiliate of the Company identified in the foregoing list
(as the same may be supplemented as aforesaid), a letter dated as of the
Closing Date substantially in the form attached as Exhibit D.



6.9. _Stock Exchange Listing and De-listing_. Parent shall use its reasonable
best efforts to cause the shares of Parent Common Stock to be issued in the
Merger to be approved for listing on the Nasdaq National Market subject to
official  



 

-57-  notice of issuance, prior to the Closing Date. The Surviving Entity shall
use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Shares to be de-listed from the
Nasdaq National Market and de-registered under the Exchange Act as soon as
practicable following the Effective Time.



6.10. _Publicity_. The initial press release regarding the Merger shall be a
joint press release and thereafter the Company and Parent each shall consult
with each other before issuing, and provide each other the opportunity to
review, comment upon and concur with and use reasonable efforts to agree on,
any press releases or otherwise making public announcements with respect to
the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement and
prior to making any filings with any third party and/or any Governmental
Entity with respect thereto, except as may be required by Law or by
obligations pursuant to any listing agreement with or rules of the Nasdaq
National Market or by the request of any Government Antitrust Entity.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section 6.10,
either party may respond to questions from stockholders or inquiries from
financial analysts and media representatives in a manner that is consistent
with then-existing public disclosures.



6.11. _Employee Benefits/Labor Matters_.



(a) For the period beginning at the Effective Time and ending on December 31
of the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent shall,
or shall cause the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries to, offer employee
compensation and benefit plans to Continuing Employees (as defined below) that
are no less favorable in the aggregate than those offered under the Company
Compensation and Benefit Plans as of the date of this Agreement. Parent
shall, or shall cause the Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries to, take such
actions as are necessary to grant those employees who are, as of the Effective
Time, employed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and are not included
in a unit of employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement ("
_Continuing Employees_ ") credit for Past Service (as defined below) for
purposes of initial eligibility to participate, vesting and benefit accrual
under, any employee benefit plans maintained by Parent, the Surviving Entity
or any Subsidiary of Parent or the Surviving Entity in which they are eligible
to participate. " _Past Service_ " means a Continuing Employees service with
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company to the same extent recognized by
the Company and any of its Subsidiaries. Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity and its Subsidiaries to, take such actions as are necessary
to give Continuing Employees credit for their Past Service for purposes of
determining the amounts of sick pay, holiday pay and vacation pay they are
eligible to receive under any sick pay, holiday pay and vacation pay policies
and programs maintained by Parent, the Surviving Entity or any Subsidiary of
the Surviving Entity in which they are eligible to participate. With respect
to each Continuing Employee who is an active participant in a group health
plan (as defined in Section 5000(b) of the Code) (a " _Company Health Plan_
") immediately prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall, or shall cause the
Surviving Entity or its Subsidiaries to, take such actions as are necessary to
ensure that the group health plan (other than a flexible spending account
arrangement) maintained by Parent,  



 

-58-  the Surviving Entity or one of its Subsidiaries in which such Continuing
Employee is eligible to participate during the calendar year in which the
Effective Time occurs (the " _Current Year_ ") shall (i) waive any
preexisting condition restrictions and waiting period requirements to the
extent that such preexisting condition restrictions and waiting period
requirements were waived or satisfied under the applicable Company Health
Plan in which such Continuing Employee participated immediately prior to the
Effective Time; and (ii) provide credit, for the Current Year, for any
copayments or deductible payments made by the Continuing Employee and out of
pocket expenditures incurred by the Continuing Employee under the applicable
Company Health Plan for the Current Year.



(b) Parent acknowledges that by operation of Law the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries shall continue to be obligated to comply with the terms of
any Company Compensation and Benefit Plans that are maintained by the Company
and any of its Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Effective Time;
_provided_ , _however_ , nothing herein shall restrict Parents or the
Surviving Entitys or its Subsidiaries ability to amend or terminate such
Company Compensation and Benefit Plans in accordance with their terms.



(c) Parent acknowledges that by operation of Law the Surviving Entity and its
Subsidiaries shall continue to be obligated to comply with the terms of
the agreements listed on Section 6.11(c) of the Company Disclosure Letter
(the " _CIC Agreements_ "). Parent acknowledges that the consummation of the
Merger contemplated by this Agreement will constitute a "Change of
Control" within the meaning of each of the CIC Agreements. If upon
termination of employment an employee of the Company is determined to be a
"key employee" within the meaning of Section 409A of the Code and that, as a
result of such determination, any portion of severance due under the
applicable CIC Agreement would be subject to additional taxation, Parent will
delay paying such portion of the severance until the earliest permissible date
on which payments may commence without triggering such additional taxation
(with such delay not to exceed six months); provided, however, that if any
such delay in payment of all or a portion of the severance is required to
ensure that any additional tax is not applied under Section 409A of the Code,
upon the key employees termination of employment Parent shall immediately
cause the unpaid severance amount to be set aside in a "rabbi trust" meeting
the requirements of Rev. Proc. 92-64 with Wachovia Bank, N.A., or the
then current trustee of the trust used to fund the Companys Nonqualified
Deferred Compensation Plan and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan, as
trustee of such rabbi trust.

appointed and qualified in the manner provided in the certificate of
incorporation of Parent or as otherwise provided by Law.



 

6.15. _Expenses_. Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.5(b) or Section
8.5(c), whether or not the Merger is consummated, all fees and expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement shall be paid by the party
incurring such expense, except that expenses incurred in connection with the
printing and mailing of the Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus shall be shared
equally by Parent and the Company.



6.16. _Indemnification; Directors  and Officers Insurance_.



(a) From and after the Effective Time, Parent shall indemnify and hold
harmless, to the fullest extent permitted under applicable Law (and Parent
shall also advance expenses as incurred to the fullest extent permitted under
applicable Law provided the Person to whom expenses are advanced provides an
undertaking to repay such advances if it is ultimately determined that such
Person is not entitled to indemnification), each present and former director
and officer of the Company and its Subsidiaries (collectively, the "
_Indemnified Parties_ ") against any costs or expenses (including reasonable
attorneys fees and expenses), judgments, fines, losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (collectively, " _Costs_ ") incurred in connection with any claim,
action, suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal,
administrative or investigative, arising out of or pertaining to matters
existing or occurring at or prior to the Effective Time (and whether asserted
or claimed prior to, at or after the Effective Time) that are, in whole or in
part, based on or arising out of the fact that such person is or was  



 

-60-  a director, officer, employee of the Company or any of Subsidiary of the
Company, including the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or serve as
a fiduciary under, or with respect to, any employee benefit plan (within the
meaning of Section 3(3) of ERISA) at any time maintained by or contributed to
by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.



(b) Any Indemnified Party wishing to claim indemnification under
paragraph (a) of this Section 6.16, upon learning of any such claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, shall promptly notify Parent thereof, but
the failure to so notify shall not relieve Parent of any liability it may have
to such Indemnified Party except to the extent such failure materially
prejudices Parent. In the event of any such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation (whether arising before or after the Effective Time), (i) Parent
and the Surviving Entity shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel selected by the Indemnified Parties, which counsel shall be reasonably
satisfactory to Parent, promptly after statements therefor are received and
otherwise advance to such Indemnified Party upon request of reimbursement of
documented expenses reasonably incurred, (ii) Parent shall cooperate with the
defense of such matter and (iii) any determination required to be made with
respect to whether an Indemnified Partys conduct complies with the standards
set forth under applicable Law and the certificate of incorporation or bylaws
shall be made by independent counsel mutually acceptable to Parent and the
Indemnified Party; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent and the
Surviving Entity shall not be liable for any settlement effected without its
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, delayed or
conditioned). If such indemnity is not available with respect to any
Indemnified Party, then the Surviving Entity and the Indemnified Party shall
contribute to the amount payable in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect relative faults and benefits.



 

(c) Subject to the last sentence of this Section 6.16(c), for six years after
the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain in effect directors and officers
liability insurance (" _D andO Insurance_") covering acts or omissions occurring
prior to the Effective Time with respect to those persons who are currently
covered by the Companys DandO Insurance policy on terms with respect to such
coverage and amount no less favorable than those of the DandO Insurance policy
of the Company in effect on the date of this Agreement; _provided_ , _however_
, that in no event will Parent be required to pay aggregate annual premiums
for insurance under this Section 6.16(c) in excess of three times the most
recent aggregate annual premium paid by the Company for such purpose (which
annual aggregate premium the Company represents and warrants to
be approximately $750,000 in the aggregate) (the " _Current Premium_ ");
_provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such insurance
coverage exceed such amount, Parent will be obligated to obtain a DandO
Insurance policy with the best coverage available, in the reasonable judgment
of the Parent Board, for a cost up to but not exceeding 300% of the Current
Premium. In addition, for six years after the Effective Time, Parent shall
maintain in effect fiduciary liability insurance policies for employees who
serve or have served as fiduciaries under or with respect to any employee
benefit plans described in Section 6.16 of the Company Disclosure Letter with
coverages and in amounts no less favorable than  



 

-61-  those of the policies of the Company in effect on the date of this
Agreement. The provisions of this Section 6.16(c) shall be deemed to have been
satisfied if Parent, with the cooperation of the Company, obtains prepaid
policies prior to the Closing for purposes of this Section 6.16(c), which
policies are provided by an insurer with a claims paying rate no lower than
the rating of the provider of the Companys current DandO Insurance policy and
provide such directors and officers with coverage no less advantageous to the
insured for an aggregate period of six years with respect to claims arising
from facts or events that occurred on or before the Effective Time (including
those related to this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby).



(d) If Parent or the Surviving Entity or any of their respective successors or
assigns (i) shall consolidate with or merge into any other corporation
or entity and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity
of such consolidation or merger or (ii) shall transfer all or substantially
all of such partys properties and assets to any individual, corporation or
other entity, then, and in each such case, proper provisions shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent or the Surviving Entity, as the case
may be, shall assume all of the applicable obligations set forth in this
Section 6.16.



(e) The provisions of this Section 6.16 are intended to be for the
benefit of, and shall be enforceable by, each of the Indemnified Parties,
their heirs and their representatives and are in addition to, and not in
substitution for, any other rights to indemnification that any such person may
have by contract or otherwise. If any Indemnified Party is required to bring
any action to enforce rights or to collect moneys due under this Agreement and
is successful in such action, Parent and the Surviving Entity shall reimburse
such Indemnified Party for all of its expenses reasonably incurred in
connection with bringing and pursuing such action including, without
limitation, reasonable attorneys fees and costs.



6.17. _Other Actions by the Company and Parent_.



(a) _Rights_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board shall take all
necessary action to terminate all of the outstanding Rights,
effective immediately prior to the Effective Time.



(b) _Takeover Statute_. If any Takeover Statute is or may become applicable
to the Merger or the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each
of Parent and the Company and its Board of Directors shall grant such
approvals and take such actions as are necessary so that such transactions
may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms contemplated by
this Agreement or by the Merger and otherwise act to eliminate or minimize the
effects of such statute or regulation on such transactions.



(c) _Section 16 Matters_. The Company Board and Parent Board shall, prior to
the Effective Time, take all such actions as may be reasonably necessary or
appropriate pursuant to Rule 16b-3(d) and Rule 16b-3(e) under the Exchange Act
to  



 

-62-  exempt (i) the conversion of Shares into Parent Common Stock and (ii) the
acquisition of Parent Common Stock pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
by officers and directors of the Company subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act or by employees of the
Company who may become an officer or director of Parent subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act. In furtherance
of the foregoing, prior to the Effective Time, (i) the Company Board shall
adopt resolutions that specify (A) the name of each individual whose
disposition of Shares (including Company Options and other
derivative securities with respect to Shares) is to be exempted, (B) the
number of Shares (including Company Options and other derivative securities
with respect to Shares) to be disposed of by each such individual and (C) that
the approval is granted for purposes of exempting the disposition from
Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3(e) of the Exchange Act and
(ii) the Parent Board shall adopt resolutions that specify (A) the name of
each individual whose acquisition of shares of Parent Common Stock is to be
exempted, (B) the number of Shares that may be converted into Parent Common
Stock acquired by each such individual in the Merger and (C) that the approval
is granted for purposes of exempting the acquisition from Section 16(b) of
the Exchange Act under Rule 16b-3(d) of the Exchange Act. The parties hereby
agree, which shall also be set forth in the foregoing resolutions, that all of
the securities, including any options and derivative securities, referred to
above serve a compensation related function. Parent and the Company shall
provide to counsel of the other party for its review copies of such
resolutions to be adopted by the Company Board and the Parent Board prior to
such adoption and the Company shall provide Parent with such information as
shall be reasonably necessary for the Parent Board to set forth the
information required in the resolutions of the Parent Board.

an undertaking on the part of the Company to cause such Subsidiary to take
such action and, after the Effective Time, on the part of the Surviving Entity
to cause such Subsidiary to take such action.



9.10. _Severability_. The provisions of this Agreement shall be deemed
severable and the invalidity or unenforceability of any provision shall not
affect the validity or enforceability or the other provisions hereof. If any
provision of this Agreement, or the application thereof to any Person or any
circumstance, is invalid or unenforceable, (a) a suitable and equitable
provision shall be substituted therefor in order to carry out, so far as may
be valid and enforceable, the intent and purpose of such invalid or
unenforceable provision and (b) the remainder of this Agreement and the  



 

-71-  application of such provision to other Persons or circumstances shall not be
affected by such invalidity or unenforceability, nor shall such invalidity
or unenforceability affect the validity or enforceability of such provision,
or the application thereof, in any other jurisdiction.



9.11. _Interpretation; Construction_.



(a) The table of contents and headings herein are for convenience of reference
only, do not constitute part of this Agreement and shall not be deemed
to limit or otherwise affect any of the provisions hereof. Where a reference
in this Agreement is made to a Section or Exhibit, such reference shall be to
a Section of or Exhibit to this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. Whenever
the words "include," "includes" or "including" are used in this Agreement,
they shall be deemed to be followed by the words "without limitation."



(b) The parties have participated jointly in negotiating and drafting this
Agreement. In the event that an ambiguity or a question of intent or
interpretation arises, this Agreement shall be construed as if drafted jointly
by the parties, and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or
disfavoring any party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this
Agreement.



(c) The parties agree that any action that may be taken by the Parent Board
or the Company Board may, to the extent permitted by applicable Law and except
with respect to the actions described in Sections 5.1(c)(ii) and 5.2(d)(ii)
hereof, instead be taken by a duly authorized committee of the Parent Board
or the Company Board, as the case may be, and any such action shall be deemed
for purposes of this Agreement the action of the full Parent Board or the full
Company Board, respectively.



9.12. _Assignment_. This Agreement shall not be assignable by operation of
law or otherwise; _provided_ , _however_ , that Parent may designate, by
written notice to the Company, another wholly owned direct or indirect
Subsidiary to be a Constituent Corporation in lieu of Merger Sub, in which
event all references herein to Merger Sub shall be deemed references to such
other Subsidiary, except that all representations and warranties made herein
with respect to Merger Sub as of the date of this Agreement shall be deemed
representations and warranties made with respect to such other Subsidiary as
of the date of such designation. Any purported assignment in violation of this
Agreement is void.

Ladies and Gentlemen:



We have been asked to make certain representations and certifications in
connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of February 27, 2005, by and among
Yellow Roadway Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Yankee II LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and USF Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
In connection with the issuance of such opinions, the undersigned, after due
inquiry and investigation, hereby represents and certifies, on behalf of the
Company, that the statements and representations contained herein are true,
correct and complete in all material respects at the date hereof and will be
true, correct and complete in all material respects as of the Effective Time,
as if made at that time:1



     | 1. | The facts, representations and covenants relating to the
Merger (as defined and described in the Agreement) and related transactions
that are set forth in the Agreement, the S-4 Registration Statement and the
other documents included or described in the S-4 Registration Statement, each
as amended or supplemented through the date hereof are true, correct and
complete in all material respects. The Merger will be consummated strictly in
accordance with the Agreement and pursuant to Delaware law. To the extent they
pertain to the Company, all representations and warranties in the Agreement
are correct and all obligations contained therein will be complied with; all
other such representations and warranties are, to the best knowledge of the
management of the Company, after due inquiry, correct in all material
respects. The Merger is being effected for bona fide business reasons and not
for the purpose of tax avoidance. 
---|---|--- 

* * *

   1 | Terms used but not defined herein have the meaning ascribed to them
in the Agreement.  
---|--- 

 other consideration received by each shareholder of the Company will be, at
the Effective Time, approximately equal to the fair market value of the
Company Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor pursuant to the Merger,
as determined on the basis of arms-length negotiations among the parties. In
connection with the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in
exchange for Company Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration
from Parent or any corporation related to Parent other than the Merger
Consideration. 
---|---|--- 


     | 3. | At least forty-five percent (45%) of the fair market value of
the Companys shareholders proprietary interests in the Company will be
preserved as a proprietary interest in Parent received in the Merger.
Proprietary interests will not be preserved to the extent that, in connection
with the reorganization: (i) prior to the Merger an extraordinary distribution
( _i.e._ , a distribution other than a regular, normal dividend) is made with
respect to Company Common Stock; (ii) prior to the Merger a redemption or
acquisition of Company Common Stock is made by the Company or a person related
to the Company as defined in Regulation § 1.368-1(e)(3)2 (a "Company Related
Person"); (iii) Parent or a person related to Parent as defined in Regulation
§ 1.368-1(e)(3) (a "Parent Related Person") acquires Company Common Stock for
consideration other than Parent Common Stock; or (iv) following the Merger,
Parent redeems its stock issued in the Merger or a Parent Related Person
acquires, for consideration other than Parent Common Stock, Parent Common
Stock issued in the Merger. For purposes of this representation: (i) any
reference to Parent or the Company includes a reference to any successor or
predecessor of such corporation, except that the Company is not treated as a
predecessor of Parent and Parent is not treated as a successor of the Company;
(ii) each partner of a partnership will be treated as owning or acquiring any
stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership (and as
having paid any consideration paid by the partnership to acquire such stock)
in accordance with that partners interest in the partnership; and (iii) an
acquisition of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock by a person acting
as an intermediary for Parent, the Company, a Parent Related Person or Company
Related Person will be treated as made by Parent, the Company, Parent Related
Person or Company Related Person, respectively. 
---|---|--- 
   2 | Except as otherwise indicated, all "Section" and "Regulation"
references contained herein refer, respectively, to sections of the Internal
Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and to the Treasury Regulations promulgated
thereunder. 
---|--- 

 acquired (or has any plan or intention to acquire prior to the Merger) any
Company Common Stock (other than in connection with a stock repurchase
program described in Revenue Ruling 99-58). During the three (3) year period
prior to the Merger, the Company has not made, and does not have any plan or
intention to make prior to the Merger, any distributions (other
than dividends made in the ordinary course of business) in contemplation of
or otherwise in connection with the Merger. 
---|---|--- 



     | 5. | At the Effective Time, the Company will be conducting the
Companys historic business or using a significant portion of the Companys
historic business assets in a business, and, to the best knowledge of the
Company, following the Merger, Parent or Merger Sub will continue the
Companys historic business or will use a significant portion of the Companys
historic business assets in a business, as such terms are used in Regulation
§ 1.368-1(d). 
---|---|--- 



     | 6. | The liabilities of the Company assumed by Merger Sub and the
liabilities to which the transferred assets of the Company are subject were
incurred by the Company in the ordinary course of its business. 
---|---|--- 



     | 7. | Parent, the Company, and the shareholders of the Company will
pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger,
except as otherwise provided in Section 6.12 of the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8. | There is no intercorporate indebtedness existing between
Parent (or any of its subsidiaries) and the Company (or any of its
subsidiaries) that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount. 
---|---|--- 



     | 9. | The Company is not an investment company with the meaning of
Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). 
---|---|--- 



     | 10. | The Company is not under the jurisdiction of a court in a
Title 11 or similar case within the meaning of Section 368(a)(3)(A). 
---|---|--- 


     | 11. | At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets
of the Company transferred to Merger Sub will equal or exceed the sum of the
liabilities assumed by Merger Sub, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which the assets are subject. 
---|---|--- 



     | 12. |

The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent Common Stock is
solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and inconvenience to Parent of
issuing fractional shares and does not represent separately bargained-for
consideration. The total cash consideration that will be paid in the
transaction to the Company shareholders instead of issuing   

---|---|--- 

  fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent (1%) of
the total consideration that will be issued in the transaction to the
Company shareholders in exchange for their shares of Company Common Stock.
The fractional share interests of each Company shareholder will be aggregated,
and (with the possible exception of Company Common Stock held in multiple
accounts) no Company shareholder will receive cash in an amount greater to or
greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock. 

---|--- 



     | 13. | Neither the Company nor any of its current or former
subsidiaries has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled
corporation" in a distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free
treatment under Section 355(a): (i) at any time during the two-year period
prior to the date of the Agreement, (ii) at any time during the period
commencing on the date of the Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, or
(iii) which could otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related
transactions" (within the meaning of Section 355(e)) in conjunction with and
including the Merger. 
---|---|--- 


     | 14. | None of the compensation received by any shareholder-
employee of the Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to,
any of their shares of Company Common Stock; none of the shares of Parent
Common Stock received by any shareholder-employee will be separate
consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar
agreement; and the compensation paid to any shareholder-employee will be
for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to
third parties bargaining at arms-length for similar services. 
---|---|--- 



     | 15. | The Agreement, the documents described in the Agreement and
the S-4 Registration Statement represent the entire understanding between or
among (i) Parent and its subsidiaries and (ii) the Company and its
subsidiaries and, to the best knowledge of the management of the Company,
between or among such entities and the affiliates and stockholders of Parent
and the Company with respect to the Merger, and there are no other written or
oral agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in
the Agreement, the documents described in the Agreement and the S-4
Registration Statement. 
---|---|--- 


     | 16. | After the Merger, the shareholders of the Company will not
be in control of Parent within the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(H). 
---|---|--- 


     | 17. |

To the best knowledge of the management of the Company, none of the
representations contained in the representation letters provided by Parent to
Sullivan and Cromwell LLP and Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P. on the date   

---|---|--- 

  hereof are untrue, incorrect or incomplete as of the date hereof or will be
untrue, incorrect or incomplete at the Effective Time.  

---|--- 



     | 18. | By operation of law, the following events will occur
simultaneously at the Effective Time: (i) all of the assets and liabilities of
the Company will become assets and liabilities of Merger Sub and (ii) the
Company will cease its legal existence for all purposes. 
---|---|--- 



     | 19. | The Company is a corporation duly organized, validly
existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of Delaware. 
---|---|--- 


     | 20. | The Company will not take any position on any federal,
state, or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax
reporting position that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) or with any of the
foregoing representations, unless otherwise required by a final judgment,
decree or other order which addresses the Merger by a court of
competent jurisdiction, or by applicable state or local income or franchise
tax law (and then only to the extent required by such applicable law). The
Company is not aware of any facts that would cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a). 
---|---|--- 



     | 21. | The undersigned is authorized to make all the
representations set forth herein on behalf of the Company. 
---|---|--- 



The Company understands that Sullivan and Cromwell LLP and Fulbright and Jaworski
L.L.P. have not undertaken to independently verify the facts providing the
basis of this letter nor have they been asked to do so. The Company
understands that Sullivan and Cromwell LLP and Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P. will
rely on the statements and representations set forth herein in rendering
their respective opinions pursuant to the Agreement concerning certain of the
United States federal income tax consequences of the Merger and hereby commit
to inform them and Parent if, for any reason, any of the facts described
herein or in the S-4 Registration Statement, or any of the foregoing
representations or statements, ceases to be true prior to the Effective time.



IN WITNESS HEREOF, I have caused this representation letter to be executed on
this _ _th day of [ ], 2005.

Ladies and Gentlemen:



We have been asked to make certain representations and certifications in
connection with the opinions to be delivered pursuant to the Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the "Agreement"), dated as of February 27, 2005, by and among
Yellow Roadway Corporation, a Delaware corporation ("Parent"), Yankee II LLC,
a Delaware limited liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Parent
("Merger Sub"), and USF Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the "Company").
In connection with the issuance of such opinions, each of the undersigned,
after due inquiry and investigation, hereby represents and certifies, on
behalf of Parent and Merger Sub respectively, that the statements and
representations contained herein are true, correct and complete in
all material respects at the date hereof and will be true, correct and
complete in all material respects as of the Effective Time, as if made at that
time. To the extent applicable, representations made with respect to Parent
shall be deemed made with respect to Merger Sub:3



     | 1. | The facts, representations and covenants relating to the
Merger (as defined and described in the Agreement) and related transactions
that are set forth in the Agreement, the S-4 Registration Statement and the
other documents included or described in the S-4 Registration Statement, each
as amended or supplemented through the date hereof are true, correct and
complete in all material respects. The Merger will be consummated strictly in
accordance with the Agreement and pursuant to Delaware law. To the extent they
pertain to Parent or Merger Sub, all representations and warranties in the
Merger Agreement are correct and all obligations contained therein will be
complied with; all other such representations and warranties are, to the best
knowledge of the management of Parent, after due

 being effected for bona fide business reasons and not for the purpose of tax
avoidance. 
---|---|--- 


     | 2. | The fair market value of the Parent Common Stock and other
consideration received by each shareholder of the Company will be, at the
Effective Time, approximately equal to the fair market value of the Company
Common Stock surrendered in exchange therefor pursuant to the Merger, as
determined on the basis of arms-length negotiations among the parties. In
connection with the Merger, no holder of Company Common Stock will receive in
exchange for Company Common Stock, directly or indirectly, any consideration
from Parent or any corporation related to Parent other than the Merger
Consideration. 
---|---|--- 


     | 3. | At least forty-five percent (45%) of the fair market value of
the Companys shareholders proprietary interests in the Company will be
preserved as a proprietary interest in Parent received in the Merger.
Proprietary interests will not be preserved to the extent that, in connection
with the reorganization: (i) prior to the Merger an extraordinary distribution
( _i.e._ , a distribution other than a regular, normal dividend) is made with
respect to Company Common Stock; (ii) prior to the Merger a redemption or
acquisition of Company Common Stock is made by the Company or a person related
to the Company as defined in Regulation § 1.368-1(e)(3)4 (a "Company Related
Person"); (iii) Parent or a person related to Parent as defined in Regulation
§ 1.368-1(e)(3) (a "Parent Related Person") acquires Company Common Stock for
consideration other than Parent Common Stock; or (iv) following the Merger,
Parent redeems its stock issued in the Merger or a Parent Related Person
acquires, for consideration other than Parent Common Stock, Parent Common
Stock issued in the Merger. For purposes of this representation: (i) any
reference to Parent or the Company includes a reference to any successor or
predecessor of such corporation, except that the Company is not treated as a
predecessor of Parent and Parent is not treated as a successor of the Company;
(ii) each partner of a partnership will be treated as owning or acquiring any
stock owned or acquired, as the case may be, by the partnership (and as
having paid any consideration paid by the partnership to acquire such stock)
in accordance with that partners interest in the partnership; and (iii) an
acquisition of Parent Common Stock or Company Common Stock by a person acting
as an intermediary for Parent, the Company or a Parent Related Person or
Company Related Person will be treated as made by Parent, the Company, Parent
Related Person or Company Related Person, respectively.

Parent Related Person to purchase, exchange, redeem, or otherwise acquire,
directly or indirectly, any

 fractional shares of Parent Common stock exchanged for cash in the Merger).
For purposes of this representation, a person is considered to own or acquire
stock owned or acquired (as the case may be) by a partnership in which such
person is a partner in proportion to such persons interest in the
partnership. 
---|---|--- 


     | 5. | Parent has no plan or intent to, following the Merger, sell,
distribute, or otherwise dispose of any of the assets of the Company acquired
in the Merger, except for dispositions made in the ordinary course of
business, transfers of assets to one or more corporations controlled (within
the meaning of Section 368(c)) in each case by the transferor corporation in
accordance with Section 368(a)(2)(C). 
---|---|--- 
 



     | 6. | Following the Merger, Parent, Merger Sub or another member of
Parents "qualified group" will continue the Companys historic business or
use a significant portion of the Companys historic business assets in a
business. For purposes of this representation letter, Parents "qualified
group" means one or more chains of corporations connected through stock
ownership with Parent, but only if Parent owns directly stock meeting the
requirements of Section 368(c) in at least one other corporation, and stock
meeting the requirements of Section 368(c) in each of the corporations (except
Parent) is owned directly by one of the other corporations. In addition,
Parent will be treated as owning its proportionate share of the Companys
business assets used in a business or any partnership in which members of
Parents qualified group either own a significant interest or have active and
substantial management functions as a partner with respect to that partnership
business. 
---|---|--- 



     | 7. | At all times prior to and after the Effective Time, Merger
Sub has been and will be a disregarded entity for United States federal income
tax purposes pursuant to Regulation § 301.7701-3(b) (a "Disregarded Entity"),
no election to be treated as a corporation has been or will be made under
Regulation § 301.7701-3(b) with respect to Merger Sub, and neither Parent nor
Merger Sub has any plan or intention to take any action or fail to take any
action that would result in Merger Sub becoming an entity that is not a
Disregarded Entity. 
---|---|--- 



     | 8. | Parent does not have any plan or intention to sell or
otherwise dispose of its membership interests in Merger Sub to any person that
is not a member of Parents "qualified group." 
---|---|--- 



     | 9. | To the best knowledge of Parent, the liabilities of the
Company assumed by Merger Sub and the liabilities to which the transferred
assets of the Company are subject were incurred by the Company in the
ordinary course of its business. 
---|---|--- 



     | 10. | Parent, the Company and the shareholders of the Company will
pay their respective expenses, if any, incurred in connection with the Merger,
except as otherwise provided in Section 6.12 of the Merger Agreement. 
---|---|--- 

 Parent (or any of its subsidiaries) and the Company (or any of its
subsidiaries) that was issued, acquired or will be settled at a discount. 
---|---|--- 



     | 12. | Parent is not an investment company with the meaning of
Sections 368(a)(2)(F)(iii) and (iv). 
---|---|--- 



     | 13. | To the best knowledge of Parent, the Company is not under
the jurisdiction of a court in a Title 11 or similar case within the meaning
of Section 368(a)(3)(A).  
---|---|--- 



     | 14. | At the Effective Time, the fair market value of the assets
of the Company transferred to Merger Sub will equal or exceed the sum of the
liabilities assumed by Merger Sub, plus the amount of liabilities, if any, to
which the assets are subject. 
---|---|--- 



     | 15. | The payment of cash in lieu of fractional shares of Parent
Common Stock is solely for the purpose of avoiding the expense and
inconvenience to Parent of issuing fractional shares and does not represent
separately bargained-for consideration. The total cash consideration that will
be paid in the transaction to the Company shareholders instead of issuing
fractional shares of Parent Common Stock will not exceed one percent (1%) of
the total consideration that will be issued in the transaction to the Company
shareholders in exchange for their shares of Company Common Stock. The
fractional share interests of each Company shareholder will be aggregated, and
(with the possible exception of Company Common Stock held in multiple
accounts) no Company shareholder will receive cash in an amount greater to or
greater than the value of one full share of Parent Common Stock. 
---|---|--- 


     | 16. | Neither Parent nor any of its current or former subsidiaries
has been a "distributing corporation" or a "controlled corporation" in a
distribution of stock intended to qualify for tax-free treatment under
Section 355(a): (i) at any time during the two-year period prior to the date
of the Agreement, (ii) at any time during the period commencing on the date of
the Agreement and ending at the Effective Time, or (iii) which could
otherwise constitute part of a "plan" or "series of related transactions"
(within the meaning of Section 355(e)) in conjunction with and including the
Merger. 
---|---|--- 


     | 17. | None of the compensation received by any shareholder-
employee of the Company will be separate consideration for, or allocable to,
any of their shares of Company Common Stock; none of the shares of Parent
Common Stock received by any shareholder-employee will be separate
consideration for, or allocable to, any employment, consulting or similar
agreement; and the compensation paid to any shareholder-employee will be
for services actually rendered and will be commensurate with amounts paid to
third parties bargaining at arms-length for similar services. 
---|---|--- 

 and the S-4 Registration Statement represent the entire understanding between
or among (i) Parent and its subsidiaries, and (ii) the Company and its
subsidiaries and, to the best knowledge of the management of Parent, between
or among such entities and the affiliates and stockholders of Parent and the
Company with respect to the Merger, and there are no other written or oral
agreements regarding the Merger other than those expressly referred to in the
Agreement, the documents described in the Agreement and the S-4 Registration
Statement. 
---|---|--- 



     | 19. | To the best knowledge of the management of Parent and Merger
Sub, none of the representations contained in the representation letters
provided by the Company to Fulbright and Jaworski L.L.P. and Sullivan and
Cromwell LLP on the date hereof are untrue, incorrect or incomplete as of the
date hereof or will be untrue, incorrect or incomplete at the Effective Time. 
---|---|--- 


     | 20. | Neither Parent nor Merger Sub will take any position on any
federal, state, or local income or franchise tax return, or take any other tax
reporting position that is inconsistent with the treatment of the Merger as a
reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) or with any of the
foregoing representations, unless otherwise required by a final judgment,
decree or other order which addresses the Merger by a court of competent
jurisdiction, or by applicable state or local income or franchise tax law (and
then only to the extent required by such applicable law). Neither Parent nor
Merger Sub is aware of any facts that would cause the Merger to fail to
qualify as a "reorganization" within the meaning of Section 368(a). 
---|---|--- 



     | 21. | After the Merger, the shareholders of the Company will not
be in control of Parent within the meaning of Section 368(a)(2)(H). 
---|---|--- 


     | 22. | Neither Parent nor any corporation related to Parent now
owns, directly or indirectly, nor has owned during the past five (5) years,

 EXHIBIT D



(Affiliates Letter)



[], 2005



Ladies and Gentlemen:



I have been advised that I may be deemed to [be][have been] an "affiliate" of
USF Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the " _Company_ "), as of the time of
the special meeting of stockholders of the Company in connection with
the Merger (as defined below), as the term "affiliate" is defined for
purposes of paragraphs (c) and (d) of Rule 145 of the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission (the " _Commission_ ") under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (together with the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder, the " _Securities Act_ "). Pursuant to the
terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of February 27, 2005 (the
" _Merger Agreement_ "), by and among the Company, Yellow Roadway
Corporation, a Delaware corporation (" _Parent_ "), and Yankee II LLC, a
Delaware limited liability company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Parent ("
_Merger Sub_ "), the Company will be merged with and into Merger Sub, in
consideration of cash and shares of common stock, par value $1.00 per share,
of Parent (" _Parent Common Stock_ "), with Merger Sub as the surviving entity
(the " _Merger_ ").



I hereby represent, warrant, and covenant to Parent and Merger Sub that in
the event I receive any shares of Parent Common Stock as a result of the
Merger (such shares, " _Affiliate Shares_ "):



A. I shall not make any sale, transfer or other disposition of any Affiliate
Shares in violation of the Securities Act.



B. I have carefully read this letter and the Merger Agreement and discussed
their requirements and other applicable limitations upon my ability to sell,
transfer, or otherwise dispose of Affiliate Shares, to the extent I felt
necessary, with my counsel or counsel for Parent and Merger Sub.



C. I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Common Stock to me
pursuant to the Merger has been or will be registered with the Commission
under the Securities Act on a Registration Statement on Form S-4. However, I
have also been advised that, because at the time the Merger will be submitted
for a vote of the stockholders of the Company, I may be deemed to be an
affiliate of the Company, and the distribution by me of any Affiliate Shares
will not be registered under the Securities Act, and that I may not
sell, transfer, or otherwise dispose of any Affiliate Shares, unless (i) such
sale, transfer or other  

  disposition has been registered under the Securities Act, (ii) such sale,
transfer or other disposition is made in conformity with the volume and
other limitations of Rule 145 promulgated by the Commission under the
Securities Act, (iii) in the opinion of counsel reasonably acceptable to
Parent, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt from
registration under the Securities Act or (iv) pursuant to a "no action"
letter or interpretive letter obtained by the undersigned from the staff of
the Commission, such sale, transfer or other disposition is otherwise exempt
from registration under the Securities Act. 



D. I understand that Parent is under no obligation to register under the
Securities Act the sale, transfer, or other disposition by me or on my behalf
of any Affiliate Shares or to take any other action necessary in order to make
an exemption from such registration available;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Parent agrees that it shall meet the requirements of Rule 144(c) under the
Securities Act.



E. I understand that stop transfer instructions will be given to Parents
transfer agent with respect to my Affiliate Shares and that there will be
placed on the certificates for any Affiliate Shares, or any substitutions
therefore, a legend stating in substance:



"The shares represented by this certificate were issued in a transaction to
which Rule 145 promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended,
applies. The shares represented by this certificate may only be transferred in
accordance with the terms of an agreement dated as of [], 2005, between the
registered holder hereof and the issuer of this certificate, a copy of which
agreement will be mailed to the holder hereof without charge within five days
after receipt of written request therefore."



F. I also understand that unless the transfer by me of my Affiliate Shares has
been registered under the Securities Act or is a sale made in conformity with
the provisions of Rule 145, Parent reserves the right to put the following
legend on the certificates issued to my transferee:



"The shares represented by this certificate have not been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and were acquired from a person who
received such shares in a transaction to which Rule 145 promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended, applies. The shares may not be sold,
pledged, or otherwise transferred except (i) pursuant to an
effective registration statement or (ii) in accordance with an exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended."

 G. Execution of this letter should not be considered an admission on my part
that I am an "affiliate" of the Company as described in the first paragraph
of this letter, nor as a waiver of any rights I may have to object to any
claim that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter;
provided, however, that notwithstanding this paragraph G, I agree that I am
bound by the terms of this letter and that this paragraph G shall not prohibit
the Company from enforcing the terms of this letter against me.



It is understood and agreed that the legends set forth in paragraph E and
F above shall be removed by the delivery of substitute certificates without
such legend if, with respect to any Affiliate Shares, (1) I shall have
delivered to Parent a copy of a letter from the staff of the Commission, or an
opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent,
to the effect that such legend is not required for purposes of the Securities
Act, (2) one year shall have elapsed from the date I received such Affiliate
Shares and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(2) are then available to me or (iii)
two years shall have elapsed from the date I received such Affiliate Shares
and the provisions of Rule 145(d)(3) are then available to me.



Parent agrees that it will (a) supply me with any information necessary to
enable me to make routine sales of any Affiliate Shares as may be permitted,
by and in accordance with, the provisions of Rule 144 under the Securities Act
or any similar rule or regulation of the Commission hereafter applicable, and
(b) promptly furnish to me, upon my written request, a written statement
representing that, as of the date of such written statement, it has complied
with the reporting requirements enumerated in Rule 144(c) under the Securities
Act.



This letter constitutes the complete understanding between Parent and me
concerning the subject matter hereof. This letter shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Delaware.
