2 ARTICLE II

_EFFECT OF THE MERGER ON THE CAPITAL STOCK OF THE_

_CONSTITUENT CORPORATIONS; EXCHANGE OF CERTIFICATES; COMPANY STOCK OPTIONS
AND RESTRICTED STOCK_

Section 2.1. _Effect on Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue of
the Merger and without any action on the part of the Company, Parent, Merger
Sub or the holder of any securities of the Company or Merger Sub:

 

(a) _Conversion of Company Common Stock_. Subject to _Section 2.4_, each
issued and outstanding share of Company Common Stock, other than (i) shares
to be canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_, (ii) any shares of
Company Common Stock held by any direct or indirect wholly-owned subsidiary of
the Company (the " _Remaining Shares_ "), which shares shall remain
outstanding except that the number of such shares shall be adjusted
appropriately in the Merger to preserve the relative percentage interest in
the Company represented by such shares immediately prior to the Effective
Time and (iii) Appraisal Shares, shall be converted into and represent the
right to receive $88.50 in cash (the " _Merger Consideration_ "), payable
without interest to the holder thereof in accordance with this Agreement. As
of the Effective Time, all such shares of Company Common Stock shall no longer
be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and shall cease to exist,
and each holder of a certificate that, immediately prior to the Effective
Time, represented any such shares of Company Common Stock (each, a "
_Certificate_ ") or any non-certificated shares of Company Common Stock held
in book-entry form (" _Book-Entry Shares_ ") shall cease to have any rights
with respect thereto, except the right to receive the Merger Consideration to
be paid in consideration therefor in accordance with _Section 2.2(b)_,
without interest.

 

(b) _Conversion of Merger Sub Capital Stock_. At the Effective Time, by virtue
of the Merger and without any action on the part of Parent, each share of
capital stock of Merger Sub issued and outstanding immediately prior to the
Effective Time shall be converted into and become one validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable share of common stock, par value $1.00 per share, of
the Surviving Corporation and, upon surrender of the certificate or
certificates representing such shares of capital stock of Merger Sub, the
Surviving Corporation shall promptly issue to Parent a certificate or
certificates representing the shares of common stock of the Surviving
Corporation into which it has been converted. As of immediately after the
Effective Time, such shares, together with the Remaining Shares (as the same
may be adjusted in accordance with  _Section 2.1(a)(ii)_), shall be the only
issued and outstanding capital stock of the Surviving Corporation.

(c) _Cancellation of Treasury Stock and Parent-Owned Stock_. Any shares of
Company Common Stock that are owned immediately prior to the Effective Time by
the Company as treasury stock, and any shares of Company Common Stock owned
immediately prior to the Effective Time by Parent or Merger Sub, shall be
automatically canceled and shall cease to exist and no consideration shall be
delivered in exchange therefor.

 



3 (d) _Appraisal Rights_. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, shares of Company Common Stock that are issued and outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time and which are held by any Person who
is entitled to demand, and who properly demands, appraisal of such shares ("
_Appraisal Shares_ ") pursuant to, and who complies in all respects with the
provisions of Sections 10.351 through 10.368 of the TBOC, as applicable, shall
not be converted into or be exchangeable for the right to receive the Merger
Consideration, but instead such holder of Appraisal Shares shall be entitled
to payment of the fair value of such Appraisal Shares in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the TBOC (and, at the Effective Time, such Appraisal
Shares shall no longer be outstanding and shall automatically be canceled and
shall cease to exist, and such holder shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto, except the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal
Shares in accordance with the applicable provisions of the TBOC), unless and
until such holder shall have failed to perfect or shall have effectively
withdrawn or lost the right to receive the fair value of such Appraisal Shares
under the TBOC. If any such holder of Appraisal Shares shall have failed to
perfect or shall have effectively withdrawn or lost such right, then the right
of such holder to be paid the fair value of such Appraisal Shares shall cease
and such Appraisal Shares shall thereupon be treated as if they had
been converted as of the Effective Time into and become exchangeable solely
for the right to receive the Merger Consideration payable in accordance with
_Section 2.1(a)_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall comply, and
after the Effective Time, Parent shall comply, with the information delivery
and other requirements under Sections 10.355 and 10.358 of the TBOC. The
Company shall give Parent (i) prompt notice of any written demands for
appraisal of any shares of Company Common Stock, attempted withdrawals of
such demands and any other instruments served pursuant to the TBOC and
received by the Company relating to demands for appraisal and (ii) the
opportunity to participate in negotiations and proceedings with respect to
demands for appraisal under the TBOC. The Company shall not, except with the
prior written consent of Parent, voluntarily make any payment with respect to
any demands for appraisal of Company Common Stock, or settle, or offer or
agree to settle, any such demands. Any portion of the Merger Consideration
made available to the Paying Agent pursuant to _Section 2.2_ to pay for
shares of Company Common Stock for which appraisal rights have been perfected
shall be returned to Parent upon demand. Each shareholder who, pursuant to
Sections 10.351 through 10.368 of the TBOC, as applicable, becomes entitled to
payment of the fair value of any Appraisal Shares will receive payment
therefor from the Surviving Corporation (but only after the value therefor
has been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to such applicable
Section).

 

Section 2.2. _Exchange of Certificates_.

 

(a) _Paying Agent_. At or prior to the Effective Time, Parent shall deposit,
or cause to be deposited, with a U.S. bank or trust company that shall be
appointed by Parent and reasonably acceptable to the Company (the " _Paying
Agent_ "), in trust for the benefit of holders of Company Common Stock (other
than Restricted Stock), cash in U.S. dollars sufficient to pay the aggregate
Merger Consideration in exchange for all of the shares of Company Common Stock
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than shares to be
canceled in accordance with _Section 2.1(c)_, the Remaining Shares,
Restricted Stock and Appraisal Shares), payable upon due surrender of the
Certificates or Book-Entry Shares pursuant to the provisions of this _Article
II_ (such cash being hereinafter referred to as the " _Exchange Fund_ ").

 



4 (b) _Payment Procedures_.

 

(i) As soon as reasonably practicable after the Effective Time and in any
event not later than the fifth business day following the Effective Time, the
Paying Agent shall mail to each holder of record of Company Common Stock
(including Restricted Stock) whose Company Common Stock was converted into the
right to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section 2.1(a)_, (A)
a letter of transmittal (which shall be in customary form and shall specify
that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title to Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares shall pass, only upon proper delivery of the Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the
Paying Agent and shall be in such form and have such other provisions as
Parent and the Company shall reasonably determine) and (B) instructions for
use in effecting the surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of
loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares in exchange for the Merger
Consideration.

 

(ii) Upon surrender of Certificates (or effective affidavits of loss in lieu
thereof) or Book-Entry Shares to the Paying Agent or, in the case of
Restricted Stock, to the Surviving Corporation or the Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation that employs the applicable holder of Restricted Stock,
together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed
in accordance with the instructions thereto, and such other documents as may
customarily be required by the Paying Agent, the holder of such Certificates
or Book-Entry Shares shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor a check
in an amount equal to the product of (x) the number of shares of Company
Common Stock represented by such holders properly surrendered Certificates
(or effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares
multiplied by (y) the Merger Consideration. No interest will be paid or
accrued on any amount payable upon due surrender of Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares. In the event of a transfer of ownership of shares of Company Common
Stock (other than Restricted Stock) that is not registered in the transfer or
stock records of the Company, a check for any cash to be paid upon due
surrender of the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares may be paid to such a
transferee if the Certificate or Book-Entry Shares formerly representing such
shares of Company Common Stock is presented to the Paying Agent, accompanied
by all documents required to evidence and effect such transfer and to evidence
that any applicable stock transfer or other Taxes have been paid or are not
applicable.

(iii) As soon after the Closing Date as shall be practicable and, in any
event, no later than the first payroll date at least five (5) business days
following the Effective Time, Parent shall cause to be paid by the Surviving
Corporation (or the Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation that employs the
applicable holder of a Company Stock Option or a Restricted Stock Unit) to
each holder of a Company Stock Option or a Restricted Stock Unit (whether or
not then vested or exercisable) the amount due and payable to such holder
pursuant to _Section 2.3(a)_ hereof in respect of such Company Stock Option
or such Restricted Stock Unit.

(iv) No later than the first payroll date at least five (5) business days
following the later of (x) the Effective Time and (y) the surrender to the
Surviving Corporation (or the Subsidiary of the Surviving Corporation that
employs the applicable holder of Restricted Stock) of Certificates (or
effective affidavits of loss in lieu thereof) or Book-Entry Shares evidencing
Restricted Stock pursuant to the provisions of this _Article II_ , Parent
shall cause to be paid by the Surviving Corporation (or the Subsidiary of the
Surviving Corporation that employs the applicable holder of Restricted Stock)
to each such holder of Restricted Stock (whether or not then vested or
exercisable) the product of the Merger Consideration pursuant to  _Section
2.1(a)_ and the number of such holders shares of Restricted Stock, in
exchange for all of the holders shares of Restricted Stock immediately prior
to the Effective Time (other than shares to be canceled in accordance with
_Section 2.1(c)_ and Appraisal Shares).

 



5 (c) _Termination of Exchange Fund_. Any portion of the Exchange
Fund (including the proceeds of any investments thereof) that remains
undistributed to the former holders of shares of Company Common Stock for one
year after the Effective Time shall be delivered to the Surviving Corporation
upon demand, and any former holders of shares of Company Common Stock who
have not surrendered their Certificates or Book-Entry Shares in accordance
with this _Section 2.2_ shall thereafter look only to the Surviving
Corporation for payment of their claim for the Merger Consideration, without
any interest thereon, upon due surrender of their Certificates or Book-Entry
Shares.

(d) _No Liability_. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, none of
the Company, Parent, Merger Sub, the Surviving Corporation, the Paying Agent
or any other person shall be liable to any former holder of shares of Company
Common Stock for any amount properly delivered to a public official pursuant
to any applicable abandoned property, escheat or similar Law.

 

(e) _Investment of Exchange Fund_. The Paying Agent shall invest all cash
included in the Exchange Fund as reasonably directed by Parent; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that any investment of such cash shall be limited to direct short-
term obligations of, or short-term obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by, the U.S. government and that no such investment or
loss thereon shall affect the amounts payable to holders of Certificates or
Book-Entry Shares or Company Stock Options pursuant to this _Article II_ and
_Section 2.3(a)_. Any interest and other income resulting from such
investments shall be paid to the Surviving Corporation pursuant to _Section
2.2(c)_.

(f)  _Other Payees_. If any cash payment is to be made to a Person other than
the Person in whose name the applicable surrendered Certificate is registered,
it shall be a condition of such payment that the Person requesting such
payment shall pay any transfer or other similar Taxes required by reason of
the making of such cash payment to a Person other than the registered holder
of the surrendered Certificate or shall establish to the satisfaction of the
Paying Agent that such Tax has been paid or is not payable.

 



6 (g) _Closing of Transfer Books_. At the Effective Time, the stock transfer
books of the Company shall be closed, and there shall be no further
registration of transfers on the stock transfer books of the Surviving
Corporation of the shares of Company Common Stock that were outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time. Subject to _Section 2.2(d)_, if, at
any time after the Effective Time, Certificates or Book-Entry Shares are
presented to the Surviving Corporation or Parent for any reason, they shall be
cancelled and exchanged pursuant to and subject to the requirements of this
_Article II_.

(h) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. If any Certificate shall have
been lost, stolen or destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact
by the Person claiming such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed and,
if required by Parent or the Paying Agent, the posting by such Person of a
bond, in such reasonable amount as Parent may direct, as indemnity against any
claim that may be made against it with respect to such Certificate, the Paying
Agent will issue in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate a
check in the amount of the number of shares of Company Common Stock
represented by such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate multiplied by the
Merger Consideration.

 

(i) _Withholding Taxes_. The Surviving Corporation, Parent and the Paying
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any holder of Company Common
Stock, Company Stock Options or Restricted Stock Units such amounts as are
required to be deducted and withheld with respect to the making of such
payment under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, and the rules and
regulations promulgated thereunder (the " _Code_ "), or under any provision of
state, local or foreign Tax Law. To the extent amounts are so withheld and
paid over to the appropriate Governmental Authority, such withheld amounts
shall be treated for the purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the
former holder of the Company Common Stock, Company Stock Options or Restricted
Stock Units, as applicable, in respect of whom such withholding was made.

Section 2.3. _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock_. As
soon as reasonably practicable following the date of this Agreement, and in
any event prior to the Effective Time, the Company Board (or, if appropriate,
any committee administering any Company Stock Plan) will adopt resolutions,
and the Company will take all other actions as may be necessary or required in
accordance with applicable Law and each Company Stock Plan (including, the
award agreements in respect of awards granted thereunder) to give effect to
this  _Section 2.3_ to provide that:

(a) _Treatment of Company Stock Options and Restricted Stock Units_. Prior to
the Effective Time, the Company shall take all actions necessary to provide
that (i) each option outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time
(whether or not then vested or exercisable) that represents the right
to acquire shares of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Company Stock Option_
") shall be cancelled and terminated and converted at the Effective Time into
the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Option Consideration for each
share of Company Common Stock then subject to the Company Stock Option and
(ii) each restricted stock unit outstanding immediately prior to the Effective
Time (whether or not then vested) that represents the right to acquire shares
of Company Common Stock (each, a " _Restricted Stock Unit_ ") shall be
cancelled and terminated and converted at the

 



7  Effective Time into the right to receive a cash amount equal to the Merger
Consideration for each share of Company Common Stock subject to such
Restricted Stock Unit (" _Restricted Stock Unit Consideration_ "). Subject to
_Section 2.2(b)(iii)_, the Option Consideration and Restricted Stock Unit
Consideration shall be paid as soon after the Closing Date as shall be
practicable and in any event, no later than the first payroll date at least
five (5) business days following the Effective Time. For purposes of this
Agreement, " _Option Consideration_ " means, with respect to any share of
Company Common Stock issuable under each Company Stock Option, an amount
equal to the excess, if any, of (y) the Merger Consideration per share of
Company Common Stock over (z) the exercise price payable in respect of such
share of Company Common Stock issuable under such Company Stock Option. 

(b) _Treatment of Restricted Stock_. Each share of Restricted Stock that is
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time shall, as of the
Effective Time, automatically and without any action on the part of the holder
thereof, vest in full and the restrictions with respect thereto shall lapse,
and each share of Restricted Stock shall be deemed issued and outstanding as
of immediately prior to the Effective Time and otherwise subject to the terms
and conditions of this Agreement (including, _Sections 2.1_ and _2.2_ ).

 

(c) _Termination of Company Stock Plans_. Prior to the Effective Time, the
Company shall take all actions necessary to terminate all of the Company
Stock Plans, such termination to be effective at the Effective Time. From and
after the Effective Time, all Company Stock Plans shall be terminated and no
Company Stock Options, Restricted Stock, Restricted Stock Units or any other
rights with respect to Company Common Stock shall be granted or be outstanding
thereunder.

 

Section 2.4. _Adjustments_. Notwithstanding any provision of this _Article II_
to the contrary (but without in any way limiting the covenants in _Section
5.2_), if between the date of this Agreement and the Effective Time the number
of outstanding shares of Company Common Stock shall have been changed into a
different number of shares or a different class, by reason of the occurrence
or record date of any stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction, the Merger Consideration shall be equitably adjusted to reflect
fully the effect of such stock dividend, subdivision, reclassification,
recapitalization, split, combination, exchange of shares or similar
transaction and to provide the holders of shares of Company Common Stock the
same economic effect as contemplated by this Agreement prior to such event,
subject to further adjustment in accordance with this _Section 2.4_.

Effect.

 

Section 3.5. _Company SEC Documents; Undisclosed Liabilities_.

 

(a) The Company and its Subsidiaries have filed all reports, schedules, forms,
certifications, prospectuses, and registration, proxy and other statements
required to be filed by them with the SEC since December 31, 2010
(collectively, and together with any other reports on Form 8-K (other than any
information in or any exhibit to such reports which is deemed not to be
"filed" and is not specifically identified in any filing under the Securities
Act or the Exchange Act as being incorporated therein by reference) filed on a
voluntary basis, and in each case including all other exhibits and schedules
thereto and documents incorporated by reference therein, the " _Company SEC
Documents_ "). The Company SEC Documents, as of their respective effective
dates (in the case of Company SEC Documents that are registration statements
filed pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act) and as of their
respective SEC filing dates (in the case of all other Company SEC Documents),
or, if amended, supplemented or superseded, as finally amended, supplemented
or superseded prior to the date of this Agreement, complied in all material
respects with the requirements of the Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, as the case may be, applicable to such Company SEC
Documents, and none of the Company SEC Documents as of such respective dates
contained any untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading. As of the date of this Agreement, there are no
outstanding or unresolved comments received from the SEC staff with respect to
the Company SEC Documents. To the Knowledge of the Company, none of the
Company SEC Documents is the subject of ongoing SEC review or investigation.

(b) The consolidated financial statements of the Company included in the
Company SEC Documents as of their respective dates (if amended, as of the date
of the last such amendment) comply as to form in all material respects with
applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of
the SEC with respect thereto, have been prepared in accordance with GAAP
(except, in the case of unaudited quarterly statements, as indicated in the
notes thereto) applied on a consistent basis during the periods involved
(except as may be indicated in the notes thereto) and fairly present in all
material respects the consolidated financial position of the Company and its
consolidated Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof and the consolidated results
of their operations and cash flows for the periods then ended (subject, in
the case of unaudited quarterly statements, to normal year-end audit
adjustments, none of which has been or will be, individually or in the
aggregate, material to the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries on a
consolidated basis).

(c) The Company has established and maintains internal control over financial
reporting and disclosure controls and procedures (as such terms are defined in
Rule 13a-15 and Rule 15d-15 under the Exchange Act); such disclosure controls
and procedures are 

 



13  designed to ensure that material information relating to the Company,
including its consolidated Subsidiaries, required to be disclosed by the
Company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is
accumulated and communicated to the Companys principal executive officer and
its principal financial officer to allow timely decisions regarding required
disclosure; and such disclosure controls and procedures are effective to
ensure that information required to be disclosed by the Company in the reports
that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and
forms. The Companys principal executive officer and its principal financial
officer have disclosed, based on their most recent evaluation, to the
Companys auditors and the audit committee of the Company Board (x) all
significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal controls
which could adversely affect the Companys ability to record, process,
summarize and report financial data and have identified for the Companys
auditors any material weaknesses in internal controls and (y) any fraud,
whether or not material, that involves management or other employees who have
a significant role in the Companys internal controls. The principal executive
officer and the principal financial officer of the Company have made all
certifications required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, the Exchange Act and any
related rules and regulations promulgated by the SEC with respect to the
Company SEC Documents, and the statements contained in such
certifications were complete and correct when made. The management of the
Company has completed its assessment of the effectiveness of the Companys
internal control over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements
of Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act for the year ended December 31,
2012, and such assessment concluded that such controls were effective. To the
Knowledge of the Company, as of the date of this Agreement, there are no facts
or circumstances that would prevent its chief executive officer and chief
financial officer from giving the certifications and attestations required
pursuant to the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to Section 404 of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act, without qualification, when next due.

(d) Except (i) as reflected or otherwise reserved against on the balance sheet

this Agreement, (ii) for liabilities and obligations incurred since the
Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of business consistent with past
practice and (iii) for liabilities and obligations incurred under or in
accordance with this Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has any
liabilities or obligations of any nature (whether or not accrued or
contingent), that would be required to be reflected or reserved against on a
consolidated balance sheet of the Company prepared in accordance with GAAP or
the notes thereto, other than as have not had and would not have, individually
or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect.

 

(e) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to, or has any
commitment to become a party to, any joint venture, off-balance sheet
partnership or any similar Contract (including any Contract or arrangement
relating to any transaction or relationship between or among the Company and
any of its Subsidiaries, on the one hand, and any unconsolidated Affiliate,
including any structured finance, special purpose or limited purpose entity or
Person, on the other hand, or any "off-balance sheet arrangements" (as defined
in Item 303(a) of Regulation S-K of the SEC)), where the result, purpose or
effect of such Contract is to avoid disclosure of any material transaction
involving, or material liabilities of, the Company in the Companys published
financial statements or any Company SEC Documents.

law, statute, ordinance, rule, regulation, judgment, order, injunction, decree
or agency requirement of or undertaking to any Governmental Authority,
including common law (collectively, " _Laws_ " and each, a " _Law_ "), except

operate their properties and assets or to carry on their 

 



15  businesses as they are now being conducted (the " _Company Permits_ "),
except where the failure to have any of the Company Permits would not have,
individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. All
Company Permits are in full force and effect, except where the failure to be
in full force and effect would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a
Company Material Adverse Effect. No suspension or cancellation of any of the
Company Permits is pending or, to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened,
except where such suspension or cancellation would not have, individually or
in the aggregate, a Company Material Adverse Effect. The Company and its
Subsidiaries are not, and since December 31, 2010 have not been, in violation

would result in a violation of, breach, default or loss of a benefit under, or
acceleration of an obligation of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries

Governmental Authority to fail or refuse to issue, renew, extend, any Company
Permit (in each case, with or without notice or lapse of time or both),

that would not have, individually or in the aggregate, a Company Material
Adverse Effect.

Section 5.3. _No Solicitation by the Company_.

 

(a) Except as expressly permitted by this _Section 5.3_ (including _Section
5.3(b)_), (x) the Company shall, and shall cause its Subsidiaries to, and
shall use

 



38  commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Companys and its Subsidiaries
respective directors, officers, employees, investment bankers, financial
advisors, attorneys, accountants, agents and other representatives
(collectively, " _Representatives_ ") to, (i) immediately cease and cause to
be terminated any discussions or negotiations with any Person (other than
Parent, Merger Sub and their respective Representatives) that may be ongoing
with respect to an Alternative Proposal, (ii) promptly demand that any Person
(or its Representatives) in possession of confidential information about the
Company or its Subsidiaries that was previously provided to such Persons by
or on behalf of the Company or its Subsidiaries in connection with an
Alternative Proposal return or destroy all such information, (iii) immediately
prohibit any access by any Person (other than Parent, Merger Sub and their

relating to a possible Alternative Proposal and (iv) not (A)
solicit, initiate, knowingly facilitate, knowingly encourage (including by

Recommendation or publicly recommend the approval or adoption of, or publicly
approve or adopt, or propose to publicly recommend, approve or adopt, any
Alternative Proposal and (y) within five (5) business days of receipt of a
written request of Parent following receipt by the Company of an Alternative
Proposal, the Company shall publicly reconfirm the Company Board
Recommendation, _provided_ that, Parent shall not be permitted to make such
request on more than one (1) occasion with respect to a particular Alternative
Proposal and one (1) additional occasion with respect to such Alternative
Proposal each time that a material amendment is made to such
Alternative Proposal, and the Company may not unreasonably withhold, delay
(beyond the five (5) business day period) or condition the public
reconfirmation of the Company Board Recommendation (the taking of any action
described in clause (x)(iv)(C) or the failure to take the action described in
clause (y) being referred to as an " _Adverse Recommendation Change_ ").
Without limiting the foregoing, it is understood that any violation of the
foregoing restrictions in this  _Section 5.3(a)_ by the Companys
Subsidiaries or Representatives shall be deemed to be a breach of this
_Section 5.3_ by the Company.

(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in _Section 5.3(a)_,
if at any time on or following the date of this Agreement and prior to the
time the Company Shareholder Approval is obtained, (i) the Company or any of
its Representatives has received a written Alternative Proposal that the
Company Board believes is _bona fide_ , (ii) the Company Board, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel,
determines in good faith that such Alternative Proposal constitutes or could
reasonably be expected to lead to or result in a Superior Proposal and (iii)
such Alternative Proposal did not result from a material breach of this 
_Section 5.3_, then the Company may, subject to provisos (x) and (y) below,
(A) furnish information, including confidential information, with respect to
the Company, its Subsidiaries and the Company Joint Ventures to the Person
making such

 



39  Alternative Proposal and (B) participate in discussions or negotiations
regarding such Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that (x) the Company will not,
and will use commercially reasonable efforts to cause its Representatives not
to, disclose any non-public information to such Person unless the Company has,
or first enters into, an Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement and (y) the
Company will provide to Parent non-public information about the Company or
its Subsidiaries that was not previously provided or made available to Parent
prior to or substantially concurrently with providing or making available such
non-public information to such other Person. 

(c) In addition to the other obligations of the Company set forth in this
_Section 5.3_, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in writing (and in
no event later than twenty-four (24) hours after receipt) if any proposal,
offer or inquiry is received by, any information is requested from, or any
discussions or negotiations are sought to be initiated or continued with, the
Company in respect of any Alternative Proposal, and shall, in any such notice
to Parent, indicate the identity of the Person making such proposal, offer,
inquiry or request and the terms and conditions of any such proposals or
offers or the nature of any inquiries or requests (and shall include with such
notice copies of any written materials received from or on behalf of such
Person relating to such proposal, offer, inquiry or request), and thereafter
shall promptly keep Parent reasonably informed of all material developments
affecting the status and terms of any such proposals, offers, inquiries or
requests (and the Company shall promptly provide Parent with copies of any
additional written materials received by the Company or that the Company has
delivered to any third party making an Alternative Proposal (other than
information provided by the Company in accordance with _Section 5.3(b)_, but
subject to the Companys compliance with _Section 5.3(b)(y)_) that relate to
such proposals, offers, inquiries or requests) and of the status of any such
discussions or negotiations.

(d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Company receives a written
Alternative Proposal that the Company Board believes is _bona fide_ and the
Company Board, after consultation with its financial advisors and outside
legal counsel, concludes that such Alternative Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal, then the Company Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the
Company Shareholder Approval, if it determines in good faith,
after consultation with outside counsel, that the failure to take such action
would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary duties, (x)
effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or (y) cause the Company to enter
into a definitive agreement relating to such Superior Proposal and terminate
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_; _provided_ , _however_ ,
that the Company Board may not effect an Adverse Recommendation Change and/or
cause the Company to enter into a definitive agreement relating to such
Superior Proposal and terminate this Agreement pursuant to _Section
7.1(d)(ii)_ pursuant to the foregoing unless:

 

(i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent specifying in
reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including a description of the
material terms of such Superior Proposal and delivering to Parent a copy of
the latest version of any proposed Acquisition Agreement for such Superior
Proposal and of any other relevant proposed transaction documents related
thereto, at least five (5) calendar days in advance of its intention to take
such action, unless at the

 



40  time such notice is otherwise required to be given there are less than five
(5) calendar days prior to the Company Shareholders Meeting, in which case the
Company shall provide as much notice as is reasonably practicable (the period
inclusive of all such days, the " _Notice Period_ ") (it being understood and
agreed that any material amendment to the terms of a Superior Proposal shall
require a new notice pursuant to this _Section 5.3(d)(i)_ and a new Notice
Period, except that such new Notice Period in connection with any material
amendment shall be for two (2) business days from the time Parent receives
such notice (as opposed to five (5) calendar days); and

(ii) during the Notice Period the Company has negotiated, and has
used commercially reasonable efforts to cause its financial advisors and
outside legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in good faith (to the extent
Parent desires to negotiate) to make such adjustments in the terms and
conditions of this Agreement so that such Superior Proposal ceases to
constitute (in the judgment of the Company Board) a Superior Proposal.

 

(e) For purposes of this Agreement:

 

(i) " _Acceptable Confidentiality Agreement_ " means a confidentiality
agreement with a Person with confidentiality provisions that are in the
aggregate not materially less favorable to the Company than the provisions of
the Confidentiality Agreement are to the Company ( _provided_ that such
confidentiality agreement need not include "standstill" provisions or similar
restrictions and may not restrict the Company from complying with this
_Section 5.3_).

(ii) " _Alternative Proposal_ " means any inquiry, proposal or offer from any
Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act), other
than Parent and its Subsidiaries, relating to any (A) direct or indirect
acquisition (whether in a single transaction or a series of related
transactions), outside of the ordinary course of business, of assets of the
Company and its Subsidiaries (including securities of Subsidiaries) equal to
twenty percent (20%) or more of the Companys consolidated assets or to which
twenty percent (20%) or more of the Companys revenues or earnings on a
consolidated basis are attributable, (B) direct or indirect acquisition
(whether in a single transaction or a series of related transactions) of
beneficial ownership (within the meaning of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
of twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity securities of the
Company, (C) tender offer or exchange offer that if consummated would result
in any Person or "group" (as defined in Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
beneficially owning twenty percent (20%) or more of any class of equity
securities of the Company or (D) merger, consolidation, share exchange,
business combination, recapitalization, liquidation, dissolution or similar
transaction involving the Company which is structured to permit such Person
or group to acquire beneficial ownership of at least twenty percent (20%) of
the Companys consolidated assets or equity interests; in each case, other
than the transactions contemplated hereby.

 

(iii) " _Superior Proposal_ " means a _bona fide_ written offer, obtained
after the date of this Agreement and not in breach of this _Section 5.3_
(other than an immaterial breach), to acquire, directly or indirectly, more
than fifty percent (50%) of the outstanding equity securities of the Company
or assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries on a consolidated basis, made
by a third party, which is on terms and conditions which the Company Board
determines in good faith to be more favorable to the Companys shareholders
from a financial point of view than the transactions contemplated hereby,
taking into account at the time of determination any changes to the terms of
this Agreement that as of that time had been committed to by Parent in writing
and the ability of the Person making such proposal to consummate the
transactions contemplated by such proposal (based upon, among other things,
the availability of financing and the expectation of obtaining required
approvals).

 



41 (f) Notwithstanding anything in this _Section 5.3_ to the contrary, the
Company Board may, at any time prior to obtaining the Company Shareholder
Approval, effect an Adverse Recommendation Change in response to an
Intervening Event if the Company Board concludes in good faith, after
consultation with outside counsel and its financial advisors, that the
failure to take such action would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with
its fiduciary duties. An " _Intervening Event_ " means, with respect to the
Company, a material event or circumstance that arises or occurs after the
date of this Agreement, or a material consequence relating to an event or
circumstance existing on or before the date of this Agreement, that was in
either case not, prior to the date of this Agreement, known by the Company
Board; _provided_ , that in no event shall the receipt, existence or terms of
an Alternative Proposal or any matter relating thereto or consequence thereof
constitute an Intervening Event. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no such
Adverse Recommendation Change with respect to an Intervening Event shall occur
unless and until (i) the Company has provided prior written notice to Parent
specifying in reasonable detail the reasons for such action (including
a description of the material facts concerning the Intervening Event) at
least five (5) calendar days in advance of its intention to effect such
Adverse Recommendation Change, unless at the time such notice is otherwise
required to be given there are less than five (5) calendar days prior to the
Company Shareholders Meeting, in which case the Company shall provide as much
notice as is reasonably practicable and (ii) during the period after delivery
of such notice and prior to effecting any Adverse Recommendation Change, the
Company has negotiated, and has used commercially reasonable efforts to cause
its financial advisors and outside legal counsel to negotiate, with Parent in
good faith (to the extent Parent desires to negotiate) to make such
adjustments in the terms and conditions of this Agreement so that the Company
Board no longer concludes that the failure to make such Adverse Recommendation
Change would be reasonably likely to be inconsistent with its fiduciary
duties.

(g) Nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Company or the
Company Board from (i) issuing a "stop, look and listen" communication
pursuant to Rule 14d-9(f) under the Exchange Act or (ii) if the Company Board
determines in good faith (after consultation with outside legal counsel) that
its failure to do so would constitute a violation of applicable Law,
complying with Rule 14d-9 and Rule 14e-2 under the Exchange Act with respect
to an Alternative Proposal; _provided_ that any Adverse Recommendation Change
may only be made in accordance with  _Section 5.3(d)_ or _Section 5.3(f)_.
For the avoidance of doubt, a public statement that describes the Companys
receipt of an Alternative Proposal and the operation of this Agreement with
respect thereto shall not be deemed an Adverse Recommendation Change.

 



42 Section 5.4. _Commercially Reasonable Efforts_.

 

(a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement (including _Section
5.4(d)_), each of Parent and Merger Sub, on the one hand, and the Company, on
the other hand, shall cooperate with the other and use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
take, or cause to be taken, all actions, and do, or cause to be done, all
things, necessary, proper or advisable to cause the conditions to the Closing
to be satisfied as promptly as practicable (and in any event no later than the
Outside Date) and to consummate and make effective, in the most expeditious
manner practicable, the transactions contemplated hereby, including preparing
and filing promptly and fully all documentation to effect all necessary
filings, notifications, notices, petitions, statements, registrations,
submissions of information, applications and other documents (including any
required or recommended filings under applicable Antitrust Laws), (ii) obtain

consents, clearances, expirations or terminations of waiting periods,

necessary, proper or advisable to consummate the transactions contemplated
hereby, (iii) defend any lawsuits or other legal proceedings, whether judicial
or administrative, challenging this Agreement or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby and (iv) obtain all necessary consents,
approvals or waivers from third parties. For purposes of this Agreement, "

as amended, the HSR Act, the Federal Trade Commission Act, as amended, all
applicable Foreign Antitrust Laws and all other applicable Laws issued by a
Governmental Authority that are designed or intended to prohibit, restrict or
regulate actions having the purpose or effect of monopolization or restraint
of trade or lessening of competition.

(b) In furtherance and not in limitation of the foregoing, (i) each party
hereto (including by their respective Subsidiaries) agrees to make an
appropriate filing of a Notification and Report Form pursuant to the HSR Act
with respect to the transactions contemplated hereby as promptly as
practicable and in any event within fifteen (15) business days after the date
of this Agreement, unless the Company and Parent agree on a later date, and to
supply as promptly as practicable any additional information and documentary
material that may be requested by any Governmental Authority pursuant to the
HSR Act or any other Antitrust Law and use its best efforts to take, or cause
to be taken (including by their respective Subsidiaries), all other actions
consistent with this _Section 5.4_ necessary to cause the expiration or
termination of the applicable waiting periods under the HSR Act as soon as
practicable (and in any event no later than the Outside Date); and (ii) the
Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to (x) take all action
necessary to ensure that no state takeover statute or similar Law is or
becomes applicable to any of the transactions contemplated hereby and (y)
if any state takeover statute or similar Law becomes applicable to any of the
transactions contemplated hereby, take all action necessary to ensure that
such transaction may be consummated as promptly as practicable on the terms
contemplated by this Agreement and otherwise minimize the effect of such Law
on the transaction.

 



43 (c) Each of the parties hereto shall use (and shall cause their
respective Subsidiaries to use) its commercially reasonable efforts to (i)
cooperate in all respects with each other in connection with any filing with
or submission to a Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby and in connection with any investigation or other inquiry
by or before a Governmental Authority relating to the transactions
contemplated hereby, including any proceeding initiated by a private Person,
(ii) promptly inform the other party of (and supply to the other party) any
communication received by such party from, or given by such party to, the
Federal Trade Commission, the Antitrust Division of the Department of Justice,
or any other Governmental Authority and any material communication received
or given in connection with any proceeding by a private Person, in each case
regarding any of the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) permit the other
party to review in advance and incorporate the other partys reasonable
comments in any communication to be given by it to any Governmental Authority
with respect to obtaining any approvals or clearances required under any
Antitrust Law in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
and (iv) consult with the other party in advance of any meeting or
teleconference with any Governmental Authority or, in connection with any
proceeding by a private Person, with any other Person, and, to the extent not
prohibited by the Governmental Authority or other Person, give the other
party the opportunity to attend and participate in such meetings and
teleconferences. Subject to _Section 5.6(b)_, the parties shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to share information protected from
disclosure under the attorney-client privilege, work product doctrine, joint
defense privilege or any other privilege pursuant to this _Section 5.4_ in a
manner so as to preserve the applicable privilege. 

(d) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the parties
contained in this  _Section 5.4_, each of the parties hereto shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts to resolve such objections, if any, as may be
asserted by a Governmental Authority or other Person with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in this Agreement, in connection with any filing or submission
required or action to be taken by either Parent or the Company to effect the
Merger and to consummate the other transactions contemplated hereby, (i) the
Company shall not, without Parents prior written consent, commit to any
divestiture transaction, or commit to alter its business or commercial
practices in any way, and (ii) neither Parent nor any of its Affiliates shall
be required to (A) divest, license or hold separate or otherwise take or
commit to take any action that limits its freedom of action with respect to,
or its ability to retain, the Company (or any of the businesses,
product lines or assets of the Company) or Parent or of any of its Affiliates
(or any of the businesses, product lines or assets of Parent or any of its
Affiliates) or (B) alter or restrict in any way the business or commercial
practices of Parent, any of its Affiliates, or the Company.

(e) In furtherance and not in limitation of the covenants of the
parties contained in this _Section 5.4_, if any administrative or judicial
action or proceeding, including any proceeding by a private Person, is
instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any transaction
contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Antitrust Law, each of the
Company and Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to contest and
resist any such action or proceeding and to have vacated, lifted, reversed or
overturned any decree, judgment, injunction or other order, whether
temporary, preliminary or permanent, that is in effect and that prohibits,
prevents or restricts consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

 



44 Section 5.5. _Public Announcements_. The initial press release with respect to
the execution of this Agreement shall be a joint press release to be
reasonably agreed upon by Parent and the Company. Thereafter, neither the
Company nor Parent shall issue or cause the publication of any press release
or other public announcement (to the extent previously issued or made in
accordance with this Agreement) with respect to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior consent of the other party
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as may
be required by Law or by any applicable listing agreement with the NASDAQ or
other national securities exchange as determined in the good faith judgment of
the party proposing to make such release (in which case such party shall not
issue or cause the publication of such press release or other public
announcement without prior consultation with the other party; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Company shall not be required by this _Section 5.5_
to consult with or obtain the consent of any other party with respect to any
public announcement in connection with an Alternative Proposal that the
Company Board believes is _bona fide_ , or a Superior Proposal or an Adverse
Recommendation Change, and matters related to any of the foregoing, but
nothing in this proviso shall limit the obligation of the Company under
_Section 5.3(d)_ to negotiate with Parent in good faith; _provided_ _further_
, that each party and their respective controlled affiliates may make
statements that are not inconsistent with previous press releases, public
disclosures or public statements made by Parent or the Company in compliance
with this _Section 5.5_).

 

Section 5.6. _Access to Information; Confidentiality_.

 

(a) Upon reasonable notice and subject to applicable Laws relating to the
exchange of information and subject to the procedures set forth on _Section
5.6(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedules_, the Company shall, and shall
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) provide to Parent and its
Representatives, to the extent reasonably requested by Parent, copies of its
and its Subsidiaries, commitments, books, Contracts, records and
correspondence, including financial and operating data on a product line
and/or segment-level basis, materials filed with or furnished to any
Governmental Authority, monthly profit and loss statements, balance sheets,
capital expenditure details, bookings and backlog schedules, monthly
management reporting packages, budget to actual reports and full year 2013
reforecasts, as well as reasonable access to its officers, key employees,
subject matter experts and other personnel as agreed to by the Company and,
subject to the supervision by a Company employee, accountants, counsel,
financial advisors, sales agents, distributors and other Representatives and
(ii) afford access to the physical properties of the Company and its
Subsidiaries accompanied by a Company employee and upon reasonable request,
all of the foregoing to be used by Parent and its Representatives to
conduct integration planning and to determine whether the conditions set
forth in _Article VI_ have been satisfied (and the Company agrees to provide,
or cause to be provided, reasonable cooperation in connection therewith,
_provided_ , that all of the foregoing access or cooperation shall not be
unduly disruptive to the operation of the Companys business). The Company
shall furnish promptly to Parent (i) a copy of each report, schedule and other
document filed or submitted by it pursuant to the requirements of federal or
state securities Laws and a copy of any communication (including

 



45  "comment letters") received by the Company from the SEC concerning
compliance with securities Laws and (ii) all other information concerning its
and its Subsidiaries business, properties and personnel as Parent may
reasonably request.

(b) Except for disclosures permitted by the terms of the Confidentiality and
Standstill Agreement, dated as of October 2, 2012, between GE Energy, LLC and
the Company (as it may be amended from time to time, the " _Confidentiality
Agreement_ "), Parent and its Representatives shall hold information received
from the Company in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in confidence in accordance with the terms of the Confidentiality
Agreement. In the event of the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with its terms, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit the
restrictions applicable to Parent under the Confidentiality Agreement,
including with respect to any information obtained by Parent pursuant to 
_Section 5.6(a)_.

(c) This _Section 5.6_ shall not require the Company to permit any access,
or to disclose any information, that in the reasonable, good faith judgment
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel) of the
Company would reasonably be expected to result in (i) any violation of any
contract or Law to which the Company or its Subsidiaries is a party or is
subject or cause any privilege (including attorney-client privilege) that the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries would be entitled to assert to be
undermined with respect to such information and such undermining of such
privilege could in the Companys good faith judgment (after consultation with
counsel, which may be in-house counsel) adversely affect in any material
respect such Persons position in any pending or, what such Person believes
in good faith (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)
could be, future litigation or (ii) if the Company or any of its Subsidiaries,
on the one hand, and Parent or any of its Subsidiaries, on the other hand,
are adverse parties in a litigation, such information being reasonably
pertinent thereto; provided, that, in the case of clause (i), the parties
hereto shall cooperate in seeking to facilitate disclosure of such
information (including by entering into a joint-defense or similar agreement)
to the extent doing so (1) would not (in the good faith belief of the Company
(after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) reasonably
be likely to result in the violation of any such contract or Law or
reasonably be likely to cause such privilege to be undermined with respect to
such information or (2) could reasonably (in the good faith belief of the
Company (after consultation with counsel, which may be in-house counsel)) be
managed through the use of customary "clean-room" arrangements pursuant to
which appropriately designated Representatives of Parent shall be provided
access to such information; provided, further, that the Company shall (x)
notify Parent that such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or
its Subsidiaries obligations under any such contract or Law or are reasonably
likely to cause such privilege to be undermined, (y) communicate to Parent in
reasonable detail the facts giving rise to such notification and the subject
matter of such information (to the extent it is able to do so in accordance
with the first proviso in this _Section 5.6(c)_) and (z) in the case where
such disclosures are reasonably likely to violate its or its Subsidiaries
obligations under any contract, use reasonable commercial efforts to seek
consent from the applicable third party to any such contract with respect to
the disclosures prohibited thereby (to the extent not otherwise expressly
prohibited by the terms of such contract).

(d) No investigation, or information received, pursuant to this _Section 5.6_
will modify any of the representations and warranties of the parties hereto.

 



46 Section 5.7. _Notification of Certain Matters_. The Company shall give
prompt notice to Parent, and Parent shall give prompt notice to the Company,
of (i) any notice or other communication received by such party from any
Governmental Authority in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
or from any Person alleging that the consent of such Person is or may be
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, if the
subject matter of such communication or the failure of such party to obtain
such consent is reasonably likely to be material to the Company or Parent,
(ii) any actions, suits, claims, investigations or proceedings commenced or,
to such partys knowledge, threatened against, relating to or involving or
otherwise affecting such party or any of its Subsidiaries and that relate to
the transactions contemplated hereby, (iii) the discovery of any fact or
circumstance that, or the occurrence or non-occurrence of any event the
occurrence or non-occurrence of which, would result in the failure to be
satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_ and (iv) any
material failure of such party to comply with or satisfy any covenant or
agreement to be complied with or satisfied by it hereby which would result in
the failure to be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in
_Article VI_ ; _provided_ that, in the case of clauses (iii) and (iv), the
failure to comply with this _Section 5.7_ shall not result in the failure to
be satisfied of any of the conditions to the Closing in _Article VI_ , or
give rise to any right to terminate this Agreement under _Article VII_ , if
the underlying fact, circumstance, event or failure would not in and of itself
give rise to such failure or right.

Section 5.8. _Indemnification and Insurance_.

 

(a) For purposes of this _Section 5.8_, (i) " _Indemnified Person_ " shall
mean any person who is now, or has been or becomes at any time prior to the
Effective Time, an officer or director of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries and any person who, while serving as an officer or director of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, is or was serving at the request or
direction of or on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a
director, officer, partner, venturer, proprietor, trustee, country manager,
employee, agent or similar functionary of another corporation, partnership,
joint venture, sole proprietorship, trust, employee benefit plan or other
enterprise, together with such persons heirs, executors or administrators and
(ii) " _Proceeding_ " shall mean any actual or threatened claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation, whether civil, criminal, administrative,
investigative or otherwise and whether or not such claim, action, suit,
proceeding or investigation results in a formal civil or criminal litigation
or regulatory action, including, for the avoidance of doubt, in connection
with (x) the Merger and the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement
and (y) actions to enforce this provision or any other indemnification or
advancement right of any Indemnified Person.

(b) From and after the Effective Time, solely to the extent that the

incorporation, bylaws or comparable governing documents or any indemnification

bylaws or comparable governing documents and indemnification agreements of
such Person in effect on the date of this Agreement, to the fullest extent
permitted from time to time by applicable Law, which provisions shall not be
amended except as required by applicable Law or to make changes permitted by
applicable Law that would enlarge the scope of the Indemnified Persons rights
thereunder. Any right of indemnification of an Indemnified Person pursuant to
this _Section 5.8(b)_ shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise modified at
any time in a manner that would adversely affect the rights of such
Indemnified Person as provided herein. 

(c) Subject to the final sentence of this _Section 5.8(c)_, prior to the
Effective Time, the Company shall and, if the Company is unable to, the
Surviving Corporation as of the Effective Time shall (and Parent shall cause
it to) obtain and fully pay the premium for "tail" insurance policies for the

directors and officers insurance policies for the Indemnified Persons, (ii)
the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing fiduciary liability insurance
policies and (iii) existing foreign local directors and officers insurance
policies, in each case for a claims reporting or discovery period of at least
six years from and after the Effective Time from an insurance carrier with the
same or better credit rating as the Companys and its Subsidiaries insurance
carrier as of the date of this Agreement with respect to directors
and officers liability insurance and fiduciary liability insurance
(collectively, " _D andO Insurance_") with benefits, terms, conditions,
retentions and levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the
Indemnified Parties as the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policies
with respect to any matters that existed or occurred at or prior to the
Effective Time (including, for the purposes of clarity, in connection with
this Agreement or the transactions or actions contemplated hereby);
_provided_ , that the Company shall cooperate with Parent to attempt to obtain
favorable pricing consistent with _Schedule 5.8(c)_. If the Company and the
Surviving Corporation for any reason fail to obtain such "tail" insurance
policies as of the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall continue to maintain in effect for a period of at least six
(6) years from and after the Effective Time the DandO Insurance in place as of
the date of this Agreement with benefits, terms, conditions, retentions and
levels of coverage that are at least as favorable to the insureds as provided
in the Companys and its Subsidiaries existing policies as of the date of
this Agreement; _provided_ , that in no event shall the Surviving Corporation
and its Subsidiaries be required to expend for such policies pursuant to this
sentence an annual premium amount in excess of 300% of the annual
premiums currently paid by the Company and its Subsidiaries for such
insurance; _provided_ , _further_ , that if the annual premiums of such
insurance coverage exceed such amount, the Surviving Corporation and its
Subsidiaries shall obtain policies with the greatest coverage available for a
cost not exceeding such amount.

in addition to any other rights such Indemnified Person may have under the
Company Charter Documents, the Company Subsidiary Documents, the
organizational documents of the Surviving Corporation, the TBOC or under any
applicable Contracts. The provisions of this _Section 5.8_ shall survive the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby for a period of six (6)
years and are expressly intended to benefit each of the Indemnified Persons
and their respective heirs and representatives; _provided_ , _however_ , that
in the event that any claim or claims for indemnification set forth in this
_Section 5.8_ are asserted or made within such six (6)-year period, all
rights to indemnification in respect of any such claim or claims shall
continue until disposition of all such claims. If Parent and/or the Surviving
Corporation, or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates
with or merges into any other Person or (ii) transfers or conveys all or
substantially all of their businesses or assets to any other Person, then, in
each such case, to the extent necessary, a proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of Parent and/or the Surviving Corporation,
as the case may be, shall assume the obligations of Parent and the Surviving
Corporation set forth in this _Section 5.8_.

(e) In the event of any breach by the Surviving Corporation or Parent of this
_Section 5.8_, the Surviving Corporation and Parent shall, jointly and
severally, be obligated to pay all reasonable expenses, including reasonable
attorneys fees, that may be incurred by any Indemnified Person in enforcing
the indemnity and other obligations provided in this _Section 5.8_ as such
fees are incurred upon the written request of such Indemnified Person.

Section 5.9. _Securityholder Litigation_. The Company shall give Parent the
opportunity to participate in the defense or settlement of any securityholder
litigation against the Company and/or its directors relating to the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no such settlement shall be agreed to
without Parents prior consent, such consent not to be unreasonably withheld
or delayed.

Section 5.10. _Fees and Expenses_. All fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby including all legal,
accounting, financial advisory, consulting and all other fees and expenses of
third parties incurred by a party in connection with the negotiation and
effectuation of the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
transactions contemplated hereby, shall be the obligation of the respective
party incurring such fees and expenses.

Section 5.11. _Section 16 Matters_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Company
shall take all such steps as may be required (to the extent permitted under
applicable Law) to cause any dispositions of Company equity securities
(including derivative securities) resulting from the transactions contemplated
by this Agreement by each individual who is subject to the reporting
requirements of Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act to be exempt under Rule
16b-3 promulgated under the Exchange Act.

Section 5.12. _Environmental Matters_. Prior to the Closing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall commence and take commercially reasonable steps to (i)
address or (ii) undertake corrective action, including availing itself of
appropriate or recognized audit disclosures or immunity programs where
available and only when, in the opinion of the

 



49  Company, such disclosure is reasonably calculated to materially mitigate
penalty and enforcement exposures, to address any issues that Parent and the
Company agree could reasonably be expected to result in (i) material non-
compliance with any Environmental Laws or Environmental Permit or (ii) a
material limitation or suspension of Company or Subsidiary operations due to
non-compliance with Environmental Laws or any Environmental Permit, in each
case, in accordance with the procedures set forth on _Section 5.6(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Company and
its Subsidiaries shall upon reasonable notice make available during normal
business hours appropriate personnel and cooperate with Parent, in each case
to the extent that it does not unduly disrupt the conduct of the Companys or
its Subsidiaries business, to review the matters set forth in _Section 5.12
of the Company Disclosure Schedule_ and the status of compliance with respect
to each.

 

Section 5.13. _Employee Benefits_.

(a) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, from and after
the Effective Time, Parent shall and shall cause its Subsidiaries, including
the Surviving Corporation to, assume all liabilities, obligations and duties
under, and honor, all Company Benefit Plans listed in _Section 5.13(a) of the
Company Disclosure Schedule_ in accordance with their terms as in effect
immediately before the Effective Time, subject to any amendment or alteration
that may be permitted by such terms.

(b) Notwithstanding  _Section 5.13(a)_, for a period of one (1) year
following the Effective Time (the " _Continuation Period_ "), Parent shall
provide, or shall cause to be provided, (i) to each employee of the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries as of immediately prior to the Effective Time (the "
_Company Employees_ "), for so long as such Company Employee remains an
employee of Parent, the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective
Affiliates during the Continuation Period, base salary or regular hourly wage
which is the same as or no less favorable than that provided to such Company
Employee immediately before the Effective Time and (ii) to each Company
Employee, for so long as such Company Employee remains an employee of Parent,
the Surviving Corporation or any of their respective Affiliates during the
Continuation Period, eligibility to participate in the employee benefit plans
that either (i) are substantially comparable in the aggregate to the
applicable Company Benefit Plans (excluding equity or other incentive
compensation, and individual agreements) or (ii) are comparable to employee
benefit plans provided to similarly situated employees of Parent or any of
its Subsidiaries.

(c) For purposes of vesting, eligibility to participate and calculation of
vacation and severance benefits under the employee benefit plans of Parent
and its Subsidiaries providing benefits to any Company Employees after the
Effective Time as required pursuant to this _Section 5.13(c)_ (the " _New
Plans_ "), each Company Employee shall be credited with his or her years of
service with the Company and its Subsidiaries and their respective
predecessors before the Effective Time, to the same extent as such Company
Employee was entitled, before the Effective Time, to credit for such service
under any similar Company Benefit Plan in which such Company Employee
participated or was eligible to participate immediately prior to the Effective
Time. In addition, and without limiting the generality of the foregoing, (i)
each Company Employee shall be immediately eligible to participate, without
any waiting time, in any and all New Plans to the extent

 



50  coverage under such New Plan is comparable to and replaces a Company Benefit
Plan in which such Company Employee participated immediately before the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby (such plans,
collectively, the " _Old Plans_ "), and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan
providing medical, dental, pharmaceutical and/or vision benefits to any
Company Employee, Parent shall cause all pre-existing condition exclusions
and actively-at-work requirements of such New Plan to be waived for such
employee and his or her covered dependents, unless such conditions would not
have been waived under the comparable plans of the Company or its Subsidiaries
in which such employee participated immediately prior to the Effective Time,
and to the extent permitted by applicable law, Parent shall cause any eligible
expenses incurred by such employee and his or her covered dependents during
the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan ending on the date such
employees participation in the corresponding New Plan begins to be taken into
account under such New Plan, without duplication, for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable
to such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan
year as if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. For
the calendar year in which the Effective Time occurs, Parent and its
Subsidiaries shall allow each Company Employee to utilize his or her earned
and unused vacation as of the Effective Time during the remainder of such
calendar year subject to scheduling and subject to any requirements of
applicable Law. 

(d) With respect to all compensation and benefit matters affecting Company
Employees covered by any of the collective bargaining agreements listed in
_Section 3.12(a) of the Company Disclosure Schedule_, Parent shall not be
required to comply with the foregoing provisions (other than _Section
5.13(c)_) and shall in lieu thereof be subject to the compensation and
benefit provisions contained in each applicable collective bargaining
agreement.

 

(e) Nothing in this _Section 5.13_ shall constitute an amendment or other
modification to any Company Benefit Plan or other employee compensation or
benefit plan or agreement.

Section 5.14. _Compliance Violations_.  

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall promptly notify Parent in
accordance with _Section 8.9_ if the Company discovers any actual violation
of applicable Law or facts or circumstances that the Company reasonably
believes are likely to constitute a violation of applicable Law. In such event
and if Parent reasonably considers such violation to be significant (as
reasonably determined by the Chief Investigative and Anti-Corruption Counsel of
Parent), the Company agrees upon notice by Parent in accordance with _Section
8.9_, to undertake an investigation of the facts and circumstances giving
rise to such violation using advisors reasonably acceptable to Parent, to give
due regard to any recommendations by Parent with respect to such investigation
and any request by Parent to participate in such investigation, to keep
Parent regularly informed on the status and facts identified by such
investigation (at least on a weekly basis) and to disclose to Parent the
Companys and its advisors final conclusions following such investigation,
including copies of any written memoranda or other work product. The Company
shall discuss with Parent whether it is necessary, appropriate, or prudent in
the circumstances for the Company to report such violation to the relevant
Governmental Authorities and whether such report should be made jointly with
Parent. The Company will give due regard

 



51  to the views of Parent with respect to the advisability of such report. In
the event that such report is to be made, the Company will or Parent and the
Company will jointly, as applicable, prepare and deliver such report on a
timely basis to the relevant Governmental Authorities. Upon the Companys
request, Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts to assist with the
investigation or other matter and, following any report to the relevant
Governmental Authorities, to provide commercially reasonable assistance with
the Companys interactions with such Governmental Authorities in connection
with such matter, including (i) expending commercially reasonable financial
resources (e.g., retaining consultants), (ii) acting in a commercially
reasonable manner in providing waivers under _Section 5.2_ to allow the
Company to resolve such investigation (including payment of fines, claims
and settlement offers) with reasonable promptness and (iii) using Parents
relationships and its internal resources to cooperate with the Company in
attempting to resolve such matter.

 

(b) The parties hereto shall enter into a joint-defense or similar agreement
to preserve applicable attorney-client privilege in connection with the
actions required to be taken under _Section 5.14(a)_. This _Section 5.14_
shall not apply to violations of Environmental Laws or any Environmental
Permit (which violations are dealt with in the covenant set forth in _Section
5.12_).

Section 5.15. _Other Compliance Matters_.

 

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company agrees to cooperate with Parent to
determine whether the Company or any of its Subsidiaries must register as a
manufacturer or exporter of defense articles pursuant to International Traffic
in Arms Regulations, 22 C.F.R. parts 120-130, with respect to the manufacture
and sale of certain parts for use by the Canadian Coast Guard or any
other domestic or foreign military branch, division or organization. If such
registration is determined to be necessary, the Company shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to effect such registration as quickly as practicable. The
Company agrees to give due regard to the views of Parent in determining
whether any voluntary disclosure by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries is
advisable with respect to any such manufacture and sale.

 

(b) Prior to the Closing, neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries
shall enter into any Contract or make any commitment or engage in any other
transaction directly or to the Knowledge of the Company, indirectly through an
unaffiliated third party, involving North Korea or any countries or entities
from countries that have been designated by the US State Department as
State Sponsors of Terrorism.

Section 5.16. _Control of Operations_. Without in any way limiting any partys
rights or obligations under this Agreement, the parties understand and agree
that (i) nothing contained in this Agreement shall give Parent, directly or
indirectly, the right to control or direct the Companys operations prior to
the Effective Time, and (ii) prior to the Effective Time, the Company shall
exercise, consistent with the terms and conditions of this Agreement, complete
control and supervision over its operations.

2013 (the " _Outside Date_ "); _provided_ , that the right to terminate this
Agreement under this _Section 7.1(b)(i)_ shall not be available (x) to a

(g) In the event that Parent shall fail to pay the Company Expenses or the
Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses
required pursuant to this _Section 7.3_ when due, such fee and/or expenses,
as the case may be, shall accrue 

 



57  interest for the period commencing on the date such fee and/or expenses, as
the case may be, became past due, at a rate equal to the rate of interest
publicly announced by Citibank, in the City of New York from time to time
during such period, as such banks Prime Lending Rate plus 2% per annum. In
addition, if Parent shall fail to pay the Company Expenses when due or if the
Company shall fail to pay the Termination Fee and/or the Parent Expenses when
due, Parent shall also pay all of the Companys costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such expenses and the
Company shall also pay all of Parents costs and expenses (including
attorneys fees) in connection with efforts to collect such fee and/or
expenses, respectively. The Company, Parent and Merger Sub acknowledge that
the provisions of this _Section 7.3_ are an integral part of
the transactions contemplated hereby and that, without these agreements,
neither the Company nor Parent or Merger Sub would enter into this Agreement.
The parties agree that in the event that (i) the Company pays the Termination
Fee to Parent in the event of a termination by Parent pursuant to _Section
7.1(c)(i)_ or _Section 7.1(c)(ii)_ or by the Company pursuant to _Section
7.1(b)(iii)_ in a case where an Adverse Recommendation Change has occurred or
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_, the Company shall have no further
liability to Parent or Merger Sub of any kind in respect of this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby, and that in no event shall the Company
be required to pay the Termination Fee on more than one occasion; (ii) Parent
pays the Company Expenses to the Company in the event of a termination
pursuant to _Section 7.1(d)(i)_, Parent shall have no further liability to
the Company and (iii) the Company pays the Parent Expenses to Parent in the
event of a termination pursuant to _Section 7.1(b)(iii)_, the Company shall
have no further liability to Parent or Merger Sub except solely in those
circumstances set forth in  _Section 7.3_ when the Termination Fee is
payable and then any such further liability shall be limited to an amount
equal to the Termination Fee less the Parent Expenses previously paid.

 

(h) For the avoidance of doubt, in no event shall the Company ever be
obligated to pay, or cause to be paid, more than one Termination Fee. As used
herein, " _Termination Fee_ " shall mean a cash amount equal to $95,000,000,
except that in the event this Agreement is terminated by the Company pursuant
to _Section 7.1(d)(ii)_ and the Company substantially contemporaneously
enters into a definitive agreement relating to a Superior Proposal on or prior
to the date that is thirty (30) days following the date of this Agreement,
then the Termination Fee shall mean a cash amount equal to $47,000,000.

and agreements in this Agreement shall terminate at the Effective Time or,
except as otherwise provided in _Section 7.2_, upon the termination of
this Agreement pursuant to _Section 7.1_, as the case may be, except that
the agreements set forth in _Article II_ and _Sections 5.8_ , _5.10_ and
_5.13_ and any other agreement in this Agreement that contemplates

their respective Boards of Directors; _provided_ __, _however_ , that
following approval of the Merger and the other transactions contemplated
hereunder by the shareholders of the Company, there shall be no amendment or
change to the provisions of this Agreement which by Law would require further
approval by the shareholders of the Company without such approval.

delay by the Company, Parent or Merger Sub in exercising any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof nor shall any single or partial exercise
thereof preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right hereunder. Any agreement on the part of a party hereto to any
such extension or waiver shall be valid only if set forth in an instrument in
writing signed on behalf of such party.

Section 8.4. _Assignment_. Neither this Agreement nor any of the rights,
interests or obligations hereunder shall be assigned, in whole or in part, by
operation of Law or otherwise, by any of the parties without the prior
written consent of the other parties, except that Merger Sub may, following
written notice thereof to the Company, assign, in its sole discretion, any of
or all its rights, interests and obligations under this Agreement to any
wholly owned Subsidiary of Parent, but no such assignment shall relieve Merger
Sub of any of its obligations hereunder. Subject to the preceding sentence,
this Agreement shall be binding upon, inure to the benefit of, and be
enforceable by, the parties hereto and their respective successors and
permitted assigns. Any purported assignment not permitted under this Section
shall be null and void.

together shall constitute one and the same agreement) and shall become
effective when one or more counterparts have been signed by each of the
parties and delivered to the other parties, any of which may be delivered by
facsimile or other electronic transmission. Facsimile or other electronic
transmission of signatures shall constitute original signatures for all
purposes of this Agreement and any enforcement hereof.

Section 8.6. _Entire Agreement; No Third-Party Beneficiaries_. This Agreement,
the Company Disclosure Schedule, the Parent Disclosure Schedule and the
Confidentiality Agreement (a) constitute the entire agreement, and supersede
all other prior agreements and

 



59  understandings, both written and oral, among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of this Agreement and thereof and (b) shall not confer upon any

(a) The provisions of this Agreement and any other document or instrument
delivered pursuant hereto, their negotiation, execution, performance or

based upon, arising out of or related to any of the foregoing (whether in
equity, law or statute) shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the internal laws, both procedural and substantive, of the State of New York
applicable to agreements made and to be performed entirely within such State,
without regard to the conflicts of law principles of such State; _provided_
, however, that the laws of State of Texas shall govern to the extent that
the provisions of the TBOC are specifically referenced herein or that it is
mandatory that the TBOC apply to any of the provisions of this Agreement or
any of the transactions contemplated hereby and to (i) the rights (including
dissenters rights) of shareholders in connection with, the Merger and (ii)
the duties and obligations of the directors and officers of the Company and
its Subsidiaries.

 

(b) Each of the parties hereto irrevocably agrees that any legal action or
proceeding with respect to this Agreement and the rights and obligations
arising hereunder, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
respect of this Agreement and the rights and obligations arising hereunder
brought by the other party hereto or its successors or assigns, shall
be brought and determined exclusively in the state or federal courts sitting
in the Borough of Manhattan in New York, New York. Each of the parties hereto
hereby irrevocably submits with regard to any such action or proceeding for
itself and in respect of its property, generally and unconditionally, to the
personal jurisdiction of the aforesaid courts and agrees that it will not
bring any action relating to this Agreement or any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement in any court other than the aforesaid courts.
Each of the parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, and agrees not to assert
as a defense, counterclaim or otherwise, in any action or proceeding with
respect to this Agreement, (i) any claim that it is not personally subject to
the jurisdiction of the above named courts for any reason other than the
failure to serve in accordance with this _Section 8.7_, (ii) any claim that
it or its property is exempt or immune from the jurisdiction of any such
court or from any legal process commenced in such courts (whether through
service of notice, attachment prior to judgment, attachment in aid of
execution of judgment, execution of judgment or otherwise) and (iii) to the
fullest extent permitted by the applicable Law, any claim that (x) the suit,
action or proceeding in such court is brought in an inconvenient forum, (y)
the venue of such suit, action or proceeding is improper or (z) this
Agreement, or the subject matter hereof, may not be enforced in or by such
courts.

(c) EACH PARTY HEREBY IRREVOCABLY WAIVES ALL RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY
ACTION, PROCEEDING OR COUNTERCLAIM (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR

CONTEMPLATED HEREBY OR THE ACTIONS OF ANY PARTY IN THE
NEGOTIATION, ADMINISTRATION, PERFORMANCE AND ENFORCEMENT OF THIS AGREEMENT
AND THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THIS AGREEMENT.

 



60 Section 8.8. _Specific Enforcement_. The parties agree that irreparable
damage would occur and that the parties would not have any adequate remedy at
law in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached,
and it is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled to an
injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement, in each case, in
accordance with this _Section 8.8_ in any state or federal court sitting in
the Borough of Manhattan in New York, New York, this being in addition to any
other remedy to which they are entitled at law or in equity. Each of the
parties agrees that it will not oppose the granting of an injunction,
specific performance and other equitable relief as provided herein on the
basis that (x) either party has an adequate remedy at law or (y) an award of
specific performance is not an appropriate remedy for any reason at law
or equity. Each party further agrees that no party shall be required to
obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or
as a condition to obtaining any remedy referred to in this _Section 8.8_, and
each party irrevocably waives any right it may have to require the obtaining,
furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument.

Section 8.9. _Notices_. All notices, requests and other communications to any
party hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given if delivered

Section 8.12.  _Interpretation_.

(a) When a reference is made in this Agreement to an Article, a Section,
Exhibit or Schedule, such reference shall be to an Article of, a Section of,
or an Exhibit or Schedule to, this Agreement unless otherwise indicated. The
table of contents and headings contained in this Agreement are for reference
purposes only and shall not affect in any way the meaning or interpretation
of this Agreement. Whenever the words "include", "includes" or "including" are
used in this Agreement, they shall be deemed to be followed by the words
"without limitation". The words "hereof", "herein" and "hereunder" and words
of similar import when used in this Agreement shall refer to this Agreement as
a whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement. All terms
defined in this Agreement shall have the defined meanings when used in any
certificate or other document made or delivered pursuant hereto unless
otherwise defined therein. The definitions contained in this Agreement are
applicable to the singular as well as the plural forms of such terms and to
the masculine as well as to the feminine and neuter genders of such term. Any
agreement, instrument or statute defined or referred to herein means such
agreement, instrument or statute as from time to time amended, modified or
supplemented, including (in the case of agreements or instruments) by waiver
or consent and (in the case of statutes) by succession of comparable successor
statutes and references to all attachments thereto and instruments
incorporated therein. References to a Person are also to its permitted
successors and assigns.

(b) The parties hereto have participated jointly in the negotiation and
drafting of this Agreement with the assistance of counsel and other advisors
and, in the event an ambiguity or question of intent or interpretation arises,
this Agreement shall be construed as jointly drafted by the parties hereto
and no presumption or burden of proof shall arise favoring or disfavoring any
party by virtue of the authorship of any provision of this Agreement or
interim drafts of this Agreement.

 

Section 8.13. _Non-Recourse_. No past, present or future director, officer,
employee, incorporator, member, partner, stockholder, agent, attorney,
representative or affiliate of any party hereto or of any of their respective
Affiliates (unless such Affiliate is expressly a party to this Agreement)
shall have any liability (whether in contract or in tort) for any obligations
or liabilities of such party arising under, in connection with or related to
this Agreement or for any claim based on, in respect of, or by reason of, the
transactions contemplated hereby; _provided_ , _however_ , that nothing
in this _Section 8.13_ shall limit any liability of the parties to this
Agreement for breaches of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
