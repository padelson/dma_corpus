Each Seller, severally but not jointly, and as to itself only, hereby
represents and warrants to Purchaser that the following are true and correct
as of the date of this Agreement:

Section 3.1. _Organization and Qualification_. Such Seller is duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
incorporation or organization. Such Seller is duly qualified or licensed to do
business and is in good standing (where such concept is applicable) in each
jurisdiction in which the character of the properties or assets owned or
operated by it, or the nature of its business, makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing could not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on such Sellers ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transaction.

 

Section 3.2. _Authority; No Conflict __._

 

(a) Such Seller has all requisite corporate, limited liability company,
partnership or analogous power, capacity and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement, to perform its obligations under this Agreement and to
consummate the Transaction. The execution and delivery of this Agreement by
such Seller, and the consummation by such Seller of the Transaction, have
been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate, limited liability
company, partnership or analogous action, and no other action or proceeding on
the part of such Seller is necessary to authorize the execution and delivery
of this Agreement or to consummate the Transaction. This Agreement has been
duly and validly executed and delivered by such Seller and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by the other parties
hereto, constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of such Seller,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except that such
enforcement may be subject to (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws, now or hereafter in effect,
relating to rights of creditors generally and (ii) rules of law and equity
governing specific performance, injunctive relief and other equitable remedies
(collectively, the "Bankruptcy and Equity Exception").

(b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement does not, and
the consummation of the Transaction will not, directly or indirectly (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both), (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in a violation of any provision of the Organizational 

 



7  Documents of such Seller; (ii) contravene, conflict with, or result in a
violation of any Law to which such Seller, or any of the Securities, are
subject; or (iii) contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or
breach of any provision of, or the forfeiture, impairment or acceleration of
rights or obligations under, or give any Person the right to declare a default
or exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance
of, or to cancel, terminate, or modify, any contract by which such Sellers
Securities are bound; except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such
matters as would not materially adversely impact the ability of such Seller
to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Transaction.

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by such Seller does not, and
the consummation of the Transaction will not, require any Consent of,
registration or filing with, or declaration or notification to, any Person,
except for (i) applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act, the
Securities Act and state securities or "blue sky" laws ("Blue Sky Laws"), and
(ii) such other Consents, registrations, filings, declarations or
notifications the failure of which to be obtained or made would not prevent
such Seller from performing its obligations under this Agreement in any
material respect.

 

Section 3.3. _Ownership_ __. Such Seller owns, beneficially and/or of record,
the Securities set forth opposite such Seller s name on _Schedule A_, has
good and marketable title to such Securities, free and clear of any and all
Liens (other than Liens imposed by applicable securities Laws), and has the
full power to dispose of such Securities. Other than the Notes (as defined in
the Exchange Agreement) and the Additional Shares, the Securities set forth
opposite such Sellers name on _Schedule A_ constitute all of the securities
(as defined in Section 3(10) of the Exchange Act) of the Company owned,
beneficially and/or of record, by such Seller. Immediately following the
Closing, Purchaser will own, beneficially and/or of record, the Securities
sold to Purchaser by such Seller under this Agreement, and will have good
and marketable title to such Securities, free and clear of any and all Liens
(other than Liens imposed by applicable securities laws). Except pursuant to
this Agreement or as contemplated by the Investment Agreements, such Seller
has not, directly or indirectly, granted any option, warrant or other right
to any Person to acquire any of such Sellers Securities.

 

Section 3.4. _Proceedings_. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of Such Seller, threatened against such Seller, and there is no
judgment, decree or order against such Seller, in each case that would be
reasonably likely to adversely affect such Sellers ability to perform its
obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transaction.

 

Section 3.5. _No Brokers_. No broker, investment banker, financial advisor or
other Person is entitled to any brokers, finders, financial advisors or
other similar fee or commission in connection with this Agreement or the
Transaction based upon arrangements made by or on behalf of Seller. The
Sellers make no representation with respect to any arrangement with any
broker, investment banker or financial advisor by which the Company is bound.

Section 3.6.  _Access to Information_ __. Such Seller has had an opportunity
to review this Agreement with assistance of counsel and other advisors of such
Seller s own choosing.

business and is in good standing (where such concept is applicable) in
each jurisdiction in which the character of the properties or assets owned or
operated by it, or the nature of its business, makes such licensing or
qualification necessary, except where the failure to be so qualified, licensed
or in good standing could not reasonably be expected to, individually or in
the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on each of Parent and
Purchaser s ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement or to
consummate the Transaction.

 

Section 4.2. _Authority; No Conflict _.__

 

(a) Each of Parent and Purchaser has all requisite corporate power, capacity
and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement, to perform its
obligations under this Agreement and to consummate the Transaction. The
execution and delivery of this Agreement by each of Parent and Purchaser, and
the consummation by each of Parent and Purchaser of the Transaction,
have been duly and validly authorized by all necessary corporate action, and
no other action or proceeding on the part of each of Parent and Purchaser is
necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this Agreement or to
consummate the Transaction. This Agreement has been duly and validly executed
and delivered by each of Parent and Purchaser and, assuming the due
authorization, execution and delivery of this Agreement by Sellers,
constitutes a legal, valid and binding obligation of each of Parent and
Purchaser, enforceable against it in accordance with its terms, except that
such enforcement may be subject to the Bankruptcy and Equity Exception.

 

(b) The execution and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the
consummation of the Transaction will not, directly or indirectly (with or
without notice or lapse of time or both); (i) contravene, conflict with, or
result in a violation of any provision of the Organizational Documents of each
of Parent and Purchaser; (ii) contravene, conflict with, or result in a
violation of any Law to which Parent or Purchaser is subject; or (iii)
contravene, conflict with, or result in a violation or breach of any provision
of, or the forfeiture, impairment or acceleration of any rights or
obligations under, or give any Person the right to declare a default or
exercise any remedy under, or to accelerate the maturity or performance of, or
to cancel, terminate, or modify, any Contract to which Parent or Purchaser is
a party; except in the cases of clauses (ii) and (iii), for such matters as
would not materially adversely impact the ability of Parent or Purchaser to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the Transaction.

 

(c) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by Parent and Purchaser does
not, and the consummation of the Transaction will not, require any Consent
of, registration or filing with, or declaration or notification to, any
Person, except (i) for applicable requirements, if any, of the Exchange Act,
the Securities Act and Blue Sky Laws, and (ii) such other Consents,
registrations, filings, declarations or notifications the failure of which to
be obtained or made would not prevent Purchaser from performing its
obligations under this Agreement in any material respect.

 

Section 4.3. _Proceedings_ __. There is no Proceeding pending or, to the
knowledge of Parent or Purchaser, threatened against Parent or Purchaser, and
there is no judgment, decree or order against Parent or Purchaser, that would
be reasonably likely to adversely affect Parent or Purchaser s ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement or to consummate the
Transaction.

 



9 Section 4.4. _Sufficiency of Funds_. As of the date hereof, Parent has
sufficient cash or other sources of immediately available funds to consummate
the Transaction on the terms contemplated by this Agreement and to pay all
amounts payable by Parent and Purchaser at Closing under this Agreement.

 

ARTICLE V __

_ADDITIONAL AGREEMENTS_

Section 5.1.  _Confidentiality_. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, each Seller will keep confidential, and not use or disclose, except
in connection with this Agreement and the Transaction, all information,
documents or materials relating solely to the Company and its business which,
prior to the date hereof, have been furnished to it by or on behalf of the
Company, any of its Subsidiaries, any other Seller, any other stockholder of
the Company, or Purchaser. The provisions of this  _Section 5.1_ shall not
apply to the disclosure or use of any information, documents or materials (a)
which are or become generally available to the public other than as a result
of disclosure by any Seller after receiving such information or any Affiliate
or Representative of such Seller receiving such information in violation of
this _Section 5.1_, (b) to the extent such information, documents or
materials can reasonably be shown to have been acquired by such Seller or its
Representative on a non-confidential basis from sources other than those
related to prior ownership of or involvement with the Company that, to the
best of such Sellers knowledge, are not prohibited from disclosing
such information, documents or materials, (c) required by applicable Law to
be disclosed by such Seller (but only, to the extent practical and permitted
by applicable Law, after providing Purchaser with written notice of its
intention to disclose such information and after Purchaser has had notice of
the proposed disclosure in order to provide it with an opportunity to
challenge such disclosure in a court of law), (d) in connection with any
litigation or disputes involving a Seller or any Affiliate of Seller, on the
one hand, and the Company, Parent or Purchaser on the other, or (e) necessary
to establish such Sellers rights under this Agreement. Further, the "residual
knowledge" resulting from access to or work with such confidential
information shall not be subject to the confidentiality and non-use
obligations contained in this Agreement. For the purposes hereof, the term "
_residual knowledge_ " means know-how and experience gained by a Seller and
its representatives (other than third-party representatives) during its
ownership of securities of the Company or from exposure to the confidential
information, and retained in the unaided memories of such Sellers
representatives (other than third-party representatives) without reference to
any information or material that is written, stored in magnetic, electronic or
physical form or otherwise fixed. For purposes hereof, the memory of a person
is unaided if the person has not intentionally memorized the confidential
information for the purpose of retaining and subsequently using or disclosing
such confidential information. The provisions of this _Section 5.1_ shall
terminate on the third (3rd) anniversary of the date of this Agreement.

 

Section 5.2. _Public Disclosure_.

(a) Following the Closing, Purchaser may issue a press release announcing the
Transaction, with the timing of such press release to be determined by
Purchaser in its sole and absolute discretion;  _provided_ , _however_ , that
Purchaser shall give each Seller a reasonable prior opportunity to review and
comment on such press release and shall consider Sellers comments in good
faith.

 

(b) Except with respect to any reporting obligations under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (including the obligation under Item 1.01 of
the Current Report on Form 8-K to disclose the identities of the parties to a
material definitive agreement), Purchaser will not, and Purchaser will not
permit any of its Affiliates to, use or refer to any Seller, its name or any
derivation thereof, as being a party to this Agreement or as being involved in
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (other than to the extent
expressly contained in the Companys filings with the SEC on or before
the date hereof) including, without limitation, in any filing with any
Governmental Body, any press release, any public announcement or statement,
advertisement or in any interview or other discussion with any 

 



10  reporter or other member of the media, without the prior written consent of
such Seller with respect to each such use or reference; _provided_ , _however_
, that any such information may be disclosed by Purchaser or any of its
Affiliates to the extent that such person has received advice from its counsel
that it is required by applicable Law to do so, _provided_ _that_ prior to
making such disclosure, such person shall, to the extent practicable and
permitted by applicable Law, notify such Seller in writing and shall use
reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of such information,
including consulting with such Seller regarding such disclosure and,
if reasonably requested by such Seller and at such Sellers sole cost and
expense, assisting such Seller in seeking a protective order to prevent the
requested disclosure.

Section 5.3. _Further Assurances __._ Each Seller, as to itself, on the one
hand, and Parent and Purchaser, on the other hand, agree that subsequent to
the Closing Date, at the request of the other party or parties, they will
execute and deliver, or cause to be executed and delivered, to the other party
or parties such further instruments and take such other action as may be
necessary or desirable to carry out the Transaction or to vest, perfect or
confirm ownership of the Securities in Purchaser.

Section 5.4. _General Release __._ Effective as of the Closing:

applicable Law, on behalf of its respective Affiliates, heirs, legal

Parties, or any of them, and which are based on acts, events or omissions
occurring up to and including the Closing Date, including, without limitation,
any acts, events or omissions arising out of or based on such Seller Releasing
Partys relationship with the Company or any of its present or former
Affiliates or predecessors, such Seller Releasing Partys rights or status as

Agreement, the CVR Agreement or the other documents and agreements executed

the board of the Company appointed by such Seller Releasing Party, may have

indemnity agreements as in effect at the date hereof and any DandO insurance and
indemnification policies as in effect at the date hereof, (iv) any rights
that the Deerfield Entities may have under the Exchange Agreement or the
Exchange Registration Rights Agreement or (v) any rights that any Deerfield
Entity may have in connection with its ownership of the Additional
Shares. Each Seller, on its behalf and, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable Law, on

 



11  behalf of its Seller Releasing Parties, acknowledges that it may hereafter
discover facts in addition to or different from those which it now knows or
believes to be true with respect to the subject matter of the claims released
hereby, but each Seller, on its behalf and on behalf of the Seller Releasing
Parties, intends to and, by operation of this Agreement shall have, fully,
finally and forever settled and released any and all Seller Released Claims
without regard to the subsequent discovery of existence of such different or
additional facts. Further, each Seller, on its behalf and, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable Law, on behalf of the Seller Releasing
Parties, being aware of and advised concerning the legal effect of the
provisions of the below cited provision in California Civil Code Section 1542,
hereby expressly, knowingly, and intentionally waive any and all rights which
it or they have or may have under the provisions of said Section 1542 or any
similar Law, with respect to the Seller Released Claims:

SETTLEMENT WITH THE DEBTOR."

whatsoever, past, present or future, at law, in equity or otherwise, whether

participated in the negotiation and drafting of this Agreement. In the event
