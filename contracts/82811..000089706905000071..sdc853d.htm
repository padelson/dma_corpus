If, in connection with the preparation of the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement, the Acquiror intends to undertake any physical inventory audits or other inventory test procedures, the Acquiror will give reasonable advance notice of such audits and/or other procedures to GE and will provide GE with the opportunity to be present at and observe all such audits and/or other procedures.

If the Acquiror does not deliver the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement to GE within 75 Business Days after the Closing Date, then, at the election of GE, either (x) GE may prepare and present the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement within an additional 45 Business Days or (y) the Statement of Estimated Closing Modified Net Current Assets shall become final and binding on the parties. If GE elects to prepare the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then all subsequent references in this Section 2.09 (other than those in Section 2.09(c)), and all references in Section 2.10, to GE and the Acquiror, respectively, shall be read as references to the Acquiror and GE, respectively. In connection with the Acquirors preparation of the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement, GE shall make reasonably available all of the books, records and other relevant information in its possession relating to the operations and finances of the Business with respect to the period up to and including the Closing Date, as well as the individuals in its employ, if any, responsible for and knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of, the Statement of Estimated Closing Modified Net Current Assets in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of the Acquiror. 

     

 (b) During the 45 Business Days immediately following GEs receipt of the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement and the Accountants Report (the "Review Period"), GE and its Representatives will be permitted to  review the Acquirors working papers and the working papers of the  Acquirors independent accountants relating to the Initial Modified Net  Current Assets Statement and the Accountants Report, as well as all of the books, records and other relevant information relating to the operations and finances of the Business with respect to the period up to and including the  Closing Date that have been transferred to the Acquiror, and the Acquiror shall  make reasonably available the individuals in its employ responsible for and  knowledgeable about the information used in, and the preparation of, the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement and the Accountants Report in order to respond to the reasonable inquiries of GE; provided that the accountants of the Acquiror shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to GE unless and until GE has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such accountants. 

   

        

 (c) The Acquiror agrees that, following the Closing through the date that the Final  Modified Net Current Assets Statement becomes final and binding, it will not  take any actions with respect to any accounting books, records, policies or  procedures on which the Reference Statement of Net Current Assets or the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement is based or on which the Final Modified Net Current Assets Statement is to be based that are inconsistent with the past practice of the Business (or the Sellers with respect to the Business) that would impede or delay the determination of the amount of Modified Net Current Assets as of the Closing Date or the preparation of the Notice of Disagreement or the Final Modified Net Current Assets Statement in the manner and utilizing the methods required by this Agreement. 

     

 Section 2.10. Reconciliation of Post-Closing Statements. (a) GE shall notify the Acquiror in writing (the "Notice of Disagreement") prior to the expiration of the Review Period if GE disagrees with the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement. The Notice of Disagreement shall set forth in reasonable detail the basis for such dispute, the amounts involved and GEs determination of the amount of Net Current Assets and Modified Net Current Assets as of the Closing Date. If no Notice of Disagreement is received by the Acquiror prior to the expiration of the Review Period, then the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement shall be deemed to have been accepted by GE and shall become final and binding upon the parties in accordance with Section 2.10(c). 

     

 (a) During the 30 Business Days immediately following the delivery of a Notice of  Disagreement (the "Consultation Period"), the Acquiror and GE shall  seek in good faith to resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement. 

     

 (b) If at the end of the Consultation Period the Acquiror and GE have been unable to  resolve any differences that they may have with respect to the matters specified in the Notice of Disagreement, the Acquiror and GE shall submit all matters that remain in dispute with respect to the Notice of Disagreement (along with a copy of the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement marked to indicate those line items that are not in dispute) to (i) an independent certified public accounting firm in the United States of national recognition mutually acceptable to the Acquiror and GE (the "Independent Accounting Firm") or (ii) if the Acquiror and GE are unable to agree upon such a firm within ten Business Days after the end of the Consultation Period, then within an additional ten Business Days, the Acquiror and GE shall each select one such firm and those two firms shall select a third such firm, in which event "Independent  Accounting Firm" shall mean such third firm. Within 30 Business Days after  such firms selection, or as soon as practicable thereafter, the  Independent Accounting Firm shall make a final determination, binding on the  parties to this Agreement, of the appropriate amount of each of the line items  in the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement as to which the Acquiror  and GE disagree as set out in the Notice of Disagreement. With respect to each  disputed line item, such determination, if not in accordance with the position  of either the Acquiror or GE, shall not be in excess of the higher, nor less  than the lower, of the amounts advocated by GE in the Notice of Disagreement or  the Acquiror in the Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement with respect  to such disputed line item. During such determination period, the Independent  Accounting Firm also shall (i) prepare a statement of Modified Net Current  Assets as of the Closing Date based upon all of the line items not disputed by  the parties and the line items determined by the Independent Accounting Firm and (ii) determine the amount of Modified Net Current Assets reflected on such  statement. The statement of Modified Net Current Assets that is final and  binding on the parties, as determined either through agreement of the parties  pursuant to Sections 2.09(a), 2.10(a) or 2.10(b) or through the action of the  Independent Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 2.10(c), is referred to as  the "Final Modified Net Current Assets Statement." 

   

       

 (c) The cost of the Independent Accounting Firms review and determination shall be shared equally by the Acquiror and GE. During the review by the Independent Accounting Firm, the Acquiror and GE will each make available to the  Independent Accounting Firm interviews with such individuals, and such  information, books and records and work papers, as may be reasonably required by the Independent Accounting Firm to fulfill its obligations under Section  2.10(c); provided, however, that the accountants of the Acquiror or GE shall not be obliged to make any work papers available to the Independent Accounting Firm unless and until such firm has signed a customary agreement relating to such access to work papers in form and substance reasonably acceptable to such  accountants. In acting under this Agreement, the Independent Accounting Firm  will be entitled to the privileges and immunities of an arbitrator. 

     

 Section 2.11. Post-Closing Adjustment. The "Post-Closing Adjustment" shall be equal to the amount of the Modified Net Current Assets set forth in the Final Modified Net Current Assets Statement less the amount of the Modified Net Current Assets set forth in the Statement of Estimated Closing Modified Net Current Assets. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a positive amount, then GE shall retain additional Trade Accounts Receivables (as Excluded Assets) in the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. If the Post-Closing Adjustment is a negative amount, then GE shall pay in cash to the Acquiror the absolute value of the amount of the Post-Closing Adjustment. Any such payment shall be made within three Business Days after the Final Modified Net Current Assets Statement becomes such, together with interest thereon at the Interest Rate calculated and payable in cash in accordance with Section 2.12 from the Closing Date until the date of payment. Acquiror shall promptly provide, deliver and transfer to GE any Excluded Assets arising from such Post-Closing Adjustment. 

     

 Section 2.12. Payments and Computations. Except for the payment of the Purchase Price (which shall be paid at the Closing), each party shall make each payment due to the other party to this Agreement not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the day when due. All payments shall be paid by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account or accounts designated by the party receiving such payment not less than three Business Days prior to the day when such payments are due. All computations of interest shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days, in each case for the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day) occurring in the period for which such interest is payable. Whenever any payment under this Agreement shall be due on a day other than a Business Day, such payment shall be made on the next succeeding Business Day, and such extension of time shall be included in the computation of payment of interest.

Subject to the terms and conditions of this Article X and Section 11.01, the Acquiror shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless GE and its Affiliates and Representatives (collectively, the "GE Indemnified Parties") against, and reimburse any GE Indemnified Party for, all Losses that such GE Indemnified Party may at any time suffer or incur, or become subject to, as a result of or in connection with:

 (a) Upon receipt of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.03(a) that is a Third Party Claim (i) for which it is reasonably likely that the amount of the net liability of the Indemnified Party (after giving effect to all indemnification and insurance recoveries, including  indemnification hereunder, reasonably likely to be received by the Indemnified  Party on account of such claim) will not exceed the amount of the potential  indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying Partyand (ii) for which  written acknowledgement by the Indemnifying Party that it is obligated to  indemnify the Indemnified Party with respect to such claim has been made, the  Indemnifying Party may elect to assume the defense and control of any such Third Party Claim but shall allow the Indemnified Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. In the event the Indemnifying Party elects to assume the defense and control of any such Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall select counsel, contractors and consultants of recognized standing and competence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party and shall take all steps reasonably necessary in the defense or settlement of any such Third Party Claim. If the Indemnifying Party, within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of a Third Party Claim (or sooner, if the nature of the Third Party Claim so requires), does not elect to assume the defense and control of a Third Party Claim, the Indemnified Party will have the right to undertake the defense and control of such Third Party Claim, provided however that the Indemnified Party may not compromise or settle any claims without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Following delivery of a notice of a claim for indemnity from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.03(a) that is a Third Party Claim for which it is reasonably likely that the amount of the net liability of the Indemnified Party (after giving effect to all indemnification and insurance recoveries, including indemnification hereunder, reasonably likely to be received by the Indemnified Party on account of such claim) will exceed the amount of the potential indemnification obligation of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnified Party shall have the right to assume the defense and control of any such Third Party Claim but shall allow the Indemnifying Party a reasonable opportunity to participate in the defense of such Third Party Claim with its own counsel and at its own expense. GE or the Acquiror, as the case may be, shall, and shall cause each of its Affiliates and Representatives to, cooperate fully with the Indemnifying Party in the defense of any Third Party Claim. The Indemnifying Party shall be authorized to consent to a settlement of, or the entry of any judgment arising from, any Third Party Claim, without the consent of any Indemnified Party, provided that the Indemnifying Party agrees to (i) pay or cause to be paid all amounts arising out of such settlement or judgment concurrently with the effectiveness of such settlement, (ii) not encumber any of the assets of any Indemnified Party or agree to any restriction or condition that would apply to or adversely affect any Indemnified Party or the conduct of any Indemnified Partys business and (iii) obtain, as a condition of any settlement or other resolution, a complete release of any Indemnified Party potentially affected by such Third Party Claim. 

     

 (b) In the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for indemnity  from an Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 10.03(a) that does not involve a  Third Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party shall notify the Indemnified Party  within 30 days following its receipt of such notice if the Indemnifying Party  disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article X. If the  Indemnifying Party does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the claim specified by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed to be a liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Article X, and the Indemnifying Party shall pay, subject to the limitations set forth in Section 10.01(b), if applicable, the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party on demand or, in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or any portion of the claim) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of such claim (or such portion of such claim) becomes finally determined. If the Indemnifying Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim as provided above, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall resolve such dispute in accordance with Section 11.11. 

   
       

 Section 10.04. Exclusive Remedies. Except (i) with respect to the matters covered by Sections 2.09 through 2.11 (the terms and conditions of which shall govern any claims, disputes and remedies thereunder) and (ii) for fraud, remedies that cannot be waived as a matter of law and injunctive relief (including the injunctive and other equitable relief provided for in Section 5.17), GE and the Acquiror acknowledge and agree that, following the Closing, the indemnification provisions of Sections 10.01 and 10.02 shall be the sole and exclusive remedies of GE and the Acquiror, respectively, for any breach of this Agreement. 

     

 Section 10.05. Additional Indemnification Provisions. GE and the Acquiror agree, for themselves and on behalf of their respective Affiliates and Representatives, that with respect to each indemnification obligation in this Agreement or any other document executed in connection with the Closing (a) each such obligation shall be calculated on an After-Tax Basis and (b) except with respect to GEs obligation to indemnify the Acquiror for Environmental Claims and in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000 in the aggregate, in no event shall the Indemnifying Party have liability to the Indemnified Party for any consequential, special, incidental, indirect or punitive damages or lost profits ("Consequential Damages"). In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers from a third Person any amount in respect of a matter for which an Indemnifying Party has indemnified it pursuant to this Article X, such Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the Indemnifying Party the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount of expenses incurred by it in procuring such recovery), but not in excess of the sum of (i) any amount previously paid by the Indemnifying Party to or on behalf of the Indemnified Party in respect of such claim and (ii) any amount expended by the Indemnifying Party in pursuing or defending any claim arising out of such matter. 

     

 Section 10.06. Environmental Claims. GEs obligation to indemnify the Acquiror under Section 10.01(a)(iii) for liabilities and obligations arising under Environmental Law (pursuant to Section 2.02(d)(iii)), including those relating to any pre-Closing release of Hazardous Materials ("Environmental Claims") are further limited as follows: 

     

 (a) Third Party Claims and Governmental Authority claims related to alleged pre-Closing violations of Environmental Law or pre-Closing releases of Hazardous Materials (including property damage or personal injury related thereto) shall be noticed as provided in Section 10.03(a) and, to the extent such claim constitutes a matter for which an Acquiror Indemnified Party is entitled to indemnification under this Article X, GE shall assume the control and defense of such claim, subject to the procedures set forth in Section 10.03(b). 

     

 (b) To the extent a Third Party Claim or Governmental Authority claim requires  corrective measures or remediation at the Real Properties, GE shall keep  Acquiror reasonably apprised of the status of such Environmental Claim, and  shall select consultants and contractors for all work at the Real Properties  that are reasonably acceptable to Acquiror. GE shall, to the extent practicable, allow Acquiror an opportunity to review and comment on in advance on any work plans, investigations and other environmental remediation activities, incorporate all reasonable comments of the Acquiror, permit Acquiror to participate in phone calls and meetings with Governmental Authorities, and provide copies of any documents or correspondence received from or provided to any Governmental Authority regarding any such claim. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Acquiror agrees to consent to reasonable use restrictions on the Real Properties consistent with risk-based industrial cleanup objectives (to the extent permitted by the relevant Governmental Authority or any applicable lease in existence on the Closing Date and included in the Transferred Assets) or otherwise consistent with continued industrial use, which restrictions shall not unreasonably interfere with the continued operations of the Business. 

   
       

 (c) GEs indemnity obligation with respect to Environmental Claims that are not Third Party Claims or Governmental Authority claims shall arise solely upon the  discovery of a pre-Closing environmental condition that requires corrective  measures to remedy a violation of applicable Environmental Law or, with respect  to releases of Hazardous Material, requires action, including investigative,  corrective or remedial, pursuant to Environmental Law. GE shall comply with the  cooperation provisions in Section 10.06(b) in implementing any remediation on  the Real Properties pursuant to this Section 10.06(c), but in no event will GE  be required to conduct remediation beyond that necessary for continued  industrial use of the Real Properties, unless a more stringent standard is  required under any applicable lease in existence on the Closing Date and  included in the Transferred Assets. 

     

 (d) GE shall not be liable for any Consequential Damages incurred by the Acquiror with respect to any Environmental Claim pursuant to Section 10.05(b) if GE did not have knowledge of the Environmental Claim or the relevant circumstances prior to the Closing Date, and only to the extent such Consequential Damages are the direct result of the Acquirors willful failure to: (i) promptly notify GE of such Environmental Claim and the Acquirors reasonable belief that such Environmental Claim will likely result in such Consequential Damages, and (ii) take such reasonable mitigating steps or actions that may be recommended by GE to Acquiror to address such circumstances ("Mitigating Actions"). The cost of such Mitigating Actions authorized by GE shall be reimbursed by GE, and in no event shall the Acquiror be required to modify or alter the manner in  which it conducts its business in the ordinary course. 

     

 Section 10.07. Indemnification for Taxes. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, with respect to indemnification related to Taxes the Tax Matters Agreement shall control. 

     

 Section 10.08. Satisfaction of Non-Third Party Claims. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, in connection with any payment required to be made by GE to any Acquiror Indemnified Party under this Article X with respect to claims that are not Third Party Claims and Governmental Authority claims, GE may, at its option, deliver shares of the Acquiror Securities in satisfaction of a percentage of any of its indemnification obligations under this Article X with respect to claims that are not Third Party Claims and Governmental Authority claims, such percentage being equal to that percentage of the Purchase Price that was paid by Acquiror in Acquiror Securities at the Closing, to-wit: 28.76%, with the balance of any indemnification obligation to be paid by GE in immediately available funds. The value of each such share of Acquiror Securities delivered in satisfaction of such indemnification obligations shall be equal to the average per share closing price on the American Stock Exchange (or such other national stock exchange or market which is the primary exchange or market on which shares of the Acquiror Common Stock are traded) of a share of the Acquiror Common Stock during the twenty (20) consecutive trading days ending on the fifth Business Day prior to date such indemnity obligation is satisfied.

If any act, omission, disclosure or failure to disclose shall form the basis for a claim for breach of more than one representation or warranty, and such representations and warranties have different periods of survival hereunder, the termination of the survival period of one representations and warranties shall not affect a partys right to make a claim based on the breach of representation or warranty still surviving.

Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal or incapable of being enforced, the parties to this Agreement shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect the original intent of the parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that the transactions contemplated by this Agreement be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent possible.

Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Transaction Agreements, the Transaction Agreements constitute the entire agreement of GE and the other Sellers, on the one hand, and the Acquiror, on the other hand, with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements and supersede all prior agreements and undertakings, both written (including the Letter of Intent) and oral, other than the Confidentiality Agreement to the extent not in conflict with this Agreement, between or on behalf of GE, the other Sellers and/or their Affiliates, on the one hand, and the Acquiror and/or its Affiliates, on the other hand, with respect to the subject matter of the Transaction Agreements.

This Agreement shall not be assigned by operation of law or otherwise, except that (i) each of GE and the Acquiror may assign any or all of its rights or obligations under this Agreement to any of its Affiliates, provided that no such assignment shall release GE or the Acquiror (as the case may be) from any liability or obligation under this Agreement, (ii) each of GE and the Acquiror may assign any or all of its respective rights (but not its obligations) under this Agreement to any designee, and (iii) in the event of a merger or consolidation in which a party to this Agreement does not survive the merger or consolidation, such party may assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement to the surviving entity in the merger or consolidation.

 Section 11.10. Disclosure Schedule. Any disclosure with respect to a Section or Schedule of this Agreement shall be deemed to be disclosed for other Sections and Schedules of this Agreement to the extent that such disclosure sets forth facts in sufficient detail so that the relevance of such disclosure would be manifestly apparent to a reader of such disclosure.
