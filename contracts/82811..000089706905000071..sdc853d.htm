2.03.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Assignment of Contracts and Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, this Agreement shall not constitute an agreement to assign any
Transferred Asset or any claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder or resulting
therefrom if an attempted assignment thereof, without the consent of a third party
thereto, would constitute a breach or other contravention thereof or in any way adversely
affect the rights of the Acquiror or the Asset Sellers (as applicable) thereunder.
Subject to Section 5.05(d), the Asset Sellers will use their commercially reasonable best
efforts to obtain the consent of the other parties to any such Transferred Asset or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder for the assignment thereof to the
Acquiror as the Acquiror may request. If such consent is not obtained, or if an attempted
assignment thereof would be ineffective or would adversely affect the rights of the Asset
Sellers (as applicable) thereunder so that the Acquiror would not in fact receive all
such rights, the Asset Sellers and the Acquiror will, without limiting the obligations of
the parties pursuant to Section 5.05(d), cooperate in a mutually agreeable arrangement
under which the Acquiror would obtain at no additional cost to Acquiror the benefits and
assume the obligations and bear the economic burden thereunder in accordance with this
Agreement, including subcontracting, sublicensing or subleasing to the Acquiror, or under
which the Asset Sellers would enforce for the benefit of the Acquiror any and all of
their rights against a third party thereto, and the Asset Sellers would promptly pay to
the Acquiror when received all monies received by them under any Transferred Asset or any
claim or right or any benefit arising thereunder.  </FONT></P>

procedures, the Acquiror will give reasonable advance notice of such audits and/or other
procedures to GE and will provide GE with the opportunity to be present at and observe
all such audits and/or other procedures. The Initial Modified Net Current Assets
Statement (i) shall be prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP applied consistently with

Modified Net Current Assets and shall otherwise contain the same line items as the

Statement (the &#147;Accountants&#146; Report&#148;), which report shall set forth in

Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement to GE within 75 Business Days after the
Closing Date, then, at the election of GE, either (x) GE may prepare and present the
Initial Modified Net Current Assets Statement within an additional 45 Business Days or
(y) the Statement of Estimated Closing Modified Net Current Assets shall become final and
binding on the parties. If GE elects to prepare the Initial Modified Net Current Assets
Statement in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, then all subsequent
references in this Section 2.09 (other than those in Section 2.09(c)), and all references
in Section 2.10, to GE and the Acquiror, respectively, shall be read as references to the

the books, records and other relevant information in its possession relating to the
operations and finances of the Business with respect to the period up to and including

the event any Indemnifying Party receives a notice of a claim for indemnity

          disputes its liability to the Indemnified Party under this Article X. If the
          Indemnifying Party does not so notify the Indemnified Party, the claim
specified           by the Indemnified Party in such notice shall be conclusively deemed
to be a           liability of the Indemnifying Party under this Article X, and the
Indemnifying           Party shall pay, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
10.01(b), if           applicable, the amount of such liability to the Indemnified Party
on demand or,           in the case of any notice in which the amount of the claim (or
any portion of           the claim) is estimated, on such later date when the amount of
such claim (or           such portion of such claim) becomes finally determined. If the
Indemnifying           Party has timely disputed its liability with respect to such claim
as provided           above, then the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall
resolve such           dispute in accordance with Section 11.11.  </FONT></P>

Basis&#148; means, with respect to the manner in which an indemnification obligation
under this Agreement is discharged, that any indemnification payments shall be paid in
the first instance by the Indemnifying Party without reduction for any Tax benefits
available to the Indemnified Party, unless otherwise mutually agreed by the Indemnifying
Party and the Indemnified Party. In the absence of such mutual agreement, in the event
that the Indemnified Party recognizes a reduction in Tax liability as a result of
incurring a loss or expense with respect to which an indemnification payment is received,
the Indemnified Party shall pay an amount equal to the amount of such reduction in Tax
liability (but not in excess of any indemnification payments actually received from the
Indemnifying Party with respect to such loss or expense) to the Indemnifying Party at the
time that such reduction in Tax liability is actually realized through receipt of a
refund of Tax or a credit (or deduction) against Tax liability then due and payable. For
this purpose, the Indemnified Party shall be deemed to recognize a reduction in Tax
liability with respect to a Tax period to the extent that the Indemnified Party&#146;s
cumulative liability for Taxes through the end of such Tax period, calculated by
excluding any Tax items attributable to the respective loss or expense from all Tax
periods, exceeds the Indemnified Party&#146;s actual cumulative liability for Taxes
through the end of such Tax period, calculated by taking into account any Tax items
attributable to the loss or expense for all Tax periods (to the extent permitted by
relevant Tax law and treating such Tax items as the last items claimed for any Tax
period).  </FONT></P>
