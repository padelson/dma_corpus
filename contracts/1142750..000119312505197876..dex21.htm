shares of Company Capital Stock that are issued and outstanding immediately
after the Effective Time.

whole cent and computed after aggregating all shares of Company Capital Stock
held by such Type 2 Shareholder and the number of shares of Parent Common
Stock that each Type 2 Shareholder is entitled to receive for the shares of
Company Capital Stock held by such Type 2 Shareholder shall be rounded down
to the nearest whole share and computed after aggregating all shares of
Company Capital Stock held by such Type 2 Shareholder. The preceding
provisions of this Section 2.1(c)(ii) are subject to the provisions of
Sections 2.2, 2.6, 2.7, 2.8 and 2.9.

for the Earnout Period, and (D) the resulting Applicable Earnout Amount, and
deliver to the Representatives on or prior to February 28, 2006 a copy of
such computation. Unless the Representatives object to such computation within
ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof in accordance with the provisions
of Section 2.3(b)(ii) below, the computations shall be binding and conclusive
for purposes of this Agreement. Immediately following the Earnout Period, the
Representatives shall have full access to the books and records (including

Parent in writing within ten (10) Business Days after receipt thereof, the

unable to reach agreement with respect to such computations within thirty (30)
days after such notification, the determination of such amounts shall be
submitted to Ernst andYoung LLP, independent certified public accountants
(the "Independent Accountant") for review, and such review by the Independent
Accountant shall be limited to (A) such items and calculations as were
addressed in the written notice of objection of the Representatives that have
not been resolved by the parties and (B) any factual or mathematical errors
contained in the information provided to or by Parent. The parties shall cause
the Independent Accountant to review, subject to limitations of the previous
sentence, as promptly as practicable, the calculation of the Adjusted EBITDA,
the Incremental Adjusted EBITDA and the Total Revenue for the Earnout Period
and to make, subject to the limitations of the previous sentence, such
corrections thereto as it deems appropriate consistent with the terms of this
Agreement. The Independent Accountant shall issue a written report of its
review, setting forth in reasonable detail its calculation of the Adjusted
EBITDA, the Incremental Adjusted EBITDA and the Total Revenue for the Earnout
Period, which calculation with respect to matters solely involving the
application of accounting principles or Tax rules shall be conclusive and
binding on the parties to this Agreement and the Company Shareholders and
shall be the sole and exclusive means of resolving such disputes. If
requested by the Independent Accountant, Parent, the Company and the
Representatives, on behalf of the Company Shareholders, shall execute an
engagement letter with the Independent Accountant setting forth the terms and
conditions of such engagement, which shall be consistent with the terms of
this Section 2.3. All fees and expenses relating to the engagement of the
Independent Accountant shall be paid by Parent. 



(iii) The Applicable Earnout Amount shall be paid to the Company Shareholders

dispute as set forth in a notice of the Representatives pursuant to Section

2.3(b)(ii) above, as the case may be.



(iv) If Company management does not make the financial statements of the
Company for the twelve-month period ended December 31, 2005 reasonably
available to Parent on or before January 15, 2006, then the time for
performance of each of Parents obligations pursuant to this Section 2.3(b)
shall be extended by one (1) Business Day for each Business Day that
such financial statements shall remain unavailable to Parent following
January 15, 2006; _provided_ , _however_ , in no event shall such extension
extend beyond the date of the filing of Parents SEC Form 10-K for the year
ended December 31, 2005.



(v) Any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or related to the
agreements or procedures described in Section 2.3(b)(i) and not otherwise
resolved pursuant to Section 2.3(b)(ii) hereof shall be resolved by either:
(i) a written settlement agreement or memorandum executed by Parent and the
Representatives;  



 

-13-  or (ii) in the absence of such a written settlement agreement within ten
(10) Business Days following receipt by Parent of the written notice from the
Representatives, by binding arbitration between Parent and the
Representatives. If no settlement agreement can be reached after good faith
negotiation, either Parent or the Representatives may, by written notice to
the other, demand arbitration of the matter and the matter shall be settled
by arbitration conducted by three arbitrators. Within fifteen (15) days after
such written notice is sent, Parent (on the one hand) and the Representatives
(on the other hand) shall each select one arbitrator, and the two arbitrators
so selected shall select a third arbitrator. Any arbitration proceeding
hereunder shall last no longer than three (3) Business Days, unless the
parties to such arbitration mutually agree to extend the proceeding. The
decision of the arbitrators as to any matter in dispute shall be binding and
conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement. Judgment upon any award
rendered by the arbitrators may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.
Any such arbitration shall be held in New York, New York under the commercial
rules then in effect of Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Services, Inc.
("JAMS"). The non-prevailing party to an arbitration shall pay its own
expenses, the fees of each arbitrator, the administrative fee of JAMS, and
the expenses, including, without limitation, the reasonable attorneys fees
and costs, incurred by the prevailing party to the arbitration. The
arbitration panel shall be instructed to determine which party to the
arbitration is the prevailing party and which party is the non-prevailing
party.



(c) _Right of Set-Off_. Subject to the terms and limitations set forth in
Section 9.3(f), Parent shall have the right to withhold and set off against
any amount otherwise due to be paid to the Company Shareholders pursuant to
this Section 2.3 the amount of any Damages to which any Parent Indemnified
Person may be entitled under Article IX of this Agreement pursuant to a
proper Notice of Claim delivered to the Representatives prior to March 15,
2006. If any Claims that are the subject of any such Notice of Claim are
unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed as of March 15, 2006, then Parent
shall retain possession and custody of that portion of the Applicable Earnout
Amount that equals the total maximum amount of Damages then being claimed by
the Parent Indemnified Persons in all such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed
Claims, and as soon as all such Claims have been resolved, Parent shall
deliver to the Company Shareholders all of the remaining Applicable Earnout
Amount (if any) not required to satisfy such Claims. Other than with respect
to duly delivered Notices of Claim made prior to March 15, 2006 in accordance

Company prior to the Closing (the "Company 2005 Budget"). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, following the Closing Date, Parent and the Representatives may, but
shall not be obligated to, amend the Company 2005 Budget in a writing

payment of the Applicable Earnout Amount hereunder is an integral part of the
consideration to be received by the Company Shareholders pursuant to this
Agreement and the Merger; (ii) the Applicable Earnout Amount is not dependent
upon the operating results of Parent or any Subsidiary of Parent other than
the Company; (iii) the right of the Company Shareholders to a portion of the
Applicable Earnout Amount is not transferable other than by operation of law;
(iv) the right of the Company Shareholders to a portion of the Applicable
Earnout Amount shall not be represented by a certificate or other instrument,
shall not represent an ownership interest in Parent and shall not entitle any
Company Shareholder to any rights common to any holder of Parent Common Stock;
and (v) the right of the Company Shareholders to payment of the Applicable
Earnout Amount shall not bear any interest.



2.4 _The Closing_. Subject to the earlier termination of this Agreement as
provided in Article VIII, the Closing shall take place at the offices of AMN

92130, on the Closing Date.



 

-14- 2.5 _Effects of the Merger_. At and upon the Effective Time:



(a) the separate existence of Merger Sub shall cease and Merger Sub shall be
merged with and into the Company, and the Company shall be the Surviving
Corporation of the Merger pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the
Articles of Merger;



(b) the Articles of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation shall be
amended and restated in their entirety to read as the Articles of
Incorporation of Merger Sub as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time;



(c) the Bylaws of the Surviving Corporation shall be amended and restated in
their entirety to read as the Bylaws of Merger Sub as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time;

2.6 _Payment and Surrender of Certificates_.



(a) At the Closing, Parent shall deposit, for payment to the Company
Shareholders, the Total Consideration with American Stock Transfer and Trust
Company which shall act as exchange agent (the "Exchange Agent") in the
Merger. Immediately after the Effective Time, Parent shall cause the Exchange
Agent to mail to each holder of record (as of the Effective Time) of a
certificate or certificates which immediately prior to the Effective Time
represented shares of Company Capital Stock (the "Certificates") a letter of
transmittal (the "Letter of Transmittal") in customary form (which shall be
agreed upon by Parent and the Representatives prior to distribution thereof
and shall specify that delivery shall be effected, and risk of loss and title
to the Certificates shall pass, only upon delivery of the Certificates to the
Exchange Agent and shall contain such other customary provisions as Parent may
reasonably specify). Upon receipt of the Certificates for cancellation,
together with a duly completed and validly executed Letter of Transmittal and
any other documents as Parent or the Exchange Agent shall require, the
Exchange Agent shall, subject to the terms of Section 2.2, cause to be
delivered to such Company Shareholder that portion of the Total Consideration
which such Company Shareholder has the right to receive pursuant to Section
2.1(c). In the event any Certificate shall have been lost, stolen or
destroyed, upon the making of an affidavit of that fact by the Person claiming
such Certificate to be lost, stolen or destroyed, the Exchange Agent shall, as
soon as reasonably practicable following the receipt by the Exchange Agent of
the foregoing documents, subject to the terms of Section 2.2, issue in
exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate that portion of the
Total Consideration and any other amount payable pursuant to Section 2.1(c)
represented by the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate in exchange therefor
which the Company Shareholder has the right to receive.



(b) Immediately following the applicable dates for distribution of the
Applicable Earnout Amount set forth in Section 2.3(b)(iii) hereof, the
Exchange Agent shall deliver to each Company Shareholder that portion of the
Applicable Earnout Amount which such Company Shareholder has the right to
receive pursuant to Section 2.3(a) to the address set forth on such
Company Shareholders Letter of Transmittal; _provided_ , _however_ , that
the Exchange Agent shall not deliver such portion of the Applicable Earnout
Amount to any Company Shareholder unless and until such Company Shareholder
shall have delivered such holders Certificates and Letter of Transmittal and
other required documents in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.6(a).



(c) From and after the Effective Time, no shares of Company Capital Stock will
be deemed to be outstanding, and holders of Certificates formerly
representing such Company Capital Stock shall cease to have any rights with
respect thereto except as provided herein or by Applicable Law.



(d) At the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of Company shall be closed
and no transfer of Company Capital Stock shall thereafter be made. If, after
the Effective Time, Certificates formerly representing shares of Company
Capital Stock are presented to Parent or the Surviving Corporation, they shall
be cancelled and  



 

-15-  exchanged for that portion of the Total Consideration and the Applicable
Earnout Amount and any other amount payable with respect to such Company
Capital Stock in accordance with this Article II.



2.7 _Dissenting Shares_. If, in connection with the Merger, holders of
Company Capital Stock shall have demanded and validly perfected dissenters
rights pursuant to Articles 5.11 to 5.13 of Texas Law, none of such Dissenting
Shares shall be converted into a right to receive a portion of the Total
Consideration, the Applicable Earnout Amount or any other amount payable with
respect to such Company Capital Stock in accordance with this Article II, but
instead shall be converted into the right to receive such consideration as
may be determined to be due with respect to such Dissenting Shares pursuant to
Texas Law. Each holder of Dissenting Shares who, pursuant to the provisions of
Texas Law, becomes entitled to payment of the fair value of such shares shall
receive payment therefor in accordance with Texas Law (but only after the
value therefor shall have been agreed upon or finally determined pursuant to
Texas Law). In the event that any Company Shareholder fails to make an
effective demand for payment or fails to perfect such shareholders
dissenters rights as to such shareholders shares of Company Capital Stock or
any Dissenting Shares shall otherwise lose their status as Dissenting Shares,
then any such shares shall immediately be converted into the right to receive
the consideration issuable pursuant to this Article II in respect of such
shares as if such shares had never been treated as Dissenting Shares, and
Parent shall issue and deliver to the holder thereof, at (or as promptly as
reasonably practicable after) the applicable time or times specified in
Section 2.6, following the satisfaction of the applicable conditions set forth
in Section 2.6 and receipt by Parent of a Type 1 Shareholder Agreement or
Type 2 Shareholder Agreement, as applicable, the portion of the Total
Consideration and any other amounts, to which such Company Shareholder would
have been entitled under this Article II. The Company shall give Parent (i)
prompt notice of any demand received by the Company for appraisal of Company
Capital Stock or notice of exercise of a Company Shareholders dissenters
rights in accordance with Texas Law and (ii) the opportunity to participate
in, and the Company and Parent shall work cooperatively to resolve, all
negotiations and proceedings with respect to demands for dissenters rights
under such law. The Company agrees that, except with Parents prior
written consent (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld), it shall
not make any payment or offer to make any payment with respect to, or settle
or offer to settle, any such exercise of dissenters rights.



2.8 _Tax Withholding_. Parent or Parents agent shall be entitled to deduct
and withhold from the Total Consideration, the Applicable Earnout Amount and
any other payment otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any Company
Shareholder (including, without limitation, holders of Company Class B Stock
(except with respect to Merritt and Hawkins) issued pursuant to the
Restricted Stock Plan), the amounts required to be deducted and withheld under
the Code or any provision of state, local or foreign tax law, with respect to
the making of such payment, or with respect to income arising from the lapse
of vesting restrictions in connection with the Merger to the extent applicable
withholdings have not previously been made by the Company. To the extent that
amounts are so withheld, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all
purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Company Shareholder in
respect of whom such deduction and withholding was made and, if reasonably
determined to be necessary, shall be paid by Parent to the
respective Subsidiary employing each Company Shareholder to enable that
Subsidiary to deposit such funds with the applicable taxing authority.



2.9 _No Fractional Shares_. No certificate or scrip representing fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock shall be issued upon the surrender for exchange
of Certificates, and such fractional share interests will not entitle the
owner thereof to vote or to any rights as a stockholder of Parent.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, each holder of shares
of Company Capital Stock exchanged pursuant to the Merger who would otherwise
have been entitled to receive a fraction of a share of Parent Common Stock
(after taking into account all Certificates delivered by such holder) shall
receive, in lieu thereof, cash (without interest) in an amount equal to such
fractional part of a share of Parent Common Stock multiplied by the Parent
Stock Price.



2.10 _Further Assurances_. If, at any time before or after the Effective Time,
any of the parties hereto reasonably believes or is advised that any further
instruments, deeds, assignments or assurances are reasonably necessary to
consummate the Merger or to carry out the purposes and intent of this
Agreement at or after the Closing, then the Company and Parent and their
respective officers and directors shall execute and deliver all such proper
deeds, assignments, instruments and assurances and do all other things
reasonably necessary to carry out the purpose and intent of this Agreement.

Financial Statements. The Company Financial Statements: (i) are derived from
and are in accordance with the books and records of the Company; and (ii)
fairly present, in accordance with GAAP (subject, in the case of unaudited

operations and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries at the dates

sufficient for the continued operation of the Company Business. _Schedule

personal property owned or leased by the Company or any Subsidiary or used in
the Company Business are in good condition and repair, normal wear and tear
excepted, except where the failure to be in such condition or repair would not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. All material leases
of real or personal property to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party
are fully effective and afford the Company or such Subsidiary a valid
leasehold title to the real or personal property that is the subject of the
lease.  _Schedule 3.9_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule identifies each
parcel of real property leased by the Company or any Subsidiary. The Company
and its Subsidiaries have adequate ingress and egress into any real property
used in the operation of the Company Business. A true and complete copy of
each lease, sublease or other agreement under which the Company and/or any
Subsidiary uses or occupies or has the right to use or occupy, now or in the

has operated the Company Business in the ordinary course consistent with its
past practices, and since such date there has not been with respect to the
Company or any Subsidiary any:

condition or effect that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material
Adverse Effect on the Company;

comparable charter documents);



(c) incurrence, creation or assumption of: (i) any material Encumbrance on any
of its assets or properties (other than Permitted Encumbrances); (ii) any
material Liability for borrowed money; or (iii) any material Liability as a

of any right to repurchase shares of its capital stock upon a shareholders
termination of employment or services with it or pursuant to any right of
first refusal;

properties, or, other than in the ordinary course of business, payment or
discharge of any of its Liabilities, in each case that was not: (i) shown on

business consistent with its past practices after the Balance Sheet Date in an
amount not in excess of $100,000 for any single Liability to a particular
creditor;

of equity and debt financing commitment letters (together with any

to enable Parent to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby. The
Financing Commitments are in full force and effect, subject to the conditions
contained therein. Parent has paid, or will pay in accordance with the terms
of the definitive agreements related to the Financing Commitments, all fees
due and payable under the Financing Commitments. To its knowledge, Parent is

action, suit, arbitration, mediation, proceeding, claim or investigation
which could not be reasonably expected to have a Material Adverse Effect on

subsidiaries exists or, to Parents knowledge, is threatened, except for such
disputes that would not result in a Material Adverse Effect on Parent. To
Parents knowledge, there is no reasonable basis for any person to assert a

Agreement until the Closing (i) at the time filed, complied or will comply in
all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act, as the case may be, and (ii) did not or will not at the
time they were or are filed (or if amended or superseded by a filing prior to
the date of this Agreement, then on the date of such filing) contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required

statements in such Parent SEC Reports, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were or are made, not misleading.



(b) Each of the financial statements (including, in each case, any related
notes) included or incorporated by reference in the Parent SEC Reports,

thereto, were or will be prepared in accordance with GAAP applied on a
consistent basis throughout the periods involved (except as may be indicated
in the notes to such financial statement or, in the case of unaudited
statements, as permitted by Form 10-Q of the SEC) and fairly present or will
fairly present the consolidated financial position of Parent and its
subsidiaries as at the respective dates and the consolidated results of
operations and cash flows for the periods indicated, except that
the unaudited interim financial statements were or will be subject to normal
and recurring year-end adjustments.



(c) Parent has implemented and maintained a system of internal accounting
controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that: (i) transactions
are executed in accordance with managements general or specific
authorization; (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (A) to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP
consistently applied and (B) to maintain accountability for assets; and (iii)
the amount recorded for assets on the respective books and records of Parent
and its subsidiaries is compared with the existing assets at reasonable
intervals in connection with the preparation of annual audits of Parents
consolidated financial statements and appropriate action is taken with respect
to any differences.

operated its business in the ordinary course consistent with its

or effect that would reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse
Effect on Parent.



4.12 _No Discussions or Unreported Transactions_. Parent has not entered into
(and is not in discussions with any Person regarding) a transaction of any
nature that, if consummated or publicly disclosed, would be reasonably likely

untrue or inaccurate such that the condition set forth in Section 7.3 would
not be satisfied, or (b) any breach of any covenant or obligation of Parent
or Merger Sub pursuant to this Agreement, any Parent Ancillary Agreement or
any Merger Sub Ancillary Agreement such that the condition set forth in
Section 7.3 would not be satisfied.



6.2 _Regulatory Approvals_. Parent shall promptly execute and file, or join
in the execution and filing of, any application, notification (including any
notification or provision of information, if any, that may be required under
the HSR Act or applicable foreign antitrust laws) or other document that may
be necessary in order to obtain the authorization, approval or consent of any
Governmental Authority, whether foreign, federal, state, local or municipal,
which may be required in connection with the consummation of the Merger and
the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any Parent Ancillary
Agreement or any Merger Sub Ancillary Agreement. Parent agrees to make its
required filing under the HSR Act within three (3) Business Days of the
execution of this Agreement. Parent shall use commercially reasonable efforts
to obtain all such authorizations, approvals and consents and shall pay any
associated filing fees with respect to such authorizations, approvals and
consents. Parent shall promptly inform the Company of any material
communication between Parent and any Governmental Authority regarding any of
the transactions contemplated hereby. If Parent or any Affiliate of Parent
receives any formal or informal request for supplemental information or
documentary material from any Governmental Authority with respect to the
transactions contemplated hereby, then Parent shall make, or cause to be made,
as soon as reasonably practicable, a response in compliance with such request
and provide a copy of such response to the Company. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, if any administrative or judicial action or
proceeding is instituted (or threatened to be instituted) challenging any
transaction contemplated by this Agreement as violative of any Applicable
Law, it is expressly understood and agreed that neither Parent nor any of its
subsidiaries or Affiliates shall be under any obligation to: (a) litigate or
contest any administrative or judicial action or proceeding or any decree,
judgment, injunction or other order, whether temporary, preliminary or
permanent; or (b) make proposals, execute or carry out agreements or submit to
orders providing for (i) the sale or other disposition or holding
separate (through the establishment of a trust or otherwise) of any assets or
categories of assets of Parent, any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or the holding separate of the shares of
Company Capital Stock or (ii) the imposition of any limitation on the ability
of Parent or  



 

-37-  any of its subsidiaries or Affiliates to freely conduct their business or
own such assets or to acquire, hold or exercise full rights of ownership of
the shares of Company Capital Stock.



6.3 _Satisfaction of Conditions Precedent_. Parent shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to satisfy or cause to be satisfied all of the conditions
precedent that are set forth in Sections 7.1, 7.2(q) and 7.3, and Parent shall
use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Merger and the other
transactions contemplated by this Agreement to be consummated in accordance
with the terms of this Agreement as soon as reasonably practical.



6.4 _New York Stock Exchange Listing_. Parent shall, prior to the Effective
Time, file with The New York Stock Exchange all required documentation with
respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock comprising the Adjusted Total
Stock Consideration to be issued in the Merger. Parent shall, prior to the
issuance of Parent Common Stock comprising the Adjusted Total Earnout Stock
Consideration file with The New York Stock Exchange all required documentation
with respect to the shares of Parent Common Stock comprising such Adjusted
Total Earnout Stock Consideration.



6.5 _Registration of Parent Common Stock_.



(a) _Registrable Shares_. For purposes of this Agreement, "Registrable
Shares" shall mean the shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger
(including shares of Parent Common Stock issued pursuant to Section 2.3) but
excluding shares of Parent Common Stock issued in the Merger that have been
sold or otherwise transferred by the Company Shareholders who initially
received such shares in the Merger in violation of this Agreement, the
Shareholder Agreement or applicable law. "Registrable Shares" shall include
any shares of Parent Common Stock issued to any Holder with respect to any
Registrable Shares by way of stock dividend or stock split, or in connection
with a combination, recapitalization, reorganization, merger or consolidation
of Parent. 



(b) _Required Registration_. Parent shall prepare and file with the SEC a
registration statement on Form S-3 (or, if not then qualified to use Form S-3,
on Form S-1 or such successor or other appropriate form) under the Securities
Act with respect to the Registrable Shares (the "Registration Statement") on
or before March 10, 2006, and shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective by the SEC as
promptly as practicable thereafter. For avoidance of doubt, Parent shall not
be obligated to cause more than one (1) Registration Statement to become and
remain effective pursuant to and in accordance with the requirements of this
Section 6.5. Parent shall deliver to each holder of Registrable Shares,
including any permitted transferees reflected in the shareholder records of
Parent (each, a "Holder"), in writing at the address set forth in the
shareholder records of Parent, notice that such Registration Statement has
been declared effective by the SEC within two (2) Business Days following such
declaration by the SEC.



(c) _Effectiveness; Suspension Right_.



(i) Parent will use commercially reasonable efforts to maintain the
effectiveness of the Registration Statement continuously (subject to the
Suspension Right set forth in Section 6.5(c)(iii)) until the later of (A) the
first anniversary of the date of the effectiveness of the Registration
Statement and (B) March 10, 2007 (the "Registration Effective Period"), and
during such Registration Effective Period, (1) prepare and file with the SEC
such amendments (including post-effective amendments) to the Registration
Statement and supplements to the prospectus contained therein as may be
necessary to keep the Registration Statement continuously effective and in
compliance with the provisions of the Securities Act applicable thereto so as
to permit the prospectus forming a part thereof to be current and usable by
the Holders for resales of the Registrable Shares at all times during the
Registration Effective Period (subject to the occurrence of a Valid Business
Reason which would give rise to a Suspension Right pursuant to Section
6.6(c)(iii) below) and (2) take all lawful action such that the Registration
Statement and any amendment thereto does not, when it becomes effective, and
any prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement and any amendment
or supplement thereto does not, as of the date of delivery to the Holder,
contain an untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading subject in each case to the following limitations
and qualifications.



(ii) Following the date on which the Registration Statement is first declared
effective, the Holders will be permitted (subject in all cases to Section
6.6(a) and Section 6.7 below) to offer and sell  



 

-38-  Registrable Shares during the Registration Effective Period in the manner
described in the Registration Statement provided that the Registration
Statement remains effective and has not been suspended.



(iii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 6.5 but subject to
Section 6.6, Parent shall have the right at any time to require that all
Holders suspend further open market offers and sales of Registrable
Shares whenever there is a Valid Business Reason (the "Suspension Right");
_provided_ , _however_ , that the foregoing Suspension Right shall not be
exercised more than twice during the Suspension Exercise Period (as defined
below) and shall continue only until such Valid Business Reason no longer
exists but in no event for more than thirty (30) days for each exercise of the
right, and the Registration Effective Period shall be extended by the total
number of days as to which the Suspension Right is in effect. The Suspension
Right shall not be invoked during any period when officers or directors of the
Parent are permitted to trade in the Parents stock. The "Suspension Exercise
Period" shall be the period commencing on the date that the Registration
Statement is declared effective and shall end on the date that is the first
anniversary of the Closing Date; _provided_ , _however_ , that the Suspension
Exercise Period shall be extended by one (1) Business Day for each Business
Day that Parent exercises a Suspension Right hereunder.



(d) _Expenses_. The costs and expenses incurred by Parent in connection with
the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Section 6.5 and Section
6.6 including, without limitation, printing expenses (including a reasonable
number of prospectuses for circulation by the selling shareholders), legal
fees and disbursements of counsel for Parent, "blue sky" expenses, accounting
fees and filing fees (the "Registration Expenses") shall be borne by the
Holders. Parent may invoice the Holders from time to time for such
Registration Expenses and, if the Holders do not pay the Registration
Expenses within ten (10) Business Days following the invoice date for such
Registration Expenses, then Parent may elect to pay the Registration Expenses,
in which case such payment shall be treated hereunder as an
indemnifiable Claim of Parent for purposes of Section 9.2(a)(viii).



(e) _Indemnification_.



(i) To the extent permitted by Law, Parent will indemnify and hold harmless
each Holder, any underwriter (as defined in the Securities Act) for such
Holder, its officers, directors, shareholders or partners and each person, if
any, who controls such shareholder or underwriter within the meaning of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act, against any Damages (joint or several) to
which they may become subject under the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or
other federal or state law, insofar as such Damages (or actions in respect
thereof) arise out of or are based upon any of the following statements,
omissions or violations (collectively a "Violation"): (A) any Registration
Statement, including any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained
therein or any amendments or supplements thereto, (B) the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein, or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, or (C) any violation
or alleged violation by Parent of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, any
state securities law or any rule or regulation promulgated under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law; and Parent will
pay to each such Holder (and its officers, directors, shareholders or
partners), underwriter or controlling person, any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by them in connection with the investigating or defending
of any such Damages or action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement
contained in this Section 6.5(e)(i) shall not apply to amounts paid in
settlement of any Damages, or action if such settlement is effected without
the consent of Parent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; nor
shall Parent be liable in any such case for any such Damages, or action to the
extent that it arises out of or is based upon (1) a Violation which occurs in
reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished expressly
for use in the Registration Statement by any such Holder, or (2) a Violation
that would not have occurred if such Holder had delivered to the purchaser the
version of the prospectus most recently made available by Parent to the
Holder as of the date of such sale.



(ii) To the extent permitted by law, each Holder will indemnify and hold
harmless Parent, each of its directors, each of its officers who has signed
the Registration Statement, each person, if any, who controls Parent within
the meaning of the Securities Act, any underwriter, any other Holder selling
securities pursuant to the Registration Statement and any controlling person
of any such underwriter or other shareholder, against any Damages (joint or
several) to which any of the foregoing persons may become subject, under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state law, insofar as
such Damages (or action in respect thereto) arise out of or are based upon
any Violation (which includes without limitation the failure of such
shareholder to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements under the
Securities Act, and the failure of such shareholder to  



 

-39-  deliver the most current prospectus made available by Parent prior to such
sale), in each case to the extent (and only to the extent) that such
Violation occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with written information
furnished by such shareholder expressly for use in the Registration Statement
or such Violation is caused by such shareholders failure to deliver to the
purchaser of the shareholders Registrable Shares a prospectus (or amendment
or supplement thereto) that had been made available to such shareholder by
Parent; and such shareholder will pay any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by any person intended to be indemnified pursuant to this Section
6.5(e)(ii) in connection with investigating or defending any such Damages or
action; provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this
Section 6.5(e)(ii) shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such
Damages or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Representatives, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The
aggregate indemnification and contribution Liability of such shareholder
under this Section 6.5(e)(ii) shall not exceed the net proceeds received by
such shareholder in connection with sale of Registrable Shares pursuant to the
Registration Statement.



(iii) Each person entitled to indemnification under this Section 6.5(e) (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified
Party has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought
and shall permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such
claim and any litigation resulting therefrom, provided that counsel for the
Indemnifying Party who conducts the defense of such claim or any litigation
resulting therefrom shall be approved by the Indemnified Party (whose approval
shall not unreasonably be withheld), and the Indemnified Party may participate
in such defense at such partys expense, and provided further that
the failure of any Indemnified party to give notice as provided herein shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations under this Section 6.5
unless the Indemnifying Party is materially prejudiced thereby. No
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall
(except with the consent of each Indemnified Party) consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement that does not include as an
unconditional term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such
Indemnified Party of a release from all Liability in respect to such claim or
litigation. Each Indemnified Party shall furnish such information regarding
itself or the claim in question as an Indemnifying Party may
reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in
connection with the defense of such claim and litigation resulting therefrom.



(iv) To the extent that the indemnification provided for in this Section 6.5
(e) is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unavailable to an
Indemnified Party with respect to any Damages referred to herein, then the
Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable, by such Indemnified Party as
a result of such Damages in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Indemnifying Party on the one hand and of the
Indemnified Party on the other in connection with the statements or omissions
which resulted in such Damages, as well as any other relevant equitable
considerations. The relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and of the
Indemnified Party shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified Party and the
parties relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such statement of omission.



6.6  _Procedures for Sale of Parent Common Stock_.



(a) _Notice and Approval of Holders other than Merritt and Hawkins_. If any
Holder other than Merritt and Hawkins shall propose to sell any Registrable
Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, it shall notify Parent of its
intent to do so (including the proposed manner and timing of all sales) at
least five (5) full trading days prior to such sale, and the provision of such
notice to Parent shall conclusively be deemed to establish and reconfirm an
agreement by such shareholder to comply with the registration provisions set
forth in this Agreement. Unless otherwise specified in such notice, such
notice shall be deemed to constitute a representation that any information
previously supplied by such Holder expressly for inclusion in the
Registration Statement (as the same may have been superseded by subsequent
such information) is accurate as of the date of such notice. At any time
within such five (5) trading day period, Parent may delay the resale by such
Holder of any Registrable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement by
exercising the Suspension Right if permitted to do so; provided, however, that
in order to exercise this right, Parent must deliver a certificate in writing
to the Holder to such effect not later than the close of business on the
second trading day following receipt of any notice from any Holder indicating
an intent to sell any Registrable Shares, provided that such notice from such
Holder shall have included a working  



 

-40-  facsimile number for purposes of delivery of such response from Parent.
Parent shall keep and hold confidential any information set forth in any
notice of a Holder delivered pursuant to this Section 6.6(a).



(b) _Notice of Exercise of Suspension Right to Merritt and Hawkins_. At any
time that Parent shall exercise the Suspension Right pursuant to Section
6.5(c)(iii), Parent shall deliver to Merritt and Hawkins written notice that
it is exercising the Suspension Right and shall deliver written notice to
such individuals at the time the Suspension Right ceases to be in effect.



(c) _Parent Obligations_. In connection with the registration of the
Registrable Shares, Parent shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to:



(i) during the Registration Effective Period, comply with the provisions of
the Securities Act with respect to the Registrable Shares covered by the
Registration Statement;



(ii) furnish to each Holder, (A) as soon as reasonably practicable after the
Registration Statement is filed with the SEC, one copy of the Registration
Statement, each prospectus forming a part of the Registration Statement, and
each amendment or supplement thereto, and (B) following the effective date of
the Registration Statement, such number of copies of the prospectus and all
amendments and supplements thereto and such other documents, as such Holder
may reasonably request in order to facilitate the disposition of the
Registrable Shares owned by such Holder;



(iii) (A) register or qualify the Registrable Shares covered by the
Registration Statement under such securities or "Blue Sky" laws of all
jurisdictions requiring Blue Sky registration or qualification, (B) prepare
and file in such jurisdictions such amendments (including post-
effective amendments) and supplements to such registrations and
qualifications as may be necessary to maintain the effectiveness thereof at
all times during the Registration Effective Period, (C) take all such other
lawful actions as may be necessary to maintain such registrations and
qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration Effective
Period, and (D) take all such other lawful actions reasonably necessary or
advisable to qualify the Registrable Shares for sale in such jurisdictions;
provided, however, that Parent shall not be required in connection therewith
or as a condition thereto to (I) qualify to do business in any jurisdiction
where it would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this Section
6.6(c)(iii) or (II) file a general consent to service of process in any such
jurisdiction;



(iv) cooperate with the Holders who hold Registrable Shares to facilitate the
timely preparation and delivery of certificates for the Registrable Shares
and enable such certificates to be in such denominations or amounts, as the
case may be, as the Holders reasonably may request and registered in such
names as the Holders may request; and, within three (3) Business Days
after the Registration Statement is declared effective by the SEC, deliver
and cause legal counsel selected by Parent to deliver to the transfer agent
for the Registrable Shares (with copies to the Holders) an appropriate
instruction and, to the extent necessary, an opinion of such counsel, to
facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of such certificates; and



(v) take all such other lawful actions reasonably necessary to expedite and
facilitate the disposition by the Holders of their Registrable Shares in
accordance with the intended methods therefor provided in the prospectus which
are customary under the circumstances, including without limitation providing
reasonable assistance in confirming (assuming the same is true) that a Holder
is not an Affiliate of the Parent; provided, however, that such reasonable
assistance shall not include in any case the preparation or delivery of an
opinion of legal counsel with respect to any Holders status as an Affiliate;
provided, further, that upon the request of a Holder, and in Parents sole
discretion and at Holders sole expense, Parent may elect to prepare and
deliver such an opinion of legal counsel.



6.7 _Obligations of the Holders_. In connection with the registration of the
Registrable Shares, the Holders shall have the following obligations, which
obligations shall be several and not joint:



(a) Prior to the first anticipated filing of the Registration Statement under
Section 6.5 hereof, each Holder shall provide Parent with such information as
may be required by Section 507 of Regulation S-K of the  



 

-41-  Securities Act, together with whatever confirmations, information requests,
certificates or consents as may reasonably be requested by Parent.



(b) Each Holder by its acceptance of the Registrable Shares agrees to
cooperate with Parent in connection with the preparation of the Registration
Statement under Section 6.5 hereof.



(c) As promptly as practicable after becoming aware of such event, the
relevant Holder shall notify Parent of the occurrence of any event, as a
result of which the material submitted by such Holder for inclusion in the
prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as then in effect, includes
an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.



(d) Each Holder agrees that, following receipt of any notice from Parent of
the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section 6.6(a) and/or
6.6(b), it shall not dispose of Registrable Shares pursuant to the
Registration Statement covering such Registrable Shares and, if so directed by
Parent, such Holder shall deliver to Parent (at the expense of Parent)
or destroy (and deliver to Parent a certificate of destruction) all copies in
such Holders possession, of the prospectus, as amended or supplemented,
covering such Registrable Shares current at the time of receipt of such
notice.



6.8 _Indemnification of Officers and Directors_.



(a) Parent agrees that the indemnification obligations set forth in the
Companys Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws in effect on the date hereof
shall survive the Merger and shall not be amended, repealed or otherwise
modified for a period of six years after the Effective Time in any manner
that would adversely affect the rights thereunder of any individual who on or
prior to the Effective Time was a director, officer, trustee, fiduciary,
employee or agent of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or who served at
the request of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as a director, officer,
trustee, partner, fiduciary, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, joint venture, trust, pension or other employee benefit plan or
enterprise, unless such amendment or modification is required by Applicable
Law.



(b) The Surviving Corporation shall honor and fulfill in all respects the
obligations of the Company pursuant to the indemnification agreements with the
Companys directors and officers existing and in effect on the date hereof and
set forth on  _Schedule 6.8(b)_ of the Company Disclosure Schedule.



(c) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall, at its option, be permitted to
purchase a prepaid insurance and indemnification policy (which payment shall
be treated as a Merger Expense) providing the Companys current directors and
officers with coverage for events occurring prior to the Effective Time (the
"DandO Insurance") that is no less favorable than the Companys existing
policies (true and complete copies which have been previously provided by the
Company to Parent), which prepaid insurance policy may provide such directors
and officers with such coverage for a period of up to six years with respect
to claims arising from facts or events that occurred on or before the
Effective Time, including, without limitation, in respect of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement. If the Company so elects to obtain DandO
Insurance, following the Effective Time, Parent shall maintain such policy in
full force and effect, and continue to honor the obligations thereunder.



6.9  _Disclosure Memorandum_. Parent shall, to the extent it deems it
appropriate or required by Applicable Law in its reasonable discretion,
provide to the Company for inclusion with the Companys mailing to the Type 2
Shareholders of the Information Statement pursuant to Section 5.5(a) of this
Agreement a disclosure memorandum that, in combination with the information
set forth in the Information Statement, complies with Regulation D of the
Securities Act and any applicable state securities laws.



6.10 _Employee Benefit Matters_. Commencing on the Closing Date and
continuing through December 31, 2005, except as otherwise contemplated by the
employment agreements to be executed by certain Company employees pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement, Parent shall cause the Surviving Corporation to
continue to maintain the Companys employee compensation levels, benefit
plans, programs, policies, and arrangements currently in effect (including but
not limited to the Companys retention, severance and termination
agreements).



 

-42-  Parent shall cause each employee benefit plan of Parent that is made
available to employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing
Date to recognize each employees tenure with the Company and its
Subsidiaries for purposes of eligibility, vesting and retirement (but not for
purposes of benefit accrual), and for purposes of determining the amount of
benefits under any applicable sick leave, vacation, severance or other
welfare plan, in each case, to the extent permitted under the terms of such
plan or plans as of the Agreement Date. Parent shall cause to be waived all
limitations as to preexisting condition limitations, exclusions and waiting
periods with respect to participation and coverage requirements applicable to
the employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries under any plan of Parent and
its Affiliates that is a healthcare plan and in which such employees are
eligible to participate after the Closing Date, to the extent such limitation
or exclusion was waived or such waiting period was satisfied under any
healthcare plan maintained for such employees by the Company immediately prior
to the Closing Date, in each case, to the extent permitted under the terms of
such plan or plans as of the Agreement Date. Parent shall cause each
healthcare plan of Parent and its Affiliates that is made available to
employees of the Company and its Subsidiaries after the Closing Date to
provide each such employee with credit for any co-payments, deductibles and
any other out-of-pocket expenses paid under any healthcare plan of the Company
and its Subsidiaries in satisfying any applicable deductible or out-of-pocket
requirements of such plan of Parent and its Affiliates, in each case, to the
extent permitted under the terms of such plan or plans as of the Agreement
Date.

an aggregate stated amount arising from such Claim (which amount may be an
estimated amount and may be the amount of damages claimed by a third party in
an action brought against any Parent Indemnified Person based on alleged
facts, which if true, would give rise to Liability for Damages to such Parent
Indemnified Person under this Article IX);



(ii) a brief description, in reasonable detail (to the extent reasonably
available to Parent), of the facts, circumstances or events giving rise to the
alleged Damages based on Parents good faith belief thereof, including the
identity and address of any third-party claimant (to the extent reasonably
available to Parent) and copies of any formal demand or complaint, the amount
of Damages (to the extent known), or the basis for such anticipated Liability,
and the specific nature of the breach to which such item is related; and 



(iii) a statement that: (A) the Claims identified in such Notice of Claim
(together with Claims set forth in all Notices of Claims theretofore
delivered), individually or in the aggregate, do not satisfy the Basket; (B)
the Claims identified in such Notice of Claim (together with Claims set forth
in all Notices of Claims theretofore delivered), individually or in the
aggregate, satisfy the Basket; or (C) that the Basket does not apply to such
Claims.



9.8 _Resolution of Notice of Claim_. Each Notice of Claim given by Parent
shall be resolved as follows:



(a) If, within ten (10) Business Days after a Notice of Claim is received by
the Representatives, the Representatives do not contest such Notice of Claim
in writing to Parent, the Representatives shall be conclusively deemed to have
consented, on behalf of all Company Shareholders, to the recovery by
the Parent Indemnified Person of the full amount of Damages (subject to the
limits contained in this Article IX) specified in the Notice of Claim in
accordance with this Article IX, including the forfeiture of all or a portion
of the Holdback Amount, and, without further notice, to have stipulated to
the entry of a final judgment for damages against the Company Shareholders for
such amount in any court having jurisdiction over the matter where venue is
proper. Upon the expiration of such ten (10) Business Day period, if Parent
has not received a notice of Contested Claim pursuant to Section 9.8(b),
Parent shall be entitled to deduct from the Holdback Amount and/or withhold
from any Applicable Earnout Amount owed to the Company Shareholders pursuant
to Section 2.3 the amount set forth in the Notice of Claim.



(b) If the Representatives gives Parent written notice contesting all or any
portion of a Notice of Claim (a "Contested Claim") within the ten (10)
Business Day period specified in Section 9.8(a) above, then Parent and the
Representatives shall attempt in good faith for ten (10) Business Days after
Parents receipt of such notice to resolve such objection. If Parent and the
Representatives shall so agree, a memorandum setting forth such agreement
shall be prepared and signed by both parties.



 

-52- (c) If no such agreement can be reached during such ten (10) Business Day
period either Parent or the Representatives may bring suit in the courts of
the State of Delaware and the Federal courts of the United States of America
located within the State of Delaware. The decision of the trial court shall be
nonappealable, binding and conclusive upon the parties to this Agreement.



(d) Judgment upon any award rendered by the trial court may be entered in any
court having jurisdiction. For purposes of this Section 9.8(d), in any suit
hereunder in which any claim or the amount thereof stated in a Notice of Claim
is at issue, Parent shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing party unless the
trial court awards Parent more than one-half of the amount in dispute, in
which case the Company Shareholders shall be deemed to be the non-prevailing
party. The non-prevailing party to a suit shall pay its own expenses and fees
and the expenses and fees of the prevailing party, including attorneys fees
and costs, reasonably incurred in connection with such suit. The resolution of
any objections to claims set forth in a Notice of Claim delivered to the
Representatives following the Expiration Date shall be conducted in accordance
with the procedures set forth in this Section 9.8.



9.9 _Release of Remaining Holdback Amount_. Within ten (10) Business Days
following the Expiration Date, Parent shall deliver to the Company
Shareholders at the address set forth in their respective Letters of
Transmittal all of the remaining Holdback Amount (if any) in excess of any
Holdback Amount that is necessary to satisfy all unresolved, unsatisfied or
disputed claims for Damages specified in any Notice of Claim delivered to the
Representatives before the Expiration Date. If any Claims are unresolved,
unsatisfied or disputed as of the Expiration Date, then Parent shall retain
possession and custody of that portion of the Holdback Amount that equals the
total maximum amount of Damages then being claimed by Parent Indemnified
Persons in all such unresolved, unsatisfied or disputed Claims, and as soon
as all such Claims have been resolved, Parent shall deliver to the Company
Shareholders all of the remaining Holdback Amount (if any) not required to
satisfy such Claims. Once the Holdback Amount (or any portion thereof) is
delivered to the Company Shareholders, Parent will have no right to make any
claim against or recovery from such delivered amount.



9.10 _Tax Consequences of Indemnification Payments_. All payments (if any)
made to an Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to any
indemnification obligations under this Article IX will be treated as
adjustments to the purchase price for tax purposes and such agreed treatment
will govern for purposes of this Agreement, unless otherwise required by law.



9.11 _Appointment of Representatives_.



(a) By voting in favor of the Merger or participating in the Merger and
accepting the benefits thereof, each Company Shareholder shall be deemed to
have irrevocably appointed the Representatives as the representatives of the
Company Shareholders and as the attorneys-in-fact and agents for and on behalf
of each Company Shareholder with respect to claims for indemnification under
this Article IX, the taking by the Representatives of any of any and all
actions set forth in Section 2.3 and the taking by the Representatives of any
and all actions and the making of any decisions required or permitted to be
taken by the Representatives under this Agreement, including the exercise of
the power to: (i) give and receive notices and communications to or from
Parent (on behalf of itself of any other Parent Indemnified Person) relating
to this Agreement or any of the transactions and other matters contemplated
hereby (except to the extent that this Agreement expressly contemplates that
any such notice or communication shall be given or received by such holders
individually); (ii) authorize the release or delivery to Parent of all or a
portion of the Holdback Amount in satisfaction of indemnification claims by
Parent or any other Parent Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article IX
(including by not objecting to such claims); (iii) agree to, object to,
negotiate, resolve, enter into settlements and compromises of, demand
arbitration or litigation of, and comply with orders of arbitrators or courts
with respect to, (A) indemnification claims by Parent or any other Parent
Indemnified Person pursuant to this Article IX or (B) any dispute between any
Parent Indemnified Person and any such holder, in each case relating to this
Agreement; (iv) receive notices and take such actions as may be necessary or
desirable pursuant to Section 2.3; (v) administer the Representative Fund
under the terms of Section 9.11(b); and (vi) take all actions necessary
or appropriate in the judgment of the Representatives for the accomplishment
of the foregoing. The Representatives shall have authority and power to act on
behalf of each Company Shareholder with respect to the disposition, settlement
or other handling of all claims under this Article IX and all rights or
obligations arising under Section 2.3 or this Article IX. The Company
Shareholders shall be bound by all actions taken and documents executed by the
Representatives in connection with Section 2.3 (including, if  



 

-53-  applicable, the engagement letter of the Independent Accountant) or this
Article IX, and Parent and other Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled
to rely on any action or decision of the Representatives. For this purpose,
the decision of both of the Representatives acting together or the decision of
either of the Representatives acting individually shall be deemed to be the
"decision of the Representatives" for purposes of this Agreement and Parent
and the other Parent Indemnified Persons shall be entitled to rely on any such
"decision of the Representatives." The individuals serving as the
Representatives may be replaced from time to time by the holders of a
majority in interest of the Holdback Amount then on deposit with Parent upon
not less than ten (10) days prior written notice to Parent. No bond shall be
required of the Representatives, and the Representatives shall receive no
compensation for their services. Notices or communications to or from the
Representatives shall constitute notice to or from each of the Company
Shareholders.



(b) The Representatives may incur out-of-pocket expenses (including
reasonable attorneys fees and court costs) on behalf of the Company
Shareholders in their capacity as Representatives, including with respect to
the determination of the Applicable Earnout Amount pursuant to Section 2.3
hereof and the indemnification obligations of the Company Shareholders under
Section 9.2(a) hereof (collectively, the "Representative Expenses"). If not
paid directly to the Representatives by the Company Shareholders,
the Representative Expenses will be paid out of the Representative Fund and
thereafter the Representative Expenses may be recovered from any Holdback
Amount to be distributed to the Company Shareholders (and not distributed or
distributable to any Parent Indemnified Person or subject to a pending
indemnification claim of any Parent Indemnified Person) following the
Expiration Date, _provided_ , _that_ , the Representative shall have delivered
a notice to Parent not less than five (5) Business Days prior to the
Expiration Date setting forth the amount of such Representative Expenses to be
paid to the Representatives, and such recovery will be made from the Company
Shareholders according to their respective Pro Rata Shares. The
Representatives shall cause any balance remaining in the Representative Fund
at the Expiration Date to be promptly distributed to the Company Shareholders
according to their Pro Rata Share; _provided_ _that_ the
Representatives shall be entitled to retain any portion of the Representative
Fund required to fund Representative Expenses related to unresolved Claims.



(c) In performing the functions specified in this Agreement, the
Representatives shall not be liable to any Company Shareholder in the absence
of gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Representatives.
Each Company Shareholder shall severally (based on each such holders Pro Rata
Share), and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Representatives
from and against any loss, Liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Representatives and
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties hereunder, including any Representative Expenses.

hereto irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the

contemplated hereby and thereby, and hereby waive, and agree not to assert, as
a defense in any action, suit or proceedings for the interpretation or
enforcement hereof or thereof, that it is not subject thereto or that such
action, suit or proceeding may not be brought or is not maintainable in said
courts or that venue thereof may not be appropriate or that this Agreement or
any such document may not be enforced in or by such courts, and the parties
hereto irrevocably agree that all claims with respect to such action or
proceeding shall be heard and determined in such a Delaware State or Federal
court. The parties hereby consent to and grant any such court jurisdiction
over the person of such parties and over the subject matter of such dispute
and agree that mailing of process or other papers in connection with any such
action or proceeding in the manner provided in Section 10.8 or in such other
manner as may be permitted by Applicable Law, shall be valid and sufficient
service thereof. With respect to any particular action, suit or proceeding,
venue shall lie solely in the State of Delaware.

inure to the benefit of the successors and assigns of Parent, including any

binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns. Any assignment in violation of
this provision shall be void.



10.3  _Severability_. If any provision of this Agreement, or the application
thereof, shall for any reason and to any extent be invalid or unenforceable,
then the remainder of this Agreement and the application of such provision to
other persons or circumstances shall be interpreted so as reasonably to
effect the intent of the parties hereto. The parties further agree to replace
such void or unenforceable provision of this Agreement with a valid and
enforceable provision that shall achieve, to the extent possible, the
economic, business and other purposes of the void or unenforceable provision.



10.4 _Counterparts_. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original as regards any party
whose signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute
one and the same instrument. This Agreement shall become binding when one or
more counterparts hereof, individually or taken together, shall bear the
signatures of all parties reflected hereon as signatories.



10.5 _Other Remedies_. The parties hereto agree that irreparable damage would
occur in the event that any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached.

injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce
specifically the terms and provisions hereof.

waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either retroactively
or prospectively), only by a writing signed by the party to be bound thereby.
The waiver by a party of any breach hereof or default in the performance
hereof shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any
succeeding breach or default. This Agreement may be amended by the parties
hereto as provided in this Section 10.6 at any time before or after adoption
of this Agreement by the Company Shareholders, but, after such adoption, no
amendment shall be made which by Applicable Law requires the further approval
of the Company Shareholders without obtaining such further approval. At any

taken by its Board of Directors, may, to the extent legally allowed, (a)
extend the time for the performance of any of the obligations or other acts of
the other, (b) waive any inaccuracies in the representations and warranties
made to it contained herein or in any document delivered pursuant hereto, and
(c) waive compliance with any of the agreements or conditions for its benefit
contained herein. No such waiver or extension shall be effective
unless signed in writing by the party against whom such waiver or extension
is asserted. The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions hereof
shall not be construed to be a waiver of the right of such party thereafter to
enforce such provisions.



10.7 _Attorneys  Fees_. Should suit be brought to enforce or interpret any
part of this Agreement, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, as
an element of the costs of suit and not as damages, reasonable attorneys fees

[SIGNATURE PAGE TO ACQUISITION AGREEMENT] SCHEDULE I-3



TOTAL CONSIDERATION ADJUSTMENT



$1,350,000 SCHEDULE 2.3



EARNOUT CALCULATION



"Adjusted EBITDA" shall be the Companys EBITDA for the Earnout Period,
adjusted as follows: (i) no deduction shall be made for any expenses arising
out of the termination of the restrictions with respect to and/or the
acquisition of the Company Class B Stock in the Merger; (ii) no deduction
shall be made for any amounts charged by Parent to the Company following the
Closing Date for Parent overhead allocations; (iii) the Companys EBITDA shall
be increased by an amount equal to $347,000, relating to losses reflected in
the Company Financial Statements and incurred in connection with the
Companys prior sale of all of the outstanding capital stock of Amerimed
Consulting, Inc.; (iv) the Companys EBITDA shall be increased by the Excess
Compensation; (v) the Companys EBITDA shall be increased by $1,000,000,
relating to certain agreed upon non-recurring legal and accounting fees and
expense; (vi) a deduction of $1,500,000 shall be made relating to certain
agreed upon allied healthcare matters; (vii) no deduction shall be made
for any Merger Expenses; (viii) no deduction shall be made for any amount for
which a Claim may be payable pursuant to Article IX to the extent that such
Claim arose out of conduct or activities occurring, or relates to periods,
prior to January 1, 2005; and (ix) such other adjustments for the period from
July 31, 2005 to the end of the Earnout Period as shall be mutually agreed
between Parent and the Representatives and as are consistent with the Pro
Forma Adjusted EBITDA calculation and are not reflected in the adjustments
pursuant to clauses (i)-(viii) above but reflect non-recurring expenses.



Annexed to this _Schedule 2.3_ is a pro forma calculation of Adjusted EBITDA
for the Company for the twelve month period ended July 31, 2005 (the
"Pro Forma Adjusted EBITDA"). Parent and the Company agree that the
calculation of Adjusted EBITDA will employ methodologies, policies and
assumptions consistent with those used in the calculation of the Pro Forma
Adjusted EBITDA.



"Excess Compensation" means the amount, if any, by which the
total compensation expense recorded for the year ended December 31, 2005, for
the compensation paid to each of Messrs. Merritt, Hawkins, Caldwell, Cotham,
Koger and Smith (together, the "Key Employees") shall exceed the sum of: (i)
the annualized base compensation to be initially paid under the Employment
Agreements executed by the Key Employees at or prior to the Closing; _plus_
(ii) one hundred percent (100%) of the eligible bonus amounts as contemplated
by the Employment Agreements executed by the Key Employees.



"Incremental Adjusted EBITDA" means the amount by which the Adjusted EBITDA
exceeds $18,200,000.



An Applicable Earnout Amount shall become payable to the Company Shareholders
pursuant to Section 2.3 of the Agreement, as calculated in accordance with
this Schedule 2.3, if, and only if, both the Total Revenue for the Earnout
Period and the Adjusted EBITDA meets or exceeds the amounts set forth in the
table below:



     |  |  |  |  |  |  |  | 
---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|--- 
    |  |

(1)

Total Revenue

* * *

 |  |
 (3)

Incremental (4)

Applicable 
Earnout 
Multiple

* * * 

  

Level 1

 |  | 272,000,000 |  | $18,200,000 to 
$22,200,000 |  | $1 to $4,000,000 |  | 6.0 
  

Level 2

 |  | 277,000,000 |  | $22,200,001 to 
$24,200,000 |  | Next $2,000,000 |  | 6.3 
  

Level 3

 |  | 283,000,000 |  | $24,200,001 to 
$26,518,000 |  | Next $2,318,000 |  | 6.6 The Applicable Earnout Amount shall be the sum of the Maximum Earnout Amounts
for each applicable Level.



The "Maximum Earnout Amount" for each applicable Level shall be calculated by
_multiplying_ the Incremental Adjusted EBITDA applicable to such Level (column
(3) in the chart above) _by_ the Applicable Earnout Multiple applicable to
such Level (column (4) in the chart above).



For example, if the Total Revenue for the Earnout Period is $280,000,000 and
the Incremental Adjusted EBITDA is $5,000,000, then the Applicable Earnout
Amount shall be $30,300,000, representing the sum of $24,000,000 (the Maximum
Earnout Amount for Level 1, calculated as $4,000,000 multiplied by 6.0) _plus_
$6,300,000 (the Maximum Earnout Amount for Level 2, calculated as $1,000,000
multiplied by 6.3).



For further example, if the Total Revenue for the Earnout Period is
$275,000,000 and the Incremental Adjusted EBITDA is $5,000,000, then the
Applicable Earnout Amount shall be $24,000,000 (the Maximum Earnout Amount for
Level 1, calculated as $4,000,000 multiplied by 6.0).



Notwithstanding the foregoing illustrative examples, the Applicable Earnout
Amount shall not be less than $35,000,000.
