such party and each of the stockholders and warrantholders of the Company (i)

any Company Capital Stock shall have been lost, stolen or destroyed, the
Buyer shall cause to be issued in exchange for such lost, stolen or destroyed
certificates and for each such share, upon the making of an affidavit of that
fact by the holder thereof, the Applicable Per Share Merger Consideration or
the Applicable Portion of the Financing Payment Shares, as the case may be;
provided, however, that Buyer may, in its discretion and as a condition

Persons if other than the Company and its Subsidiaries to whom such insurance
policies have been issued, the expiration dates thereof, the annual premiums
and payment terms thereof, whether it is a "claims made" or an "occurrence"
policy and a brief identification of the nature of the policy) of all
liability, property, workers' compensation and other insurance policies
currently in effect that insure the property, assets or business of any of the
Company or its Subsidiaries or their respective employees (other than self-
obtained insurance policies by such employees). Each such insurance policy is
valid and binding and in full force and effect, all premiums due thereunder
have been paid and none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries have
received any notice of cancellation or termination in respect of any such
policy or default thereunder. The Company believes such insurance policies,
in light of the nature of the Company and its Subsidiaries' business, assets
and properties, are in amounts and have coverage that are reasonable and
customary for Persons engaged in such business and having such assets and
properties. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or to the
knowledge of the Company, the Person to whom such policy has been issued, has
received notice that any insurer under any policy referred to in this Section
4.18 is denying liability with respect to a claim thereunder or defending
under a reservation of rights clause. Except as set forth on Schedule 4.18,
within the last two (2) years none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
has filed for any claims exceeding $2,000,000 against any of its insurance
policies, exclusive of automobile and health insurance policies. None of the
Company or its Subsidiaries has received written notice from any of its
insurance carriers or brokers that any premiums will be materially increased
in the future, and does not have any reason to believe that any insurance
coverage listed on Schedule 4.18 will not be available in the future on
substantially the same terms as now in effect.

in any Action that involves a claim of infringement of any Intellectual
Property Rights, and the Company has no knowledge of any other claim of
infringement by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, and no knowledge of
any continuing infringement by any other Person of any Intellectual Property
Rights of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries.

  



  

(c) Neither the current use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any
of their Affiliates, of the Intellectual Property Rights infringes, nor
the use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, or any of their
Affiliates, of the Intellectual Property Rights after the Closing will
infringe, the rights of any other Person. Any Intellectual Property Rights
used by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries in the performance of any
services under any Contract is, and upon the performance of such Contract
remains, owned by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries and no client,
customer or other third-party has any claim of ownership on the Intellectual
Property Rights.

consultants or contractors who have contributed to or participated in the
creation or development of any copyrightable, patentable or trade secret
material on behalf of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any

agreement under which the Company or its Subsidiary is deemed to be the
original owner/author of all property rights therein; or (ii) has executed an
assignment or an agreement to assign in favor of the Company or its
Subsidiary (or such predecessor in interest, as applicable) all right,
title and interest in such material.

  



  

(e) None of the execution, delivery or performance by the Company of this
Agreement or any of the Additional Agreements to which the Company is a party
or the consummation by the Company of the transactions contemplated hereby or
thereby will cause any material item of Intellectual Property Rights owned,
licensed, used or held for use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries
immediately prior to the Closing to not be owned, licensed or available for
use by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries on substantially the same terms
and conditions immediately following the Closing.

safeguard and maintain the confidentiality and value of all trade secrets and
other items of Company Intellectual Property that are confidential and all
other confidential information, data and materials licensed by the Company or

Subsidiaries customers, which together with related revenue information for
the Company's December 31, 2012 and 2011 fiscal years, is attached hereto as
Schedule 4.22 and is true and complete. Except as indicated on Schedule 4.22,
none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has been notified, on a formal

terminate or materially modify the terms of its business relationship with,
or substantially reduce the fees and commissions it pays to the Company or any
of its Subsidiaries. To the Company's knowledge, there is no reason (other
than possible general economic or general industry conditions) why the
revenues with respect to such customers should not, for the foreseeable future
after the Closing, in the aggregate remain constant or increase from the
amounts shown on Schedule 4.22 or why the practices of the Company and its
Subsidiaries with respect to the billing of and collections from its
customers should not, for the foreseeable future after the Closing, be
able to be continued by the Company and its Subsidiaries on substantially the
same basis.

respect to such employees (except for those related to wages during the pay
period immediately prior to the Closing Date and arising in the ordinary
course of business), whether arising by operation of Law, by contract, by past
custom, or otherwise, for salaries and holiday pay, bonuses and other forms
of compensation payable to such employees in respect of the services
rendered by any of them prior to the date hereof have been or will be paid by
the Company and its Subsidiaries prior to the Closing Date.

  



  

4.28 _Employee Benefits and Compensation_.

  



  

(a) Schedule 4.28 sets forth a true and complete list of each "employee
benefit plan" (as defined in Section 3(3) of ERISA), bonus,
deferred compensation, equity-based or non-equity-based incentive, severance
or other plan or written agreement relating to employee or director benefits
or employee or director compensation or fringe benefits, maintained or
contributed to by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries at any time during
the 7-calendar year period immediately preceding the date hereof and/or with
respect to which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries could incur or could
have incurred any direct or indirect, fixed or contingent liability (each a
"Plan" and collectively, the "Plans"). Each Plan is and has been maintained in
substantial compliance with all applicable laws, including but not limited to
ERISA, and has been administered and operated in all material respects
in accordance with its terms.

(b) Each Plan which is intended to be "qualified" within the meaning of
Section 401(a) of the Code, has received a favorable determination letter
from the Internal Revenue Service and, to the knowledge of the Company, no
event has occurred and no condition exists which could reasonably be expected
to result in the revocation of any such determination. No event which
constitutes a "reportable event" (as defined in Section 4043(c) of ERISA) for
which the 30-day notice requirement has not been waived by the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (the "PBGC") has occurred with respect
to any Plan. No Plan subject to Title IV of ERISA has been terminated or is
or has been the subject of termination proceedings pursuant to Title IV of
ERISA. Full payment has been made of all amounts which the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries was required under the terms of the Plans to have paid as
contributions to such Plans on or prior to the date hereof (excluding any
amounts not yet due) and no Plan which is subject to Part 3 of Subtitle B of
Title I of ERISA has incurred an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the
meaning of Section 302 of ERISA or Section 412 of the Code), whether or not
waived.

  



  

(c) Neither the Company nor to the knowledge of the Company, any other
"disqualified person" or "party in interest" (as defined in Section
4975(e)(2) of the Code and Section 3(14) of ERISA, respectively), has engaged
in any transaction in connection with any Plan that could reasonably be
expected to result in the imposition of a penalty pursuant to Section 502(i)
of ERISA, damages pursuant to Section 409 of ERISA or a tax pursuant to
Section 4975(a) of the Code. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has maintained any Plan (other than a Plan which is intended to
be "qualified" within the meaning of Section 401(a) of the Code) which
provides benefits with respect to current or former employees or directors
following their termination of service with the Company (other than as
required pursuant to COBRA). Each Plan subject to the requirements of COBRA
has been operated in substantial compliance therewith.

  



  

(d) No individual will accrue or receive additional benefits, service or
accelerated rights to payment of benefits as a direct result of the
transaction contemplated by this Agreement. No material liability, claim,
investigation, audit, action or litigation has been incurred, made, commenced
or, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened, by or against any Plan or the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries with respect to any Plan (other than for
benefits payable in the ordinary course and PBGC insurance premiums). No Plan
or related trust owns any securities in violation of Section 407 of ERISA.
With respect to each Plan which is an "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA) as of the most recent actuarial valuation
report prepared for each such Plan, the aggregate present value of the
accrued liabilities thereof (determined in accordance with Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards No. 35) did not exceed the aggregate fair
market value of the assets allocable thereto.

  



  

(e) No Plan is a "multiemployer plan" (as defined in Section 4001(a)(3) of
ERISA) and the Company has not been obligated to contribute to any
multiemployer plan. No material liability has been, or could reasonably be
expected to be, incurred under Title IV of ERISA (other than for PBGC
insurance premiums payable in the ordinary course) or Section 412(f) or (n) of
the Code, by the Company or any entity required to be aggregated with the
Company pursuant to Section 4001(b) of ERISA and/or Section 414 (b), (c), (m)
or (o) of the Code with respect to any "employee pension benefit plan" (as
defined in Section 3(2) of ERISA).

  



  

   

33

--- 

   

  



  

(f) There is no unfunded non-tax-qualified Plan which provides a pension or
retirement benefit.

  



  

(g) Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries has made any commitment
to create or cause to exist any employee benefit plan which is not listed
on Schedule 4.28, or to modify, change or terminate any Plan (other than as
may be necessary for compliance with applicable law).

  



  

(h) Neither the Company nor any Subsidiary has any plan, arrangement or
agreement providing for "deferred compensation" that is subject to Section
409A(a) of the Code, or any plan, arrangement or agreement that is subject to
Section 409A(b) of the Code.

  



  

(i) With respect to each Plan, the Company has delivered or caused to be
delivered to Buyer and its counsel true and complete copies of the
following documents, as applicable, for each respective Plan -- (i) all Plan
documents, with all amendments thereto; (ii) the current summary plan
description with any applicable summaries of material modifications thereto as
well as any other material employee or government communications; (iii) all
current trust agreements and/or other documents establishing Plan funding
arrangements; (iv) the most recent U.S. Internal Revenue Service ("IRS")
determination letter and, if a request for such a letter has been filed and
is currently pending with the IRS, a copy of such filing; (v) the three most
recently prepared IRS Forms 5500; (vi) the three most recently prepared
financial statements; and (viii) all material related contracts, including
without limitation, insurance contracts, service provider agreements and
investment management and investment advisory agreements.

(a) Except for the Office Lease (a copy of which is attached as Schedule
4.29), none of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries owns, or otherwise has
an interest in, any Real Property, including under any Real Property lease,
sublease, space sharing, license or other occupancy agreement. Each of the
Company and its Subsidiaries has good, valid and subsisting title to its
respective leasehold estates in the offices described on Schedule 4.29, free
and clear of all Liens. None of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries has
breached or violated any local zoning ordinance, and no notice from any

of default by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries thereunder; and (vii)
there are no outstanding claims of breach or indemnification or notice of
default or termination thereunder. The Company holds the leasehold estate on
the Office Lease free and clear of all Liens, except for Liens of mortgagees
of the Real Property in which such leasehold estate is located. The Real
Property leased by the Company is in a state of maintenance and repair in
all material respects adequate and suitable for the purposes for which it is
presently being used, and there are no material repair or restoration works
likely to be required in connection with any of the leased Real Properties.
The Company is in physical possession and actual and exclusive occupation of
the whole of the leased property, none of which is subleased or assigned to
another Person. The Office Lease leases all useable square footage of the
premise located at the leased Real Property. The Company does not owe any

9.8 _Tender Offer_.

  



  

(a) Tender Offer. Within 30 days following the Closing Date, Buyer will
provide its stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of
Buyer Common Stock for cash equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the Trust Account, less taxes payable by Buyer,
upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
"Tender Offer"). Unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, Buyer shall use
its commercially reasonably best efforts (subject to market conditions) to
conduct the Tender Offer pursuant to Rule 13e-4 and Regulation 14E of the
Exchange Act (as modified, waived or otherwise agreed to with the SEC) which
regulates issuer tender offers and compliance with the requirement of Article
156 of its charter, and will file Tender Offer documents with the SEC. The
Tender Offer documents will comply as to form in all material respects with
the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder and in addition shall contain substantially the same
financial and other information about the transaction and the redemption
rights as is required under Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act
which regulates the solicitation of proxies. The obligation of Buyer to
accept for payment shares of Buyer Common Stock validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to the Tender Offer shall be subject to the
condition (the "Maximum Tender Condition") that no more than a number of
shares of the Buyer Common Stock equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the
IPO Shares (as defined in Buyer's amended and restated certificate of
incorporation and bylaws) shall have been validly tendered and not
validly withdrawn pursuant to and prior to the expiration of the Tender
Offer.

(b) Payment Obligations. If the payment to a registered holder under the
Tender Offer is to be made to a Person other than the Person in whose name
the surrendered certificate formerly evidencing Buyer Common Stock is
registered on the transfer books of the Company, it shall be a condition of
payment that the certificate so surrendered shall be endorsed properly or
otherwise be in proper form for transfer and that the Person requesting such
payment shall have paid all transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the
payment of such consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of
the certificate surrendered, or shall have established to the
reasonable satisfaction of Buyer that such Taxes either have been paid or are
not applicable.

  



  

(c) Tender Offer Documents. Buyer shall file with the SEC a Tender Offer
Statement on Schedule TO (together with all amendments and
supplements thereto, the "Schedule TO") with respect to the Tender Offer. The
Schedule TO shall contain or shall incorporate by reference an offer to
purchase (an "Offer to Purchase") and forms of the related letter of
transmittal and any related summary advertisement (such Schedule TO, Offer to
Purchase and such other documents, together with all supplements and
amendments thereto, being referred to herein collectively as the "Offer
Documents"). Each of Buyer and the Company agree to correct promptly any
information provided by it for use in the Offer Documents that shall have
become false or misleading in any material respect, and Buyer further agrees
to take all steps necessary to cause the Schedule TO, as so corrected, to be
filed with the SEC, and the other Offer Documents, as so corrected, to be
disseminated to holders of Buyer Common Stock, in each case as and to
the extent required by applicable federal securities laws. Buyer shall give
the Company and its counsel a reasonable opportunity to review and comment on
the Offer Documents prior to such documents being filed with the SEC or
disseminated to holders of the Buyer Common Stock. Buyer shall provide the
Company and its counsel with any comments that Buyer or its counsel may
receive from the SEC or its staff with respect to the Offer Documents
promptly after the receipt of such comments and shall provide the Company and
its counsel with a reasonable opportunity to participate in the response of
Buyer to such comments.

  



  

(d) Company Cooperation. The Company acknowledges that a substantial portion
of the filings with the SEC and mailings to Buyer's stockholders with respect
to the Tender Offer shall include disclosure regarding the Company and its
management, operations and financial condition. Accordingly, the Company
agrees to as promptly as reasonably practical provide Buyer with such
information as shall be reasonably requested by Buyer for inclusion in or
attachment to the Offer Documents to be filed and/or mailed as of and
following the commencement of the Tender Offer, that is accurate in all
material respects and complies as to form in all material respects with the
requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated
thereunder and in addition shall contain substantially the same financial and
other information about the Company and its Stockholders as is required under
Regulation 14A of the Exchange Act regulating the solicitation of proxies
even if such information is not required under the tender offer rules. The
Company understands that such information shall be included in the Offer
Documents and/or responses to comments from the SEC or its staff in
connection therewith and mailings. The Company shall make, and cause each
Subsidiary to make, their managers, directors, officers and
employees available to Buyer and its counsel in connection with the drafting
of such filings and mailings and responding in a timely manner to comments
from the SEC.

(e) Termination of Tender Offer. Buyer shall not terminate the Tender Offer
prior to date that the Tender Offer is scheduled to expire, as set forth in
the Schedule TO, without the prior consent of the Company except in the event
this Agreement is terminated pursuant to the terms hereof.

  



  

(f) Other Information. None of the information supplied or to be supplied by
the Company expressly for inclusion or incorporation by reference in
the filings with the SEC or the mailings to Buyer's stockholders as it
relates to the Tender Offer will, at the date of filing or mailing, or any
amendment thereto, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary in order to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they are made, not misleading (subject to the
qualifications and limitations set forth in the materials provided by the
Company and/or that is included in the SEC filings or mailings).

  



  

9.9 _Settlement of Buyer Liabilities_. Immediately following the Closing, the
Surviving Corporation shall

  



  

(a) settle and pay in full all outstanding material fixed and determinable
liabilities of Buyer, including, but not limited to, (i) all
outstanding loans made by the Sponsor to Buyer, provided any such loans
incurred after the date hereof must be approved in advance by the
Company, and (ii) all reasonable fees and expenses of service providers other

counsel and auditors; and

liabilities of the Buyer in excess of $250,000) (the "Post-closing Net Cash")
will be made available to the combined company in connection with the Closing,
which amount shall include any funds used to satisfy the Bridge Financing.
Except for the Bridge Financing, the Post-closing Net Cash may not be made
available through the issuance of debt or securities other than Buyer Common
Stock; provided that any issuance of such common stock must be at a price per
share no less than $8.00; provided further, however, that Selway Capital
Holdings LLC may arrange for one or more third parties to invest up to

or its designees may directly invest up to $2,000,000 at a price per share of
$5.00, which investments, if any, shall be included in the Post-closing Net
Cash. In the event Buyer is unable in good faith to enter into agreements to
provide $2,000,000 of Post-closing Net Cash at a per share price of no less
than $8.00, but has entered into agreements for $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 of
Post-closing Net Cash at $6.50 per share and $5.00 per share, respectively,
the Buyer may enter into agreements to provide for an additional $2,000,000
of Post-closing Net Cash at a per share price of not less than $5.00, which
the Company shall have the right to not accept and be able to terminate such
agreements at no cost to the Buyer, the Company or the Surviving Corporation;
and, if such agreements are entered into and presented to the Company, the
condition to Closing contained in this Section 10.3(d) shall be
deemed satisfied regardless of whether such Post-closing Net Cash is accepted
by the Company. Schedule 10.3(d) provides the capitalization of the Buyer
after the Merger, assuming that each of the notes issued in the Bridge
Financing is converted into Buyer Common Stock and the Post-closing Net Cash
consists of $2,000,000 of shares purchased at $8.00 per share, $2,000,000 of
shares purchased at $5.00 per share, and $1,000,000 of shares purchased at
$6.50 per share.

  



  



   

55 
--- 

 


--- 

   

  



  

(e) The Buyer shall have entered into agreements providing that no less than
a $4,000,000 credit facility will be available to the combined company in
connection with the Closing on terms and conditions usual and customary for a
transaction of this type and for a borrower of the Company's size and credit
quality, provided, however, that such agreements shall: (i) provide that the
credit facility shall have a term of not less than two (2) years; (ii) have
an interest rate of not more than eight percent (8%) per annum; and (iii) not
require guarantors other than the Company's Subsidiaries.

  



  

10.4 _Frustration of Closing Conditions_. None of the Company, Buyer or
Merger Sub may rely on the failure of any condition set forth in
Section 10.1, Section 10.2 or Section 10.3, as the case may be, to be
satisfied if such failure was caused by such party's failure to act in good
faith or use its reasonable best efforts to consummate the Merger and the
other transactions contemplated by this Agreement, as required by and subject
to Section 9.1.

  



  

10.5 _Waiver of Closing Conditions by Buyer_. For the sake of clarification,
it is hereby agreed that Buyer shall have the ability to waive, at Buyer's
sole and absolute discretion, any or all of the conditions set forth in
Section 10.2 of this Agreement, and have the Closing consummated provided the
conditions set forth in Sections 10.1 and 10.3 to this agreement are satisfied
or waived by the Company at the Company's sole and absolute discretion.

  



  

ARTICLE XI 
 INDEMNIFICATION

  



  

11.1 _Survival of Representations and Warranties_. All of the representations
and warranties of the Parties contained in this Agreement shall survive the
Closing hereunder and continue in full force and effect until a period of
twelve months from the Closing Date ("Survival Period").

  



  

11.2 _Indemnification Provisions for Benefit of Buyer_. If the Company
(including, without limitation, PCA) violates, misrepresents or breaches
(or in the event any third party alleges facts that would represent a Company
violation, misrepresentation or breach) any of its
representations, warranties, and covenants contained herein and if Buyer
makes a written claim for indemnification with respect thereto within
the Survival Period, then the Stockholders shall indemnify Buyer from and
against any and all out-of-pocket losses, costs, payments, demands,
penalties, forfeitures, expenses, liabilities, judgments, deficiencies or
damages, and diminution in value or claims (including actual costs of
investigation and reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs and expenses)
(all of the foregoing collectively, "Adverse Consequences") up to 10% of the
Closing Payment that Buyer has suffered or may suffer (including any
Adverse Consequences Buyer or the Company may suffer after the end of the
Survival Period) resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature
of, or caused by such violation, misrepresentation or breach. Any liability
incurred by the Stockholders pursuant to the terms of this Article XI shall
be paid solely by the return for cancellation of the Escrow Securities in
accordance with Section 11.6 hereof. The foregoing shall be the sole remedy
of Buyer in respect of any claims for indemnification by Buyer with respect
to misrepresentations of the Company, but shall not limit any remedies Buyer
may have in the case of fraud. All determinations relating to the submission
of claims for the benefit of Buyer hereunder shall be determined, in good
faith, solely by the nominees of Buyer to the Board of Directors or by the
Buyer's Representative. The foregoing provisions are subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 11.8.

  



  



   

56

11.3 _Indemnification Provisions for the Benefit of the Stockholders_. If
Buyer violates, misrepresents or breaches (or in the event any third
party alleges facts that would represent a Buyer violation, misrepresentation
or breach) any of its representations, warranties, and covenants contained
herein and if the Stockholders' Representative makes a written claim for
indemnification with respect thereto within the Survival Period, then Buyer
agrees to indemnify the Stockholders from and against the entirety of any
Adverse Consequences up to an amount equal to 10% of the Closing Payment that
the Stockholders have suffered or may suffer (including any Adverse
Consequences the Stockholders may suffer after the end of the Survival Period)
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
such violation, misrepresentation or breach. Any liability incurred by Buyer
pursuant to the terms of this Article XI shall be paid in cash. The foregoing
shall be the sole remedy of the Stockholders in respect of any claims for
indemnification by the Stockholders with respect to misrepresentations of the
Buyer, but shall not limit any remedies the Stockholders may have in the case
of fraud. All determinations relating to the submission of claims for the
benefit of the Stockholders hereunder shall be determined, in good faith,
solely by the Stockholders' Representative. The foregoing provisions are
subject to the limitations set forth in Section 11.8.

  



  

11.4 _Matters Involving Third Parties_.

  



  

(a) If any third party shall notify any indemnified party (the "Indemnified
Party") with respect to any matter (a "Third Party Claim") which may give
rise to a claim for indemnification against any other party (the "Indemnifying
Party") under this Article XI, then the Indemnified Party shall promptly (and
in any event within ten (10) business days after receiving notice of the
Third Party Claim) notify each Indemnifying Party and the Escrow Agent thereof
in writing (an "Indemnification Notice"); provided, however, that no delay on
the part of the Indemnified Party in notifying any Indemnifying Party
shall relieve the Indemnifying Party from any obligation hereunder unless
(and then solely to the extent) the Indemnifying Party thereby is prejudiced.

  



  

   

57 
--- 

 


--- 

   



  



  

(b) Any Indemnifying Party will have the right, at its sole cost and expense,
to defend the Indemnified Party against the Third Party Claim with counsel of
its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party so long as (i) the
Indemnifying Party notifies the Indemnified Party in writing within thirty
(30) business days (or earlier in the event the underlying Third Party claim
requires action) after the Indemnified Party has given notice of the Third
Party Claim that the Indemnifying Party will indemnify the Indemnified Party
from and against the entirety of any Adverse Consequences (subject to the
limitations contained herein) the Indemnified Party may suffer resulting
from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by the Third
Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnifying Party provides the Indemnified Party with
evidence reasonably acceptable to the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying
Party will have the financial resources to defend against the Third Party
Claim and fulfill its indemnification obligations hereunder, (iii) the Third
Party Claim involves only money damages and does not seek an injunction or
other equitable relief, (iv) settlement of, or an adverse judgment with
respect to, the Third Party Claim is not, in the good faith judgment of the
Indemnified Party, likely to establish a precedent or practice materially
adverse to the continuing business interests of the Indemnified Party, and
(v) the Indemnifying Party conducts the defense of the Third Party Claim
actively and diligently.

  



  

(c) So long as the Indemnifying Party is conducting the defense of the Third
Party Claim in accordance with Section 11.4(b) above, (i) the
Indemnified Party may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense
and participate in the defense of the Third Party Claim, (ii) the Indemnified
Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any
settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior written
consent of the Indemnifying Party (not to be withheld unreasonably) and (iii)
the Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any judgment or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third Party Claim without the prior
written consent of the Indemnified Party (not to be withheld unreasonably).

  



  

(d) In the event that any of the conditions in Section 11.4(b) above fail to
be complied with, however, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend against, and
consent to the entry of any judgment or enter into any settlement with respect
to, the Third Party Claim in any manner it reasonably may deem appropriate
(and the Indemnified Party need not consult with, or obtain any consent from,
any Indemnifying Party in connection therewith), (ii) the Indemnifying
Parties will reimburse the Indemnified Party promptly and periodically for the
costs of defending against the Third Party Claim (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), and (iii) the Indemnifying Parties will remain
responsible for any Adverse Consequences the Indemnified Party may suffer
resulting from, arising out of, relating to, in the nature of, or caused by
the Third Party Claim to the fullest extent provided in this Article XI.

  



  

(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Article XI,
the Party conducting the defense of any Third Party Claim shall not
settle and pay any Third Party Claim unless and until the other Party shall
have consented thereto, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed.

  



  

11.5 _Determination of Adverse Consequences_. In the event that Buyer has
made a claim for indemnification prior to the termination of the
Survival Period, no Escrow Securities held in escrow pursuant to this Article
XI and the Closing Payment Escrow Agreement shall be released until such time
as the claim has been resolved unless the Survival Period shall have expired
after the making of such claim but before such claim is fully resolved, in
which case the Escrow Securities in excess of the amount of the claimed
Adverse Consequence shall be released from the Escrow Fund.

11.6 _Escrow of Closing Payment by Stockholders_. The Company and the
Stockholders hereby authorize Buyer to withhold, from the delivery of the
Closing Payment Shares otherwise deliverable to the Stockholders as part of
the Merger Consideration, for delivery into escrow, pursuant to an escrow
agreement (the "Closing Payment Escrow Agreement") by and among the Buyer,
Company, each Stockholder and Escrow Agent, shares of Buyer Common Stock
representing 10% of the aggregate amount of the Closing Payment Shares (the
"Escrow Shares"), which for purposes of this Article XI shall be valued at
$10 per share, plus 10% of the amount of the Closing Payment Notes (the
"Escrow Notes", and together with the Escrow Shares the "Escrow Securities"),
to be allocated among the Stockholders in accordance with the relative
proportions of the Closing Payment to which they are entitled. For
purposes of this Article XI such notes shall be valued at face value.

  



  

(a) Escrow Securities. The Escrow Securities shall be withheld from delivery
to the Stockholders and segregated from securities issuable to them at
Closing and placed in escrow pursuant to the terms of the Closing Payment
Escrow Agreement. The Escrow Securities shall be registered in the name of
each Stockholder, pro-rated among all of the Stockholders in proportion to the
Closing Payment to which they are entitled, and shall be held by American
Stock Transfer and Trust Company, LLC (the "Escrow Agent"), and shall constitute
the escrow fund (the "Escrow Fund") governed by the terms of the Closing
Payment Escrow Agreement. Once released from the Escrow Fund, shares of Buyer
Common Stock shall cease to be Escrow Securities.

  



  

(b) Payment of Dividends; Voting. Any dividends, interest payments, or other
distributions of any kind made in respect of the Escrow Securities will be
delivered promptly to the Escrow Agent as part of the Escrow Fund. The
Stockholders shall be entitled to vote the Escrow Shares on any matters to
come before the stockholders of Buyer, with each Stockholder being entitled to
direct the voting of the Escrow Shares allocated to such Stockholder.

  



  

(c) Distribution of Escrow Securities. At the times provided for in Section
11.6(e), the Escrow Securities shall be released to the Stockholders in
proportion to the number allocated to them. Buyer will take such action as may
be necessary to cause such certificates and notes to be issued in the names
of the appropriate persons. Certificates and notes representing Escrow
Securities so issued that are subject to resale restrictions under applicable
securities laws will bear a legend to that effect. No fractional shares shall
be released and delivered from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders and all
fractional shares shall be rounded to the nearest whole share.

  



  

(d) Assignability. No Escrow Securities or any beneficial interest therein
may be pledged, sold, assigned or transferred, including by operation of law,
by any Stockholders or be taken or reached by any legal or equitable process
in satisfaction of any debt or other liability of any such stockholder, prior
to the delivery to such Stockholders of its or his pro rata portion of the
Escrow Fund by the Escrow Agent as provided herein.

  



  

   

59 
--- 

 


--- 

   

  



  

(e) Release from Escrow Fund. Within five (5) business days following
expiration of the Survival Period (the "Release Date"), the Escrow Securities
will be released from the Escrow Fund to the Stockholders less the number or
amount of Escrow Securities (at an assumed value of $10.00 per Escrow Share
and at the face value per Escrow Note, but pro rata based on the relative
aggregate values of the Escrow Securities) equal to the amount of Adverse
Consequences set forth in any Indemnification Notice from Buyer with
respect to any pending but unresolved claim for indemnification. Prior to the
Release Date, the Buyer's Representative and the Stockholders' Representative
shall issue to the Escrow Agent a certificate executed by each of them
instructing the Escrow Agent to release such number of Escrow Securities
determined in accordance with this Section 11.6(e). Any Escrow Securities
retained in the Escrow Fund as a result of the immediately preceding sentence
shall be released to the Stockholders or Buyer, as appropriate, promptly
upon resolution of the related claim for indemnification in accordance with
the provisions of this Article XI.

  



  

(f) Buyer's Representative.

  



  

(i) Edmundo Gonzalez is hereby constituted and appointed jointly as Buyer's
Representative for and on behalf of Buyer to give and receive notices and
communications, to negotiate, enter into settlements and compromises of, and
comply with orders of courts with respect to such claims (including Third
Party Claims), and to take all actions necessary or appropriate in the
judgment of Buyer's Representative for the accomplishment of the foregoing.
Such agency may be changed from time to time upon not less than ten
(10) days' prior written notice, executed by the Buyer nominee on the Company
Board, to the Buyer's Representative. No bond shall be required of Buyer's
Representative, and Buyer's Representative shall receive no compensation for
his services. Notices or communications to or from Buyer's Representative
shall constitute notice to or from Buyer.

  



  

(ii) Buyer's Representative shall not be liable for any act done or omitted
hereunder while acting in good faith and any act done or omitted pursuant to
the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of such good faith. The
Surviving Corporation shall indemnify Buyer's Representative and hold him
harmless against any loss, liability, or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of Buyer's Representative and arising out
of or in connection with the acceptance or administration of his
duties hereunder.

  



  

(iii) A decision, act, consent or instruction of Buyer's Representative shall
constitute a decision of Buyer under this Article XI and shall be final,
binding, and conclusive upon Buyer. The Stockholders' Representative and the
Stockholders may rely upon any decision, act, consent, or instruction of
Buyer's Representative as being the decision, act, consent or instruction
of Buyer. Buyer's Representative shall have the right to consent to the use
of the Escrow Securities to settle any claim for which Buyer is entitled to
indemnification under this Article XI.

11.7 _Determination/Resolution of Claims_.

  



  

(a) If an Indemnified Party wishes to make a claim for indemnification
against an Indemnifying Party, such Indemnified Party shall deliver the
Indemnification Notice to the Indemnifying Party and to the Escrow Agent on
or before the expiration of the Survival Period. Such Indemnification Notice
shall contain the amount of Adverse Consequences for which the Indemnified
Party is seeking indemnification and shall set forth the reasons therefore in
reasonable detail.

  



  

(b) If Buyer asserts a claim upon the Escrow Fund by delivering an
Indemnification Notice to the Stockholders' Representative and the Escrow
Agent on or before the end of the Survival Period, the Escrow Agent shall
retain in the Escrow Fund such number or amount of Escrow Securities (at an
assumed value of $10.00 per Escrow Share and at the face value per Escrow
Note, but pro rata based on the relative aggregate values of the Escrow
Securities) until the resolution of such claim.

  



  

(c) Unless the Stockholders' Representative shall notify Buyer in writing
within thirty (30) days after receipt of an Indemnification Notice that the
Stockholders' Representative objects to any claim for indemnification set
forth therein, which notice shall include a reasonable explanation of the
basis of such objection, then such indemnification claim shall be deemed to be
accepted by the Stockholders' Representative and the parties shall issue to
the Escrow Agent a certificate executed by the Buyer's Representative and the
Stockholders' Representative indicating what number or amount of Escrow
Securities are to be released to Buyer. If the Stockholders'
Representative shall timely notify Buyer in writing that it objects to any
claim for indemnification made in such an Indemnification Notice, Buyer shall
have fifteen (15) days from receipt of such notice to respond with a written
statement to such objection. If after thirty (30) days following receipt of
Buyer's written statement, there remains a dispute as to any indemnification
claims set forth in the Indemnification Notice, the Stockholders'
Representative and Buyer's Representative shall attempt in good faith for
sixty (60) days to agree upon the rights of the respective parties with
respect to each of such claims. If the Stockholders' Representative and
Buyer's Representative should so agree, a memorandum setting forth such
agreement shall be prepared and signed by both parties. Based upon the
memorandum, the parties shall issue to the Escrow Agent a certificate executed
by Buyer's Representative and the Stockholders' Representative indicating
what number or amount of Escrow Securities are to be released to Buyer. The
Escrow Agent shall be entitled to rely on any such certificate and disburse
Escrow Securities from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms thereof.

  



  

(d) If the Stockholders' Representative and the Buyer's Representative cannot
resolve a dispute during the sixty-day period (or such longer period as the
parties may agree to in writing), then such dispute shall be submitted (and
either party may submit such dispute) for arbitration in accordance with
Article XII.

  



  

11.8 _Indemnification Threshold_. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, no Person or party shall have any obligation to
indemnify Buyer or Stockholders, as the case may be, from and against any
Adverse Consequences caused proximately by the breach of any
representation or warranty of Buyer or Company hereunder (but not any other
breach or violation), as the case may be, until Buyer or Company, as the case
may be, has suffered Adverse Consequences by reason of all such breaches (or
alleged breaches) in excess of $500,000 in the aggregate, after which the
Indemnified Party shall be entitled to indemnification without regard to such
threshold.

  



  



   

61 
--- 

 


--- 

   

  



  

11.9 _Other Indemnification Provisions_. No recovery for indemnification
shall include recovery for special, incidental, punitive or consequential
damages. All claims for indemnification shall not be subject to reduction or
offset for any tax benefits associated with or insurance proceeds applicable
to the claim. All payments under this Article XI shall be treated as an
adjustment to the consideration provided in the Merger.

Arbitrator's decision, unless the Arbitrator shall otherwise allocate such
costs in such decision. The determination of the Arbitrator shall be final and
binding upon the parties and not subject to appeal.

  



  

(h) Any judgment upon any award rendered by the Arbitrator may be entered in
and enforced by any court of competent jurisdiction. The parties
expressly consent to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the courts (Federal
and state) in New York, New York to enforce any award of the Arbitrator or to
render any provisional, temporary, or injunctive relief in connection with or
in aid of the arbitration. The parties expressly consent to the personal and
subject matter jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to arbitrate any and all matters
to be submitted to arbitration hereunder. None of the parties hereto shall
challenge any arbitration hereunder on the grounds that any party necessary to
such arbitration (including the parties hereto) shall have been absent from
such arbitration for any reason, including that such party shall have been
the subject of any bankruptcy, reorganization, or insolvency proceeding.

  



  

(i) The parties shall indemnify the Arbitrator and any experts employed by

ARTICLE XIII 
 TERMINATION

  



  

13.1 _Termination Without Default_. In the event that (i) the Closing of the
transactions contemplated hereunder has not occurred by March 8, 2013 (the
"Outside Closing Date"), or (ii) the Buyer has not satisfied the condition
specified in Section 10.3(e) by February 28, 2013, and, in either case, no
material breach of this Agreement by Buyer, on one hand, or the Company, on
the other hand, seeking to terminate this Agreement shall have occurred or
have been made (as provided in Section 13.2 hereof), Buyer or the Company
shall have the right, at its sole option, to terminate this Agreement without
liability to the other side. Such right may be exercised by Buyer or the
Company, as the case may be, giving written notice to the other at any time
after the Outside Closing Date. In the event this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this Section 13.1, each party shall bear its own expenses
incurred in connection with this Agreement.

  



  

13.2 _Termination by the Buyer_. After February 28, 2013, in the event that
the Company has not provided the audited Financial Statements or if the
Financial Statements indicate that: (a) the Company had revenue (calculated in
accordance with U.S. GAAP) of less than $32,555,000 for the year ended
December 31, 2012; or (b) the Company had Adjusted EBITDA of less than
negative 7% of revenue (calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP) for the year
ended December 31, 2012, then the Buyer may terminate this Agreement on three
(3) Business Days prior written notice to the Company. "Adjusted EBITDA"
means, with respect to any applicable period, the Company's earnings before
interest, taxes depreciation and amortization (each of which is determined in
accordance with U.S. GAAP consistently applied in accordance with the
Company's accounting policies and practices), plus all expenses incurred by
the Company in connection with the Bridge Financing and the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, plus any charges required by U.S. GAAP due to
the consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Bridge Financing and
this Agreement (including charges relating to the issuance of securities
pursuant to the Bridge Financing or this Agreement). In the event this
Agreement is terminated by Buyer pursuant to this Section 13.2, the Company

incurred in connection with this Agreement.

13.3 _Termination by the Company_. The Company may terminate this Agreement
on three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Buyer in the event
that prior to the time, but not after, the Stockholder Approval is obtained,
there is a Change of Recommendation. The Buyer may terminate this Agreement
on three (3) Business Days prior written notice to the Company in the event
that (i) approval by the Company Board of this Agreement is not in effect,
(ii) the audited Financial Statements of the Company are not delivered to
the Buyer by March 31, 2013, or (iii) a lawsuit is initiated or a court order
is obtained against the Company that prevents or would delay the closing of
the Merger to later than March 31, 2013, provided that such lawsuit or court
order is not initiated or obtained due to the actions, structure or
agreements of or entered into by the Buyer. If this Agreement is terminated
pursuant to this Section 13.3, the Company shall deliver to the Buyer,
concurrently with (if terminated by the Company) or promptly after (if
terminated by the Buyer) termination, warrants (the "Break-up Warrants") to
purchase an aggregate of 4.9% of the issued and outstanding shares of common
stock of the Company as of the date of such termination at an exercise price
of $1.00 per share, which warrants shall have substantially the same terms as
the Customer Incentive Warrants other than the exercise price per share. In
the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 13.3, the
Company shall bear the reasonable expenses incurred by the Buyer in
connection with this Agreement. If, for any reason, the Stockholder Approval
is not obtained by February 28, 2013, then the Company shall immediately
issue the Break-up Warrants to the Buyer regardless of whether or not this
Agreement has been terminated. For clarity, if the Stockholder Approval is
obtained, this Agreement may not be terminated by the Company other than
pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.4.

  



  

13.4 _Termination Upon Default_.

  



  

(a) Buyer may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to the Company on or
prior to the Closing Date, without prejudice to any rights or
obligations Buyer may have, if the Company shall have materially breached any
representation or warranty or breached any agreement or covenant contained
herein or in any Additional Agreement to be performed on or prior to the

Closing Date and ten (10) days following receipt by the Company of a notice
describing in reasonable detail the nature of such breach.

  



  

(b) The Company may terminate this Agreement by giving notice to Buyer,
without prejudice to any rights or obligations the Company or the Company
may have, if Buyer shall have materially breached any of its covenants,
agreements, representations, and warranties contained herein to be performed
on or prior to the Closing Date and such breach shall not be cured by the
earlier of the Outside Closing Date and ten (10) days following receipt by
Buyer of a notice describing in reasonable detail the nature of such breach.

  



  

(c) In the event this Agreement is terminated pursuant to this Section 13.4,
each party shall be responsible for paying its own expenses incurred in
connection with this Agreement; provided that the foregoing shall not prohibit
any party from pursuing any other remedy that is available to it hereunder.

14.2 _Amendments; No Waivers; Remedies_.

  



  

(a) This Agreement cannot be amended, except by a writing signed by each
party, and cannot be terminated orally or by course of conduct. No
provision hereof can be waived, except by a writing signed by the party
against whom such waiver is to be enforced, and any such waiver shall apply
only in the particular instance in which such waiver shall have been given.

  



  

(b) Neither any failure or delay in exercising any right or remedy hereunder
or in requiring satisfaction of any condition herein nor any course of
dealing shall constitute a waiver of or prevent any party from enforcing any
right or remedy or from requiring satisfaction of any condition. No notice to
or demand on a party waives or otherwise affects any obligation of that party
or impairs any right of the party giving such notice or making such demand,
including any right to take any action without notice or demand not otherwise
required by this Agreement. No exercise of any right or remedy with respect
to a breach of this Agreement shall preclude exercise of any other right or
remedy, as appropriate to make the aggrieved party whole with respect to such
breach, or subsequent exercise of any right or remedy with respect to any
other breach.

  



  

(c) Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no statement herein of any
right or remedy shall impair any other right or remedy stated herein or
that otherwise may be available.

  



  

(d) Notwithstanding anything else contained herein, neither shall any party
seek, nor shall any party be liable for, punitive or exemplary damages, under
any tort, contract, equity, or other legal theory, with respect to any breach
(or alleged breach) of this Agreement or any provision hereof or any matter
otherwise relating hereto or arising in connection herewith.

  



  

14.3 _Arm 's length bargaining; no presumption against drafter_. This
Agreement has been negotiated at arm's-length by parties of equal bargaining
strength, each represented by counsel or having had but declined the
opportunity to be represented by counsel and having participated in the
drafting of this Agreement. This Agreement creates no fiduciary or other
special relationship between the parties, and no such relationship otherwise
exists. No presumption in favor of or against any party in the construction or
interpretation of this Agreement or any provision hereof shall be made based
upon which Person might have drafted this Agreement or such provision.

  



  

14.4 _Publicity_. Except as required by law, the parties agree that neither
they nor their agents shall issue any press release or make any other public
disclosure concerning the transactions contemplated hereunder without the
prior approval of the other party hereto.

and expenses incurred in connection with this Agreement and the

14.6 _No Assignment or Delegation_. No party may assign any right or delegate
any obligation hereunder, including by merger, consolidation, operation of

purported assignment or delegation without such consent shall be void, in
addition to constituting a material breach of this Agreement.

  



  

14.7 _Governing Law_. This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with
and governed by the laws of the State of New York, without giving effect to
the conflict of laws principles thereof (other than sections 5-1401 and 5-1402
of the New York General Obligations law, which shall apply to this
Agreement).

  



  

14.8 _Counterparts; facsimile signatures_. This Agreement may be executed in
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which
shall constitute one agreement. This Agreement shall become effective upon
delivery to each party of an executed counterpart or the earlier delivery to
each party of original, photocopied, or electronically transmitted signature
pages that together (but need not individually) bear the signatures of all
other parties.

  



  

14.9 _Entire Agreement_. This Agreement together with the Additional
Agreements, sets forth the entire agreement of the parties with respect to the
subject matter hereof and thereof and supersedes all prior and
contemporaneous understandings and agreements related thereto (whether
written or oral), all of which are merged herein. No provision of this
Agreement or any Additional Agreement may be explained or qualified by any
agreement, negotiations, understanding, discussion, conduct or course of
conduct or by any trade usage. Except as otherwise expressly stated herein or
any Additional Agreement, there is no condition precedent to the effectiveness
of any provision hereof or thereof. No party has relied on any representation
from, or warranty or agreement of, any person in entering into this
Agreement, prior hereto or contemporaneous herewith or any Additional
Agreement, except those expressly stated herein or therein.

  



  

14.10 _Severability_. A determination by a court or other legal authority
that any provision that is not of the essence of this Agreement is
legally invalid shall not affect the validity or enforceability of any other
provision hereof. The parties shall cooperate in good faith to substitute (or
cause such court or other legal authority to substitute) for any provision so
held to be invalid a valid provision, as alike in substance to such invalid
provision as is lawful.

otherwise modified from time to time. Any reference to a numbered schedule
means the same-numbered section of the disclosure schedule.

  



  

(e) If any action is required to be taken or notice is required to be given
within a specified number of days following a specific date or event, the day
of such date or event is not counted in determining the last day for such
action or notice. If any action is required to be taken or notice is required
to be given on or before a particular day which is not a Business Day, such
action or notice shall be considered timely if it is taken or given on or
before the next Business Day.

hereof confers any benefit or right upon or may be enforced by any Person not
a signatory hereto, except that a Stockholders' Representative pursuant to
Section 14.14 may enforce any right assigned to such assignee.

  



  

14.14 _Stockholders ' Representative._

  



  

(a) After the approval by a majority of the Stockholders of this Agreement,
Gary Sekulski, as Stockholders' Representative, shall have exclusive power
and authority on behalf of the Stockholders and, prior to the Effective Time
on behalf of the Company, with respect to any action taken pursuant to this
Agreement (including with respect to waivers and adjustments to, receipt of,
and distribution of, the aggregate Applicable Per Share Merger
Consideration).

  



  

(b) The Stockholders' Representative shall not (i) be liable to the holders
of Company Capital Stock for any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it
or any agent employed by it under or in connection with this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby, or (ii) owe any fiduciary duty or have any
fiduciary responsibility to any of the holders of Company Capital Stock or the
Company as a result of actions taken as the Stockholders' Representative
pursuant to this Agreement, except for such actions taken or omitted to be
taken resulting from the Stockholders' Representative's gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct. Provided that all payments and distributions
made by or at the direction of the Stockholders' Representative hereunder to
the holders of Company Capital Stock are made based on the good faith
determination of each such holder's respective Applicable Portion, the
Stockholders' Representative shall not be liable to any holder of Company
Capital Stock if the apportionment with respect to such payment or
distribution is subsequently determined to have been made in error, and the
sole recourse of any holder of Company Capital Stock to whom such payment or
distribution was due, but not made, shall be to recover from other holders of
Company Capital Stock any payment in excess of the amount to which they are
determined to have been entitled pursuant to this Agreement.

Stockholders' Representative under this Agreement or in connection with any
of the transactions contemplated hereby, such out-of-pocket expenses shall be
paid from, or reimbursed through deduction from any amounts received by the
Stockholders' Representative that would otherwise be distributable to holders
of Company Capital Stock in accordance with their respective Applicable
Portions.

  



  

(d) Buyer and the Surviving Corporation shall have the right to rely upon all
actions taken or omitted to be taken by the Stockholders'
Representative pursuant to this Agreement, all of which actions or omissions
shall be legally binding upon the Stockholders.

  



  

(e) The grant of authority provided for herein (i) is coupled with an
interest and shall be irrevocable and survive the death, incompetency,
bankruptcy or liquidation of any Stockholder and (ii) shall survive the
consummation of the Merger, and any action taken by the
Stockholders' Representative pursuant to the authority granted in this
Agreement shall be effective and absolutely binding on each
Stockholder notwithstanding any contrary action of or direction from such
Stockholder, except for actions or omissions of the
Stockholders' Representative constituting gross negligence, bad faith or
willful misconduct.

  



  

14.15 _Waiver_. Reference is made to the final prospectus of Buyer, dated
November 7, 2011 (the "Prospectus"). The Company and the Stockholders'
Representative have read the Prospectus and understand that Buyer has
established the Trust Account for the benefit of the public stockholders of
Buyer and the underwriters of the IPO pursuant to the Trust Agreement and
that, except for a portion of the interest earned on the amounts held in the
Trust Account, Buyer may disburse monies from the Trust Account only for the
purposes set forth in the Trust Agreement. For and in consideration of Buyer
agreeing to enter into this Agreement with the Company, the Stockholders'
Representative and the Company each hereby agrees that it does not have any
right, title, interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies in the Trust
Account and hereby agrees that it will not seek recourse against the Trust
Account for any claim it may have in the future as a result of, or arising out
of, any negotiations, contracts or agreements with Buyer.

  



  

14.16 _Specific Performance_. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that
the rights of each party to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby
are unique and recognize and affirm that in the event of a breach of this
Agreement prior to the Closing by any party, money damages shall be
inadequate and the non-breaching party shall have no adequate remedy at law.
Accordingly, the parties agree that such non-breaching party shall have the
right, in addition to any other rights and remedies existing in their favor
at law or in equity, to enforce their rights and the other party's obligations
hereunder not only by an action or actions for damages but also by an action
or actions for specific performance, injunctive and/or other equitable relief
(without posting of bond or other security), and the parties hereto will
waive, in any action for specific performance, injunctive and/or
other equitable relief, the defense of adequacy of a remedy at law.

shall not prevent Loeb and Loeb LLP from representing the Stockholders'

involving this Agreement, including any disputes between any of the parties
