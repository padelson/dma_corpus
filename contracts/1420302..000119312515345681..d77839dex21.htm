5 STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT

 

This STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is made as of October 8,
2015, by and among LogMeIn, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Buyer"), Marvasol,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (d/b/a LastPass) (the "Company"), the persons set
forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto (collectively, the "Stockholders") and Joseph
Siegrist in his capacity as representative of the Stockholders (the
"Representative"). Capitalized terms used and not otherwise defined herein
have the meanings set forth in ARTICLE XII below.

 

WHEREAS, the Stockholders own all of the issued and outstanding securities in
the Company, which consist entirely of shares of Common Stock (collectively,
the "Shares");

WHEREAS, subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, Buyer
desires to acquire from the Stockholders, and the Stockholders desire to sell
to Buyer, all of the Shares for the consideration described herein; and

 

WHEREAS, Buyer, the Company and the Stockholders desire to make certain
representations, warranties, covenants and agreements in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement and also prescribe various
conditions to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

 

AGREEMENT

NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises, representations and
warranties and mutual covenants contained herein and of other good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby
acknowledged, the Parties hereto, intending to be legally bound hereby, agree
as follows:

ARTICLE I

 

STOCK PURCHASE

 

Section 1.1 Purchase and Sale of Shares. Subject to the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement, each Stockholder agrees to sell to Buyer, and
Buyer agrees to purchase from each Stockholder, at the Closing, all of the
Shares set forth next to such Stockholders name on _Exhibit A_, which,
collectively, constitute 100% of the outstanding equity interests in the
Company, free and clear of any Security Interest, in exchange for the payment
of the Stockholders Pro Rata Basis of (i) the Initial Purchase Price and (ii)
any Contingent Purchase Price payable pursuant to Section 1.4. 

Section 1.2 Payment of Purchase Price. The purchase price to be paid by Buyer
for the Shares (the "Purchase Price") shall be paid as provided in this
Section 1.2:

(a) At the Closing, Buyer shall pay, to the Stockholders by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to an account or accounts designated in writing by
the Stockholders at least three (3) Business Days prior to the Closing, an
aggregate amount equal to: (i) $110,000,000 (the "Base Purchase Price"),
_plus_ (ii) the amount, if any, by which the Estimated Net Working Capital
exceeds the Working Capital Target, _minus_ (iii) the General Escrow Amount,
_and minus_ (iv) the Special Escrow Amount,  _and minus_ (v) the amount, if
any, by which the Working Capital Target exceeds the Estimated Net Working
Capital.

 



1 (b) At the Closing, Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Escrow
Agent, by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account
designated in writing by the Escrow Agent, the General Escrow Amount and the
Special Escrow Amount, to hold in accordance with the terms of the Escrow
Agreement.

 

(c) Following the Closing, Buyer shall pay all or such portion of the
Contingent Purchase Price due and payable in accordance with the provisions
of Section 1.4.

Section 1.3 Purchase Price Adjustment.

 

(a) _Estimated Net Working Capital_. No later than three (3) Business Days
prior to the Closing, the Company shall deliver to Buyer a reasonably
detailed statement (the "Preliminary Statement") setting forth, along with the
related calculations (and including each line item of Current Assets and
Current Liabilities as is set forth on the Reference Statement, including,
for the avoidance of doubt, each line item of Unpaid Company Transaction
Expenses), the Companys good faith estimate of Closing Net Working Capital
(such estimate, the "Estimated Net Working Capital"). The Estimated Net
Working Capital amount set forth on the Preliminary Statement shall be
conclusive for the purposes of calculating the Purchase Price, but the Final
Net Working Capital and any resulting adjustment to the Purchase Price
contemplated by Section 1.3(c) shall be determined in accordance with the
provisions of Section 1.3(b). The Preliminary Statement and the determinations
and calculations contained therein shall be prepared in accordance with this
Agreement, including Section 1.3(d).

(b) _Final Net Working Capital_.

 

(i) Within seventy-five (75) calendar days after the Closing Date, Buyer shall
prepare and deliver to the Representative a reasonably detailed statement
(the "Closing Statement") setting forth, along with the related calculations,
Buyers good faith determination of the actual amount of Closing Net Working
Capital, together with copies of such documentation used in the calculations
thereof as may be reasonably requested by the Representative to allow the
Representative and its advisors to review such calculations and the related
adjustments to the Purchase Price contemplated by Section 1.3(c). The Closing
Statement and the determinations and calculations contained therein shall be
prepared in accordance with this Agreement, including Section 1.3(d).

 

(ii) Within twenty (20) calendar days following receipt by the Representative
of the Closing Statement, the Representative shall deliver written notice (an
"Objection Notice") to Buyer of all disputes, if any, the Representative may
have with respect to the preparation of the Closing Statement, which Objection
Notice shall specify those amounts, determinations or calculations set forth
in the Closing Statement that the Representative disputes and shall set forth
the Representatives proposed adjustment to each such disputed amount,
determination or calculation. If the 

 



2  Representative does not timely deliver an Objection Notice with respect to
the Closing Statement within such twenty (20) calendar day period, the Closing
Statement (including each amount, determination and calculation contained
therein) will be deemed to be final, conclusive and binding on the parties. If
an Objection Notice is timely delivered within such twenty (20) calendar day
period, Buyer and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable
efforts to resolve each dispute raised therein (each, an "Objection"). All
Objections that are so resolved in writing between the parties shall be final,
conclusive and binding on the parties.

 

(iii) The parties hereto agree that:

 

(A) If Buyer and the Representative fail to resolve any Objections within
twenty (20) calendar days after the Representative delivers an Objection
Notice, then Buyer and the Representative shall jointly, and as promptly as
practicable, engage an Accounting Firm (acting as an expert and not an
arbitrator) to resolve, in accordance with this Agreement (including Section
1.3(d)), only those Objections that remain in dispute (the "Objection Items").
The terms of engagement of the Accounting Firm shall be as mutually agreed
upon between Buyer, on the one hand, and the Representative, on the other
hand. Buyer and the Representative shall cooperate with the Accounting Firm in
all reasonable respects, but no party hereto will have _ex parte_ meetings,
teleconferences or other correspondence with the Accounting Firm.

(B) Buyer and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Firm to, as promptly as practicable following the
engagement of the Accounting Firm (but in any event within thirty (30)
calendar days following such engagement), deliver to Buyer and the
Representative a written determination (such determination to include a
worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination, and such determination to be based solely on information
provided to the Accounting Firm by Buyer and the Representative and not by
independent review or development) of each Objection Item, which
determination (i) shall be within the range of disputes between the Closing
Statement and the Objection Notice, such that the Accounting Firm may not
assign a value to any Objection Item greater than the greatest value for such
Objection Item claimed by any party hereto nor less than the smallest value
for such Objection Item claimed by any party hereto; (ii) shall be made
strictly in accordance with the accounting procedures set forth in this
Agreement (including Section 1.3(d)) without exception; and (iii) shall be (1)
the exclusive remedy of the parties with respect to any disputes arising with
respect to the calculation of Closing Net Working Capital or any adjustment
to the Purchase Price contemplated by Section 1.3(c), and (2) final,
conclusive and binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered on such
determination of the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction
over the party against which such determination is to be enforced.

(C) The Accounting Firm shall only make determinations with respect to the
Objection Items, provided, that the scope of the disputes to be resolved by
the Accounting Firm shall in all cases be limited to whether the Closing
Statement and the amounts, calculations and determinations therein were
accurate and prepared in accordance with this Agreement (including Section
1.3(d)), and the Accounting Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any
other determination.

 



3 (D) Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand, shall
each pay their own fees and expenses and the Party that has proposed figures
that are the subject matter of the disagreement and which figures differ the
most (in the aggregate) from the determination by the Accounting Firm shall
bear the costs and charges of the Accounting Firms review and report;
provided, that no Stockholder shall be required to bear any amount of such
fees in excess of such Stockholders Pro Rata Basis with respect to such
amount.

 

(c) _Adjustments_.

 

(i) If there is a Final Net Working Capital Surplus in an amount of not less
than $10,000, then, within three (3) Business Days after the date on which
the Final Net Working Capital is finally and conclusively determined in
accordance with this Agreement, Buyer shall deliver or cause to be delivered
to the Escrow Agent, to be held by the Escrow Agent in the Escrow Fund, cash
constituting an amount equal to such Final Net Working Capital Surplus. Any
amounts so delivered to the Escrow Agent pursuant to this Section 1.3(c)(i)
shall be deemed to be an increase of the General Escrow Amount, and shall
constitute part of the Escrow Fund, for all purposes of this Agreement.

(ii) If there is a Final Net Working Capital Deficiency in an amount of not
less than $10,000, then, within three (3) Business Days after the date on
which the Final Net Working Capital is finally and conclusively determined in
accordance with this Agreement, the parties shall deliver joint written
instructions to the Escrow Agent instructing the Escrow Agent to disburse to
Buyer a portion of the General Escrow Amount equal to such Final Net Working
Capital Deficiency.

 

(iii) Any payment made pursuant to Section 1.3 shall be treated as an
adjustment to the Purchase Price by the parties for Tax purposes, unless
otherwise required by Law.

(d) _Accounting Procedures_. _Exhibit B_ sets forth a statement
(the "Reference Statement") agreed to by Buyer, the Representative, and the
Stockholders setting forth the specific line items used (or to be used) in,
and illustrating as of August 31, 2015, the calculation of (i)
Current Assets, (ii) Current Liabilities (including with respect to each item
of Unpaid Company Transaction Expenses) and (iii) Net Working Capital, in each
case prepared and calculated in accordance with this Agreement and the Agreed
Accounting Policies and Principles. For all purposes hereunder, the
Preliminary Statement and Closing Statement and all determinations and
calculations by any Person (including the Accounting Firm) of Current Assets,
Current Liabilities or any Net Working Capital Amount shall in all
circumstances be prepared and calculated strictly in accordance with the
manner of determination and calculation (as applicable) as shown on the
Reference Statement using the same line items, accounting
principles, practices, procedures, policies and methods (with consistent
classifications, elections, inclusions, exclusions and valuation and
estimation methodologies)

 



4  used and applied in preparing the Reference Statement without deviation or
exception in any manner, or for any reason, whatsoever; provided that such
calculations and determinations: (i) shall not include any purchase
accounting or other adjustment arising out of the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and (ii) shall calculate any
reserves, accruals or other non-cash expense items on a pro rata (as opposed
to monthly accrual) basis to account for a Closing that occurs on any date
other than the last day of a calendar month.

 

Section 1.4 Contingent Payments.

 

(a) Buyer agrees to make an additional payment or payments to the Stockholders
of the amounts set forth opposite the Stockholders respective names on
_Exhibit C_, as applicable, up to a maximum of $10,000,000 in the aggregate,
in each case in accordance with and subject to the conditions and limitations
provided in this Section 1.4 and in _Exhibit C_ (the "Contingent Purchase
Price").

(b) Buyer agrees to make an additional payment or payments to the Key
Personnel named on  _Exhibit C_ of the amounts set forth opposite such Key
Personnels respective names on _Exhibit C_, as applicable, up to a maximum
of $5,000,000 in the aggregate, in each case in accordance with and subject to
the conditions and limitations provided in this Section 1.4 and in _Exhibit
C_ (the "Contingent Key Personnel Payments").

(c) Within thirty (30) calendar days after each Contingent Payment
Determination Date, the Buyer shall prepare and deliver to the Representative
a Contingent Payment Statement for the applicable Contingent Payment Period.
Buyer shall promptly provide to the Representative copies of the
documentation used in the calculations of the amounts set forth on the
Contingent Payment Statement as may be reasonably requested by the
Representative to allow the Representative and its advisors to review such
calculations.

(d) The Representative shall deliver to the Buyer, by the applicable
Contingent Payment Objection Deadline Date, either (i) a notice stating that
the Representative accepts the applicable Contingent Payment Statement, or
(ii) a reasonably detailed statement, along with the related calculations,
describing the Representatives objections to such Contingent Payment
Statement (a "Contingent Payment Objection Notice"). If the Representative
delivers to the Buyer a notice accepting the Contingent Payment Statement, or
the Representative does not deliver a Contingent Payment Objection Notice by
the applicable Contingent Payment Objection Deadline Date, then, effective as
of either the date of delivery of such notice of acceptance or as of the close
of business on the applicable Contingent Payment Objection Deadline Date, the
Contingent Payment Statement shall be deemed to be a Final Contingent Payment
Statement.

(e) If the Representative timely objects to a Contingent Payment Statement,
such objections shall be resolved as follows:

(i) The Buyer and the Representative shall first use their good faith efforts
to resolve such dispute between themselves.

 



5 (ii) If the Buyer and the Representative are unable to resolve all of
the objections set forth on the Representatives statement of objections
within thirty (30) calendar days after delivery of a Contingent Payment
Objection Notice, then any remaining items in dispute (the "Unresolved
Contingent Objections") shall be resolved by the Buyer and the Representative
jointly, as promptly as practicable, by engaging an Accounting Firm (acting as
an expert and not an arbitrator) to resolve, in accordance with this
Agreement, only the Unresolved Contingent Objections. The terms of engagement
of the Accounting Firm shall be as mutually agreed upon between Buyer, on the
one hand, and the Representative, on the other hand. Buyer and the
Representative shall cooperate with the Accounting Firm in all reasonable
respects, but no Party hereto will have _ex parte_ meetings, teleconferences
or other correspondence with the Accounting Firm.

 

(A) Buyer and the Representative shall use commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Accounting Firm to, as promptly as practicable following the
engagement of the Accounting Firm (but in any event within thirty (30)
calendar days following such engagement), deliver to Buyer and the
Representative a written determination (such determination to include
a worksheet setting forth all material calculations used in arriving at such
determination, and such determination to be based solely on information
provided to the Accounting Firm by Buyer and the Representative and not by
independent review or development) of each Unresolved Contingent Objections,
which determination (i) shall be within the range of disputes between the
Contingent Payment Statement and the Contingent Payment Objection Notice, such
that the Accounting Firm may not assign a value to any Unresolved Contingent
Objection greater than the greatest value for such Unresolved Contingent
Objection claimed by any Party hereto nor less than the smallest value for
such Unresolved Contingent Objection claimed by any Party hereto; (ii) shall
be made strictly in accordance with the accounting procedures set forth in
this Agreement without exception; and (iii) shall be final, conclusive and
binding on the parties, and judgment may be entered on such determination of
the Accounting Firm in any court having jurisdiction over the Party against
which such determination is to be enforced.

 

(B) The Accounting Firm, to the extent engaged in connection with any
Unresolved Contingent Objections contemplated by this Section 1.4 shall only
make determinations with respect to the Unresolved Contingent Objections,
_provided_ , that the scope of the disputes to be resolved by the Accounting
Firm shall in all cases be limited to whether the Contingent Payment
Statement and the amounts, calculations and determinations therein were
accurate and prepared in accordance with this Agreement, and the Accounting
Firm is not authorized or permitted to make any other determination.

 

(C) Buyer, on the one hand, and the Stockholders, on the other hand, shall
each pay their own fees and expenses and the Party that has proposed figures
that are the subject matter of the disagreement and which figures differ the
most (in the aggregate) from the determination by the Accounting Firm shall
bear the costs and charges of the Accounting Firms review and report;
provided, that no Stockholder shall be required to bear any amount of such
fees in excess of such Stockholders Pro Rata Basis with respect to such
amount.

 



6 (iii) The determination of the Accounting Firm as to a Contingent
Payment Statement (and the amounts therein) shall be binding and conclusive
upon all Parties, and such Contingent Payment Statement shall be deemed to be
a Final Contingent Payment Statement. The Parties agree that the procedures
set forth in this Section 1.4(e) for resolving disputes with respect to
Contingent Payment Statements shall be the sole and exclusive method for
resolving any such disputes; _provided_ , that a judgment on the determination
made by the Accounting Firm pursuant to this Section 1.4(e) may be entered in
and enforced by any court having jurisdiction thereover.

(f) Except as otherwise provided in this Section 1.4(f) or as provided in
Section 1.4(g) below, on the date of the first regularly-scheduled payroll
following the fifteenth (15th) calendar day after the determination of a
Final Contingent Payment Statement pursuant to Section 1.4(d) or Section
1.4(e), as applicable, Buyer shall pay the amount of any Contingent Purchase
Price and/or Contingent Key Personnel Payment due and payable to
the Stockholders and/or Key Personnel listed on _Exhibit C_ , as applicable,
and with respect to the applicable Contingent Payment Period in accordance
with the Contingent Payment Schedule attached hereto as _Exhibit C_ ;
_provided however_ , that a Stockholder or Key Personnel shall be entitled to
the applicable portion of a Contingent Purchase Price payment made pursuant to
this Section 1.4 and _Exhibit C_ (a "Contingent Purchase Price Payment") or
Contingent Key Personnel Payment (other than with respect to the First
Contingent Installment), as applicable, only if such Stockholder or Key
Personnel is Personnel in Good Standing as of the applicable date of a Final
Contingent Payment Statement; provided, further, that the Second Key
Personnel Installment shall be paid no later than December 31, 2017. In the
event any Stockholder or Key Personnel is not Personnel in Good Standing as of
the applicable date of a Final Contingent Payment Statement with respect to
(i) the Second Contingent Installment, (ii) the First Key Personnel
Installment, or (iii) the Second Key Personnel Installment (but not with
respect to the First Contingent Installment), as applicable, including
because such individual never became an employee of or consultant to the Buyer
effective as of the Closing due to a Failed Background Check or the refusal of
such individual to accept post-Closing employment or to enter into
a consulting relationship with the Buyer following the Closing (in each case,
a "Forfeiting Individual"), (A) the amount of any Second Contingent
Installment or Second Key Personnel Installment set forth on _Exhibit C_
 hereto and otherwise payable to such Forfeiting Individual shall not be
reapportioned among the remaining Stockholders or Key Personnel then eligible
to receive a Contingent Purchase Price Payment or a Contingent Key Personnel
Payment and shall not be paid to any Stockholder or Key Personnel, and (B)
_Exhibit C_ hereto will be deemed amended to remove such person from any
applicable list therein. Without limiting the foregoing, in the event any Key
Personnel is not Personnel in Good Standing as of the applicable date of a
Final Contingent Payment Statement with respect to the First Key Personnel
Installment (each such person being "Forfeiting Key Personnel"), the amount of
the First Key Personnel Installment set forth on _Exhibit C_ hereto and
otherwise payable to such Forfeiting Key Personnel shall not be paid to such
Key Personnel and shall instead be reapportioned among the remaining Key
Personnel then eligible to receive a portion 

 



7  of the First Key Personnel Installment and shall be paid to such remaining
eligible Key Personnel in proportion to the relative amounts of their payments
of such First Key Personnel Installment specified in _Exhibit C_ , and
_Exhibit C_ hereto will be deemed amended to remove such Forfeiting Key
Personnel from any applicable list therein and to reapportion the payments
among such remaining eligible Key Personnel. Any amount of the First
Contingent Installment payable to the Stockholders in accordance with the
terms hereof shall be treated as payments in connection with an "installment
sale" within the meaning of Section 453 of the Code, shall not be
processed through the Companys payroll and shall be paid to the Stockholders
via wire transfer of immediately available funds. The Second Contingent
Installment and the Contingent Key Personnel Payments shall be treated as
employment compensation to the applicable Stockholder or Key Personnel, and
processed through payroll.

(g) In the case of a claim or claims by one or more Buyer Indemnified Parties
(i) for indemnification pursuant to (A) Section 9.2(a) with respect to a
breach of a Key Representation (other than Section 2.15), (B) Section 9.2(b) 
Section 9.2(g), or (C) Section 9.2(k) (but in the case of Section 9.2(k) only
to the extent the applicable Damages arise from defending any Third-Party
Claim alleging the occurrence of facts or circumstances that, if true,
regardless of the outcome of such defense, would entitle a Buyer Indemnified
Party to indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a) (solely with respect to
breaches of Key Representations other than Section 2.15) or any of Section
9.2(b)  Section 9.2(g)), or (ii) in connection with any intentional or
willful breaches of this Agreement or actual fraud or intentional
misrepresentation by the Company (prior to the Closing) or by the Stockholders
or the Representative, in the event such claim or claims remain unresolved
when a Contingent Installment becomes otherwise due and payable, the Buyer
shall be entitled to withhold from the applicable Contingent Purchase Price
Payments, the lesser of (1) the amount of the underlying claim or claims and
(2) the amount equal to the Contingent Purchase Price Payments otherwise
payable. Upon the resolution of such claim or claims in accordance with
Section 9.4 or Section 9.5, as applicable, or otherwise, any amount
of Contingent Purchase Price Payments due and payable by the Buyer (less any
amount offset in accordance with Section 9.6 and this paragraph above) to the
Stockholders and/or the Key Personnel shall be paid by the Buyer on the date
of the first regularly-scheduled payroll following the fifteenth (15th)
calendar day after the resolution of such claim or claims by, at the option of
the Buyer, check or wire transfer of immediately available funds or inclusion
in such regularly-scheduled payroll.

(h) The Contingent Payments shall represent only a right to receive a cash
payment from the Buyer, subject to the terms set forth herein. No Contingent
Payment shall be deemed an interest in any security, shall possess any
attributes of capital stock or shall entitle the holder thereof to any rights
of any kind other than as specifically set forth herein. Each Contingent
Payment is personal to the Stockholder or Key Personnel, as applicable, and
shall remain nontransferable for any reason other than by operation of Law or
by will or the Laws of descent and distribution; _provided_ , that in the
event of such permitted transfer of a Contingent Payment by a Stockholder or
Key Personnel, such Contingent Payment shall be due and payable to such
transferee only to the extent due and payable to such transferring
Stockholder or Key Personnel, as applicable, in accordance with this Section
1.4 (including Section 1.4(f)). Any attempted assignment, pledge,
hypothecation, transfer or other disposition of any Contingent Payment, or
any portion thereof or interest therein, by a Stockholder or Key Personnel
(other than as set forth in the immediately preceding sentence) shall be null
and void.

 



8 (i) Buyer shall not take, and shall cause the Company and Buyers
other Affiliates to refrain from taking, any action for the primary purpose
of reducing any Contingent Purchase Price Payment or Contingent Key Personnel
Payment.

1.3;

required or permitted to be made or delivered under this Agreement or under
the documents referred to in this Agreement) necessary or appropriate in the
reasonable judgment of the Representative in connection with any transaction
contemplated hereunder or for the accomplishment of the foregoing, in each
case without having to seek or obtain the consent of any Person under any
circumstance.

 

(b) Joseph Siegrist hereby accepts his appointment as the initial
Representative.

 

(c) Any notice or communication given or received by, and any decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of, the
Representative shall constitute a notice or communication to or by, or a
decision, action, failure to act within a designated period of time,
agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of all the
Stockholders and shall be final, binding and conclusive upon each such
Stockholder; and Buyer, each Buyer Indemnified Party and the Escrow Agent
shall be entitled to rely upon any such notice, communication, decision,
action, failure to act within a designated period of time, agreement,
consent, settlement, resolution or instruction as being a notice or
communication to or by, or a decision, action, failure to act within a
designated period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or
instruction of, each and every such Stockholder. Buyer, each Buyer Indemnified
Party and the Escrow Agent are hereby relieved from any liability to any
Person for any acts done by them in accordance with any such
notice, communication, decision, action, failure to act within a designated
period of time, agreement, consent, settlement, resolution or instruction of
the Representative.

 

(d) The Representative shall not be liable to any Stockholder for any act done
or omitted under this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any other Ancillary
Agreement or certificate or instrument contemplated hereunder while acting in
good faith, and any act done

 



10  or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel shall be conclusive evidence of
such good faith. Each Stockholder, severally and not jointly, in accordance
with his Pro Rata Basis, shall indemnify the Representative and hold it
harmless against any loss, liability or expense incurred without gross
negligence or bad faith on the part of the Representative and arising out of
or in connection with the acceptance or administration of its duties under
this Agreement, the Escrow Agreement, any other Ancillary Agreement or
certificate or instrument contemplated hereunder. To the extent that any
distributions of the Escrow Amount are being made to the Stockholders pursuant
to the terms of the Escrow Agreement, the Representative may, upon written
notice to Buyer and the Stockholders, receive reimbursement from the
Stockholders directly out of any such distributions that are being made to the
Stockholders for any and all expenses, charges and liabilities, including
attorneys fees, reasonably incurred by the Representative in the performance
or discharge of his rights and obligations under this Agreement; provided,
however, that neither Buyer nor the Company shall have any liability with
respect to such items.

(e) The Stockholders hereby agree that:

 

(i) remedies available at Law for any breach of the provisions of this Section
1.5 are inadequate; therefore, the Buyer shall be entitled to temporary and
permanent injunctive relief without the necessity of proving damages if the
Buyer brings an action to enforce the provisions of this Section 1.5; and

 

(ii) the provisions of this Section 1.5 shall be binding upon the executors,
heirs, legal representatives, personal representatives, successors and
permitted assigns of the Buyer, the Representative, and each Stockholder, and
any references in this Agreement to a Stockholder or the Stockholders shall
mean and include the successors to the Stockholders rights hereunder,
whether pursuant to testamentary disposition, the Laws of descent and
distribution or otherwise.

(f) The Stockholders and Buyer acknowledge and agree that the Representative
can be removed and/or replaced upon the affirmative written consent of
Stockholders holding a majority of the aggregate Pro Rata Basis percentages
set forth on _Exhibit A_ hereto, upon not less than ten (10) days prior
written notice to Buyer. Upon the due removal and/or replacement of the
Representative, Buyer and the newly appointed Representative shall provide
prompt written notice to the Escrow Agent concerning such replacement.

Section 1.6 Escrow. At the Closing, the Representative, Buyer and the Escrow
Agent shall execute the Escrow Agreement. Pursuant to Section 1.2(b) of this
Agreement, an amount in cash equal to (i) $15,000,000 (the "General Escrow
Amount") plus (ii) $8,000,000 (the "Special Escrow Amount") shall be
withheld from the Base Purchase Price payable to, and therefore shall not be
paid to, the Stockholders at the Closing (such withholding to be made on a Pro
Rata Basis with respect to each Stockholder), but instead shall be delivered
to the Escrow Agent to be held by the Escrow Agent in two or more dedicated
escrow accounts (collectively, the "Escrow Fund"), with the Special Escrow
Amount being held in a separate escrow account from the General Escrow Amount,
as security for the indemnification obligations of the Stockholders provided
for in ARTICLE IX pursuant to the terms of the Escrow Agreement and shall be
disbursed in accordance with the terms thereof.

 



11 Section 1.7 The Closing. The closing of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement (the "Closing") shall take place via electronic exchange of
documents, on or prior to the third (3rd) Business Day following satisfaction
or waiver of all of the closing conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII
hereof (other than those to be satisfied at the Closing) or on such other
date as is mutually agreeable to Buyer and the Representative. The date of the
Closing is herein referred to as the "Closing Date." The Closing shall be
deemed to occur at 5:00 p.m. Boston time on the Closing Date.

Section 1.8 Withholding Rights. Each of the Buyer, the Company and the Escrow
Agent shall be entitled to deduct and withhold from the consideration
otherwise payable pursuant to any provision of this Agreement (or any other
document referred to herein) to any Person such amounts as it reasonably
determines that it is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the
making of such payment under the Code, or any other applicable Law. To the
extent that amounts are so withheld by the Buyer, the Company or the Escrow
Agent, such withheld amounts shall be treated for all purposes of this
Agreement (and each other document referred to herein) as having been paid to
the Persons in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made. Prior
to Closing, the parties hereto agree to provide Buyer and the Company, and
the Escrow Agent IRS Forms W-8 or W-9, or such other forms relating to United
States federal or other applicable withholding obligations as may be
applicable, as Buyer, the Company or the Escrow Agent may reasonably request.
For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent any amounts are required to be so
withheld from any distributions from the Escrow Fund, such amounts required to
be withheld may be distributed to Buyer (or an entity designated by Buyer) to
enable Buyer (or any such designated entity) to comply with its withholding
obligations (including any obligations of the Company). Buyer, the Company, or
the Escrow Agent, as the case may be, shall pay over to the appropriate
Governmental Entity amounts withheld under this Section 1.8.

accurate list of (i) all accounts payable of the Company as of the date of
this Agreement and the aging thereof, and (ii) any customer deposits or other
deposits held by the Company as of the date of this Agreement. All outstanding

notice from an account debtor stating that, nor does the Company have
Knowledge of specific facts that provide a reason to believe that, any
account receivable in an amount in excess of $10,000 is subject to any
contest, claim or setoff by such account debtor or that such account debtor

instrument relating thereto, nor does any Circumstance exist which, with the
passage of time or giving of notice, or both, would result in a default with
respect to any Contract or instrument with respect to any Indebtedness, and no
such Indebtedness or any Contract or instrument relating thereto purports to
limit the issuance or transfer of any securities by the Company or the
operation of the Companys business. Complete and correct copies of all

relating to any Indebtedness of the Company have been furnished to Buyer.

 



18 Section 2.10 Tax Matters.

 

(a) Except as set forth in Section 2.10(a) of the Disclosure Schedule, the
Company has properly filed with the appropriate Governmental Entity on a
timely basis all Income Tax Returns and all other Tax Returns that it was
required to file, and all such Tax Returns (including the amount of all Tax
Assets reported therein) were true, correct and complete in all material
respects. The Company is not and has never been a member of a group of
corporations (other than the group which has the Company as its parent) with
which it has filed (or been required to file) consolidated, combined or
unitary Tax Returns. The Company has paid on a timely basis all Taxes that
were due and payable by it, whether or not shown on any Tax Return. The unpaid
Taxes of the Company as of the Most Recent Balance Sheet Date do not exceed
the accruals and reserves for Taxes (excluding accruals and reserves for
deferred Taxes established to reflect timing differences between book and Tax
income) set forth on the face of the Most Recent Balance Sheet. Since the Most
Recent Balance Sheet Date, the Company has not incurred any material
liability for Taxes outside of the Ordinary Course of Business. The Company
does not have any actual or potential liability under Treasury Regulations
Section 1.1502-6 (or any comparable or similar provision of federal, state,
local or foreign Law), as a transferee or successor, pursuant to any
contractual obligation, or otherwise for any Taxes of any Person other than
the Company. The Company is not a party to or bound by any Tax indemnity, Tax
sharing, Tax allocation or similar agreement. All Taxes that the Company was
required by Law to withhold or collect have been duly withheld or collected
and, to the extent required, have been timely and properly paid to the
appropriate Governmental Entity, and the Company has complied with
all material information reporting and backup withholding requirements,
including the maintenance of required records with respect thereto, in
connection with amounts paid to any employee, independent contractor,
creditor, stockholder or other third party.

Taxes for all taxable periods for which the applicable statute of limitations
has not yet expired. The Company is not the subject of and has not submitted,
received or requested (as applicable) any private letter rulings,
revenue agent reports, information document requests, audit or examination
reports, notices of proposed deficiencies, deficiency notices, protests,
petitions, closing agreements, settlement agreements, pending ruling requests
or any similar documents, submitted by, received by, or agreed to by or on
behalf of the Company relating to Taxes for any taxable periods for which the
statute of limitations has not yet expired. No examination or audit of any Tax
Return of the Company by any Governmental Entity is currently in progress or,
to the Knowledge of the Company, threatened or contemplated. No issues
relating to Taxes of the Company were raised in any completed audit or
examination that could reasonably be expected to result in a material amount
of Taxes in a later taxable period. There are no matters under discussion with
any Governmental Entity or Known to the Company with respect to Taxes that are
likely to result in an additional liability for Taxes with respect to the
Company. No deficiencies for Taxes of the Company have been claimed, proposed
or assessed by any Governmental Entity. No claim within the last seven (7)
years has been made by a Governmental Entity in a jurisdiction where the
Company does not file a particular type of Tax Return or pay a particular
type of Taxes that the Company is or may be required to file such Tax Return
or pay such Taxes in that jurisdiction. The Company has not (x) waived any
statute of limitations with respect to Taxes or agreed to extend the period
for assessment or

 



19  collection of any Taxes, (y) requested or been granted any extension of time
within which to file any Tax Return, which Tax Return has not yet been filed,

transactions or events occurring or accounting methods employed up to the
Closing. 

(d) There is no limitation on the utilization by the Company of its net
operating losses, built-in losses, Tax credits, Tax Assets, or similar items

disposition made on or prior to the Closing Date, (iii) prepaid amount

in any jurisdiction (i) in which a material amount of Tax is imposed, or the
value of the interest is materially reassessed, on the transfer of an interest
in real property resulting from the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or (ii) which treats the transfer of an interest (resulting from
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement) in an entity that owns an
interest in real property as a transfer of the interest in such real property.

 

(l) No holder of Common Stock holds any Common Stock that is non-transferable
and subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture within the meaning of Section

(m) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
Ancillary Agreements and the performance of any transactions contemplated by
this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements will not (i) result in the loss,
impairment or termination of any Company Intellectual Property, or (ii) cause

reasonably be expected to make any of the conditions set forth in ARTICLE VIII
required to be satisfied by it incapable of being satisfied in a timely
manner; provided, however, that the delivery of any notice pursuant to this
Section 6.4 shall not limit or otherwise affect any remedies available to the
other Parties.

 



47 Section 6.5 [Intentionally Omitted.]

 

Section 6.6 Exclusivity. From the date of this Agreement through the Closing
Date or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.1
(whichever first occurs), the Company, and each Stockholder shall not, and
shall cause the officers, directors, managers, employees, consultants,
advisors, representatives, agents, lenders, and Affiliates
(collectively "Agents") of the Company and each Stockholder not to, directly
or indirectly, discuss, pursue, solicit, initiate or otherwise enter into or
engage in any discussions, agreements or other arrangements regarding, a
possible sale or other disposition (whether by sale, merger, share exchange,
reorganization, recapitalization, share issuance, exclusive license, or
otherwise) of all or any of the capital stock or assets of the Company with
any Person other than Buyer or its Affiliates (an "Acquisition Proposal") or
provide any information to any Person other than Buyer or its Affiliates in
connection with any such proposed or potential Acquisition Proposal. The
Company, and each Stockholder shall, and shall cause the their respective
Agents to, (i) immediately cease and cause to be terminated any and all
contacts, discussions and negotiations with third parties regarding any
Acquisition Proposal or other possible sale or disposition of the Company,
and (ii) promptly notify Buyer if any Acquisition Proposal, or any inquiry or
contact with any Person with respect thereto, is subsequently made after the
date hereof and the material terms thereof (including the identity of the
third party or third parties, the specific material terms discussed or
proposed, and a copy of any written inquiry, proposal or offer and all
correspondence related thereto).

 

Section 6.7 Protective Agreements.

 

(a) Non-Competition. As a material inducement and consideration for Buyer to
enter into this Agreement, for a period of three (3) years following the
Closing Date (the "Restricted Period"), each of the Stockholders shall not,
directly or indirectly, participate or engage, or assist (whether as owner,
partner, member, officer, director, employee, consultant, advisor, investor,
lender or otherwise, except as the holder of not more than 1% of the
outstanding capital stock of a publicly-held company) any other Person in
engaging in any Restricted Business anywhere in the world in which Buyer
is doing business or has specific, publically announced plans to do business
as of the Closing Date ("Restricted Territory").

 

(b) Scope and Choice of Law. It is the understanding of the parties that the
scope of the covenants contained in this Section 6.7, both as to time and
area covered, are necessary to protect the rights of Buyer and the goodwill to
be acquired by Buyer. It is the parties intention that these covenants be
enforced to the greatest extent (but to no greater extent) in time, area, and
degree of participation set forth in Section 6.7(a) as is permitted by
applicable Law of that jurisdiction whose law is found to be applicable to any
acts in breach of these covenants. Therefore, if any restriction set forth in
this Section 6.7 is found by any court of competent jurisdiction to be
unenforceable because it extends for too long a period of time or over too
great a range of activities or in too broad a geographic area, it shall be
interpreted to extend only over the maximum period of time, range of
activities or geographic area as to

 



48  which it may be enforceable. If any such covenants or any part of such
covenants is held invalid, void or unenforceable by any court of competent
jurisdiction, such invalidity, voidness, or unenforceability shall in no way
render invalid, void, or unenforceable any other part of them or any separate
agreements not declared invalid, void or unenforceable; and this Agreement
shall in such case be construed as if the invalid, void or unenforceable
provisions were omitted.

(c) Remedy for Breach. The parties agree that any breach of this Section 6.7
(or Section 6.2, Section 6.3, or Section 6.6 above or Section 6.8, Section
6.9, or Section 6.14 below) could cause Buyer substantial and irrevocable
damage which is difficult to measure. Therefore, Buyer shall be entitled to
injunctive relief against the Stockholders and the Company in the event of any
breach or threatened breach of any of this Section 6.7 (or Section 6.2,
Section 6.3, or Section 6.6 above or Section 6.8, Section 6.9, or Section
6.14 below) by any of the Stockholders or the Company, in addition to any
other relief (including damages) available to Buyer.

 

Section 6.8 Non-Solicitation; Non-Disparagement. As a material inducement and
consideration for Buyer to enter into this Agreement:

(a) during the Restricted Period, each of the Stockholders agrees that it
shall not, directly or indirectly (including through the Company or its
Agents prior to the Closing), (i) solicit for employment or hire any Person
who is or was an employee or consultant of the Company as of the date of this
Agreement or at any time during the six (6) month period prior to the Closing
Date; _provided_ , that the foregoing shall not prevent a Stockholder from (A)
soliciting an employee that the Company has terminated after Closing (but only
from and after the date that is three (3) months following the date of such
persons termination by the Company), or (B) from placing notices for
employment in publications of general circulation which notices are not
directed toward or targeting the Company and its personnel, or (ii)
solicit, divert or take away, or attempt to divert, decrease, or take away
from the Company, any business or patronage of any of the customers served by
the Company or who otherwise conducted business with the Company during the
twelve (12) month period prior to the Closing Date.

(b) From and after the date of this Agreement, (i) none of the Stockholders
shall directly or indirectly, disparage the Buyer or any of its Affiliates
(including the Company following the Closing), including any of their
respective products, services, or personnel, either orally or in writing, and
(ii) the Buyer shall not directly or indirectly, disparage any Stockholder,
either orally or in writing.

Section 6.9 Confidentiality. From and after the Closing Date, without the
prior written consent of Buyer, the Stockholders shall not, and the
Stockholders shall cause their respective Agents and Affiliates (and the
Agents of their respective Affiliates) not to, use for their own benefit or
divulge or convey to any third party, any Confidential Information;
_provided_ , _however_ , that any such Person may furnish such portion (and
only such portion) of the Confidential Information (a) as outside legal
counsel to such Person determines such Person is legally obligated to
disclose, (b) in connection with any required reporting to a Governmental
Entity, (c) to such Persons financial, legal, and tax advisors to the extent
necessary to obtain

 



49  their professional advice, and (d) as is necessary to perform its employment
duties on behalf of the Buyer or its Affiliates (including, the Company)
following Closing, subject to the requirements of any employee
confidentiality agreement executed with Buyer or its Affiliates (including the
Company following the Closing); _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of
the foregoing clauses (a) and (b), such Person shall (i) provide prior
written notice to Buyer and the Company of such required disclosure, (ii) use
commercially reasonable efforts to preserve the confidentiality of the
disclosed Confidential Information and only disclosure such Confidential
Information to the extent necessary to comply with the applicable law or
regulation, and (iii) if requested by Buyer or the Company, as applicable,
shall cooperate with Buyer or the Company, as applicable and at expense of
the requesting Party, in seeking to avoid or limit the extent of such
required disclosure; _provided_ , _further_ , that in the case of the
foregoing clause (c), that such advisor is bound with respect to such
Confidential Information by customary professional obligations of
confidentiality or other binding confidentiality obligations substantially
similar to those set forth herein.

 

Section 6.10 Release.

 

(a) For and in consideration of the amounts to be paid to the Stockholders
under this Agreement, and in consideration of the other covenants and
promises hereunder, each of the Stockholders, on behalf of themselves and
their successors, assigns, heirs and beneficiaries (each a "Releasor"), hereby
fully and finally releases, acquits and forever discharges Buyer, the Company
and Buyers and the Companys current and prior Agents, Affiliates and
predecessors, successors and permitted assigns, in their respective capacities
(collectively, the "Released Parties"), from any and all actions, debts,
claims, counterclaims, demands, liabilities, damages, causes of action, costs,
expenses, royalties, and compensation of every kind and nature whatsoever, at
law or in equity, whether known or unknown (collectively, "Claims"), that
such Releasor had, has, or may have had at any time in the past until and
including the date hereof against any of the Released Parties; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that nothing in this release shall be construed to release,
acquit or discharge any Claims or rights that such Stockholder had, has or may
have under (i) this Agreement and the Ancillary Agreements to which such
Stockholder is a party in connection with the Transactions, (ii) any rights,
claims or entitlements to any fees, salary, bonuses, other compensation earned
or accrued prior to the date hereof by or for the benefit of Releasor in
respect of services performed by Releasor as a director, employee,
officer, advisor or consultant of the Company prior to the date hereof, (iii)
any indemnification rights of Stockholders as officers or directors of the
Company under the Companys charter or bylaws, insurance policies, or
indemnification agreement between the Company and such Stockholder or (iv)
any employee benefit arrangements of the Company.

(b) Each Releasor agrees, from and after the date hereof and to the fullest
extent permitted by law, not to commence, aid, prosecute or cause to be
commenced or prosecuted, directly or indirectly, any action or other
proceeding based upon any of the Claims which are released by Section 6.10(a)
above. Releasor acknowledges and agrees that, except as expressly limited in
this Section 6.10, this release releases and precludes, effective upon the
date hereof, inter alia, any Claims against any of the Released Parties of
which such Releasor is not now aware and of which such Releasor may only
become aware at some later date. Nevertheless, such Releasor fully and freely
intends to and does, by executing this release and effective upon the date
hereof, release any and all such Claims.

 



50 (c) Each Releasor, on its behalf and on behalf of its Agents and Affiliates,
(a) represents and warrants that neither it nor any of its Agents or
Affiliates has assigned and (b) covenants that it will not assign, and will
cause each of its Agents and Affiliates not to assign, to any other Person,
any Claim or potential Claim against the Released Parties released by Section
6.10(a) above.

(d) Each of the Stockholders hereby further agrees to execute and deliver
to Buyer at the Closing a release agreement in the form attached hereto as
_Exhibit F_ (the "Stockholder Releases").

 

Section 6.11 Background Checks. Following execution of this Agreement, Buyer
anticipates conducting customary background checks of employees of the
Company in connection with their pending employment with Buyer. Buyer may,
without penalty or obligation, determine not to hire any employee of the
Company who is Key Personnel as a result of a Failed Background Check. 

Section 6.12 Certain Employment and Benefits Matters.

 

(a) Except with respect to (i) the hiring or engagement, as applicable, of the
Stockholders and the Key Personnel by the Company at or immediately following
the Closing pursuant to the Offer Letters and Consulting Agreements, and (ii)
the Contingent Purchase Price Payments and Key Personnel Contingent Payments,
in each case solely to the extent expressly provided in this Agreement, the
Buyer (and, following the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries) shall not
be under any obligation to hire or retain any employee, independent contractor
or consultant, or provide any employee, independent contractor or
consultant with any particular benefits, or make any payments or provide any
benefits to those employees, independent contractors or consultants whom the
Buyer (or the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, following the Closing)
chooses not to employ or subsequently terminates, except as otherwise
required by applicable Law or any applicable separate written agreement
between Buyer and any such Person. The Company shall take all necessary action
such that all amounts due and payable or that may become due and payable
(including notice periods, repatriation commitments, severance, bonuses and
sales commissions) with respect to any employee, independent contractor or
consultant whose relationship with the Company and the Subsidiaries
has terminated or expired on or prior to the Closing shall have been paid in
full by the Company such that the Company, its Subsidiaries, and the Buyer,
shall have no obligation to any such Person as of and after the Closing.

 

(b) For a period of at least six (6) months following the Closing, the Buyer
shall cause the Company to provide each employee of the Company hired by the
Buyer (or the Company following the Closing), while such employee is employed
by Buyer (or the Company following the Closing), with: (i) base salary or
hourly wage rates which are no less than the base salary or hourly wage rates
provided by the Company immediately prior to the Closing; and (ii) retirement
and welfare benefits that are substantially comparable in the aggregate to
those provided by the Company immediately prior to the Closing.

 



51 (c) At the request of Buyer, the Company will terminate any and all Company
Benefit Plans, including any group health, dental, bonus, commission,
severance, separation or salary continuation plans, programs or arrangements,
effective either immediately prior to the Closing or thereafter as specified
by Buyer and, at the request of Buyer, the Company will provide Buyer with
evidence that such Company Benefit Plans have been so terminated pursuant to
resolutions duly adopted by the Company Board or the board of directors of a
Subsidiary, as applicable. The Company also shall take such other actions in
furtherance of terminating such Company Benefit Plans as the Buyer may
reasonably require. If any defined contribution plan qualified under Section
401(a) of the Code is terminated, the Buyer shall take such reasonable
actions as may be necessary to enable such plan participants who become
employed by the Buyer (or the Company following the Closing) with outstanding
plan loans to rollover their loans to a qualified Section 401(a) plan
maintained by the Buyer.

 

(d) At or immediately prior to Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries shall
pay to their current and former employees all vacation, paid-time off and
similar amounts accrued through the Closing, so that neither Buyer nor any of
its Affiliates (including the Company and its Subsidiaries following the
Closing) will have any Damages or other obligations related to or in respect
of such amounts on or following Closing (including any Taxes in respect of
such amounts).

(e) Without limiting the generality of Section 11.5, this Section 6.12 is
included for the sole benefit of the respective Parties hereto (and their
respective permitted successors and assigns) and nothing herein, express or
implied, shall create any rights, remedies, benefits or obligations in any
other Person, including any employees of the Company or any representative,
beneficiary or dependent thereof. Nothing in this Section 6.12 shall (i) be
treated as an amendment or termination of any Company Benefit Plan or
employee benefit plan or program of Buyer or any of its Affiliates or prevent
the amendment or termination of any such plan or arrangement or (ii) obligate
Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates to retain
the employment of any particular employee or continue the employment of any
particular employee for any period of time.

Section 6.13 Insurance and Indemnification of Directors

(a) Prior to the Closing, the Company shall purchase an extended reporting
period endorsement, or "tail," under the Companys existing directors and
officers liability insurance coverage in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer that shall provide the members of the Company Board and the
Companys officers with coverage for six (6) years following the Closing of
not less than the existing coverage and have other terms not materially less
favorable to the insured persons than the Companys directors and officers
liability insurance coverage presently maintained by the Company.

(b) The Buyer and the Company agree that all applicable rights
to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company in
favor of each current and former officer or director of the Company (the "DandO
Indemnified Parties"), as provided in the certificate of incorporation or by-
laws of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date of immediately
prior to the Closing, or pursuant to any other agreements in effect as of
immediately prior to the Closing, shall survive the Closing and shall not be
modified as a 

 



52  result of the Closing, and shall continue in full force and effect in
accordance with their respective terms. After the Closing, in the event the
Company or Buyer or any of their respective successors or assigns (i)
consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the
continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger
or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to
any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so
that the successors and assigns of the Buyer or the Company, as the case may
be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this Section 6.13(b).

 

Section 6.14 Stockholder Standstill. Without limiting the obligations of any
Party under Section 6.6, each Stockholder hereby agrees that, until the
Closing Date or the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section
10.1 (whichever first occurs), such Stockholder shall not, directly or
indirectly (including through its Affiliates or by entering into an agreement
to do any of the following), unless specifically requested or consented to in
writing by Buyer:

(a) sell, transfer, tender, pledge, encumber, assign or otherwise dispose of
(each, a "Transfer"), or enter into any contract, option or other agreement
with respect to, or permit or consent to, a Transfer of, any of the Shares, or
any other securities in the Company held by such Stockholder from time to
time, except for Transfers (i) of the Shares to Buyer at the Closing pursuant
to this Agreement, (ii) by the laws of descent and distribution, or (iii) by
operation of Law; provided that in the case of any such Transfer pursuant to
the foregoing clause (ii) and/or (iii), the transferee shall be required, as a
condition precedent to the effectiveness of such Transfer, to execute and
deliver to each party to this Agreement a counterparty signature page to this
Agreement or a joinder to this Agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to
Buyer and the Company;

(b) acquire, offer to acquire, or agree to acquire, by purchase or otherwise,
any securities or rights to acquire any Shares or any other securities in the
Company;

 

(c) make any announcement with respect to, or submit a proposal for, or offer
of (with or without conditions) any extraordinary transaction involving the
Company or its securities or assets, including, without limitation, any merger
or sale of the Company or sale of all or substantially all of the Companys
securities (including any Shares) or assets.

 

Section 6.15 Certain Deliveries. As soon as practicable after the date of this
Agreement, but in no event more than five (5) Business Days following the
date hereof, the Company will deliver to Buyer on one or more CD-ROM disks a
complete and accurate (as of the date of this Agreement) electronic copy of
the "data room" established and maintained by the Company through ansarada at
https://dataroom.ansarada.com/Project_Chesapeake (the "Data Room").

Section 6.16 Cooperation with Respect to Network Intrusion Matters. The
Stockholders shall preserve and maintain all information and documents in
their possession or custody (or that may come into their possession or
custody) relevant to the Network Intrusion Matters, including any information
or documentation that is or may be or become relevant to any investigation
with respect to the Network Intrusion Matters and/or the defense or
prosecution of any Legal Proceeding related to the Network Intrusion Matters.
The Stockholders shall reasonably cooperate with Buyer, at Buyers expense, in
all respects in any such investigations and Legal Proceedings.

 



53 Section 6.17 Technology and Licensing Deliverables. The Stockholders shall,
prior to and following the Closing, use their diligent efforts to complete or
cause to be completed to the Buyers satisfaction the technology and licensing
activities and deliverables detailed on Schedule 6.17.

 

Section 6.18 Records. Following the Closing, the Company shall, and the Buyer
shall cause the Company to, in each case upon reasonable prior written
request, afford the Stockholders and their respective advisors and
representatives (subject to the execution by any such advisor or
representative of a customary confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably
acceptable to Buyer or the Company (following the Closing)) access to, and
the right to make copies and extracts from, the books, records and other data
in the Companys possession relating to the Company with respect to periods
prior to the Closing Date to the extent that such access may be reasonably
required by the Stockholders to facilitate the investigation, litigation and
final disposition of any claims which may have been or may be made against the
Stockholders in their capacity as stockholders, officers, directors, or
employees of the Company prior to the Closing, and for the purposes of
satisfying any reporting requirements required by any applicable Laws. The
Buyer agrees that for a period of seven years following the Closing Date,
the Company shall not, and the Buyer shall cause the Company not to, destroy
or otherwise dispose of any such books, records or data in its possession
without (a) giving the Stockholders at least sixty (60) days prior written
notice of such intended disposition and (b) offering to deliver to the
Stockholders, at the Stockholders expense, copies of any or all of the books,
records and data that the Company intends to destroy. The Stockholders agree
that any books, records, data, or other information, or copies thereof,
accessed by or otherwise furnished, provided, or made available the
Stockholders pursuant to this Section 6.18 shall be treated as Confidential
Information and held by the Stockholders in accordance with Section 6.9.

Section 6.19 Updates to Disclosure Schedule. From time to time prior to the
Closing, the Representative shall have the right (but not the obligation) to
deliver to Buyer one or more supplements to the Disclosure Schedule with
respect to any matter hereafter arising or of which the Representative becomes
aware after the date hereof (each a "Schedule Supplement"). Schedule
Supplements shall be deemed to be provided to Buyer for informational purposes
only so as to notify Buyer of the facts and information therein prior to the
Closing, and no Schedule Supplement shall be deemed to be incorporated into
or modify or become part of the Disclosure Schedule or the content thereof or
to qualify or modify the representations and warranties of the Company and the
Stockholders set forth in herein in any way. The Company and the Stockholders
agree and acknowledge that the Buyer has negotiated the provisions of this
Agreement, including the representations, warranties, covenants, and
indemnification obligations of the Company, the Representative, and
the Stockholders, as applicable, in reliance on the disclosures set forth in
the Disclosure Schedule as delivered to Buyer simultaneously with the
execution and delivery of this Agreement, and Buyer shall be entitled to rely
on the representations and warranties of the Company and the Stockholders set
forth herein (as qualified by the Disclosure Schedule) and pursue any rights
and remedies available to Buyer hereunder with respect to any breach of such
representations and warranties (as qualified by the Disclosure Schedule) in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, regardless of any Schedule
Supplement delivered to Buyer after the date hereof.

 



54 ARTICLE VII

 

CERTAIN TAX MATTERS

 

Section 7.1 Tax Filings.

 

(a) Except as provided in Section 7.1(b), the Company shall prepare and timely
file, or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns in
respect of the Company that are required to be filed (taking into account any
extension) on or before the Closing Date, and the Company shall pay, or cause
to be paid, all Taxes of the Company due on or before the Closing Date.
Such Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a
manner consistent with the past practices of the Company with respect to such
items, except as required by applicable Law. At least fifteen (15) days prior
to the due date (taking into account any extension) for the filing of such
Tax Returns, the Company shall deliver a draft of such Tax Returns to the
Buyer for the Buyers review and approval (which approval shall not be
unreasonably withheld).

 

(b) The Representative on behalf of the Stockholders shall prepare and timely
file, or shall cause to be prepared and timely filed, the final U.S. federal
and applicable state Income Tax Returns for the Company for the taxable period
ending on or prior to the Closing Date (the "Final Short Period Income Tax
Returns") in accordance with the provisions of this Section 7.1(b).

(i) The Final Short Period Income Tax Returns shall be prepared by treating
items on such returns in a manner consistent with the past practices of the
Company with respect to such items, except as required by applicable Law.
Except for any Final Short Period Income Tax Return that is subject to a
dispute as provided in clause (ii) below, the Representative shall deliver to
the Buyer such Final Short Period Income Tax Returns for execution and filing
at least ten (10) days prior to the due date (as extended) of such Final Short
Period Income Tax Returns. The Company shall have an appropriate officer of
the Company sign and timely file such Final Short Period Income Tax Returns in
accordance with the written instructions provided by the Representative;
provided, that the Stockholders (and not the Buyer or the Company) shall be
responsible for the completeness and accuracy of any such Final Short Period
Income Tax Returns and the payment of any Taxes due on any of such Final Short
Period Income Tax Returns filed pursuant to this Section 7.1(b), except to
the extent any such Taxes are taken into account as Indebtedness or a Current
Liability in the computation of Final Net Working Capital, in which event, the
Buyer shall pay or cause the Company to pay (or reimburse the Representative
on behalf of the Stockholders for) any such Taxes to the extent of such
provision. The Parties shall treat the taxable year of the Company as ending
on the Closing Date where required or allowable by Law and shall allocate
income to the period ending on the Closing Date based on a closing of the
books as of the Closing Date.

 



55 (ii) The Representative shall provide the Buyer with drafts of such Final
Short Period Income Tax Returns a minimum of forty-five (45) days prior to
the due date (as extended) so that the Buyer has a reasonable opportunity to
review such Final Short Period Income Tax Returns prior to the due date (as
extended) and provide comments with respect thereto. The Buyer shall promptly
advise the Representative of any disagreement with items shown on such Final
Short Period Income Tax Returns. If the Buyer and the Representative are
unable to resolve any such disagreement, the disputed Final Short Period
shall be referred to the Accounting Firm, which firm shall be directed to
resolve such dispute as promptly as possible. The fees of such Accounting Firm
shall be allocated between the Buyer and the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders) in the manner set forth in Section 1.3(b)(iii)(D) above. The
decision of such Accounting Firm shall be final and binding upon all parties
absent fraud or gross negligence. In the event the decision of such
Accounting Firm requires the filing of an amended Tax Return, Stockholders
and the Representative shall be responsible for causing to be filed all
amended Tax Returns (in the manner provided in Section 7.1(b)(i) for execution
and filing) and the Stockholders shall be responsible for the payment, if
any, of any additional Tax (including penalties and interest thereon) due and
payable with respect thereto, and the Stockholders shall be entitled to any
overpayment of Tax pursuant to such amended Tax Return. This dispute
resolution mechanism is referred to as the "Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism."

(c) Tax Returns of the Company not described in the preceding provisions of
this Section 7.1 which relate to a Pre-Closing Tax Period (other than a
Straddle Period) but which are not required to be filed until after the
Closing Date shall be prepared and filed in accordance with the procedures
and the Tax Dispute Resolution Mechanism set forth in Section 7.1(b) above,
except that if the due date for any such Tax Return does not allow for such
Tax Return to be submitted to the Buyer for its review within a minimum of
forty-five (45) days prior to such due date, such Tax Return shall be
submitted to the Buyer as soon as reasonably possible prior to such due date
for its review. The Stockholders shall pay any Taxes resulting from the
filing of any such Tax Returns except to the extent any such Taxes are taken
into account as Indebtedness or a Current Liability in the computation of
Final Net Working Capital, in which event, the Buyer shall pay or cause the
Company to pay (or reimburse the Representative on behalf of the Stockholders
for) any such Taxes to the extent of such provision.

(d) The Buyer shall prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and
timely filed, any Tax Return required to be filed by the Company for a
Straddle Period (a "Straddle Period Tax Return"). At least thirty (30) days
prior to the due date (taking into account any extension) for the filing of
such Tax Returns, the Buyer shall deliver a draft of such Straddle Period Tax
Return to the Representative for the Representatives review and approval
(which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld). With respect to Taxes of
the Company relating to a Straddle Period, the Buyer shall have the right to
recover from the Escrow Fund the amount of such Taxes allocable to the portion
of the Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period, except to the extent
any such Taxes are taken into account as Indebtedness or a Current Liability
in the computation of Final Net Working Capital, in which event, the Buyer
shall pay or cause the Company to pay (or reimburse the Representative on
behalf of the Stockholders

 



56  for) any such Taxes to the extent of such provision. The portion of any Tax
that is allocable to the Pre-Closing Tax Period will be: (i) in the case of
real, personal and intangible property Taxes and similar ad valorem Taxes,
deemed to be the amount of such Taxes for the entire Straddle Period
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of calendar
days of such Straddle Period in the Pre-Closing Tax Period and
the denominator of which is the number of calendar days in the entire
Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of all other Taxes, determined as though
the taxable year of the Company terminated at the close of business on the
Closing Date.

 

Section 7.2 Tax Refunds. The Representative (on behalf of the Stockholders)
shall be entitled to any refund of Taxes attributable to a Pre-Closing Tax
Period (and any interest thereon paid by a Governmental Entity) which refund
is actually received by the Buyer after the Closing, net of any cost to Buyer
attributable to obtaining such refund, except to the extent that (i) such
refund arises as the result of a carryback of a loss or other tax benefit from
a Tax period (or portion thereof) beginning after the Closing Date or such
refund was included in the computation of Final Net Working Capital. Any
amended Tax Returns or claims for refund shall be prepared and filed in
accordance with the methodology set forth in Section 7.1(b). Within ten (10)
days of the receipt of any such Tax refunds, the Buyer shall pay, or cause the
Company to pay, the amount to which the Representative (on behalf of the
Stockholders) is entitled pursuant to this Section 7.2 to the Representative;
provided however, to the extent any such refund is subsequently disallowed or
required to be returned, in whole or in part, to the applicable Governmental
Entity, the Representative shall promptly repay such amount, together with any
interest, penalties or other additional amounts imposed by such Tax Authority,
to Buyer.

 

Section 7.3 Cooperation. Buyer, the Representative and the Company agree to
furnish or cause to be furnished to one another, upon request, as promptly as
practicable, such information and assistance relating to Taxes of the Company,
including access to books and records, as is reasonably necessary for the
filing of all Tax Returns by Buyer, the Representative or the Company, the
making of any election relating to Taxes, the preparation for any audit by any
Governmental Entity and the prosecution or defense of any claim, suit or
proceeding relating to any Tax. Buyer, the Representative and the Company
agree to retain all books and records with respect to Tax matters pertinent
to the Company relating to any Pre-Closing Tax Period until the expiration of
the applicable statute of limitations, and to abide by all record retention
agreements entered into with any Governmental Entity.

Section 7.4 Transfer Taxes. All sales, recording, transfer, valued added,

similar event, a "Tax Matter"). Any failure to so notify the other party of
any Tax Matter shall not relieve such other party of any liability with
respect to such Tax Matters except to the extent such party was actually
prejudiced as a result thereof.

(b) Buyer shall have sole control of the conduct of all Tax Matters, including
any settlement or compromise thereof, provided, however, that Buyer shall
keep the Representative reasonably informed of the progress of any Tax Matter
and shall not effect any such settlement or compromise with respect to which

the Representative, which shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. The
Representative shall be entitled, at its own expense, to participate in any
Tax Matter, provided however, that Buyer shall be entitled to control the

(a) Notice. A Buyer Indemnified Party or Stockholder Indemnified Party making
an indemnification claim under this ARTICLE IX is referred to as the
"Indemnified Party" with respect to such indemnification claim and the Party
or Parties against whom such claim is asserted under this ARTICLE IX are each
referred to as an "Indemnifying Party" (which term includes all indemnifying
parties if more than one, as applicable) with respect to such claim. As soon
as reasonably practicable after any Indemnified Party hereto becomes aware of
any claim that has resulted in or could reasonably be expected to result in
Damages that any such Indemnified Party has under this ARTICLE IX against
another Party hereto, the Indemnified Party shall deliver to the Indemnifying
Party a certificate signed by the Indemnified Party or its duly
authorized representative (a "Claim Notice"):

(i) stating that an Indemnified Party has incurred, paid or properly accrued,
or reasonably anticipates that it may incur, pay or properly accrue, Damages;

(ii) stating the amount of such Damages (which, in the case of Damages not
yet incurred, paid or properly accrued, may be the maximum amount in good
faith anticipated to be incurred, paid or properly accrued, if ascertainable);
and

 

(iii) specifying in reasonable detail (based upon the information then
possessed by Indemnified Party) the individual items of such Damages included
in the amount so stated (if ascertainable) and the nature of the claim to
which such Damages are related.

(b) Limitation on Time to Initiate Certain Claims.

(i) Except as set forth in Section 9.4(b)(ii), any claim for indemnification
under Section 9.2(a) or Section 9.3(a) must be asserted by written notice
within the applicable survival period set forth in Section 9.1(a). If any such
claim has been asserted in writing and is a pending claim prior to the
expiration of the applicable representation or warranty, such representation
or warranty and the associated rights of indemnification shall survive with
respect to such claim until such claim has been resolved.

 

(ii) Any claim for indemnification under Section 9.2(a) (solely relating to
breach of a representation or warranty under Section 2.14(f) arising out of
the Network Intrusion Matter or Other Cybersecurity Matters or under Section
2.15), Section 9.2(i) (but in the case of Section 9.2(i), only to the extent
that such indemnification claim arises out of the Network Intrusion Matter or
Other Cybersecurity Matters), Section 9.2(j), or Section 9.2(k) (but in the
case of Section 9.2(k) only to the extent such indemnification claim relates
to the defense of any Third-Party Claim alleging the occurrence of facts or
circumstances that, if true, regardless of the outcome of such defense, would
entitle a Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to Section
9.2(a) (solely relating to breach of a representation or warranty under
Section 2.14(f) (but in the case of Section 2.14(f), only to the extent that
such breach of

 



67  representation or warranty arises out of the Network Intrusion Matter or
Other Cybersecurity Matters) or under Section 2.15), Section 9.2(i) (but in
the case of Section 9.2(i) only to the extent that such claim for
indemnification arises out of the Network Intrusion Matter or Other
Cybersecurity Matters), or Section 9.2(j)) (any such indemnification claim
described above in this Section 9.4(b)(ii) being a "Security Indemnity
Claim") must be asserted by written notice by the second (2nd) anniversary of
the Closing Date. If any such claim has been asserted in writing and is
a pending claim prior to the expiration of the second (2nd) anniversary of
the Closing Date, such claim and the associated rights of indemnification
shall survive with respect to such claim until such claim has been resolved.

(iii) Except as set forth in Section 9.4(b)(i) and Section 9.4(b)(ii) above,
claims for indemnification under this ARTICLE IX may be asserted at any time.

(iv) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, there shall be no
limitation on the time within which a claim based on fraud or intentional
misrepresentation on the part of any Party may be made.

 

(c) Delay. Subject to Section 9.4(b), no delay in or failure to give a Claim
Notice by an Indemnified Party to the Indemnifying Party (or to the
Representative in the case of a claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party) pursuant
to this Section 9.4 will adversely affect any of the other rights or remedies
that the Indemnified Party has under this Agreement, except and to the extent
that such delay or failure has actually materially prejudiced the Indemnifying
Party.

(d) Objections to Claims. An Indemnifying Party may object to any claim set
forth in such Claim Notice by delivering written notice to the Indemnified
Party (and, if applicable, to the Escrow Agent) of the Indemnifying Partys
objection (an "Indemnification Objection Notice"). Such Indemnification
Objection Notice must describe the grounds for such objection in reasonable
detail. If an Indemnification Objection Notice is not delivered by the
Indemnifying Party to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after
receipt by the Indemnifying Party of the Claim Notice (the "Indemnification
Objection Period"), such failure to so object shall be an irrevocable
acknowledgment by the Indemnifying Party that the Indemnified Party is
entitled to indemnification under ARTICLE IX for the full amount of the
Damages set forth in such Claim Notice.

(e) Resolution of Objections to Claims. If an Indemnifying Party shall object
in writing during the Indemnification Objection Period to any claim or claims
by an Indemnified Party made in any Claim Notice, the Indemnified Party shall
have thirty (30) days after its receipt of the Indemnification Objection
Notice to respond in a written statement to such objection. If after such
thirty (30)-day period there remains a dispute as to any claims, the
Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall attempt in good faith for
twenty (20) days thereafter to agree upon the rights of the respective parties
with respect to each of such claims. If Buyer and the Representative agree to
a resolution of such objection, and cash remains in the account within the
Escrow Fund relating to the applicable Escrow Amount, then Buyer and the
Representative shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Escrow Agent a
statement setting

 



68  forth such conclusively resolved matters and directing the Escrow Agent to
distribute cash from the Escrow Fund in accordance with the terms of such
statement. If no such agreement can be reached after good faith negotiation,
each of the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party shall meet within ten
(10) days of the expiration of such twenty (20)-day period and negotiate in
good faith for one day with an impartial mediator mutually agreed to by the
parties in Boston, Massachusetts. The costs of the mediator shall be equally
borne by the Stockholders, on the one hand, and by the Buyer, on the other
hand. If no agreement can be reached after good faith mediation, each of
the Indemnifying Party and the Indemnified Party may, subject to Section
9.10, bring suit to resolve the objection.

(f) Delivery to Escrow Agent. If, at the time of delivery of any Claim Notice
to the Representative (or of any Indemnification Objection Notice by the
Representative or response thereto by Buyer), cash remains in the account
within the Escrow Fund relating to the applicable Escrow Amount, a duplicate
copy of such Claim Notice or Indemnification Objection Notice (or response
thereto) shall be delivered to the Escrow Agent by or on behalf of the
Indemnified Party.

 

(g) For purposes of this ARTICLE IX, in the case of any indemnification claim
asserted by a Buyer Indemnified Party any references to the Indemnifying
Party (except provisions relating to an obligation to make any payments) shall
be deemed to refer to the Representative.

 

Section 9.5 Third-Party Claims.

 

(a) In the event that an Indemnified Party desires to make a claim against an
Indemnifying Party in connection with any third-party Legal Proceeding at any
time instituted against or made upon it for which it may seek indemnification
hereunder (a "Third-Party Claim"), the Indemnified Party will promptly notify
in writing the Indemnifying Party of such Third-Party Claim and of its claims
of indemnification with respect thereto; _provided_ , that failure or delay to
promptly give such notice will not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
indemnification obligations under this ARTICLE IX with respect to such claim,
except to the extent, if any, that the Indemnifying Party has actually been
materially prejudiced thereby.

(b) Except in the case of Third-Party Claims (A) in which the remedy sought
in such Third-Party Claim includes an injunction or equitable relief against
the Indemnified Party, or (B) such Third-Party Claim arises in connection with
a criminal proceeding against the Indemnified Party (in the case of any of
which the provisions of Section 9.5(d) shall apply), the Indemnifying Party
will have the right to assume the defense of the Third-Party Claim
with counsel of its choice reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party
by written notice to the Indemnified Party within thirty (30) days after the
Indemnifying Party has received notice of the Third-Party Claim; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that the Indemnifying Party may only assume control of such
defense if (x) it acknowledges in writing to the Indemnified Party that any
damages, fines, costs or other liabilities that may be assessed against the
Indemnified Party in connection with such Third-Party Claim shall constitute
Damages for which the Buyer shall be indemnified pursuant to this ARTICLE IX,
and (y) in the case of a claim by a Buyer Indemnified Party, the claimant
seeks the recovery of a sum of money that does not exceed either the General
Escrow Cap or the Special Escrow Cap with respect to any Damages

 



69  indemnifiable under the applicable provision of Section 9.2 (as set forth in
the limitations on the indemnification obligations of the Stockholders
provided in Section 9.7), and  _provided further_ , in each case, that (i)
the Indemnifying Party shall take reasonable steps to conduct the defense of
the Third-Party Claim actively and diligently, and (ii) the Indemnified Party
may retain separate co-counsel at its sole cost and expense and participate in
the defense of the Third-Party Claim.

 

(c) The Indemnifying Party will not consent to the entry of any Order or enter
into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim without the prior
consent of the Indemnified Party (which will not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed) unless the Order or proposed settlement (i) includes an unconditional
release of all liability of each Indemnified Party with respect to such
Third-Party Claim, and (ii) involves only the payment of money damages by the
Indemnifying Party and does not impose an injunction or other equitable relief
upon the Indemnified Party. So long as the Indemnifying Party has assumed and
is conducting the defense of the Third-Party Claim in accordance with Section
9.5(b) above, the Indemnified Party will not consent to the entry of any
Order or enter into any settlement with respect to the Third-Party Claim
without the prior written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed).

 

(d) In the event the Indemnifying Party does not or is not entitled to assume
the defense of a Third-Party Claim, (i) the Indemnified Party may defend
against, and consent to the entry of any Order or enter in any settlement with
respect to the Third-Party Claim (with the prior consent of the Indemnifying
Party, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed), and (ii) the Indemnifying
Party will remain responsible for any Damages the Indemnified Party may suffer
as a result of such Third-Party Claim to the extent provided herein.

(e) The Parties shall cooperate with each other in all reasonable respects in
connection with the defense of any Third-Party Claim, including making
available records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing, without
expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to
the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may
be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim (subject in each case to any request by the disclosing party for the
receiving party to enter into a customary nondisclosure agreement on terms
reasonably acceptable to the disclosing party and the receiving party).

 

Section 9.6 Payment of Claims.

 

(a) Subject to the other terms of this ARTICLE IX, including the limitations
to the Stockholders indemnification obligations set forth in this Section
9.7, in order to satisfy any indemnification obligations of the Stockholders
to the Buyer pursuant to this ARTICLE IX, the Buyer (and each of the Buyer
Indemnified Parties) shall have the right to recover Damages, and
such obligations shall be satisfied: (i) first, from the account within the
Escrow Fund relating to the applicable Escrow Amount and all interest and
investment income thereon to the extent available and subject to the terms of
the Escrow Agreement as set forth in Section 9.6(b) below, (ii) second, at
the option of the Buyer, by offsetting against any payment of Contingent
Purchase Price, to the extent such amount (A) is or becomes due and payable
pursuant to Section 1.4 and _Exhibit C_ and (B) is held back from payment in
accordance with Section 1.4(g), and (iii) thereafter, directly from the
Stockholders by wire transfer of immediately available funds.

 



70 (b) Any payments from the Escrow Fund with respect to Damages indemnifiable
pursuant to any claim under Section 9.2 that is not a Security Indemnity
Claim shall be exclusively paid out of the account within the Escrow Fund
relating to the General Escrow Amount and not the account within the Escrow
Fund relating to the Special Escrow Amount. Any payments from the Escrow Fund
with respect to Damages indemnifiable pursuant to any claim under Section 9.2
that is a Security Indemnity Claim shall be exclusively paid out of the
account within the Escrow Fund relating to the Special Escrow Amount and not
the account within the Escrow Fund relating to the General Escrow Amount.

(c) Upon the determination of an amount due and payable under this ARTICLE IX
directly from the Stockholders or from Buyer, such amount shall be paid within
ten (10) Business Days after the date of determination.

9.2(h), Section 9.2(i) (but in the case of Section 9.2(i) only to the extent
that such claims are not Security Indemnity Claims), and Section 9.2(k) (but
in the case of Section 9.2(k) only to the extent such claims arise from
defending any Third-Party Claim alleging the occurrence of facts or
circumstances that, if true, regardless of the outcome of such defense, would
entitle a Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant to any of
Section 9.2(a) (other than with respect to breaches of Key Representations and
Security Indemnity Claims) and claims under Section 9.2(h) or Section 9.2(i)
(but in the case of Section 9.2(i) only to the extent that such claims are
not Security Indemnity Claims), an amount equal to, as of any applicable time,
(A) all amounts actually deposited into the Escrow Fund in respect of the
General Escrow Amount __plus__ (B) all interest and investment income
thereon, __less__ (C) any amounts actually released to the Representative and
the Stockholders from the Escrow Fund in respect of the General Escrow Amount
prior to such applicable time (as of any applicable time, the "General Escrow
Cap");

(ii) with respect to any breaches of any of the Key Representations (other
than Section 2.15) and Section 9.2(k) (but in the case of Section 9.2(k) only
to the extent such Damages arise from defending any Third-Party Claim alleging
the occurrence of facts or circumstances that, if true, regardless of the
outcome of such defense, would entitle a Buyer Indemnified Party to
indemnification pursuant to Section 9.2(a) (solely with respect to breaches of
Key Representations other than Section 2.15)), an amount equal to the sum of
(x) the Initial Purchase Price, _plus_ (y) the full amount of each Contingent
Purchase Price Payment paid or otherwise payable by the Buyer to the
Stockholders pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, _plus_ (z) any amounts
paid to the Stockholders as a purchase price adjustment pursuant to Section
1.3(c)(i) (the "Purchase Price Cap");

 



71 (iii) with respect to all claims under Section 9.2(b) through Section 9.2(g)
and Section 9.2(k) (but in the case of Section 9.2(k) only to the extent such
Damages arise from defending any Third-Party Claim alleging the occurrence of
facts or circumstances that, if true, regardless of the outcome of such
defense, would entitle a Buyer Indemnified Party to indemnification pursuant
to any of Section 9.2(b) through Section 9.2(g)), an amount equal to, the
Purchase Price Cap;

 

(iv) with respect to all Security Indemnity Claims, an amount equal to, as of
any applicable time, (A) all amounts actually deposited into the Escrow Fund
in respect of the Special Indemnity Amount __plus__ (B) all interest and
investment income thereon, _ _less__ (C) any amounts actually released to the
Representative and the Stockholders from the Escrow Fund in respect of the
Special Escrow Amount prior to such applicable time (as of any applicable
time, the "Special Escrow Cap");

 

(b) Anything to the contrary contained herein notwithstanding, the
Stockholders shall not be obligated to indemnify the Buyer
Indemnified Parties with respect to any claim for indemnification resulting
from or arising out of matters described in Section 9.2 unless and until the
aggregate amount of all such claims exceeds $400,000 (the "Threshold"), in
which event the Buyer Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the
full amount of Damages (including any amounts of Damages within the Threshold)
resulting from or arising out of such matters, _provided_ that, the Threshold
limits imposed by this Section 9.7(b) shall not apply to any Damages (i)
indemnifiable under Section 9.2(a) solely with respect to any Key
Representation, (ii) indemnifiable with respect to any Security Indemnity
Claim, (iii) indemnifiable under Section 9.2(f) (solely with respect to Taxes
arising in connection with the transactions contemplated by the 2014 Share
Transfer Documents), or (iv) arising out of or in connection with any
intentional or willful breaches of this Agreement, or actual fraud or
intentional misrepresentation.

(c) In all cases in determining whether there has been a breach of
a representation or warranty by any Party for purposes of this Agreement, or
in determining the amount of any Damages with respect to a breach of a
representation or warranty by any Party for purposes of this Agreement, such
representations and warranties shall be read without regard to any
materiality qualifier (including any reference to Company Material Adverse
Effect) contained therein.

 

(d) In no event shall the Buyer Indemnified Parties be entitled to recover
from any Stockholder under this ARTICLE IX an amount greater than such
amounts as have actually been paid to such Stockholder pursuant to this
Agreement (including any Contingent Purchase Price Payments), except in the
case of intentional or willful breaches of this Agreement, or actual fraud.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the limitations on liability
imposed by this Section 9.7 shall not apply to any Damages arising out of or
in connection with any intentional or willful breaches of this Agreement, or
actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation.

 



72 (e) No Indemnifying Party shall be obligated to indemnify any Indemnified
Party with respect to any Damages to the extent that such Damages were
previously taken into account in the calculation of Final Net Working Capital.

(f) All Damages recoverable by an Indemnified Party from an Indemnifying
Party pursuant to this ARTICLE IX shall be net of insurance proceeds actually
received by such Indemnified Party and any other amounts such Indemnified
Party actually recovers from third parties, in each case solely to the extent
that such insurance proceeds or other amounts directly relate to such Damages.
In any case where an Indemnified Party recovers, under insurance policies or
from other third parties, any amount in respect of a matter for which such
Indemnified Party was indemnified pursuant to this ARTICLE IX, such
Indemnified Party shall promptly pay over to the applicable Indemnifying Party
the amount so recovered (after deducting therefrom the amount of the expenses
(including increases in premiums) incurred by such Indemnified Party in
procuring such recovery); _provided_ , _however_ , that no Indemnified Party
shall be required to pay over to the applicable Indemnifying Party any
amount so recovered under such insurance policies or from such other third
parties to the extent (but only to the extent) that such amount so recovered
was previously taken into account pursuant to the first sentence of this
Section 9.7(f).

 

Section 9.8 Treatment of Indemnity Payments. Any payment made pursuant to this
ARTICLE IX shall be treated as an adjustment to the Purchase Price by the
parties for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Law.

Section 9.9 Remedy. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that, except (i) in
the case where a Party seeks to obtain specific performance pursuant to
Section 11.13 or (ii) as otherwise expressly provided for in this Agreement,
its sole and exclusive remedy following the Closing Date with respect to any
and all claims under or relating to this Agreement shall be pursuant to the
indemnification provisions set forth in this ARTICLE IX; _provided_ ,
_however_ , that no Party hereto shall be deemed to have waived any rights,
claims, causes of action or remedies to the extent (x) based upon actual fraud
or intentional misrepresentation or (y) such rights, claims, causes of action
or remedies may not be waived under applicable Law.

 

Section 9.10 Right to Bring Action; No Contribution. Each Stockholder waives,
and acknowledges and agrees that such Stockholder shall not have and shall
not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of
contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Company
in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other liability to
which such Stockholder may become subject under or in connection with this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this ARTICLE IX or elsewhere in this
Agreement to the contrary, only the Representative shall have the right, power
and authority to commence or prosecute any action, suit or proceeding, by and
on behalf of any or all Stockholders against Buyer, the Company, or any other
Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with Buyers obligations under this
Agreement, and in no event shall any Stockholder himself, herself or itself
have the right to commence or prosecute any action, suit or proceeding against
Buyer, the Company, or any other Buyer Indemnified Party in connection with
Buyers obligations under this Agreement.

(b) by Buyer if there has been a breach in any material respect on the part of
the Company or any Stockholder, or by the Representative if there has been a
breach in any material respect on the part of Buyer, in each case of the
representations and warranties or covenants (which in the case of any breach
of covenant has not been cured within thirty (30) days after
written notification thereof by the terminating Party to the other Party) of
the non-terminating Party set forth in this Agreement, in either case to the
extent such breach would cause a condition to the terminating Partys
obligation to close not to be satisfied, or if events have occurred which
have made it impossible to satisfy a condition precedent to the terminating
Partys obligations to consummate the transactions contemplated hereby, unless
such terminating Partys willful breach of this Agreement has caused the
condition to be unsatisfied;

(c) by either Buyer or the Representative if the Closing has not occurred on
or prior to December 31, 2015; _provided_ that neither Buyer nor the
Representative will be entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this

prevented satisfaction of the conditions or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby at or prior to such time;

(d) by Buyer if there is a Company Material Adverse Effect; or

(e) by Buyer if there shall have been any action taken, or any Law enacted,
promulgated or issued or deemed applicable to the Transactions, by any
Governmental Entity which would: (i) prohibit Buyers or the Companys or its
Subsidiarys ownership or operation of any portion of the business of the
Company and its Subsidiaries or (ii) compel Buyer or any of its Affiliates to
dispose of or hold separate, as a result of the Transactions, any portion of
the business or assets of Buyer or any of its Affiliates (including, after the
Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries).

Section 10.2 Effect of Termination. In the event of termination of this
Agreement by either Buyer or the Representative as provided above, this
Agreement will forthwith become void and there will be no liability hereunder
on the part of any Party, except for the provisions set forth in Section 6.1,
this Section 10.2, and ARTICLE XI, which shall remain in full force and
effect, and except (i) that nothing herein will relieve any Party from any
liability resulting or arising from any breach of this Agreement prior to such
termination, and (ii) Section 9.2 of the letter agreement regarding Proposed
Acquisition of Marvasol, Inc. (d/b/a LastPass), dated as of June 10, 2015,
between LogMeIn, Inc. and the Company, shall survive any termination of this

provision will be fully severable, (b) this Agreement will be construed and
enforced as if such illegal, invalid or unenforceable provision had
never comprised a part hereof, (c) the remaining provisions of this Agreement

     | Re: | _Amendment to Stock Purchase Agreement Concerning E*Trade
Matters_ 
---|---|--- 

Dear Joe:

 

Reference is hereby made to the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated October 8,
2015, between LogMeIn, Inc. ("Buyer"), Marvasol, Inc. d/b/a "LastPass" (the
"Company"), the Stockholders of the Company referred to therein, and the
Representative Referred therein (the "Purchase Agreement"). Capitalized terms
used without definition herein shall have the meanings provided in the
Purchase Agreement.

As we discussed, each of Buyer, the Company, and the Representative hereby
agree with respect to the indemnification obligations of the Stockholders
under Article IX of the Purchase Agreement that, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary set forth in the Purchase Agreement, including Article IX of the
Purchase Agreement:

1\. "E*Trade Claim" shall mean any claim for indemnification under Section 9.2
of the Purchase Agreement directly or indirectly resulting from or relating
to the E*TRADE Matters.

2\. The Representative (including on behalf of the Stockholders) and the
Company acknowledge and agree that any Damages suffered or incurred by any
Buyer Indemnified Party with respect to any E*Trade Claim set forth in a Claim
Notice delivered to the Representative within the applicable time period set
forth in Section 9.4(b) of the Purchase Agreement shall be Damages for the
full amount of which the applicable Buyer Indemnified Party is entitled to
indemnification under Article IX of the Purchase Agreement (subject to
any applicable limitations on liability as set forth in Article IX of the
Purchase Agreement, as modified by paragraphs 4 and 5 of this letter agreement
below).

 

3\. Any E*Trade Claim shall be deemed not to be a Security Indemnity Claim. 4\. The maximum aggregate liability of the Stockholders for indemnification
pursuant to Article IX of the Purchase Agreement with respect to all E*Trade
Claims will not exceed an amount equal to $500,000 (the "E*Trade Cap"). The
amount of Damages within the E*Trade Cap for which the Buyer Indemnified
Parties receive indemnification payments from the Stockholders (including
from the Escrow Fund) pursuant to Article IX of the Purchase Agreement with
respect to any E*Trade Claims shall be taken into account when determining
whether the General Escrow Cap and/or the Purchase Price Cap described in
Section 9.7(a) of the Purchase Agreement have been met with respect to
indemnification claims under Section 9.2 of the Purchase Agreement generally.

 

5\. The Stockholders shall not be obligated to indemnify the Buyer Indemnified
Parties pursuant to Article IX of the Purchase Agreement with respect to any
E*Trade Claim unless and until the aggregate amount of all E*Trade Claims
exceeds $25,000 (the "E*Trade Threshold"), in which event the Buyer
Indemnified Parties shall be entitled to recover the full amount of
Damages (including any amounts of Damages within the E*Trade Threshold)
resulting from or arising out of such matters. Any amount of Damages within
the E*Trade Threshold that are suffered or incurred by any Buyer Indemnified
Party with respect to any E*Trade Claims shall be taken into account when
determining whether the Threshold described in Section 9.7(b) of the Purchase
Agreement has been met with respect to indemnification claims under Section
9.2 of the Purchase Agreement generally.

6\. Without limiting any of other restrictions or limitations set forth in
Section 9.5 of the Purchase Agreement, the Indemnifying Party may not assume
control of the defense (pursuant to Section 9.5 of the Purchase Agreement) of
an E*Trade Claim that is a Third-Party Claim if the claimant seeks the
recovery of a sum of money that exceeds the E*Trade Cap (after taking into
account all Damages with respect to any other E*Trade Claims) with respect to
any Damages indemnifiable under any applicable provisions of Section 9.2 of
the Purchase Agreement (as set forth in the limitations on
the indemnification obligations of the Stockholders provided in Section 9.7
of the Purchase Agreement, as modified by this letter agreement).

 

7\. The Stockholders have received from E*TRADE Financial Corporation
("E*TRADE") and provided to Buyer a draft Settlement Agreement with respect
to the E*TRADE Matters. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that in the event Buyer
engages in litigation with E*TRADE for the purpose of retaining or obtaining
the right to use the single-asterisk logos attached hereto as  _Exhibit A_ ,
this letter agreement shall be null and void _ab initio_.

Upon execution and delivery of this letter agreement by the Buyer, the
Company, and the Representative, this letter agreement shall be deemed to
amend the Purchase Agreement, solely to the extent specifically set forth
herein, and shall become a part of the Purchase Agreement, provided that no
term or provision of the Purchase Agreement shall be amended, waived or
affected by this letter agreement, except as specifically set forth in this
letter agreement, and any and all terms and provisions of the Purchase
Agreement not affected by this letter agreement shall remain in full force
and effect in all respects in accordance with their respective terms.

Each party hereto represents and warrants to each other party hereto that:
(i) such party has all requisite power and authority to execute and deliver
this letter agreement and to perform its obligations hereunder, (ii) the
execution and delivery by such party of this letter agreement has been duly
and validly authorized by all necessary action on the part of such party,
(iii) this letter agreement has been duly and validly executed and delivered
by such party and, assuming the due authorization, execution and delivery by
the other parties hereto (other than such party),  constitutes valid and binding obligations of such party, enforceable against
such party in accordance with its terms, subject, in the case of
enforceability, to the Bankruptcy and Equitable Remedies Exception.

This letter agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
the domestic Laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to any
choice of law or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the State of
Delaware or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the
Laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of Delaware. 

This letter agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts, which, when
taken together, shall be deemed to be one and the same instrument.
