On the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date, the Escrow Agent shall deliver the funds in the Escrow Account as directed by the Shareholder Representative (and the Escrow Agent is hereby entitled to rely on such direction); _provided, however_ , in the event that Buyer has then timely and properly submitted claims against such Escrow Account to the Shareholder Representative, the parties hereto agree that the Escrow Account (or such portion of the Escrow Account as shall be encumbered by timely and properly submitted claims) shall be maintained by the Escrow Agent for an additional ninety (90) days following the one (1) year anniversary of the Closing Date (the " _Fifteen-Month Anniversary_ ").

written instructions to the Escrow Agent to release funds in the Escrow
Account to Buyer where Buyer has made a proper and timely indemnification
claim (including under _Section 2.5(c)_ below) and the amount of such claim
has been finally determined by the parties pursuant to the provisions of this
Agreement. Buyer agrees to promptly (and, in any event, within three (3)

instruction provided to the Escrow Agent by the Shareholder Representative in

On the Closing Date, Buyer shall repay the Closing Date Indebtedness shown on the Closing Date Net Debt Report to the applicable obligees thereof by wire transfer as directed by the Company. The parties agree that Excess Net Debt, if any, (but not the aggregate amount of Indebtedness) shall reduce the Closing Payment on a dollar for dollar basis as contemplated by _Section 2.3(a)_.

In the event that the foregoing calculation results in a Seller being entitled to receive a fractional share of Buyer Common Stock (and Buyer is unable or unwilling to permit such fractional share ownership among its stockholders generally), in lieu of such fractional share, Buyer shall pay to such Seller an amount in cash equal to the value of such fractional share based upon the Issue Price. 

  

 (e) At the Closing, in order to establish a fund to, among other things, pay the costs and expenses of the Shareholder Representative and the Sellers after the Closing (including any and all costs and expenses arising from any dispute or disagreement involving this Agreement or Buyer), Buyer shall remit to the Escrow Agent, to be deposited into an account separate and apart from the Escrow Account (the " _Expense Account_ "), an amount equal to $2,000,000 (the " _Expense Reserve Amount_ ") to be held by the Escrow Agent for the benefit of the Sellers pursuant to the terms of the Expense Agreement. Buyer shall have no interest whatsoever in the Expense Account (which has _not_ been set aside as security for the Sellers\' or the Company\'s obligations hereunder) and the Escrow Agent shall take instruction in connection therewith exclusively from the Shareholder Representative. Once deposited with the Escrow Agent, Buyer disclaims any and all right, title or interest in, to or under the Expense Reserve Amount. For income Tax reporting purposes, the Sellers shall be regarded as the owners of the Expense Account.

Each of the Closing Date Balance Sheet, schedule of Closing Date Working Capital and Schedule of Differences (together, the " _Final Determination Documents_ ") shall be prepared by Buyer in good faith in accordance with this Agreement (including the definition of Working Capital contained herein) and in accordance with GAAP, consistently applied (but without giving effect to the Closing). Michel M. Fournier shall be provided with a reasonable opportunity to participate in, and be consulted during the preparation of, the Final Determination Documents and shall have the opportunity to review the Final Determination Documents prior to the time that they shall be delivered to the Shareholder Representative; _provided, however_ , that in no event shall the Buyer\'s delivery of the Final Determination Documents to the Shareholder Representative be unreasonably delayed as a result of such review.

Buyer agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to provide access to the
necessary books and records of the Company electronically. If Buyer fails to

Estimated Working Capital proposed by the Company prior to Closing shall be
deemed, for all purposes hereunder, to be (and shall be conclusively regarded
as) the Final Working Capital.

  

 (b) If, within sixty (60) days following delivery of the Final Determination Documents to the Shareholder Representative, the Shareholder Representative has not delivered to Buyer written notice (the " _Objection Notice_ ") of her objections to the schedule of Closing Date Working Capital, including a statement describing in reasonable detail the basis of such objections, then Closing Date Working Capital, as set forth in such schedule, shall be deemed final and conclusive and shall be " _Final Working Capital_ ;" _provided_ , _however_ , the response period for the Objection Notice shall be extended to ninety (90) days in the event that the Final Determination Documents delivered by Buyer would, if accepted, result in an additional payment to Buyer under the terms hereof of $100,000 or more. If the Shareholder Representative delivers the Objection Notice within such prescribed period, then Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall endeavor in good faith to resolve the objections, for a period not to exceed thirty (30) days from the date of delivery of the Objection Notice. In the event that Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall resolve all objections set forth in the Objection Notice within such thirty (30) day period, Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall execute a memorandum setting forth (i) the resolved item(s) and/or amount(s) and (ii) Final Working Capital, as calculated based on such resolved item(s) and/or amount(s). If, however, at the end of the thirty (30) day period there are any objections that remain in dispute, then the remaining objections in dispute shall be submitted to an independent accounting firm (the " _Independent Auditor_ "), mutually agreeable to Buyer and the Shareholder Representative, which firm shall resolve any objections that remain in dispute. Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall use all commercially reasonable efforts to select the Independent Auditor within ten (10) days of the expiration of such period and to cause the Independent Auditor to resolve all disagreements as soon as practicable. The parties agree that (A) any Person proposed as an Independent Auditor must disclose, in writing to Buyer and the Shareholder Representative, any factors, relationships, current or prior engagements or similar matters that could reasonably be regarded as a conflict hereunder, (B) the Independent Auditor shall be retained jointly by Buyer and the Shareholder Representative, (C) the Independent Auditor shall be instructed by both the Shareholder Representative and Buyer, in writing within two (2) Business Days of its engagement, that it must remain neutral with respect to the dispute, (D) the Independent Auditor must make a final determination in accordance with a strict interpretation of the relevant provisions of this Agreement, (E) each will provide the Independent Auditor with such reasonable access to books, records and accounting information (including accountants\' work papers) as the Independent Auditor regards as reasonably related or necessary to its assignment hereunder, (F) it will not engage, nor permit any of its employees, advisors, agents or Representatives to engage, in any _ex parte_  communications with the Independent Auditor (it being the agreement between the parties that all communications between the Independent Auditor and any party shall be in writing, with a copy of the original communication, any response thereto and any other communication, to be delivered to the other party) and (G) the Independent Auditor will be required to provide a written report with respect to its determination hereunder. The determination by the Independent Auditor shall be binding on the parties and shall represent 

  

      

  

Final Working Capital, absent manifest error or a failure to adhere to the
express terms of this Agreement. The Independent Auditor shall also determine
the appropriate allocation of financial responsibility for the costs, fees
and expenses of the Independent Auditor incurred in connection with the
resolution of a dispute pursuant to this _Section 2.5(b)_. Each party shall
bear its own attorneys\' fees associated with a dispute pursuant to this
_Section 2.5(b)_.

  

 (c) If Final Working Capital as determined pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ is less than Estimated Working Capital, Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall jointly provide written instruction to the Escrow Agent to return to Buyer from the Escrow Account, within ten (10) days after Final Working Capital has been determined, an amount in cash equal to the dollar amount of such deficiency, without interest (the " _Working Capital Deficiency_ "); _provided, however_ , that if the dollar amount of the Working Capital Deficiency exceeds the amount in the Escrow Account, such amount (the amount by which the Working Capital Deficiency exceeds the amount of the Escrow Account, the " _Adjustments Deficiency_ ") shall constitute Losses for which Buyer is entitled to indemnification pursuant to _Article VII_. If Final Working Capital exceeds Estimated Working Capital, then Buyer will deliver to the Shareholder Representative (or as instructed by the Shareholder Representative), within ten (10) days after Final Working Capital has been determined, an amount in cash, without interest, equal to the Excess Working Capital. 

  

 (d) Any distribution of Excess Working Capital to the Shareholder Representative pursuant to _Section 2.5(c)_ shall be for the benefit of the Sellers as of immediately prior to the Closing, and shall be distributed by the Shareholder Representative to the Sellers in accordance with _Section 2.3(a)_. The parties agree that any Excess Working Capital payable by Buyer pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ shall be paid to the Sellers in their capacity as shareholders of the Company and does not constitute payment to any Person in their capacity as an employee or independent contractor of the Company or Buyer. Accordingly, the parties agree to report any Excess Working Capital paid pursuant to this _Section 2.5_ as an adjustment to the Purchase Price and, furthermore, each party agrees not to initiate any Tax filing or Tax-related Legal Proceeding in which such party takes a position inconsistent with the position expressed in the second sentence of this paragraph.

The execution, delivery and performance by Buyer of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents to which it is a party do not, and the consummation by Buyer of the transactions contemplated herein and therein will not, directly or indirectly (with or without due notice or lapse of time): (a) violate or result in any breach of any provision of the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of Buyer; (b) materially violate or result in a material violation or material breach of, or constitute a material default under, any of the terms, conditions or provisions of any material contract of Buyer or any other material agreement to which Buyer is a party; (c) subject to obtaining the Consents or making the registrations, declarations or filings set forth in the next sentence, materially violate any Applicable Law binding upon Buyer or by which or to which any of the assets owned, used or controlled by Buyer, is subject; or (d) result in the imposition or creation of any Lien on any asset of Buyer.

 Section 4.9 SEC Reports. 

  

  

 (a) Since December 31, 2009, Buyer has filed all forms, reports and documents with the SEC that have been required to be filed by it under Applicable Law prior to the date hereof, and Buyer will timely file prior to the Closing all forms, reports and documents with the SEC that are required to be filed by it under Applicable Law prior to such time (all such forms, reports and documents, together with all exhibits and schedules thereto, the " _SEC Reports_ "). Each of the consolidated balance sheets included in or incorporated by reference into the SEC Reports (including related notes and schedules) complied as to form in all material respects with the applicable accounting requirements and the published rules and regulations of the SEC with respect thereto and fairly presents in all material respects the consolidated financial position of Buyer and its subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) as of its date, and each of the consolidated statements of operations, cash flows and changes in stockholders\' equity included in or incorporated by reference into the SEC Reports (including any related notes and schedules) fairly presents in all material respects the results of operations, cash flows or changes in stockholders\' equity, as the case may be, of Buyer and its subsidiaries (or such entities as indicated in such balance sheet) for the periods set forth therein (subject, in the case of unaudited statements, to (i) such exceptions as may be permitted by Form 10-Q and (ii) normal, recurring year-end audit adjustments which are not material in the aggregate), in each case in accordance with GAAP consistently applied during the periods involved, except as may be noted therein. 

  

 (b) As of its filing date (or, if amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this Agreement, on the date of the last such amendment or superseding filing) or submission date, as the case may be (i) each SEC Report complied, or will comply, as the case may be, as to form in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, or any successor statute, rules or regulations thereto (" _Sarbanes-Oxley Act_ ") and the Dodd-Frank Act of 2010, as the case may be, and the applicable rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, each as in effect on the date such SEC Report was or will be filed, and (ii) the Transaction PPM and each SEC Report did not, and will not, as the case may be, contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements made therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading. Buyer has delivered or made available to the Company complete and correct copies of all material correspondence between the SEC, on the one hand, and Buyer, on the other hand, occurring since December 31, 2009, that is not publicly available via the Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval system of the SEC. As of the date hereof, there are no material outstanding or unresolved comments in comment letters from the SEC staff with respect to any of the SEC Reports. As of the date hereof, to the knowledge of Buyer, none of the SEC Reports is the subject of ongoing SEC review, outstanding SEC comment or outstanding SEC investigation. No executive officer of Buyer has failed to make the certifications required of him or her under Section 302 or 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act with respect to any SEC Report. Neither Buyer nor, to the knowledge of Buyer, any of its Representatives, has received notice from any Governmental Authority challenging or questioning the accuracy, completeness, form or manner of filing of such certifications. Except as previously disclosed in the SEC Reports since the enactment of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Buyer and each of its officers and, to the knowledge of Buyer, each of its directors, have been and are in compliance in all material respects with (A) the applicable provisions of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder and (B) the applicable listing and corporate governance rules and regulations of the Nasdaq Global Select Market. As part of the Transaction PPM, Buyer has supplied or made available to the Sellers and the Company the same information (including financial information and data) provided to the Related Investor, and none of the information provided to the Related Investor but not 

  

       

  

provided to the Company and the Sellers is necessary in order for the Sellers
to make an informed investment decision thereunder.

  

  

 Section 4.10 Restricted Data. Neither Buyer, any of its Representatives nor Affiliates of Buyer has provided, disseminated, or otherwise made available (nor will Buyer or any of its Representatives or Affiliates provide, disseminate or otherwise make available prior to Closing) any information pertaining to the Company which would constitute "technology" or "technical data" that is restricted to "U.S. Persons" under Applicable Law (including, for this purpose, the United States Export Administration Regulations and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations) (the " _Restricted Data_ "), to any Persons other than individuals for whom Buyer reasonably determined were either U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents of the United States, nor provided, disseminated, or otherwise made available any Restricted Data to any foreign persons or foreign entities, including, without limitation, a foreign parent, subsidiary, or investor of Buyer, unless such disclosure was made after Buyer obtained the appropriate export license, technical assistance agreement or other requisite documentation for the transmission of all or any portion of the Restricted Data. Buyer has not provided any Restricted Data to any Person who has been listed on any screening list by any Governmental Authority (including, without limitation, the Department of Commerce, the DoD, the Department of State or the Department of Treasury) as a party for whom restrictions on exports, re-exports or transfers of Restricted Data would apply. 

  

    
ARTICLE V. 
_COVENANTS 
_

  

 Section 5.1 Public Announcements. Unless otherwise required by Applicable Law, no party to this Agreement shall make any announcements in respect of this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or otherwise communicate with any news media or other private or public source (including as background or if the source shall otherwise agree to retain the information as confidential) without the prior written consent of (a) the Company and the Shareholder Representative if the request is made by Buyer prior to Closing, (b) the Shareholder Representative if the request is made by Buyer after the Closing or (c) Buyer if the request is made by the Company, the Shareholder Representative or any Seller either before or after the Closing. The parties shall cooperate as to the timing and contents of any such announcement. For purposes of absolute clarity, the parties acknowledge that if this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and this _Section 5.1_ shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect. 

  

 Section 5.2 Supplement to Disclosure Schedules. 

  

  

 (a) From time to time before the Closing Date, the Company and the Sellers shall have the right (but not the obligation) to supplement or amend the Disclosure Schedules (and the information and materials provided in connection therewith) to disclose any fact, condition, matter, thing, development or occurrence (i) that has taken place after the date hereof and (ii) that would cause or constitute a breach of any representation or warranty contained in _Article III_ had such representation or warranty been made as of the time of discovery of such fact, condition, matter, thing, development or occurrence. 

  

 (b) If (i) the matter or matters included in any such disclosure supplement individually or in the aggregate constitute a Material Adverse Effect, and (ii) the Shareholder Representative or the Company deliver to Buyer a written authorization to terminate this Agreement (given the condition specified in _Section 6.2(c)_ and Buyer\'s termination rights in connection therewith), and thereafter Buyer does not terminate this Agreement within five (5) Business Days of the delivery of such authorization, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Buyer shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement as a result of, or seek indemnification hereunder in respect of, such matter or matters included in such disclosure supplement. 

  

      

  

 (c) If following delivery of the authorization contemplated by _Section 5.2(b)_ above, Buyer elects to terminate this Agreement within five (5) Business Days following delivery thereof, Buyer shall have no further rights or remedies in connection therewith (including indemnification under _Article VII_ hereof); it being the intention of the parties that termination by Buyer under those circumstances will function as its exclusive election of remedies in connection therewith. 

  

  

 Section 5.3 Employment Agreements; Restricted Stock Unit Agreements. As of the date hereof, Buyer and each of the Key Managers have separately negotiated and executed employment agreements (" _Employment Agreements_ ") and restricted stock unit agreements (" _Restricted Stock Unit Agreements_ ") with inducement restricted stock unit awards (" _RSUs_ ") which shall be effective as of, and contingent upon, the Closing. If any of the RSUs issued as inducement to the Key Managers to continue employment with Buyer after the Closing in connection with the Restricted Stock Unit Agreements (" _Retention RSUs_ ") (other than those held by Michel M. Fournier) do not vest at any point following the Closing because of termination for Cause, resignation without Good Reason, death or disability, as set forth in the respective Restricted Stock Unit Agreements, Michel M. Fournier (or, in his absence, the Shareholder Representative) and the seniormost executive of Buyer, acting together and in good faith, shall reallocate the unused Retention RSUs among the other holders of Retention RSUs or otherwise provide such Retention RSUs to one or more other Key Managers or current employees of the Company; _provided, however_ , that no portion of such Retention RSUs shall be allocable to Michel M. Fournier under those circumstances. The parties expressly intend the covenant contemplated by this _Section 5.3_ to survive Closing. Buyer agrees that, upon vesting of such Retention RSUs, it shall have in place an effective registration statement on Form S-8 pursuant to which the issuance of the securities related to such Retention RSUs to such holders will be registered under Section 5 of the Securities Act. 

  

 Section 5.4 Employees; Benefit Plans. 

  

  

 (a) With respect to any employee benefit plan maintained by Buyer or its subsidiaries (collectively, " _Buyer Benefit Plans_ ") in which any Company Continuing Employees will participate effective as of the Closing, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law and the terms of the Buyer Benefit Plans, Buyer shall, or shall cause the Company to, recognize all service of the Company Continuing Employees with the Company as if such service were with Buyer, for vesting and eligibility purposes in any Buyer Benefit Plan in which such Company Continuing Employees may be eligible to participate after the Closing; _provided, however_ , that nothing in this _Section 5.4_ shall prohibit Buyer or its subsidiaries from amending or terminating any benefit plan, program or arrangement or require participation of any Company Continuing Employee in any particular Buyer Benefit Plan. 

  

 (b) Subject to the other terms and provisions hereof, the Company Continuing Employees shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.4_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this  _Section 5.4_. Nothing contained herein, express or implied, shall be construed to establish, amend or modify any benefit plan, program, agreement or arrangement. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the terms set forth in this _Section 5.4_ shall not create any right in any Company Continuing Employee or any other Person to any continued employment with the Company, Buyer or any of their respective Affiliates. 

  

  

 Section 5.5 Plant Closings and Mass Layoffs. Buyer shall not, and shall cause the Company not to, take any action following the Closing that could result in WARN Act liability. Buyer hereby agrees to indemnify, and hold the Sellers harmless from, any and all cost, expenses, liabilities or Losses incurred under the WARN Act following the Closing. 

        

 Section 5.6 Director and Officer Indemnification and Insurance. 

  

  

 (a) Buyer agrees that all rights to indemnification, advancement of expenses and exculpation by the Company now existing in favor of each Person who is now, or has been at any time prior to the date hereof or who becomes prior to the Closing Date, an officer or director of the Company, as provided in the Constituent Documents of the Company, in each case as in effect on the date of this Agreement shall survive the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect in accordance with their respective terms. 

  

 (b) As promptly following the Closing as practicable, Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall work in good faith to cause the Company to obtain DandO "tail" insurance coverage with a claims period of six (6) years from the Closing Date with not less than $5,000,000 coverage and containing such other terms and conditions as shall be negotiated thereby, in each case with respect to claims arising out of or relating to events which occurred on or prior to the Closing Date (including in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement). Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the Buyer and/or the Company shall not be required to fund more than $50,000 as a one-time premium for such policy. For purposes of adding additional clarity hereto, the parties acknowledge that the premium costs associated with obtaining this policy shall not reduce the Cash Purchase Price nor be taken into account when calculating Working Capital. 

  

 (c) The obligations of Buyer and the Company under this _Section 5.6_ shall not be terminated or modified in such a manner as to adversely affect any director or officer to whom this _Section 5.6_ applies without the consent of such affected director or officer (it being expressly agreed that the directors and officers to whom this _Section 5.6_ applies shall be intended third-party beneficiaries of this _Section 5.6_, each of whom may enforce the provisions of this  _Section 5.6_). 

  

 (d) In the event Buyer, the Company or any of their respective successors or assigns (i) consolidates with or merges into any other Person and shall not be the continuing or surviving corporation or entity in such consolidation or merger or (ii) transfers all or substantially all of its properties and assets to any Person, then, and in either such case, proper provision shall be made so that the successors and assigns of Buyer or the Company, as the case may be, shall assume all of the obligations set forth in this _Section 5.6_. 

  

  

 Section 5.7 Confidentiality. Buyer acknowledges and agrees that the Confidentiality Agreement remains in full force and effect and, in addition, covenants and agrees to keep confidential, in accordance with the provisions of the Confidentiality Agreement, information contained in this Agreement (or any drafts hereof) as well as all negotiations and discussions related hereto and all information provided to Buyer pursuant hereto, except that each of Buyer and its Affiliates may make any public disclosure it believes in good faith is required by applicable securities laws or securities listing standards. If this Agreement is, for any reason, terminated prior to the Closing, the Confidentiality Agreement and the provisions of this _Section 5.7_ shall nonetheless continue in full force and effect. 

  

 Section 5.8 Governmental Approvals and Other Third-Party Consents. 

  

  

 (a) Each party hereto shall, as promptly as possible, use its reasonable best efforts to obtain, or cause to be obtained, all Consents from all Governmental Authorities that may be or become necessary for its execution and delivery of this Agreement and the performance of its obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Each party shall cooperate fully with the other party and its Affiliates in promptly seeking to obtain all such Consents. The parties hereto shall not willfully take any action that will have the effect of delaying, impairing or impeding the receipt of any required Consents. Each party hereto agrees to make an appropriate filing pursuant to the HSR Act with respect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement within five (5) Business Days after the 

  

      

  

date hereof and to supply as promptly as practicable to the appropriate
Governmental Authority any additional information and documentary material
that may be requested pursuant to the HSR Act. Buyer agrees that all filing
fees under the HSR Act (whether imposed on Buyer, any Seller or any other
Person pursuant to the HSR Act) shall be borne exclusively by Buyer.

  

 (b) Without limiting the generality of Buyer\'s undertaking pursuant to this _Section 5.8_, Buyer agrees to use its reasonable best efforts and to take any and all steps necessary (other than divestiture) to avoid or eliminate each and every impediment under any antitrust, competition or trade regulation law that may be asserted by any Governmental Authority or any other Person so as to enable the parties hereto to close the transactions contemplated by this Agreement as promptly as possible. In addition, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to defend through litigation on the merits any claim asserted in court by any Person in order to avoid entry of, or to have vacated or terminated, any Governmental Order (whether temporary, preliminary or permanent) that would prevent the consummation of the Closing. 

  

 (c) All analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments and proposals made by or on behalf of either party before any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, in connection with the transactions contemplated hereunder (but, for the avoidance of doubt, not including any interactions between the Sellers or the Company with Governmental Authorities in the ordinary course of business, any disclosure which is not permitted by Applicable Law or any disclosure containing confidential information) shall be disclosed to the other party hereunder in advance of any filing, submission or attendance, it being the intent that the parties will consult and cooperate with one another, and consider in good faith the views of one another, in connection with any such analyses, appearances, meetings, discussions, presentations, memoranda, briefs, filings, arguments, and proposals. Each party shall give notice to the other party with respect to any meeting, discussion, appearance or contact with any Governmental Authority or the staff or regulators of any Governmental Authority, with such notice being sufficient to provide the other party with the opportunity to attend and participate in such meeting, discussion, appearance or contact. 

   

 (d) The Sellers, the Company and Buyer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to give all notices to, and obtain all Required Consents from, all third parties that are described in _Disclosure Schedule 3.6_; _provided, however_ , that neither the Company nor the Sellers shall be obligated to pay any consideration therefor to any third party from whom consent or approval is requested. 

  

  

 Section 5.9 Resale of Buyer Common Stock. 

  

  

 (a) With a view to making available to the Sellers the benefits of certain rules and regulations of the SEC which at any time permit the sale of Buyer Common Stock to the public without registration, so long as the Sellers still own shares of Buyer Common Stock issued pursuant to this transaction, Buyer shall use its reasonable best efforts to: 

    

 (i) make and keep adequate current public information available, as those terms are understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times; 

  

 (ii) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other documents required of Buyer under the Exchange Act; 

   

 (iii) furnish to any Seller, upon any reasonable request, a written statement by Buyer as to its compliance with Rule 144, a copy of the most recent annual or quarterly report of Buyer, and such other reports and documents of Buyer as such Seller may reasonably request in availing itself of any rule or regulation of the SEC allowing such Seller to sell any such securities without registration; and 

   

      

   

 (iv) take any other steps necessary to allow the Sellers to sell such shares of Buyer Common Stock pursuant to Rule 144\. 

    

 (b) The Sellers may request that Buyer remove, and Buyer agrees to authorize the removal of any legend from the shares of Buyer Common Stock following any sale of such shares pursuant to Rule 144\. Following the time a legend is no longer required for the shares of Buyer Common Stock hereunder, Buyer will, no later than three (3) Business Days following the delivery by a Seller to Buyer or Buyer\'s transfer agent of a legended certificate representing such securities, deliver or cause to be delivered to such Seller a certificate representing such securities that is free from all restrictive and other legends. 

  

 (c) If Buyer at any time after the Closing proposes to register any of its common stock under the Securities Act, for its own account or for the account of any holder of its securities other than the Sellers, in connection with the public offering of such securities solely for cash, on a form which would permit registration of the Closing Shares then in the hands of such Sellers for sale to the public under the Securities Act (other than in an Excluded Registration), Buyer will, each such time, give notice to each Seller of its intention to do so. Any Seller may, by written response delivered to Buyer within ten (10) Business Days after the receipt of such notice, request that all or a specified part of the Closing Shares then held by such Seller be included in such registration. Buyer will thereupon, subject to the provisions of _Section 5.9(d)_ below, use commercially reasonable efforts as part of its filing of such form to cause to be included in such registration under the Securities Act all Closing Shares which Buyer has been so requested to register by the Seller(s). Buyer shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any registration initiated by it under this _Section 5.9(c)_ before the effective date of such registration, whether or not any Seller has elected to include Closing Shares in such registration; _provided, however_ , following such termination or withdrawal, if Buyer subsequently elects to refile such registration statement or file a new registration statement which would otherwise give rise to Sellers participation therein, Buyer shall again permit such Sellers to be included in such refiled or newly filed registration statement. Buyer hereby agrees to pay any and all registration expenses in connection with each registration of Closing Shares requested pursuant to this _Section 5.9(c)_ (other than underwriting discounts and commissions and applicable transfer Taxes, if any, which shall be borne by the Sellers in all cases), including the reasonable fees and disbursements, not to exceed $10,000, of one counsel for the participating Sellers. Buyer may require each Seller selling or proposing to sell Closing Shares hereunder to furnish to Buyer such information regarding the Seller and the distribution of the Closing Shares contemplated by such Seller as Buyer may reasonably request to comply with the Securities Act (and similar state laws) or as requested by the SEC in connection therewith or as required to effect the registration of the Closing Shares. It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of Buyer to take any action pursuant to this _Section 5.9(c)_ with respect to the Closing Shares of any Seller that such Seller shall furnish to Buyer such information regarding itself, the Closing Shares held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities as is reasonably required to effect the registration of such Seller\'s Closing Shares and shall provide Buyer with customary indemnification rights with respect to any information provided to Buyer in connection with such registration. 

  

 (d) In connection with any offering involving an underwriting of shares of Buyer\'s common stock pursuant to _Section 5.9(c)_, Buyer shall not be required to include any of the Sellers\' Closing Shares in such underwriting unless the Sellers accept the terms of the underwriting as agreed upon between Buyer and its underwriters, and then only in such quantity as the underwriters in their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the offering by Buyer. If the total number of securities, including Closing Shares, requested by stockholders to be included in such offering exceeds the number of securities to be sold (other than by Buyer) that the underwriters in their reasonable discretion determine is compatible with the success of the offering, then Buyer 

  

      

  

shall be required to include in the offering only that number of such
securities, including Closing Shares, which the underwriters and Buyer in
their sole discretion determine will not jeopardize the success of the
offering. If the underwriters determine that less than all of the Closing
Shares requested to be registered can be included in such offering, then the
Closing Shares that are included in such offering shall be allocated among
the participating Sellers in proportion (as nearly as practicable to) the
number of Closing Shares owned by each participating Seller or in such
other proportions as shall mutually be agreed to by all such selling Sellers.
To facilitate the allocation of shares in accordance with the above
provisions, Buyer or the underwriters may round the number of shares
allocated to any Seller to the nearest 100 shares.

  

  

 Section 5.10 Novations; Credit Facilities. 

  

  

 (a) As promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, the Buyer, the Company and the Shareholder Representative shall work in good faith to ensure that, following the Closing Date, neither Michel M. Fournier nor Amy Fournier (nor any other Seller, Representative or Affiliate of the Company) (in each case, a " _Credit Enhancer_ ") shall have any obligation, exposure or liability under, for or in connection with, any personal guarantee, bond, indemnity, financial assurance, pledge of security or other credit enhancement established prior to the Closing Date for the benefit of the Company (each, a " _Credit Enhancement_ "). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties agree to provide written notice to each vendor, supplier or other creditor of the Company to notify them that credit should no longer be provided in connection with previously supplied Credit Enhancements. The Company has listed each Credit Enhancement of which it is aware on the date hereof on _Disclosure Schedule 5.10(a)_. The Company and the Sellers agree not to provide additional Credit Enhancements after the date hereof. To the extent that any such Credit Enhancement remains outstanding after the Closing Date, Buyer shall indemnify any Credit Enhancer from any Losses, liabilities, costs or expenses incurred by such Credit Enhancer in the event the beneficiary of such Credit Enhancement requires any payment, or the Credit Enhancer otherwise suffers any Loss, in connection therewith. 

   

 (b) Notwithstanding any other term or provision hereof, the parties agree that, prior to Closing, the Company shall be permitted to terminate or, if not terminated prior to Closing, Buyer shall be required to terminate, at Closing (without liability or obligation on the part of the Company, any Seller or any Credit Enhancer in connection therewith) all loans, financing or credit facilities or similar such arrangements previously in place for the benefit of the Company and listed on _Disclosure Schedule 5.10(b)_, including, without limitation, those giving rise to Indebtedness to be paid at Closing. 

  

  

 Section 5.11 Tax Matters. 

  

  

 (a) Subject to Buyer\'s exercise of the 338 Option in accordance with _Section 5.12_, the parties hereto acknowledge that the taxable year of the Company shall end as of the end of the day immediately prior to the Closing Date for federal income Tax purposes pursuant to Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(A)(2) (and to the extent applicable, for state Tax purposes as well) and further agree that the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) has no application with respect to any Tax item of the Company. If Buyer exercises the 338 Option, the parties hereto acknowledge that the taxable year of the Company shall end as of the end of the Closing Date for federal income Tax purposes (and to the extent applicable, for state Tax purposes as well) and further agree that the "next day rule" of Treasury Regulation Section 1.1502-76(b)(1)(ii)(B) has no application with respect to any Tax item of the Company. 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (b) The Shareholder Representative will have the exclusive authority to prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all Tax Returns for income Taxes of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods that are required to be filed after the Closing Date, including for those jurisdictions and Governmental Authorities that permit or require a short year Return for the period commencing January 1, 2012 and ending on the last day of the Pre-Closing Tax Period (the " _Short Year_ "). Such Short Year Tax Returns will be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company with respect to such items, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. The Shareholder Representative will provide to Buyer a draft of the Tax Returns of the Company required to be prepared and filed by the Shareholder Representative under this _Section 5.11(b)_ at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (including any extensions) for its review. At least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Return (including any extensions), Buyer will notify the Shareholder Representative of the existence of any objection (specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such objection) Buyer may have to any items set forth on such draft Tax Return. Buyer and the Shareholder Representative agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any objections within ten (10) days following the delivery of written notice by Buyer of such objections, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall jointly request an independent accounting firm to resolve any issue in dispute at least seven (7) days before the due date of such Tax Return, in order that such Tax Return may be timely filed. Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall instruct the accountant to make its determination based solely on presentations by Buyer and the Shareholder Representative (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The accountant\'s determination shall be final and binding on the parties effective on the date the accountant delivers its final resolution in writing to Buyer and the Shareholder Representative, and all fees and expenses of the accountant for such determination shall be allocated between Buyer and the Sellers so as to approximate the extent to which the parties\' submitted differences were, on a net basis, different from the amount finally resolved by the accountant (as an illustration, this sentence would result in apportionment between both parties equally if the amounts that each assigned to items in dispute were equidistant from the amount finally resolved by the accountant). Subject to the foregoing, the Sellers shall bear all costs and expenses relating to the preparation and filing of such Tax Returns. 

  

 (c) Buyer will have the exclusive authority to prepare and timely file, or cause to be prepared and timely filed, all other Tax Returns of the Company. For Tax Returns for the Straddle Period, such Tax Returns will be prepared by treating items on such Tax Returns in a manner consistent with the past practice of the Company with respect to such items, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. For Tax Returns for the Straddle Period, Buyer will provide to the Shareholder Representative a draft of such Tax Returns required to be prepared and filed by Buyer under this _Section 5.11(c)_ at least thirty (30) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns (including any extensions). At least twenty (20) days prior to the due date for the filing of such Tax Returns (including any extensions), the Shareholder Representative will notify Buyer of the existence of any objection (specifying in reasonable detail the nature and basis of such objection) the Shareholder Representative may have to any items set forth on such draft Tax Return. Buyer and the Shareholder Representative agree to consult and resolve in good faith any such objection. In the event the parties are unable to resolve any objections within ten (10) days following the delivery of written notice by the Shareholder Representative of such objections, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall jointly request an independent accounting firm to resolve any issue in dispute at least seven (7) days before the due date of such Tax Returns, in order that such Tax Returns may be timely filed. Buyer and the Shareholder Representative shall instruct the accountant to make its determination based solely on presentations by Buyer and the Shareholder Representative (i.e., not on the basis of an independent review). The accountant\'s determination shall be final and binding on the parties effective on the date the accountant delivers its final 

  

      

  

resolution in writing to Buyer and the Shareholder Representative. The
accountant shall apportion its fees and expenses for such determination
between Buyer and Seller so as to approximate the extent to which the
parties\' submitted differences were, on a net basis, different from the
amount finally resolved by the accountant (as an illustration, this sentence
would result in apportionment between both parties equally if the amounts
that each assigned to items in dispute were equidistant from the amount
finally resolved by the accountant). Subject to the foregoing, Buyer shall
bear all costs and expenses relating to the preparation and filing of Tax
Returns under this _Section 5.11(c)_.

  

 (d) For purposes of _Sections 5.11(b)_ and _5.11(c)_ , in the case of any Taxes that are imposed on a periodic basis and are payable for a Tax period that includes (but does not end on) the last day of the Pre-Closing Tax Period (the " _Straddle Period_ "), the portion of such Tax which relates to the Pre-Closing Tax Period shall (i) in the case of any Taxes other than Taxes based upon or related to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use Tax), or employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed to be the amount of such Tax for the entire Straddle Period multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days in the Straddle Period ending on the last day of the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the denominator of which is the number of days in the entire Straddle Period, and (ii) in the case of any Tax based upon or related to income, gains or receipts (including sales and use Tax), or employment or payroll Taxes, be deemed equal to the amount which would be payable if the Straddle Period ended on the last day of the Pre-Closing Tax Period. Any credits relating to the Straddle Period shall be apportioned between the Pre-Closing Tax Period and the Post-Closing Tax Period in a manner consistent with the apportionment of the Taxes subject to clause (i) above. All determinations necessary to give effect to the foregoing allocations shall be made in a manner consistent with reasonable prior practice of the Company. 

   

 (e) Subject to the other provisions hereof, including the provisions of _Article VII_, after the Closing, the Sellers shall, indemnify Buyer and hold it harmless from and against: (i) all Taxes of the Company for all Pre-Closing Tax Periods, and (ii) with respect to any Straddle Period, all Taxes of the Company attributable to the portion of such Straddle Period that ends on and includes the last day of the Pre-Closing Tax Period. 

  

 (f) Buyer shall inform the Shareholder Representative of the commencement of any audit, examination or proceeding (" _Tax Contest_ ") relating in whole or in part to Taxes for which Buyer may be entitled to indemnity from the Sellers hereunder. With respect to any Tax Contest for which the Sellers are liable under _Section 5.11(e)_, the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to control, in good faith, all proceedings taken in connection with such Tax Contest; _provided, however_ , that (i) the Shareholder Representative shall promptly notify Buyer in writing of its intention to control such Tax Contest, (ii) in the case of a Tax Contest relating to Taxes of the Company for a Straddle Period, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall jointly control all proceedings taken in connection with any such Tax Contest and (iii) if any Tax Contest could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on Buyer, the Company, or any of their Affiliates in any Post-Closing Tax Period, the Tax Contest shall not be settled or resolved without Buyer\'s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if notice is given to the Shareholder Representative of the commencement of any Tax Contest and the Shareholder Representative does not, within thirty (30) days after Buyer\'s notice is given, give notice to Buyer of its election to assume the defense thereof (and in connection therewith, acknowledge in writing the indemnification obligations hereunder of the Sellers), the Sellers shall be bound by any determination made in such Tax Contest or any compromise or settlement thereof effected by Buyer. Buyer and the Company shall use their reasonable efforts to provide the Shareholder Representative with such assistance as may be reasonably requested by the Shareholder Representative in connection with a Tax Contest controlled solely or jointly by the Shareholder Representative. 

  

      

  

 (g) All sales and transfer taxes, deed taxes, conveyance fees, recording charges and similar taxes imposed as a result of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, if any, together with any interest, penalties or additions to such transfer taxes (" _Transfer Taxes_ "), shall be borne by Buyer. 

  

 (h) Buyer shall not cause or permit the Company to amend any Tax Return with respect to any Pre-Closing Tax Period or Straddle Period, or make any election that has retroactive effect to any such period, to the extent that the Sellers would be adversely affected by such amendment or election unless required by Applicable Law. 

  

 (i) The parties hereto agree that, for the purposes of this Agreement, all deductions associated with any Transaction Expenses of the Company and Sellers paid on or before the Closing are owned by Sellers. Accordingly, in the event that Buyer does not exercise the 338 Option, Buyer may take deductions associated with any Transaction Expenses paid on the Closing Date on the Company\'s Tax Returns, however, Buyer shall pay an amount to Sellers equal to the deductions associated with such Transaction Expenses of the Company and Sellers paid on the Closing Date multiplied by 82.8%. Buyer shall pay such amount to Sellers on or prior to thirty (30) days after the Closing. In the event that Buyer exercises the 338 Option, Buyer shall not have the right to take such deductions and Sellers shall be permitted to include such deductions for such Transaction Expenses on the final income Tax Returns for the Tax period ending at the end of the Closing Date. 

  

 (j) Each Seller (severally and not jointly) hereby covenants and agrees to pay all Taxes of the Seller due and payable pursuant to Applicable Law. 

  

  

 Section 5.12 338 Option. 

  

  

 (a) The Sellers hereby grant Buyer an option (the " _338 Option_ ") to decide if it desires to have the Sellers and Buyer make an election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code with respect to its acquisition of the Shares hereunder. In the event that Buyer desires to exercise the 338 Option, it shall give written notice thereof to the Shareholder Representative on or prior to ninety (90) days after the Closing Date (the " _Election Period_ "). In the event that Buyer fails to provide such notice during the Election Period, the 338 Option shall terminate and be of no further force or effect. In connection with the foregoing, the Sellers agree to promptly provide (at Buyer\'s expense) all information in their custody and control reasonably requested by Buyer to enable Buyer to analyze the net benefit of exercising the 338 Option as contemplated under this _Section 5.12_, including the information required to be delivered in the Tax Reports referenced in _Section 5.12(b)_. Subject to _Section 5.12(e)_, in the event that Buyer exercises the 338 Option, Buyer and each of the Sellers hereby covenant and agree to (i) jointly make a timely election under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code (and any corresponding elections under state or local tax law) (" _Section 338(h)(10) Election_"), (ii) take, and cooperate with each other to take, all actions necessary and appropriate (including filing such forms, returns, elections, schedules and other documents as may be required) to effect and preserve a timely Section 338(h)(10) Election in accordance with Section 338 of the Code, or any successor provisions, as promptly as practicable following the Closing Date, but not later than the date which is the last date for making such Section 338(h)(10) Election, and from time to time thereafter, and (iii) report the sale of the Shares pursuant to this Agreement consistent with the Section 338(h)(10) Election and to take no position contrary thereto or inconsistent therewith in any tax return, any discussion with or proceeding before any tax authority, or otherwise. 

  

 (b) Upon delivery of written notice to the Shareholder Representative of Buyer\'s exercise of the 338 Option, each Seller shall prepare a report (each, a " _Tax Report_ ") and deliver the same to Buyer within thirty (30) days after the Shareholder Representative\'s receipt of the written notice. The Tax Report for each Seller shall, using reasonable methods, in accordance with the Code, 

  

      

  

Treasury Regulations and pronouncements thereunder, (i) determine the amount
by which ordinary income, for federal and state purposes, generated from the
sale calculated under Section 338(h)(10) of the Code for federal and state
Tax purposes, exceeds the ordinary income generated under a stock sale for
federal and state Tax purposes, and (ii) multiply the amount calculated under
clause (i) by the tax rate differential, in existence at the time of Closing,
that exists between the ordinary income tax rate and the long-term capital
gain rate for federal and state Tax purposes for such Seller (for each
Seller, the amount described in clause (ii) is hereinafter referred to as the
" _Election Amount_ "). The Tax Report for each Seller (including the
Election Amount) shall include each Seller\'s share of the Company\'s Tax
attributable to the recognition of gain by the Company pursuant to Section
1374 of the Code. Buyer and its accountants shall have the right to review the
work papers and other documents used in completing each Tax Report, and shall
also have the right to propose reasonable questions to the accountant
regarding the same. If Buyer does not notify a Seller of its objection to the
Election Amount for such Seller within thirty (30) days of its receipt of the
Tax Report for such Seller, Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted the
Election Amount for such Seller. In the event that Buyer shall disapprove of
the Election Amount in any Tax Report, Buyer shall deliver written notice of
such disapproval to the applicable Seller within thirty (30) days after it
received the Tax Report and provide written support, as supported by
applicable provisions of the Code, Treasury Regulations and pronouncements
thereunder and reasonably acceptable to such Seller, for such disapproval to
such Seller. In that event, the Sellers and Buyer hereby covenant and agree
to attempt to resolve any such dispute, in good faith, within fifteen (15)
days of such Seller\'s receipt of Buyer\'s disapproval notice.

  

 (c) Upon receipt of the Tax Report for each of the Sellers and agreement of the Election Amount for each of the Sellers, Buyer shall prepare a report (the " _Buyer\'s 338 Report_ ") that (i) grosses up the Election Amount of each Seller to make each such Seller whole for the additional income taxes payable by such Seller arising from receipt of the Election Amount for such Seller (the " _Gross-up Amount_ "), and (ii) determines the dates in which the Election Amount and the Gross-up Amount must be paid in order for the Sellers to satisfy their respective tax payment obligations as a result thereof. Buyer agrees to pay (A) the Gross-up Amount, and (B) an amount equal to all costs and fees incurred by each Seller associated with each Seller\'s preparation of its Tax Report and Buyer\'s related review of, and proposed changes to, such Tax Report pursuant to _Section 5.12(b)_, to the Sellers on the date specified in Buyer\'s 338 Report (the Election Amount and amounts payable pursuant to clauses (A) and (B) above collectively, the " _Make Whole Amount_ "). 

  

 (d) If Buyer exercises the 338 Option, the "aggregate deemed sales price" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-4) (the " _ADSP_ ") and the "adjusted gross-up basis" (as defined in Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-5) shall be allocated among the assets of the Company in accordance with Treasury Regulations Section 1.338-7. Simultaneously with delivery of notice to the Shareholder Representative of Buyer\'s exercise of the 338 Option, Buyer shall determine the ADSP and deliver to the Shareholder Representative an allocation of the ADSP among the assets of the Company (the " _ADSP Allocation Schedule_ "). If within thirty (30) days after the Shareholder Representative\'s receipt of the draft ADSP Allocation Schedule, the Shareholder Representative shall not have objected in writing to such draft ADSP Allocation Schedule, the draft ADSP Allocation Schedule shall become the ADSP Allocation Schedule. In the event that the Shareholder Representative objects in writing within such thirty (30) day period, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall negotiate in good faith to resolve the dispute. If the Shareholder Representative and Buyer are unable to reach an agreement within thirty (30) days after Buyer\'s receipt of the Shareholder Representative\'s written objection, the dispute shall be resolved and the ADSP Allocation Schedule shall be determined by an independent, nationally recognized accounting firm mutually selected by Buyer and the Shareholder Representative. The ADSP 

  

      

  

Allocation Schedule, as agreed upon by Buyer and the Shareholder
Representative and/or determined under this _Section 5.12(d)_, shall be final
and binding upon the parties hereto, subject to such changes as are required
due to a subsequent change in the Purchase Price. Each of Buyer on the one
hand and the Sellers on the other hand shall bear all fees and costs incurred
by it in connection with the determination of the ADSP Allocation Schedule,
except that each of Buyer on the one hand and the Sellers on the other hand
shall pay one half (50%) of the fees and expenses of the accounting firm. The
Shareholder Representative and Buyer shall file IRS Forms 8023 and IRS Forms
8883 and any other state, local and foreign forms required for the Section
338(h)(10) Election in accordance with the ADSP Allocation Schedule. The
parties hereto agree not to take any position inconsistent with the ADSP
Allocation Schedule for Tax reporting purposes and in the course of any Tax
audit, Tax review or Tax litigation relating thereto; _provided, however_ ,
that (i) Buyer\'s cost for the assets of the Company that it is deemed to
acquire may differ from the total amount allocated hereunder to reflect the
inclusion in the total cost of items (for example, capitalized acquisition
costs) not included in the amount so allocated and (ii) the amount realized by
the Sellers may differ from the total amount allocated hereunder to reflect
transaction costs that reduce the amount realized for federal income tax
purposes; provided that neither the Sellers or any of their Affiliates nor
Buyer or any of its Affiliates will be obligated to litigate any challenge to
such allocation of such amount by a Governmental Authority. If changes are
required in any of these forms as a result of information that is first
available after the date on which any such form is completed and executed
pursuant to this _Section 5.12(d)_, the parties hereto will act in good faith
to agree on such changes using the same methodology as used in originally
determining the ADSP pursuant to this _Section 5.12(d)_. The ADSP shall be
allocated among the assets of the Company in accordance with Section
1.338(h)(10)-1 of the Treasury Regulations, if the Purchase Price is adjusted
as permitted hereunder. The parties hereto will promptly inform one another
of any challenge by any Governmental Authority to any allocation made pursuant
to this _Section 5.12(d)_ and agree to consult and keep one another informed
with respect to the status of, and any discussion, proposal or submission with
respect to, such challenge.

  

 (e) Buyer will hold in escrow each Form 8023 executed by the Sellers at Closing until the end of the Election Period and will file such forms with the Internal Revenue Service only in the event that Buyer has (i) exercised the 338 Option in accordance with the terms of this Agreement and (ii) paid each Seller the Make Whole Amount with respect to each Seller. 

  

  

 Section 5.13 Closing Conditions. From the date hereof until the Closing, each party hereto shall use commercially reasonable efforts to take such actions as are necessary to expeditiously satisfy the closing conditions set forth in _Article VI_ hereof. In addition, Buyer expressly covenants and agrees to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be fully and timely funded at Closing in accordance with, but subject to, the terms and conditions hereof. 

  

 Section 5.14 Operations Pending Close. Except as required by Applicable Law, as contemplated or permitted herein or as otherwise set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 5.14_, without the consent of Buyer (which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed), between the date hereof and the Closing Date (or sooner termination), the Company will operate its business in the ordinary course generally consistent with past practice. Notwithstanding the generality of the foregoing, the parties expressly agree and intend that the Company shall not (a) except as set forth on _Disclosure Schedule 5.14_, pay or promise to pay any bonuses to its employees outside the ordinary course of business and generally consistent with past practice, (b) except as set forth in the final sentence of this _Section 5.14_, declare, accrue, set aside or pay any dividends on, or make any other distributions (whether in cash, stock or property) in respect of, any of its capital stock, or (c) incur or pay any single discretionary expenditures of $250,000 or more (other than those set forth in or contemplated by the Company\'s operating plan or arising under contract), at any point between the date hereof and the Closing Date (or sooner termination), without the prior consent of the chief executive officer of Buyer 

        

(which consent shall not be unreasonably conditioned, withheld or delayed).
It is expressly agreed and understood that nothing in this _Section 5.14_ or
otherwise in this Agreement shall preclude or restrict in any way (i) the
Company\'s ability to declare, set aside, make and/or pay distributions in
respect of any of its capital stock in amounts necessary (or believed to be
reasonably necessary) to pay any Seller\'s Assumed Tax Liability for either
the 2011 or 2012 tax year, or (ii) the Company\'s ability to pay or accrue
for Transaction Expenses.

   

 Section 5.15 Further Assurances. Following the Closing, each of the parties hereto shall, and shall cause their respective Affiliates to, execute and deliver such additional documents, instruments, conveyances and assurances, and take such further actions as may be reasonably required to carry out the provisions hereof and give effect to the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

effect; _provided, however_ , that if a claim for Losses for which
indemnification is sought hereunder is properly asserted in writing within
the survival period set forth above, then such claim shall continue to survive
until the date that such claim is conclusively resolved (as provided herein)
or becomes Dormant.

   

 (b) The covenants of the parties after the Closing shall survive the Closing for the expressed duration of the obligations therein specified. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, claims for any breach of any covenant or agreement to be performed prior to Closing, if any, must be brought by Buyer, the Sellers or the Company, as the case may be, by the first anniversary of the Closing Date. 

  

  

 Section 7.2 Indemnification by the Sellers. 

  

  

 (a) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article VII_, after the Closing, (i) each Seller, other than Michel M. Fournier and Amy Fournier, (on an individual basis, and not jointly and severally with others) and (ii) Michel M. Fournier and Amy Fournier (jointly and severally with respect to the other _only_ ) shall indemnify Buyer against, and shall hold Buyer harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, Buyer based upon, arising out of, with respect to, or by reason of: 

    

 (i) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of the Company contained in this Agreement; 

  

 (ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by the Company pursuant to this Agreement; 

  

 (iii) any unpaid Adjustments Deficiency; 

  

 (iv) any unpaid Transaction Expenses that were not deducted in calculating the Closing Payment on the Closing Date; and 

  

 (v) any unpaid Excess Net Debt of the Company that was not deducted in calculating the Closing Payment on the Closing Date. 

    

 (b) Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article VII_, after the Closing, (i) each Seller, other than Michel M. Fournier and Amy Fournier, (on an individual basis, and not jointly and severally with others) and (ii) Michel M. Fournier and Amy Fournier (jointly and severally with respect to the other _only_ ) shall indemnify Buyer against, and shall hold Buyer harmless from, 

  

      

  

any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, Buyer based on,
arising out of, with respect to, or by reason of:

    

 (i) any breach of the Several Representations by such Seller; or 

  

 (ii) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by such Seller pursuant to this Agreement. 

   

  

 Section 7.3 Indemnification by Buyer. Subject to the other terms and conditions of this _Article VII_, Buyer shall indemnify each Seller against, and shall hold each Seller harmless from, any and all Losses incurred or sustained by, or imposed upon, such Seller based upon, arising out of, with respect to or by reason of: 

  

  

 (a) any breach of any of the representations or warranties of Buyer contained in this Agreement; 

  

 (b) any breach of any covenant, agreement or obligation to be performed by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement; 

  

 (c) any Tax Contest involving the Section 338(h)(10) Election and any determination made by a Governmental Authority as a result of any such Tax Contest; or 

  

 (d) any post-Closing adjustment that causes an increase to the ADSP pursuant to _Section 5.12(d)_ allocated to an asset of the Company the disposition of which gives rise to ordinary income for income Tax purposes. The indemnifiable amount for purposes of this _Section 7.3(d)_ shall be any amount so allocated in the preceding sentence multiplied by the tax rate differential, in existence at the time of Closing, that exists between the ordinary income tax rate and the long-term capital gain rate for federal and state income Tax purposes for such Seller, plus any Losses attributable thereto. 

  

  

 Section 7.4 Certain Limitations. The indemnification provided for in _Section 7.2_ shall be subject to the following limitations: 

  

  

 (a) The Sellers shall not be liable (for indemnification or otherwise) to Buyer with respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ of this Agreement until the aggregate amount of the actual Losses in respect thereof exceeds $1,525,000 (the " _Basket_ "), in which event, the Sellers, as a group (but on an individual basis and not jointly and severally with others except with respect to Michel M. Fournier and Amy Fournier as otherwise provided herein), shall be liable for all Losses (and not just Losses in excess of the Basket), subject to the other limitations contained in this _Article VII_. The Basket shall not apply to any claim against an individual Seller for actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation committed by that Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any breach of any of the Fundamental Representations or Special Representations. 

  

 (b) The Sellers shall not be liable (for indemnification or otherwise) to Buyer with respect to claims for indemnification pursuant to _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ of this Agreement for aggregate Losses in excess of $10,675,000 (the " _Cap_ "); _provided, however_ , that the Sellers shall not be liable to Buyer for indemnification under _Section 7.2(a)(i)_ as a result of one or more breaches of the Special Representations (when measured separately) for aggregate Losses in excess of $10,000,000 (which the parties acknowledge to be an amount separate from, and not a part of, the Cap); and _provided, further_ , that the Cap shall not apply to (i) any claim against an individual Seller for actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation committed by that Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (however, in that case, such Seller\'s aggregate Loss for such claims and all other claims combined shall not exceed the amount of Purchase Price previously received by such Seller) or (ii) any breach of any of the Fundamental Representations (however, in 

  

      

  

that case, such Sellers\' aggregate Loss for such claims and all other claims
combined shall not exceed the Purchase Price previously received by such
Sellers).

  

 (c) Subject to the other limitations imposed by this _Article VII_, with respect to any claims by Buyer, such claims shall first be paid and satisfied from the Escrow Account, to the extent of any funds then remaining, and only secondarily by each Seller severally (and not jointly), in each case, in strict proportion to such Seller\'s respective Percentage Interest of the applicable Loss; _provided, however_ , that (i) Losses resulting from actual fraud or intentional misrepresentation committed by an individual Seller in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, (ii) Losses resulting from the indemnification provisions of _Section 7.2(b)_ and (iii) Losses resulting from a breach of the Special Representations shall _not_ be satisfied from the Escrow Account but instead, Buyer may only seek to recover such Losses (A) directly against the offending Seller in the case of (i) and (ii) above (severally and not jointly and severally against others) and (B) directly against the Sellers as a group in the case of (iii) above, but only in strict proportion to such Seller\'s respective Percentage Interest of the applicable Loss. 

  

 (d) Any Loss incurred by Buyer shall be reduced, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, by the amount of any realized insurance proceeds and any indemnity, contribution or other similar payment received by Buyer (or the Company) in respect of any such Loss or claim associated with such Loss; _provided, however_ , that this Agreement shall not be deemed to impose on Buyer any affirmative obligation to make claims under any insurance policy or to recover any insurance proceeds or any similar payments. 

  

 (e) To the extent that the Sellers are required to pay Buyer for a claim made pursuant to this section and Buyer recognizes a "Net Tax Benefit," then Buyer will pay to Sellers such Net Tax Benefit. For purposes of this section, " _Net Tax Benefit_ " means a reduction of Tax payable by Buyer in a particular year attributable to the item giving rise to the claim for indemnity. Sellers hereby acknowledge that Buyer\'s net operating losses and other pre-existing tax attributes may limit the ability to realize any Net Tax Benefits hereunder. Sellers also agree and acknowledge that neither the Sellers nor the Shareholder Representative has or will have any right (i) to review, audit or otherwise dispute the existence or the amount of any Net Tax Benefit or (ii) to dispute or challenge any particular Tax position taken by the Buyer, the Company or any of their respective Affiliates. Sellers agree that the amount of any Net Tax Benefit will be computed by Buyer with the assistance of its tax advisors and that such computation shall be final and binding for all purposes of this Agreement; _provided, however_ , notwithstanding the foregoing, Buyer acknowledges an obligation to prepare all Tax returns in good faith. 

  

 (f) Simultaneously with any amount paid to a Seller by Buyer pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_ and _Section 7.3(d)_, Buyer shall gross up such amount paid to make the Seller whole for the additional income Taxes payable by such Seller arising from receipt of such amount pursuant to _Section 7.3(c)_ and _Section 7.3(d)_. 

  

 (g) Following the Closing, Buyer shall take, and cause its Affiliates, including the Company, to take, all reasonable steps to mitigate any Loss upon becoming aware of any event or circumstance that would be reasonably expected to, or does, give rise thereto, including incurring costs to the extent necessary to remedy the breach that gives rise to such Loss and the failure to so mitigate will reduce, on a dollar-for-dollar basis, all Loss resulting from such failure; _provided, however,_ that it is expressly agreed and understood that such costs and expenses, including, without limitation, attorneys\' fees and expenses, incurred in connection with Buyer\'s obligation to mitigate pursuant to this _Section 7.4(g)_ may (subject to the applicable definition thereof) be deemed to be Losses for all purposes under this Agreement. Without in any manner limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties acknowledge and agree that Buyer shall have an obligation to mitigate costs and expenses associated with litigation involving a Third-Party Claim, and, as such, no cost or expense associated with prosecuting a counterclaim against any Third-Party Claim shall be recoverable hereunder (unless such counterclaim has been authorized in writing in advance of filing by the Shareholder Representative). 

  

      

                                     

   

  

 (h) No Seller shall have any liability with respect to a breach of any of the Several Representations by any other Seller and Buyer agrees not to seek recovery against a Seller with respect to a breach of the Several Representations by another Seller (except in the case of Michel M. Fournier and Amy Fournier as provided). The Company shall have no liability with respect to a breach of the Several Representations by any Seller and Buyer agrees not to seek recovery against the Company with respect to a breach of the Several Representations by any Seller. 

  

 (i) In no event (including expressly, any fraud or intentional misrepresentation of any Seller) shall any Seller be liable to Buyer for any Losses (in the aggregate) in excess of the portion of the Purchase Price actually received by such Seller. 

  

 (j) Under no circumstances shall any claim, Loss, reserve or liability reflected on the Company\'s financial statements (including (i) as referenced in the footnotes thereof or (ii) in connection with any matter for which an accrual or reserve has been established) give rise to an indemnifiable Loss hereunder until the amount of such Loss actually suffered exceeds such amount reflected, accrued or reserved. 

  

 (k) Sellers shall not be liable for any Losses or any indemnification for Taxes or other matters attributable to Third Party Claims arising out of or resulting from (i) any issue, concern or set of circumstances brought to the attention of such third party voluntarily by Buyer or the Company (or their respective Representatives) or (ii) any inquiry, proceeding or audit self-initiated by Buyer or the Company (or their Representatives), after the Closing unless, in any case, the inquiry, proceeding or audit has been applied across all companies, subsidiaries and divisions of Buyer evenly or the inquiry, proceeding or audit is required by Applicable Law or the policies or procedures of Buyer (without an intent or objective to single out the Losses occurring inside the Company only). 

  

 (l) Buyer expressly waives any right or rights of offset, whether under common law or otherwise, and however styled or articulated, against any amount that is or may be due any Seller following the Closing. 

  

 (m) Buyer acknowledges that the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ were specifically bargained for between the parties and were taken into account in arriving at the Purchase Price. The Company and the Sellers have specifically relied upon the provisions of this _Section 7.4_ in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties made hereunder. Neither the Company nor the Sellers would have entered into this Agreement but for the inclusion of this _Section 7.4_. 

  

  

 Section 7.5 Indemnification Procedures. 

  

  

 (a) Third-Party Claims. If any party making a claim for indemnification under this Agreement (an " _Indemnified Party_ ") receives notice of the assertion or commencement of any action, suit, claim or other legal proceeding made or brought by any Person who is not a party to this Agreement or an Affiliate of a party to this Agreement or a Representative of the foregoing (a " _Third-Party Claim_ ") against such Indemnified Party with respect to which the party against whom the Indemnified Party is making a claim (the " _Indemnifying Party_ ") is obligated to provide indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified Party shall give the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall (i) describe the Third-Party Claim in reasonable detail, (ii) include copies of all material written evidence, correspondence, and information relating thereto, (iii) state the provision(s) of this Agreement under which such claim is made (including specifically if the claim relates to a breach of representation or warranty hereof, the precise representation or warranty alleged to have been 

  

      

  

breached), (iv) indicate the amount (or estimate of the amount) of the Loss
that has been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party and (v) include
such other information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request. The
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to participate in, or by giving
written notice to the Indemnified Party, to assume the defense of any Third-
Party Claim at the Indemnifying Party\'s expense and by the Indemnifying
Party\'s own counsel, and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate in good faith
in such defense. It is understood between the parties that the assumption of
the defense by the Indemnifying Party shall not represent, under any
circumstances, the concession by such Indemnifying Party that it has any duty
or obligation to indemnify. In the event that the Indemnifying Party assumes
the defense of any Third-Party Claim, subject to _Section 7.5(b)_, it shall
have the right to take such action as it deems necessary to avoid, dispute,
defend, appeal or make counterclaims pertaining to any such Third-Party Claim
in the name and on behalf of the Indemnified Party. The Indemnified Party
shall have the right, at its own cost and expense, to participate in the
defense of any Third-Party Claim with counsel selected by it subject to the
Indemnifying Party\'s right to control the defense thereof. If the
Indemnifying Party elects not to compromise or defend such Third-Party Claim
or fails to notify the Indemnified Party in writing of its election to defend
as provided in this Agreement, the Indemnified Party may, subject to _Section
7.5(b)_, pay, compromise, defend such Third-Party Claim and
seek indemnification for any and all Losses based upon, arising from or
relating to such Third-Party Claim. The Sellers and Buyer shall cooperate with
each other in all reasonable respects in connection with the defense of any
Third-Party Claim, including making available (subject to the provisions of
_Section 5.7_) records relating to such Third-Party Claim and furnishing,
without expense (other than reimbursement of actual out-of-pocket expenses) to
the defending party, management employees of the non-defending party as may
be reasonably necessary for the preparation of the defense of such Third-Party
Claim.

  

 (b) Settlement of Third-Party Claims. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Indemnifying Party shall not enter into settlement of any Third-Party Claim without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), except as provided in this _Section 7.5(b)_. If a firm offer is made to settle a Third-Party Claim without leading to liability or the creation of a financial or other substantive obligation on the part of the Indemnified Party and provides, in customary form, for the unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from all liabilities and obligations in connection with such Third-Party Claim and the Indemnifying Party desires to accept and agree to such offer, the Indemnifying Party shall give written notice to that effect to the Indemnified Party. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer within ten (10) days after its receipt of such notice, the Indemnified Party may continue to contest or defend such Third-Party Claim and in such event, the maximum liability of the Indemnifying Party as to such Third-Party Claim shall not exceed the amount of such settlement offer. If the Indemnified Party fails to consent to such firm offer and also fails to assume defense of such Third-Party Claim, the Indemnifying Party may settle the Third-Party Claim upon the terms set forth in such firm offer to settle such Third-Party Claim. If the Indemnified Party has assumed the defense pursuant to _Section 7.5(a)_, it shall not agree to any settlement without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed). In the event, however, that the Indemnified Party settles any claim without the written consent of the Indemnifying Party (in violation of the previous sentence), then, in that event, the Indemnifying Party shall be relieved of its obligations to indemnify hereunder unless such Indemnifying Party has acted unreasonably in withholding its consent. 

  

 (c) Direct Claims. Any claim by an Indemnified Party on account of a Loss which does not result from a Third-Party Claim (a " _Direct Claim_ ") shall be asserted by the Indemnified Party giving the Indemnifying Party prompt written notice thereof. The failure to give such prompt written notice shall not, however, relieve the Indemnifying Party of its indemnification obligations, 

  

      

  

except and only to the extent that the Indemnifying Party is prejudiced
thereby. Such notice by the Indemnified Party shall (i) describe the Direct
Claim in reasonable detail, (ii) include copies of all material written
evidence, correspondence and information relating thereto, (iii) state the
provision(s) of this Agreement under which such claim is made (including,
specifically, if the claim relates to a breach of representation or warranty
hereof, the precise representation or warranty alleged to have been breached),
(iv) indicate the amount (or estimate of the amount) of the Loss that has
been or may be sustained by the Indemnified Party and (v) include such other
information as the Indemnifying Party may reasonably request.
The Indemnifying Party shall have thirty (30) days after its receipt of such
notice and materials to respond in writing to such Direct Claim. During such
thirty (30) day period, the Indemnified Party shall allow the Indemnifying
Party and its professional advisors to investigate the matter or circumstance
alleged to give rise to the Direct Claim, and whether and to what extent any
amount is payable in respect of the Direct Claim, and the Indemnified Party
shall assist the Indemnifying Party\'s investigation by giving such assistance
(including access to the Company\'s premises and personnel and the right to
examine and copy any accounts, documents or records in the possession or
control of the Indemnified Party) as the Indemnifying Party or any of its
professional advisors may reasonably request. If the Indemnifying Party does
not so respond within such thirty (30) day period, the Indemnifying Party
shall be deemed to have rejected such claim, in which case the Indemnified
Party shall be free to pursue such remedies as may be available to the
Indemnified Party on the terms and subject to the provisions of this
Agreement.

  

  

 Section 7.6 Tax Treatment of Indemnification Payments. All indemnification payments made under this Agreement shall be treated by the parties as an adjustment to the Purchase Price for Tax purposes, unless otherwise required by Applicable Law. 

  

 Section 7.7 Exclusive Remedies. Subject to _Section 9.11_ (Specific Performance) and _Section 5.2_ (Supplement to Disclosure Schedules), and except in the event of actual common law fraud (but subject to the limitation on liability set forth in _Section 7.4(i)_), the parties acknowledge and agree that after the Closing, their sole and exclusive remedy with respect to any and all claims for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise arising out of or relating to the subject matter of this Agreement, shall be pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 5.11(e)_ and _Article VII_. In furtherance of the foregoing, each party hereby waives, to the fullest extent permitted under Applicable Law, any and all rights, claims, remedies and causes of action for any breach of any representation, warranty, covenant, agreement or obligation set forth herein or otherwise relating to the subject matter of this Agreement it may have against the other parties hereto and their Affiliates and each of their respective Representatives arising under or based upon any Applicable Law, except pursuant to the indemnification provisions set forth in _Section 5.11(e)_ and _Article VII_ and except in the event of actual common law fraud (but subject to the limitation on liability set forth in _Section 7.4(i)_). Nothing in this _Section 7.7_ shall limit any Person\'s right to seek and obtain any equitable relief or specific performance to which any Person shall be entitled pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. The provisions of this _Section 7.7_ were specifically bargained for between the parties and were taken into account in arriving at the Purchase Price. The Company and the Sellers have specifically relied upon the provisions of this _Section 7.7_ in agreeing to the Purchase Price and in agreeing to provide the specific representations and warranties made hereunder. Neither the Company nor the Sellers would have entered into this Agreement but for the inclusion of this _Section 7.7_. 

  

 Section 7.8 No Contribution. Following the Closing, should this occur, the Sellers shall not have and shall not exercise or assert (or attempt to exercise or assert), any right of contribution, right of indemnity or other right or remedy against the Company in connection with any indemnification obligation or any other Liability to which the Sellers may become subject to in connection with this Agreement. 

        

 Section 7.9 Liability of Certain Sellers. It is expressly agreed and acknowledged that Michel M. Fournier and Amy Fournier shall be jointly and severally liable for any and all Losses for which Michel M. Fournier or Amy Fournier _only_ , are responsible under the terms of this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt, to the extent that any liability under this _Article VII_ is limited to such Seller\'s respective Percentage Interest of the applicable Loss, each of Michel M. Fournier and Amy Fournier shall be jointly and severally liable for their aggregate Percentage Interest of such Loss. 

  

    
ARTICLE VIII. 
_TERMINATION 
_

   

 Section 8.1 Termination. This Agreement may be terminated at any time prior to the Closing: 

  

  

 (a) by the mutual written consent of the Shareholder Representative, the Company and Buyer; 

  

 (b) by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Company and the Shareholder Representative, acting collectively, on the other hand, if the Closing shall not have occurred on or before April 15, 2013 (the " _Drop Dead Date_ "); 

   

 (c) subject to _Section 5.2(b)_, by Buyer upon written notice to the Company and the Shareholder Representative if: 

    

 (i) there has been a material breach in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by the Company or any Seller pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions specified in _Section 6.2(a)_ or _Section 6.2(b)_ and such breach cannot be cured by the Drop Dead Date; or 

  

 (ii) Buyer shall be terminating this Agreement in accordance with the terms of _Section 5.2(c)_ above; 

    

 (d) by the Company and the Shareholder Representative, acting collectively, upon written notice to Buyer if: 

    

 (i) there has been a material breach in any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement made by Buyer pursuant to this Agreement that would give rise to the failure of any of the conditions specified in _Section 6.3(a)_ or _Section 6.3(b)_ and such breach cannot be cured by the Drop Dead Date; or 

    

 (e) by Buyer, on the one hand, or the Company and the Shareholder Representative, acting collectively, on the other hand, in the event that: 

    

 (i) there shall be any Applicable Law that makes consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement illegal or otherwise prohibited; or 

   

 (ii) any Governmental Authority shall have issued a Governmental Order restraining or enjoining the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, and such Governmental Order shall have become final and non-appealable (it being agreed between the parties that they shall use commercially reasonable efforts to promptly appeal any Governmental Order which has not become final and non-appealable (and pursue such appeal with reasonable diligence)). 

    

 (f) by the Buyer on or before the end of the fourth Business Day after the date of this Agreement, if the Buyer does not complete the public offering of its common stock announced on the date hereof as a result of the underwriters for such public offering invoking the conditions in Section 6(a), (e)(ii), (e)(iii), (f), (g), or (h) of the underwriting agreement for such offering as justification for not completing such offering; _provided, however,_ (i) in the case Section 6(a) is invoked, only if such section is invoked as a result of a stop order issued by the SEC, the initiation of proceedings by the SEC or raising of objections by FINRA and, (ii) in the case Section 6(e)(ii) or (e)(iii) is invoked, (A) only if such section is not invoked as a result of any willful or negligent 

  

      

  

act on the part of Buyer, and (B) if Section 6(e)(ii) is invoked, only if
such section is invoked as a result of any fact, circumstance or event that
occurs after the date hereof that causes any representation or warranty of
Buyer contained in the underwriting agreement to fail to be true and correct
during such four Business Day period following the date hereof and not for
any other reason, including any failure of Buyer to comply with any
agreements or conditions contained in such underwriting agreement.

  

  

 Section 8.2 Effect of Termination. In the event that this Agreement is validly terminated in accordance with this _Article VIII_, then each of the parties shall be relieved of their duties and obligations arising under this Agreement after the date of such termination and such termination shall be without liability to Buyer, any Seller or the Company; _provided, however_ , that (a) nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall relieve Buyer, any Seller or the Company of any liability for any Losses for any willful and intentional breach of any representation or any willful and intentional breach of any covenant or other agreement contained in this Agreement or the other Transaction Documents, (b) nothing in this _Article VIII_ shall limit any provision relating to the payment of fees and expenses or the commitment to retain information as confidential, which in each case, shall survive any such termination and (c) Buyer\'s election to terminate in accordance with the provisions of _Section 5.2(c)_ above shall function as its exclusive election of remedies in connection therewith.

In the event of any inconsistency between the statements in the body of this Agreement, the Exhibits and Disclosure Schedules (other than an exception expressly set forth as such in the Disclosure Schedules), the statements in the body of this Agreement will control. 

  

 Section 9.7 Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns. No party may assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of the other parties, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed. No assignment shall relieve the assigning party of any of its obligations hereunder. 

  

 Section 9.8 No Third-Party Beneficiaries. Except as provided in _Section 5.4_, _Section 5.6_ and _Article VII_, this Agreement is for the sole benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns and nothing herein, express or implied, is intended to or shall confer upon any other Person any legal or equitable right, benefit or remedy of any nature whatsoever under or by reason of this Agreement. Any grant of third-party beneficiary rights hereunder is made expressly subject to the last sentence of _Section 9.9_ hereof. 

  

 Section 9.9 Amendment and Modification; Consents; Waiver. This Agreement may only be amended, modified or supplemented by an agreement in writing signed by the Company, the Shareholder Representative and Buyer. Any amendment, modification or supplement to this Agreement shall be binding on all of the parties, including each of the Sellers. No waiver by any party of any of the provisions hereof shall be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and signed by the party so waiving except that, prior to the Closing, the Company or the Shareholder Representative may grant a waiver on behalf of all of the Sellers and, following a Closing, the Shareholder Representative may grant a waiver on behalf of all of the Sellers. No waiver by any party shall operate or be construed as a waiver in respect of any failure, breach or default not expressly identified by such written waiver, whether of a similar or different character, and whether occurring before or after that waiver. No failure to exercise, or delay in exercising, any right, remedy, power or privilege arising from this Agreement shall operate or be construed as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. Whenever this Agreement requires or permits consent by or on behalf of any party hereto, such consent shall be given in writing in a manner consistent with the requirements for a waiver of compliance as set forth above in this _Section 9.9_. For purposes of absolute clarity, the parties agree that no Person not a party hereto (but, instead, merely listed as a third-party beneficiary hereof) shall have any right to be consulted or notified in connection with any amendment, modification, supplement, waiver or consent contemplated hereby. 

       

                                    

  

 Section 9.10 Governing Law; Mediation; Submission to Jurisdiction; Waiver of Jury Trial. 

  

  

 (a) This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard to any conflict of law provisions thereof. 

  

 (b) Except for disputes under _Section 2.5(b)_, _Section 5.11_ and _Section 5.12_ requiring an accounting firm to finally resolve disputes, and for ancillary and other claims for injunctive relief and specific performance, all disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to this Agreement, or any other agreement executed and delivered pursuant to this Agreement (other than the Employment Agreements), or the negotiation, validity or performance hereof and thereof or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby " _Transaction Dispute_ "), that are not resolved by mutual agreement shall first be submitted to the mediation organization JAMS or its successor (" _JAMS_ ") as provided herein. The parties understand and agree that this alternative dispute resolution provision shall apply equally to surviving claims of fraud. Before any Transaction Dispute is filed as a lawsuit, the parties, each represented by a representative authorized to enter into an agreement and bind such party, shall meet to mediate the dispute. An unbiased mediator with JAMS shall be selected between the parties (or, following an inability to agree upon an unbiased mediator after five (5) Business Days, JAMS shall select an unbiased mediator) and the parties shall in good faith engage in mediation of the Transaction Dispute. The parties agree that such mediation shall commence within thirty (30) days of the request of either party to mediate a Transaction Dispute under this Agreement. In the event that the parties cannot resolve the Transaction Dispute in mediation within sixty (60) days of submitting the Transaction Dispute to mediation, the parties agree that such Transaction Dispute shall be resolved as otherwise permitted by Applicable Law. The mediation shall be held in New York, New York before a single mediator and shall be conducted in accordance with the rules and regulations of JAMS unless specifically modified herein. The parties shall bear their own attorneys\' fees, costs and expenses in connection with the mediation. The parties will share equally in the fees and expenses charged by JAMS. All proceedings conducted pursuant to this agreement to mediate, including any settlement following such mediation, shall be kept confidential by all parties. 

  

 (c) ANY LEGAL SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR BASED UPON THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY SHALL, FAILING MEDIATION (AS APPLICABLE) BE INSTITUTED IN THE FEDERAL COURTS OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA OR THE COURTS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK IN EACH CASE LOCATED IN THE BOROUGH OF MANHATTAN, AND EACH PARTY IRREVOCABLY SUBMITS TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF SUCH COURTS IN ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING. SERVICE OF PROCESS, SUMMONS, NOTICE OR OTHER DOCUMENT BY MAIL TO SUCH PARTY\'S ADDRESS SET FORTH HEREIN SHALL BE EFFECTIVE SERVICE OF PROCESS FOR ANY SUIT, ACTION OR OTHER PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT. THE PARTIES IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE ANY OBJECTION TO THE LAYING OF VENUE OF ANY SUIT, ACTION OR ANY PROCEEDING IN SUCH COURTS AND IRREVOCABLY WAIVE AND AGREE NOT TO PLEAD OR CLAIM IN ANY SUCH COURT THAT ANY SUCH SUIT, ACTION OR PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN ANY SUCH COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT FORUM. 

  

 (d) EACH PARTY ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ANY CONTROVERSY WHICH MAY ARISE UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS LIKELY TO INVOLVE COMPLICATED AND DIFFICULT ISSUES AND, THEREFORE, EACH SUCH PARTY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY LEGAL ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT CERTIFIES AND ACKNOWLEDGES 

  

      

  

THAT (i) NO REPRESENTATIVE OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR
OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING
WAIVER IN THE EVENT OF A LEGAL ACTION, (ii) SUCH PARTY HAS CONSIDERED THE
IMPLICATIONS OF THIS WAIVER, (iii) SUCH PARTY MAKES THIS WAIVER VOLUNTARILY,
AND (iv) SUCH PARTY HAS BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT BY, AMONG

 Section 9.11 Specific Performance. Except as otherwise expressly provided, all rights and remedies of each of the parties under this Agreement will be cumulative, and the exercise of one or more rights or remedies will not preclude the exercise of any other right or remedy available under this Agreement, Applicable Law or otherwise. Without limiting the foregoing, the parties acknowledge that irreparable damages would occur if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not performed, or threatened not to be performed, by any party hereto in accordance with their specific terms or were otherwise breached and that money damages or other legal remedies would not be adequate for any such damages. It is accordingly agreed that each of the parties hereto shall be entitled to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions of this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, it is expressly agreed that the Company and the Sellers (acting through the Shareholder Representative) shall be entitled to specific performance of the Closing, Buyer\'s obligation to cause the transactions contemplated hereby to be fully and timely funded, and the other actions and transactions of Buyer contemplated hereby. The parties hereto further agree that no party shall be required to obtain, furnish or post any bond or similar instrument in connection with or as a condition to obtaining any remedy referenced in this _Section 9.11_, and the parties waive any objection to the imposition of such relief or any right it may have to require the obtaining, furnishing or posting of any such bond or similar instrument; _provided, however_ , to the extent any such bond or similar instrument is required by Applicable Law or Governmental Order, the parties expressly agree and intend that a bond or similar instrument in the amount of $100 shall be sufficient and reasonable. 

  

 Section 9.12 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which shall be deemed an original, but all of which together shall be deemed to be one and the same agreement. A signed copy of this Agreement delivered by facsimile or e-mail shall be deemed to have the same legal effect as delivery of an original signed copy of this Agreement. 

  

 Section 9.13 Shareholder Representative. 

  

  

 (a) Each Seller, for himself and for his or her successors and assigns, hereby irrevocably makes, constitutes and appoints the Shareholder Representative as his or her true and lawful attorney-in-fact to act for and on behalf of such Seller with respect to any matter arising under this Agreement and/or any of the Transaction Documents, and, by executing below in her capacity as the Shareholder Representative, Amy Fournier hereby expressly accepts such appointment. Each Seller acknowledges that the appointment of the Shareholder Representative is coupled with an interest and may not be revoked. 

  

 (b) In furtherance of the appointment of the Shareholder Representative, each Seller, fully and without restriction: (i) acknowledges receiving, reviewing and understanding the terms and provisions of this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents; (ii) agrees to be bound by all notices given and received and agreements and determinations made by and documents executed and delivered by the Shareholder Representative under this Agreement, the Expense Agreement and the Transaction Documents; and (iii) authorizes the Shareholder Representative to (A) deliver to Buyer all certificates and documents to be delivered to Buyer by the Sellers (or the Shareholder Representative on behalf of the Sellers) pursuant to this Agreement, the Expense Agreement and the Transaction Documents, together with any certificates and documents executed by the Sellers 

  

      

  

and deposited with the Shareholder Representative for such purpose, (B)
dispute or refrain from disputing any claim made by Buyer under this
Agreement, the Expense Agreement or the Transaction Documents, (C) negotiate
and compromise any dispute which may arise under this Agreement, the Expense
Agreement or the Transaction Documents, (D) pay any amounts due Buyer from

the Expense Agreement or the Transaction Documents, (F) sign any releases or
other documents with respect to any such dispute or remedy, (G) waive
any condition contained in this Agreement or the Transaction Documents, (H)
give such notices and instructions and do or refrain from doing such other
things as the Shareholder Representative, in her sole discretion, deems
necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of this Agreement, the
Expense Agreement or the Transaction Documents, (I) take any and all actions
and make any decisions required or permitted to be taken by her under the
Escrow Agreement, including, without limitation, the exercise of the power to
authorize delivery to Buyer of cash out of the Escrow Account in satisfaction
of claims by Buyer, to petition the Escrow Agent for the release of any or all
funds due to the Sellers under the Escrow Agreement and, subject to the
Shareholder Representative\'s other responsibilities under this subsection,
to pay to each Seller such Seller\'s Pro-Rata Share of such funds, (J) receive
all amounts payable by Buyer to the Sellers under this Agreement or the
Escrow Agreement on behalf of the Sellers and, subject to the Shareholder
Representative\'s other responsibilities under this subsection, pay to each
Seller such Seller\'s Pro-Rata Share of such amounts, (K) pay out of funds
coming into the hands of the Shareholder Representative from Buyer (including
from the Expense Account) or the Escrow Agent all fees and expenses of the
Sellers (and of the Shareholder Representative acting in such capacity)
incurred in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Transaction
Documents, including without limitation the fees and expenses of counsel,
accountants, investment bankers and other professional advisors retained by or
on behalf of the Sellers (or the Shareholder Representative) in connection
with such transactions, (L) retain such counsel, accountants and other
professional advisors as the Shareholder Representative reasonably deems
necessary to assist it in the performance of its duties hereunder and pay the
fees, costs and expenses thereof out of the funds coming into the hands of the
Shareholder Representative, (M) retain out of funds coming into the hands of
the Shareholder Representative from Buyer or the Escrow Agent, including by
depositing such amounts into the Expense Account, such amounts as the
Shareholder Representative, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate to be
held as reserves, including for expected or potential future expenses or
liabilities of the Sellers hereunder or as otherwise deemed appropriate by the
Shareholder Representative as a litigation reserve or otherwise, (N) control,
maintain and use the Expense Account as the Shareholder Representative
determines in its sole discretion is in the best interests of the Sellers and
(O) to petition the Escrow Agent for the release to the Sellers of the Expense
Reserve Amount in accordance with each Seller\'s Pro Rata Share of such
amounts. Except for any obligations for which the Sellers are severally, but
not jointly, liable, payments made by the Shareholder Representative under
this subsection will be considered to be paid by all Sellers in accordance
with their respective Pro-Rata Share. As used in this Agreement, a Seller\'s "
_Pro-Rata Share_ " means such Seller\'s Percentage Interest.

  

 (c) All actions, decisions and instructions of the Shareholder Representative shall be conclusive and binding upon the Sellers and no Seller nor any other Person shall have any claim or cause of action against the Shareholder Representative, and the Shareholder Representative shall have no liability to any Seller or any other Person, for any action taken, decision made or instruction given by the Shareholder Representative in connection with this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, except in the case of his or her own gross negligence or willful misconduct (it being the explicit intention of the Sellers that any act done or omitted pursuant to the advice of counsel (acting in good faith) shall be without gross negligence or willful 

  

      

  

misconduct). In determining the occurrence of any such event or contingency,
the Shareholder Representative may request from any one or more of the Sellers
such reasonable additional evidence as the Shareholder Representative in its
sole discretion may deem necessary to determine any fact relating to the
occurrence of such event or contingency, and may at any time inquire of and
consult with others, including any one or more of the Sellers, and the
Shareholder Representative shall not be liable to any Sellers for any damages
resulting from its delay in acting hereunder pending its receipt and
examination of additional evidence requested by him. In the performance of its
duties hereunder, the Shareholder Representative shall be entitled to rely
upon any document or instrument reasonably believed by it to be genuine,
accurate as to content and signed by any Seller.

  

 (d) If the Shareholder Representative resigns, dies or becomes incapacitated, her successor will be appointed within fifteen (15) days of such event by the Sellers owning a majority of the Shares immediately prior to the Closing. The Sellers owning a majority of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to Closing have the right, at any time, to remove the then-acting Shareholder Representative and to appoint a successor Shareholder Representative determined in their discretion; _provided, however_ , neither such removal of the then-acting Shareholder Representative nor such appointment of a successor Shareholder Representative shall be effective until the delivery to each of Buyer and the then-acting Shareholder Representative of executed counterparts of a writing signed by Sellers owning a majority of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, together with an acknowledgment for the benefit of the Sellers signed by the successor Shareholder Representative whereby he, she or it agrees to perform and be bound by all of the provisions of this Agreement applicable to the Shareholder Representative. The decisions and actions of any successor Shareholder Representative will be, for all purposes, those of the Shareholder Representative as if originally named herein. The death or incapacity of any Seller will not terminate the authority and agency of the Shareholder Representative. Any successor Shareholder Representative will provide Buyer with prompt written notice of its or his appointment. 

  

 (e) Buyer will be entitled to rely exclusively upon any communication given or other action taken by the Shareholder Representative and will not be liable to the Sellers or any other Person for any action taken or not taken in reliance upon the Shareholder Representative. Buyer will not be obligated to inquire as to the authority of the Shareholder Representative with respect to the taking of any action that the Shareholder Representative takes on behalf of the Sellers. 

   

 (f) The Sellers will, severally and not jointly and in accordance with their respective Pro-Rata Share, indemnify the Shareholder Representative and hold him or her harmless against any and all Loss, liability or expense incurred without gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of the Shareholder Representative and arising out of or in connection with his or her duties as the Shareholder Representative. The Shareholder Representative shall have the option, but not the requirement, to pay for such Losses, liabilities or expenses out of the Expense Account or, to the extent funds remain in the Escrow Account and are otherwise payable or distributable to the Sellers, out of the Escrow Account; _provided, however_ , reasonable documentation exists therefor. The Shareholder Representative shall not be entitled to be paid for his or her services hereunder unless and until a separate agreement relating to such compensation shall be signed by the Shareholder Representative, on the one hand, and the Sellers owning a majority of the Shares outstanding immediately prior to the Closing, on the other hand. 

  

  

 Section 9.14 Conflicts. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges and agrees, on its own behalf and on behalf of its Representatives and Affiliates, that the Company is the client of Andrews Kurth LLP and J. David Washburn (collectively, " _AK LLP_"). After the Closing, it is possible that AK LLP will represent one or more of the Sellers, the Shareholder Representative and/or their respective Representatives and Affiliates (individually and collectively, the " _Seller Group_ ") in connection with a variety of matters, 

        

including matters adverse or potentially adverse to the interests of Buyer
and/or the Company. Each of the parties to this Agreement hereby agrees that
AK LLP (or any successor) may serve as counsel to all or a portion of the
Seller Group, in connection with any such matter. Each of the parties hereto
consents to such representation, and waives any conflict of interest arising
therefrom. Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that such consent and
waiver is voluntary, that it has been carefully considered, and that the
parties have consulted with counsel or have been advised they should do so in
connection herewith. Each of the parties further agrees that all
communications or privileged materials between AK LLP, on the one hand, and
the Company (or any Company Representative) or a Seller, on the other hand,
prior to the Closing (together with any other legally protected or privileged
communications or materials including those between members of the
Seller Group) (collectively, " _Privileged Materials_ ") are the property of
the Sellers (as a group) and that Buyer and the Company cannot obtain copies
of, or access to, any such Privileged Materials without a waiver from the
Shareholder Representative. Each of the parties expressly agrees that, at and
after the Closing (and continuing indefinitely thereafter), any privilege
related to any of the Privileged Materials shall be solely controlled by the
Sellers acting collectively through the Shareholder Representative. Buyer
further agrees that it will not and that it will not permit the Company to
seek to obtain any such Privileged Materials, including by way of review of
any electronic communications or documents or by seeking to have the Sellers
and/or the Shareholder Representative waive the attorney-client or other
privilege, or by otherwise asserting that Buyer (or the Company) has the right
to waive the attorney-client or other privilege. In the event that Buyer or
the Company is required by Governmental Order or otherwise to access or
obtain a copy of such Privileged Materials, Buyer shall immediately (and, in
any event, within two (2) Business Days) notify the Shareholder
Representative in writing (including by making specific reference to this
Section) so that the Shareholder Representative can seek a protective order
and Buyer agrees to use all commercially reasonable efforts to assist
therewith.
