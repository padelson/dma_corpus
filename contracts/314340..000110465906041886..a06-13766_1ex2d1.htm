(b) The Company will give the Buyer (i) prompt notice of any demands for
appraisal filed pursuant to Section 262 of the DGCL received by the Company,
withdrawals of such demands and any other instruments served or delivered in
connection with such demands pursuant to the DGCL and received by the Company
and (ii) the opportunity to participate in all negotiations and proceedings
with respect to demands under the DGCL consistent with the obligations of the
Company thereunder. The Company will not, except with the prior written
consent of the Buyer, (A) make any payments with respect to any such demand
or (B) offer to settle or settle any such demand.

  

SECTION 3.4 _Exchange of Certificates_.

  

(a) _Paying Agent; Payment Fund_. Prior to the Effective Time, the Buyer will
designate a bank or trust company (which bank or trust company will be
reasonably acceptable to the Company) to act as agent (the " **Paying Agent**
") to receive the funds to which holders of shares of the Company
Stockholders will become entitled pursuant to Section 3.1(c). At the
Effective Time, the Company will deposit with the Paying Agent an amount of
cash equal to the product of (i) the number of Company Shares outstanding
immediately prior to the Effective Time (other than Excluded Shares)
_multiplied_ _by_ (ii) the Merger Consideration (the " **Payment Fund**
"). The Payment Fund will be invested by the Paying Agent as directed by
the Surviving Corporation; _provided_ , that such investments will be (A)
in obligations of or guaranteed by the

     

   

United States of America or of any agency thereof and backed by the full
faith and credit of the United States of America, (B) in commercial paper
obligations rated A-1 or P-1 or better by either MoodyÂ’s Investors Service,
Inc. or Standard and PoorÂ’s Corporation or (C) in deposit accounts,
certificates of deposit or bankerÂ’s acceptances of, repurchase or reverse
repurchase agreements with, or Eurodollar time deposits purchased from,
commercial banks, each of which has capital, surplus and undivided profits
aggregating more than $1.0 billion (based on the most recent financial
statements of such bank which are then publicly available at the SEC or
otherwise); _provided_ , that no such investment or losses thereon will
affect the Merger Consideration payable to former Company Stockholders under
this Agreement, and the Buyer will promptly provide, or will cause the
Surviving Corporation to promptly provide, additional funds to the Paying
Agent for the benefit of the former Company Stockholders in the amount of any
such losses.

  

(b) _Exchange Procedure_. As soon as reasonably practicable after the
Effective Time (but in any event, no later than two Business Days after the
Effective Time), the Surviving Corporation will cause the Paying Agent to
mail to each Person who was, at the Effective Time, a holder of record of
Company Shares entitled to receive the Merger Consideration pursuant to
Section 3.1(c), (i) a form of letter of transmittal for use in effecting the
surrender of Certificates in order to receive payment of the Merger
Consideration (which letter of transmittal will be in customary form and will
specify that delivery will be effected, and risk of loss and title to the
Certificates will pass, only upon proper delivery of such Certificates to the
Paying Agent) and (ii) instructions for use in effecting the surrender of
such Certificates pursuant to such letter of transmittal. Upon surrender of a
Certificate for cancellation to the Paying Agent, together with such letter
of transmittal, duly completed and validly executed in accordance with the
instructions thereto, and such other documents as may reasonably be required
by the Paying Agent, the Paying Agent will pay from the Payment Fund to the
holder of the Company Shares represented by such Certificate, or as otherwise
directed in the letter of transmittal, the Merger Consideration for each
Company Share formerly evidenced by such Certificate, and such Certificate
will forthwith be canceled. No interest will be paid or will accrue on the
Merger Consideration payable upon surrender of any Certificate. If payment of
the Merger Consideration is to be made to a Person other than the Person in
whose name the surrendered Certificate is registered on the stock transfer
books of the Company, it will be a condition of payment that the Certificate
so surrendered will be endorsed properly or otherwise be in proper form for
transfer and that the Person requesting such payment will have paid all
transfer and other Taxes required by reason of the payment of the Merger
Consideration to a Person other than the registered holder of the Certificate
surrendered or will have established to the satisfaction of the Surviving
Corporation that such Taxes either have been paid or are not applicable.

  

(c) _Termination of Payment Fund_. Promptly following the date which is 180
days after the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation will be entitled to
require the Paying Agent to deliver to it any funds in the Payment Fund which
had been made available to the Paying Agent and not disbursed to holders of
Company Shares (including all interest and other income received by the
Paying Agent in respect of all funds made available to it), and thereafter
each holder of a Certificate formerly representing a Company Share entitled
to the Merger Consideration who has not received the Merger Consideration
therefor may surrender such Certificate to the Surviving Corporation and,
subject to abandoned property, escheat and other

     

   

similar Laws, receive in consideration therefor the aggregate Merger
Consideration that may be payable upon due surrender of the Certificates held
by them, without interest or dividends thereon.

  

(d) _No Further Ownership Rights in Company Shares_. The Merger Consideration
paid upon the surrender of a Certificate in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement will be deemed to have been paid in full satisfaction of all rights
pertaining to the Company Shares formerly represented by such Certificate. At
the Effective Time, the stock transfer books of the Company will be closed,
and there will be no further registration of transfers on the stock transfer
books of the Surviving Corporation of the Company Shares that were
outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time. If, after the Effective
Time, Certificates are presented to the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent for transfer or any other reason, they will be canceled and exchanged
for the Merger Consideration as provided in this Article III.

  

(e) _No Liability_. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable Law, none
of the Buyer, Merger Sub, the Company, the Surviving Corporation or the
Paying Agent will be liable to any Company Stockholder or other person in
respect of any cash delivered to a public official pursuant to any applicable
abandoned property, escheat or similar Laws. Any portion of the Payment Fund
remaining unclaimed by Company Stockholders as of a date that is immediately
prior to such time as such amounts would otherwise escheat to or become
property of any Governmental Entity will, to the extent permitted by
applicable Law, become the property of the Buyer free and clear of any claims
or interest of any Person previously entitled thereto.

  

(f) _Lost, Stolen or Destroyed Certificates_. In the event that any
Certificate has been lost, stolen or destroyed, the Surviving Corporation or
Paying Agent will, upon the receipt of an affidavit of that fact by the
holder thereof in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Surviving
Corporation or Paying Agent, as the case may be, pay in exchange for such
lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate the Merger Consideration payable in
respect of the Company Shares previously evidenced by such lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate; _provided_ , that the Surviving Corporation may, in
its discretion and as a condition precedent to the payment of such Merger
Consideration, require the owner of such lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate to deliver a bond in such sum as the Surviving Corporation may
reasonably direct as indemnity against any claim that may be made against the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent with respect to such Certificate.

  

SECTION 3.5 _Certain Tax Matters_. Each of the Buyer, the Surviving
Corporation and the Paying Agent will be entitled to deduct and
withhold from the amounts otherwise payable pursuant to this Agreement to any
Person such amounts as the Buyer, the Surviving Corporation or the Paying
Agent is required to deduct and withhold with respect to the making of such
payment under the Code, or any provision of state, local or foreign Tax Law.
To the extent that amounts are so deducted and withheld by the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent, such withheld amounts will be
treated for all purposes of this Agreement as having been paid to the Person
in respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Buyer, the
Surviving Corporation or the Paying Agent (as applicable).

Schedule if such fact, event or occurrence existed as of the date hereof
which did not arise out of a breach of this Agreement by the Company (a "
**Post-Signing Change** "), (iii) any failure by it to comply in all material
respects with any material covenant, condition or agreement to be complied
with or satisfied by it under this Agreement and (iv) the occurrence of any
matter or event which would reasonably be expected to have, individually or

the event that the Company provides the Buyer with notice of a Post-Signing

condition set forth in Section 7.1(a) to fail to be satisfied as of the
Closing (a " **Closing Condition Change** "). In the event that the Notice of
Change states that a Post-Signing Change is a Closing Condition Change and
Buyer nonetheless proceeds with the Closing, the Buyer will be deemed to have
waived the condition to Closing set forth in Section 7.1(a) with respect to
the Closing Condition Change. Except for the foregoing, no notice provided
under this Section 6.8(a) will be deemed to cure any breach of
representation, warranty or covenant or update the Disclosure Schedule
or otherwise affect in any respect the rights and remedies of any party.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement or the Indemnification Agreement
to the contrary, none of the Indemnifying Parties will have any liability
following the Closing (i) with respect to the CompanyÂ’s breach or alleged
breach of this Section 6.8(a) or (ii) with respect to any Post-Signing Change
set forth in a Notice of Change delivered prior to the Closing unless and
until the aggregate amount of Losses (as such term is defined in the
Indemnification Agreement) arising out of such Post-Signing Changes exceeds
$300,000, and then only to the extent such amount exceeds $300,000 and

the Buyer, Merger Sub or the Company (or any stockholder, agent, consultant
or Representative of any such party); _provided_ , that the provisions
of Sections 8.2, 9.1, 9.6, 9.7, 9.8, 9.11, 9.14, 9.15 and this Section
8.3 will survive any termination hereof pursuant to Section 8.1.
Nothing herein shall relieve the parties of any liability for any breaches
of representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in
this Agreement that occur prior to the termination of this Agreement;
_provided_ ,  _however_ , that the payment by the Company of a Termination
Fee, if applicable, will be considered liquidated damages for any breach by
the Company of this Agreement and in the event of such payment the Company
will not have any other Liability for any breach by it of any of the
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements set forth in this
Agreement.

  

SECTION 8.4 _Amendments_. This Agreement may be amended by the parties

board of directors, in the case of Merger Sub, by its Board of Directors, and
in the case of the Company, by its Board of Directors, at any time before or
after the receipt of the Stockholder Approval, but, after any such approval,
no amendment will be made which by Law or in accordance with the rules of any
relevant stock exchange requires further approval by the Company Stockholders
without such further approval. This Agreement may not be amended except by
an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Buyer, Merger Sub and
the Company.

  

SECTION 8.5 _Waiver_. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether before
or after the Special Meeting, the Buyer (on behalf of itself and Merger Sub)

obligations or other acts of the Company or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any
representations or warranties or compliance with any of the agreements,
covenants or conditions of the Company or with any conditions to its own
obligations. Any agreement on the part of the Buyer (on behalf of itself and
Merger Sub) to any such extension or waiver will be valid only if such waiver
is set forth in an instrument in writing signed on behalf of the Buyer by its
duly authorized officer. At any time prior to the Effective Time, whether
before or after the Special Meeting, the Company may (a) extend the time for
the performance of any of the covenants, obligations or other acts of the
Buyer or Merger Sub or (b) waive any inaccuracy of any representations or
warranties or compliance with any of the agreements, covenants or conditions
of the Buyer or Merger Sub, or with any conditions to its own obligations.
Any agreement on the part of the Company to any such extension or waiver will
be valid only if such waiver is set forth in an instrument in writing signed
on behalf of the Company by its duly authorized officer. The failure of any
party to this Agreement to assert any of its rights under this Agreement or
otherwise will not constitute a waiver of such rights. The waiver of any such
right with respect to particular facts and other circumstances will not be

     

   

deemed a waiver with respect to any other facts and circumstances, and each
such right will be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any time
and from time to time.
