interfere with the normal business operations of the Target Group, to the

(or the then currently serving chief financial officer of Syniverse), Robert
Krajick, William McGee, Wayne Nelson, Leigh Ann Davey, John Hofmann, Richard
DeNardis and Collin Roche (collectively, the " _Designated Persons_ "), and to
such other persons as reasonably and mutually agreed between the Seller and
Syniverse from time-to-time; _provided_ _that_ , the such Competitive

PAGE 13 Group and their respective representatives and advisors shall hold all
information furnished pursuant to any provision of this Agreement by or on
behalf of any Member of the Seller Group or any of their respective
representatives in confidence in accordance with the terms of the
confidentiality agreement dated 6 November 2006 by and between Syniverse and
the Seller, as such agreement has been amended and supplemented by the
parties from time to time. 
---|---|--- 



   7.2 | _SEC Filing_. The Seller understands that Syniverse or one of
its affiliates may file a securities filing (the " _Filing_ ") with the SEC,
which Filing might be required to include financial statements of the Target
Group for periods prior to the Completion Date prepared in accordance with

Statements_ ").  
---|--- 

Accordingly, promptly after the date of this Agreement the Seller shall, at
the Buyers expense, make reasonable efforts to engage (on terms and
conditions reasonably acceptable to the Buyer and the Seller) its current
independent auditors, Ernst and Young LLP (or, if Ernst and Young LLP (" _E andY_")
is unwilling to accept such engagement, another internationally recognized
firm of independent auditors reasonably acceptable to the Seller and Syniverse
(EandY, or any such other firm of independent auditors, the " _Auditor_ ")), to

Financial Statements. In addition, the Seller shall, at the Buyers expense,

reasonable efforts to ensure that their respective representatives (including
legal, financial and such independent auditors) shall furnish, to Syniverse
and the Buyer any information or documents reasonably requested by Syniverse
and the Buyer in the possession of any member of the Seller Group, or to
which any member of the Seller Group has access, necessary or desirable for
the completion of the S-X Financial Statements. For the avoidance of doubt, if
any such provision of information as described in this clause 7.2 would, or
would reasonably be likely to, result in or require access to, or the
disclosure of, Competitive Information, such access or disclosure shall only
be made in accordance with clause 7.1(b). The Buyer acknowledges and agrees
that the engagement of the Auditor, the delivery of the audit with respect to
the Target Group Companies and the delivery of the S-X Financial Statements is
not a condition to Completion.



   7.3 | _Non-Solicitation; Acquisition Proposal_. 
---|--- 



     | (a) |

The Seller agrees that prior to Completion (i) it, its subsidiaries and its
and its subsidiaries officers and directors shall not, and (ii) it shall use
reasonable efforts to ensure that its and the Target Groups financial
advisors, lawyers, accountants, employees, consultants or other agents,
advisors and/or representatives shall not (A) directly or indirectly,
initiate, solicit or facilitate any inquiries or the making or submission of
any proposal or offer with respect to an Acquisition Proposal or (B) directly

PAGE 14  provide access to its properties, books and records or any confidential
information or data to, any Person relating to an Acquisition Proposal or,

letter of intent or arrangement with respect to any Acquisition Proposal
(other than a confidentiality agreement described below). 

---|--- 


     | (b) | Subject to clause 7.3(c) and clause 7.3(d), neither the
Seller, the Targets nor any of their respective Boards of Directors shall
recommend to shareholders any Acquisition Proposal or approve any agreement
with respect to an Acquisition Proposal. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing contained in this Agreement shall prevent the Seller or its Board of
Directors from, prior to obtaining the Shareholder Consent, (A) providing
access to its properties, books and records and providing information or data
in response to a request therefor by a Person who has made an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal if the Board of Directors receives from the
Person so requesting such information an executed confidentiality agreement or
(B) engaging in any negotiations or discussions with any Person who has made
an unsolicited bona fide written Acquisition Proposal, if and only to the
extent that prior to taking any of the actions set forth in clauses (A) or
(B) of clause (ii) above, 
---|---|--- 



     | (i) | the Board of Directors of the Seller shall have determined
in good faith, consistent with fiduciary considerations and after consultation
with its outside legal counsel and financial advisors, that such action will
result in a Superior Proposal (as defined below) from the party that made the
applicable Acquisition Proposal, and 
---|---|--- 


     | (ii) | the Seller shall have informed the Buyer promptly following
(and in no event later than 24 (twenty four) hours after) the taking by it of
any such action. 
---|---|--- 
 

A " _Superior Proposal_ " means an Acquisition Proposal that is reasonably
capable of being consummated, taking into account all legal, financial,
regulatory, timing, and similar aspects of, and conditions to, the proposal,
the likelihood of obtaining necessary financing and the Person making the
proposal, and, if consummated, would in the reasonable belief of the
Sellers Board of Directors result in a transaction more favourable to the
Sellers shareholders than the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
(after giving effect to any adjustments to the terms and provisions of this
Agreement committed to in writing by the Buyer in response to such
Acquisition Proposal).



     | (c) |

In the case of a Superior Proposal that complies with clause 7.3(b), the
Seller shall not enter into, and shall procure that no Member of the Seller
Group enters into, any form of legally binding documentation in respect of
such Superior Proposal, nor shall the Sellers Board of Directors recommend
any offer for the Seller, unless the Buyer fails, within three Business Days
of receiving notice from the Seller of such Superior Proposal, (i) to confirm
in writing that the Buyer or a Member of the Buyer Group intends to make an
offer for the shares or the assets   

---|---|--- 



 

PAGE 15  that are the subject of the Superior Proposal which would, in the reasonable
opinion of the Sellers financial advisers, provide the shareholders of
the Seller at least five percent greater financial value on a per share basis
than the Superior Proposal and is otherwise on terms which are, in the
reasonable opinion of the Sellers financial advisers, substantially equal to
or not materially worse than those contained in the Superior Proposal ("
_Matched Proposal_ ") and (ii) to prosecute such offer expeditiously
thereafter; _provided_ , that in the case of a Superior Proposal for all or a
majority of the outstanding issued share capital of the Seller or the whole
or substantially the whole of the business or assets of the Seller Group,
either of the following may constitute a Matched Proposal: (A) an offer for
all or a majority of the outstanding issued share capital of the Seller or
the whole or substantially the whole of the business or assets of the Seller
Group or (B) a revised offer for the shares of the Target Companies that
would, in the reasonable opinion of the Sellers financial advisers when
considered together with any North American Sale with respect to which, at the
time of the revised offer, the Seller has entered into a definitive agreement,
result in the shareholders of the Seller receiving at least five percent
greater financial value on a per share basis than the Superior Proposal. In
the event the Buyer provides written notice of a Matched Proposal to the
Seller pursuant to this clause 7.3(c), the Seller agrees to procure that
its directors approve and give a unanimous and unqualified recommendation of
such Matched Proposal to its shareholder in connection with the Shareholder
Consent. 

---|--- 


     | (d) | If (i) at any time prior to obtaining the Shareholder
Consent, the Sellers Board of Directors determines in good faith, after
consultation with its financial advisors and outside legal counsel, in
response to a bona fide written Acquisition Proposal that was unsolicited and
that did not otherwise result from a breach of clause 7.3(a) or 7.3(b), that
such proposal is a Superior Proposal, (ii) the Buyer has not provided written
notice of a Matched Proposal in accordance with clause 7.3(c), and (iii) the
Seller otherwise complies with the terms and conditions of clause 11 below,
the Seller may terminate this Agreement and/or its Board of Directors
may approve or recommend such Superior Proposal to its shareholders and
immediately prior to or concurrently with the termination of this Agreement
enter into any agreement, understanding, letter of intent or arrangement with
respect to such Superior Proposal, as applicable. 
---|---|--- 



     | (e) | Prior to Completion, the Seller shall immediately cease and
shall cause to be terminated any existing activities, discussions or
negotiations with any Persons conducted heretofore with respect to any
Acquisition Proposal. The Seller also shall, if it has not already done so,
promptly request, to the extent it has a contractual right to do so, that each
Person, if any, that has heretofore executed a confidentiality
agreement within the twelve months prior to the date of this Agreement in
connection with its consideration of any Acquisition Proposal shall return or
destroy all confidential information or data heretofore furnished to any
Person by or on behalf of it or any of its subsidiaries.

the Buyer after receipt of an Acquisition Proposal and thereafter shall keep
the Buyer reasonably informed of the status and material terms and conditions
of any proposals or offers. 
---|---|--- 



   7.4 | _Technology Cooperation_. Prior to Completion, the Target Group
Companies will cooperate so far as is reasonably practicable with the Buyer
and Syniverse to develop a plan for the post-Completion integration of the
technology and business functions of the Target Group Companies, the Buyer and
Syniverse, subject in all cases to applicable legal requirements or applicable
law and insofar as such cooperation does not interfere with the normal
business operations of the Target Group. For the avoidance of doubt, if any
such cooperation as described in this clause 7.4 would, or would reasonably be
likely to, result in or require access to, or the disclosure of, Competitive
Information, such access or disclosure shall only be made in accordance with
clause 7.1(b). 
---|--- 



   7.5 | _Financing Cooperation_. Prior to Completion, the Seller shall
provide, and shall use all reasonable endeavours to cause each Target Company
and its representatives (including legal, financial and accounting advisors)
to provide, all cooperation reasonably requested by the Buyer Group in
connection with the arrangement of the financing to be obtained by the Buyer
Group in connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (the
" _Financing_ ") (it being understood that the completion of any Financing is
not a condition to the obligations of the Buyer hereunder), including, without
limitation, (i) assisting with the preparation of materials for rating agency
presentations, (ii) executing and delivering any pledge and security
documents, other definitive financing documents, or other certificates or
documents as may be reasonably requested and otherwise reasonably
facilitating the pledging of collateral (provided that no such pledge or
security documents shall be effective until Completion), (iii) furnishing the
Buyer Group and their Financing sources as promptly as practicable with
financial and other pertinent information regarding the Target Group
Companies as may be reasonably requested by the Buyer, (iv) providing monthly
accounts of the Target Group Companies (excluding footnotes) and annual
audited accounts of the Seller Group within the time frame, and to the
extent, such accounts are prepared, and (v) taking all corporate actions,
subject to the occurrence of Completion, reasonably requested by the Buyer
Group to permit the consummation of the Financing and the direct borrowing or
incurrence of all of the proceeds of the Financing, by the Target Group
Companies immediately following Completion; _provided_ that in each case such
requested cooperation does not unreasonably interfere with the
ongoing operations of the Seller or the Target Group Companies. The Seller
hereby consents to the use of its and the Target Group Companies logos in
connection with the Financing; provided that such logos are used solely in a
manner that is not intended to, nor reasonably likely to, harm or disparage
the Seller or the Target Group Companies or the reputation or goodwill of the
Seller or the Target Group Companies and its or their marks. For the avoidance
of doubt, (i) if any such cooperation as described in this clause 7.5 would,
or would reasonably be likely to, result in or require access to, or the
disclosure of, Competitive Information, such access or disclosure shall only
be made in accordance with clause 7.1(b), and (ii) for the purposes of this
clause 7.5 only, the proviso set out in clause 7.1(b) in relation to
Syniverses advisors shall be deemed to include representatives of Syniverses
and the Buyers financing sources and their respective outside legal counsel.

   12.1 | Each party shall, and shall use reasonable endeavours to procure
that any necessary third party shall, from time to time, execute such
documents and perform such acts and things as either the Seller or the Buyer
may reasonably require to transfer the Shares to the Buyer and to give each
party the full benefit of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, from and after the Completion Date and through the Sellers
preparation of its year-end 2007 audited financial statements (the " _2007
Audited Financials_ "), the Buyer and Syniverse shall, and shall cause each
Target Group Company and the respective officers, directors, managers,
members, employees, consultants and other representatives of each of Buyer,
Syniverse and each Target Group Company to, at the Sellers expense,
reasonably cooperate with the Seller and its authorized representatives
in connection with (i) the Sellers preparation of its financial statements
(including, without limitation, the 2007 Audited Financials and interim
results) and its Tax Returns for Tax-year 2007, and (ii) the Sellers
compliance with the requirements of any securities exchange on which the
Sellers securities may then be listed (including, without limitation, the AIM
Rules for Companies and any other applicable rules and regulations). 
---|--- 


   12.2 | The Buyer shall procure that promptly (but in any event within
twenty Business Days) after Completion no Target Group Company shall have as
any part of its corporate name or otherwise use, whether as part of the name
under which it carries on business or otherwise, the names "Billing Services
Group" or "BSG" or any name intended or likely to be confused or associated
with it and the Buyer shall supply a copy of the certificate of incorporation
on change of name (or equivalent confirmation in the case of any Group Company
incorporated outside the United Kingdom) to the Seller promptly after each
such change being effected, and shall use its reasonable best endeavours to
remove or procure the removal of all references to and reproductions of such
name from the assets of each Target Group Company prior to the first
anniversary of the Completion Date. 
---|--- 


   12.3 | The Buyer shall procure that  
---|--- 



     | (a) | each Target Group Company shall preserve until the seventh
anniversary of Completion all books, records and documents which are at
Completion in its possession or under its control insofar as they record
matters occurring on or before Completion; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | until the seventh anniversary of Completion, the Seller and
its agents, accountants, solicitors and other professional advisers shall be
allowed to inspect and, at the Buyers expense, take copies of the books,
records and documents referred to in clause 12.3(a) (but only in relation to
matters recorded therein which occurred on or before Completion) at all
reasonable times upon the Seller giving reasonable notice of such requirement
to the relevant Target Group Company. 
---|---|--- 



   12.4 |

The Buyer shall not, so long as any of the Buyers obligations set out in
clauses 12.2 to 12.3 (inclusive) or the warranties by the Buyer set out
in clause 9 are applicable or capable of taking effect, cease to control any
Target Group Company or any material part   

---|--- 



 

PAGE 24  of its business without first procuring from the Person acquiring control an
undertaking in a form satisfactory to, and in favour of, the Seller and
its successor in title to be bound by such provisions to the same extent as
the Buyer is bound. 

---|--- 



   12.5 | To facilitate Syniverses operation of the business of the
Target Group Companies (the " _Business_ ") following Completion, the Seller
shall (i) provide, or cause other Members of the Seller Group to provide,
Syniverse, the Buyer, and the Target Group Companies with such transition
services on the general terms set forth below as may be reasonably be
requested by Syniverse to operate the Business (the " _Services_ "), and (ii)
cause such Members of the Seller Group that will be involved in providing the
Services to execute a Joinder Agreement in the form as set forth in Schedule
7, pursuant to which such Member of the Seller Group shall join in and agree
to become bound to the provisions of this clause 12.5 (the Seller and such
Members of the Seller Group providing the Services, collectively, the "
_Service Provider_ "):  
---|--- 



     | (a) | the Service Provider shall provide the Services for such
length of time after Completion as Syniverse shall reasonably request and in
consideration therefor Syniverse shall pay the Service Provider, in arrears
on the last business day of each month, an amount equal to (i) the actual cost
charged by the Seller Group for providing such Services to the Target Group
Companies prior to the date of this Agreement, and (ii) any third-party costs
and expenses incurred by the Service Provider with the prior consent of
Syniverse in connection with the provision of the Services hereunder in excess
of those actually incurred prior to the date of this Agreement by the Seller
Group; 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the Services shall be performed by Service Provider with
reasonable care and in a manner consistent with Service Providers past
practices with respect to the provision of such Services to the Business, and
the Service Provider shall maintain sufficient resources to perform the
Services in accordance with this clause 12.5; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | all information disclosed to the Service Provider, any other
Member of the Seller Group or any other Person controlled by or under common
control with the Service Provider or any other Member of the Seller Group by
Syniverse or any other member of the Buyer Group (which, for purposes of this
clause 12.5, shall include the Target Group Companies) pursuant to this clause
12.5 shall be deemed to be "Confidential Information" as defined in the
Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement, and the Service Providers use
and disclosure of such information shall be subject to the terms and
conditions of the Confidentiality and Non-Solicitation Agreement. 
---|---|--- 



   13 | INSURANCE 
---|--- 



   13.1 | The Buyer acknowledges and agrees that  
---|--- 



     | (a) | all insurance cover effected by the Seller or a Member of
the Seller Group for the benefit of any Target Group Company will cease to
have effect upon Completion and, accordingly, that it is the responsibility
of the Buyer to effect new insurance for the benefit of the Target Group
Companies with effect from Completion; 
---|---|--- 



 

PAGE 25 Completion under any insurance policy effected by the Seller or a Member of
the Seller Group for the benefit of any Target Group Company; and 
---|---|--- 



     | (c) | where the insurance cover referred to in clause 13.1(a) is
on a claims made basis, the Buyer shall have no claim against the Seller in
respect of any event, circumstance or incident occurring before Completion
where no claim in respect thereof has been made before Completion. 
---|---|--- 



   13.2 | As of the Completion Date, the Buyer shall procure and maintain
a liability insurance policy (or acquire a tail-policy) for the benefit of
each Target Group Companys officers and former officers, and directors and
former directors to the fullest extent possible under applicable laws for a
period of not less than six years from Completion; _provided_ that the cost of
such insurance cover shall not exceed $300,000, and if the cost of such
insurance cover would exceed $300,000, then the Buyer shall procure and
maintain the maximum insurance cover available at such price. 
---|--- 


   13.3 | Nothing in this clause is intended to affect in any way or
otherwise apply to insurances for the benefit of the Target Group effected by
the landlord of any property occupied by a Target Group Company.

---|--- 



     | (a) | the receipt from the EC Commission or the appropriate
National Competition Authority for each of the jurisdictions listed in
paragraph 2 below and any other jurisdiction that may assert prior to
Completion its authority under applicable competition laws over the Sale
(hereafter referred to as the Relevant National Competition Authority/ies) by
the Buyer Group, either unconditionally or on conditions acceptable to the
Buyer Group in its sole discretion of consents to or approvals to the Sale;
or 
---|---|--- 



     | (b) | the expiry of any relevant waiting period without (x) any
substantive objection being raised by the Relevant National Competition
Authority or any Competent Authority to the Sale or (y) any court or

   2 | To the best of the knowledge of both the Buyer Group and the Seller
Group, and based on data exchanged between Syniverse and the Seller, in
relation to the subject matter of this Agreement, merger filings will be
required to be made in Germany, Greece, Slovenia, Spain, and Portugal. If it
becomes apparent before Completion that notification is required in other
jurisdictions, the Buyer Group and the Seller Group mutually agree to notify
the Agreement to the Relevant National Competition Authority on the terms of
this Schedule 2. 
---|--- 



   3 | The Buyer Group shall promptly (and in any event within 15 Business
Days from the date of this Agreement) submit the appropriate request to the EC
Commission that the latter accept jurisdiction over the subject matter of
this Agreement pursuant to Article 4 of Council Regulation 139/2004 in lieu of
the separate national jurisdictions. 
---|--- 


   4 | Within 10 Business Days of receiving an affirmative response
pursuant to paragraph 3 above, the Buyer Group shall notify the subject matter
of this Agreement to the EC Commission by submitting the notification
prepared pursuant to this Agreement (the " _Notification_ "). 
---|--- 



   5 | In the event that the EC Commission does not accept jurisdiction,

shall give such undertakings and accept such conditions as the EC Commission
or the Relevant National Competition Authority shall require of it as a
condition of granting the consents to the Sale (such undertakings and
conditions, collectively " _Competition Authority Approval Conditions_ ");
_provided_ that (a) such Competition Authority Approval Conditions are
acceptable to the Buyer Group in its sole discretion, (b) if and to the extent
such Competition Authority Approval Conditions materially and adversely
affect the Seller Group (other than as a result of the Buyer Group electing
not to accept such Competition Authority Approval Conditions), such
Competition Authority Approval Conditions shall also be acceptable to the
Seller Group in its sole discretion, and (c) nothing herein shall obligate
the Seller Group to accept a reduction in Consideration in order to induce the
Buyer Group to accept any Competition Authority Approval Conditions. 
---|---

shall consult with the Sellers Solicitors (on behalf of the Sellers) in
respect of the Notification or National Notifications and shall provide the
Sellers Solicitors (on behalf of the Sellers) with a reasonable opportunity
to review such filings prior to their submission to the Relevant Competition
Authorities. For the purposes of this clause a "reasonable opportunity" shall
mean two Business Days, or such shorter period as may be agreed by the parties
to be required or practicable under the circumstances. 
---|--- 


   8 | The Buyer Group undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to keep
the Sellers Solicitors (on behalf of the Sellers) promptly informed as to
progress towards satisfaction of the Competition Conditions and further
undertakes to use all reasonable endeavours to: 
---|--- 



     | (a) | notify the Sellers Solicitors (on behalf of the Sellers)
promptly and provide copies of any communications from the EC Commission or

Sellers) a reasonable opportunity to provide comments on such submissions and
communications before they are submitted or sent and provide the Sellers
Solicitors (on behalf of the Sellers) promptly with copies of all such
submissions and communications in the form submitted or sent; 

---|--- 


     | (c) | where reasonably requested by the Sellers and where
permitted by the EC Commission or the Relevant National Competition
Authorities or others persons concerned, allow the persons nominated by the
Sellers to attend all meetings with the EC Commission or the Relevant National
Competition Authorities or other persons concerned, and, where permitted, to
make oral submissions at such meetings; and 
---|---|--- 


     | (d) | regularly review with the Sellers Solicitors (on behalf of
the Sellers) the progress of all Notifications and promptly provide to the
Sellers Solicitors all information and documents reasonably requested by
them in relation to the Notifications and the satisfaction of the Competition
Conditions.
