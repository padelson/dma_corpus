Representative's position for such item (as set forth in the Dispute Notice
delivered to Buyer by Seller Representative) or within such other range of
numbers as Buyer and Seller Representative may agree in writing and shall
thereafter deliver to the Accountants in writing; and (C) the determination by

Adjustment Amount, as set forth in a written notice delivered to both parties by
the Accountants, shall be binding and conclusive on the parties. The fees of the
Accountants for such determination shall be borne by Buyer, on the one hand, and
Sellers, on the other hand, in inverse proportion to the manner in which such
parties prevail on the items resolved by the Accountants, which proportionate
allocation shall be calculated on an aggregate basis based on the relative
dollar values of the amounts in dispute and shall be computed by the Accountants
at the time the determination of the Accountants is rendered.

                  (c)      On the tenth (10th) Business Day following the final
determination of the Adjustment Amount, (i) if the Adjustment Amount is positive

Buyer Adjustment Amount required to be paid by Buyer pursuant to clause (i) of
Section 2.05(c) as directed by Seller Representative and agrees that, following
such payment in full, Buyer shall have no liability to any Seller in respect of
the allocation of the Adjustment Amount among Sellers made by Seller
Representative pursuant to Section 2.05(c) and (ii) authorizes LEF II to pay the
portion of the Seller Adjustment Amount required to be paid by LEF II pursuant
to clause (ii) of Section 2.05(c) as determined by Seller Representative and
agrees that, following such payment or earlier demand by LEF II, each Seller

         7.06     Notification.
                  ------------

                  (a)      From the date hereof until the Closing Date, the
Company and each Seller shall disclose to Buyer in writing (in the form of
updated schedules, if applicable) any material variances from the

the representations and warranties made by such Seller in Article IV) and
Article V, as applicable, promptly upon such Seller becoming aware of such
variances with respect to Article IV and promptly upon such variances with
respect to Article V coming to the attention of the Knowledge of the Company.
Such disclosures shall amend and supplement the appropriate schedules delivered
on the date hereof. Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the
contrary, unless Buyer provides the Company or Seller Representative with an
objection notice within five (5) Business Days after delivery by the Company or
Seller Representative of an updated disclosure schedule pursuant to this Section
7.06(a), Buyer shall be deemed to have accepted and agreed to the updated
disclosure schedule. Any fact, matter or occurrence disclosed in such updated
Schedule that should have been disclosed in the Disclosure Schedules with
respect to the representations and warranties contained in Article IV or Article
V as of the date hereof is referred to herein as a "Pre-Signing Matter" and any
fact, matter or occurrence that occurs after the date hereof and that is
disclosed pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 7.06(a) with respect to
the representations and warranties contained in Article IV or Article V in an
updated Schedule is referred to herein as a "Post-Signing Matter". Buyer may not
terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.01(b) due to the failure to
satisfy the Closing condition specified in Section 3.01(g) on account of a
Pre-Signing Matter or a Post-Signing Matter unless a decision to so terminate
has been communicated in writing to Seller Representative along with the
objection notice referred to in this Section 7.06(a) relating to such
Pre-Signing Matter or Post-Signing Matter, as applicable; provided, however, if
any Pre-Signing Matter or Post-Signing Matter is subsequently disclosed, any
previously disclosed Pre-Signing Matter or Post-Signing Matter may be considered
in determining if the condition set forth in Section 3.01(g) may be satisfied or
not. For the avoidance of doubt, any decision by Buyer or the Seller
Representative to terminate this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.01 or 3.02, as
applicable, may be challenged by the Seller Representative or Buyer, as
applicable, pursuant to all available remedies.

                                       36
<PAGE>

                  (b)      From the date hereof until the Closing Date, Buyer
shall disclose to the Company and Seller Representative in writing any material
variances from Buyer's representations and warranties contained in Article VI
promptly upon discovery thereof, and Buyer shall promptly notify Seller
Representative if, to the Knowledge of Buyer, the representations and warranties
of Sellers or the Company in this Agreement and the schedules (including updated
schedules) are not true and correct in all material respects, or if, to the
Knowledge of Buyer, there exists any material errors in, or omissions from, the
schedules (including updated schedules) to this Agreement.

discretion, offer certain Sellers (other than BMS LLC) (the "Participating
Sellers") the opportunity to contribute up to an aggregate of $15,000,000 in
Shares to Buyer in exchange for equity securities of Buyer immediately prior to
or at the Closing. The Parties hereto agree to negotiate reasonably and in good
faith any amendment to this Agreement necessary to reflect such contribution(s)
and to effect the foregoing in a tax-efficient manner for such Sellers,
including, without limitation, by amending Schedule 5.02 (to reflect the fact
that such contribution may be structured to occur immediately prior to Closing)
and permitting Buyer to assign its interest (or a portion of its interest) in
this Agreement to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Buyer (but such assignment shall
not relieve Buyer or the Guarantors of any of their obligations under this
Agreement or the Commitment Letters); provided, that, any such amendment shall
not reduce any consideration payable hereunder to any Seller that is not a
Participating Seller or increase any obligation of such Seller hereunder. Each
of the Sellers acknowledges and agrees that the foregoing offer may not be
extended to all Sellers (including such Seller). The Seller Representative shall
have the authority to act behalf of the Sellers with respect to the matters
contemplated by this Section 7.07. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
herein, if Buyer and the Participating Sellers, if any, are not able to agree to
the terms of such Participating Sellers' investment in Buyer, nothing in this
Section 7.07 shall in any way provide any Party with the right to terminate this
Agreement or seek any recourse or indemnification from any Party.

employment of any "at-will" employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiary.

                  (b)      For all purposes under the employee benefit plans of
Buyer and its Affiliates providing benefits after the Closing Date, each
employee who is as of the Closing Date an employee of the Company or the Company
Subsidiary shall be credited with his or her years of service with the Company
or the Company Subsidiary, as applicable, before the Closing Date, to the same
extent as such employee was entitled, before the Closing Date, to credit for
such service under any similar Employee Benefit Plans, except to the extent such
credit would result in a duplication of benefits. In addition, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing: (i) each employee shall be immediately
eligible to participate, without any waiting time, in any and all employee
benefit plans sponsored by Buyer and its Affiliates for the benefit of employees

(such plans, collectively, the "New Plans") to the extent coverage under such
New Plan replaces coverage under a comparable Employee Benefit Plan in which
such employee participated immediately before the Closing Date (such Plans,
collectively, the "Old Plans"); and (ii) for purposes of each New Plan providing
medical, dental, pharmaceutical or vision benefits to any employee, Buyer shall
cause all pre-existing condition exclusions and actively-at-work requirements of
such New Plan to be waived for such employee and his or her covered dependents,
and Buyer shall cause any eligible expenses incurred by such employee and his or
her covered dependents during the portion of the plan year of the Old Plan
ending on the date such employee's participation in the corresponding New Plan
begins to be taken into account under such New Plan for purposes of satisfying
all deductible, coinsurance and maximum out-of-pocket requirements applicable to
such employee and his or her covered dependents for the applicable plan year as
if such amounts had been paid in accordance with such New Plan. Buyer shall be
solely responsible for any obligations arising under COBRA with respect to all
"M&A qualified beneficiaries" as defined in Treasury Regulation Section
54.4980B-9.

                  (c)      Nothing in this Section 8.04 shall cause any employee
of the Company or any Company Subsidiary (or any of their eligible dependants or
other beneficiaries) to be a third party beneficiary of, or have any right or
claim under, this Agreement.

         8.05     Commitment Letters.
                  ------------------

         Buyer shall not terminate, amend or otherwise modify any of the

affect Buyer's ability to obtain the financings contemplated thereby without the
consent of Seller Representative.

provided, that any representation or warranty in respect of which indemnity may
be sought under Section 9.02 or under Section 9.03, and the indemnity with
respect thereto, shall survive the time at which it would otherwise terminate
pursuant to this Section 9.01 if reasonably detailed written notice of the
breach or potential breach thereof giving rise to such right or potential right
of indemnity shall have been given to the Person against whom such indemnity may
be sought prior to such time; provided, that, it shall be sufficient for any
Buyer Indemnified Party to give notice with respect to any breach or potential
breach to the Seller Representative so long as such notice identifies the
Seller(s) against whom such indemnity is sought.

applicable, of this Agreement if, prior to the date hereof, such Indemnitee (i)
had actual knowledge of any fact or circumstance and (ii) had actual knowledge
that the existence of such fact or circumstance would constitute a breach of the
particular representation or warranty set forth in Article IV, Article V or
Article VI, as applicable, of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
knowledge of a Indemnitee of a fact or circumstance shall not be construed as
evidence that the relevant Indemnitee had actual knowledge that the existence of
such fact or circumstance would constitute a breach of a particular
representation or warranty set forth in Article IV, Article V or Article VI, as
applicable, of this Agreement or that such fact or circumstance was or was not
appropriately reflected in the schedules; provided, further, that the Indemnitor

Indemnified Person under this Agreement or any other agreement delivered in
connection with the Agreement, other than as expressly set forth in Section
9.02.

         9.05     Exclusive Remedy; No Punitive Damages.
                  -------------------------------------

         Notwithstanding anything contained in this Agreement to the contrary,
after the Closing, other than with respect to fraud, the indemnification
provisions of this Article IX shall constitute the sole and exclusive remedy of
the parties hereto for any and all Losses or other claims relating to or arising
from this Agreement or any certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant

                                       43
<PAGE>

hereto and the transactions contemplated hereby. In no event shall any
Indemnitee be entitled to recover or make a claim for any amounts in respect of
punitive damages. The Parties agree that with respect to any breaches of any
covenants occurring prior to the Closing, the Parties shall have prior to the
Closing, in addition to the right to seek specific performance, the right to
seek damages with respect to any such breach.

         9.06     Manner of Payment.
                  -----------------

         Any indemnification of a Buyer Indemnified Party pursuant to Section
9.02(a) shall be effected by wire transfer of immediately available funds from
the applicable individual Seller to an account designated by Buyer within 15
days after the final determination thereof. Any indemnification of a Buyer
Indemnified pursuant to Section 9.02(b) shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from the Sellers (pro rata based upon their
respective Pro Rata Portions) to an account designated by Buyer within 15 days
after the final determination thereof. Any indemnification of a Seller
Indemnified Party pursuant to Section 9.03 shall be effected by wire transfer of
immediately available funds from Buyer or the Company to an account designated
by Seller Representative within 15 days after the final determination thereof.

         9.07     Defense of Third Party Claims.
                  -----------------------------

         Any Person making a claim for indemnification under Section 9.02 or
Section 9.03 (an "Indemnitee") shall notify the indemnifying party (an
"Indemnitor") of the claim in writing promptly after receiving written notice of
any action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or other claim against it (if by
a third party), describing the claim, the amount thereof (if known and
quantifiable) and the basis thereof. Any Indemnitor shall be entitled to
participate in the defense of such action, lawsuit, proceeding, investigation or
other claim giving rise to an Indemnitee's claim for indemnification at such
Indemnitor's expense, and at its option shall be entitled to assume the defense
thereof by appointing a reputable counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnitee to be the lead counsel in connection with such defense; provided that
the Indemnitee shall be entitled to participate in the defense of such claim and
to employ counsel of its choice for such purpose; provided, however, that the
fees and expenses of such separate counsel shall be borne by the Indemnitee. If
the Indemnitor shall control the defense of any such claim, the Indemnitor shall
obtain the prior written consent of the Indemnitee (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld) before entering into any settlement of a claim or ceasing
to defend such claim if, pursuant to or as a result of such settlement or
cessation, injunctive or other equitable relief will be imposed against the
Indemnitee or if such settlement does not expressly and unconditionally release
the Indemnitee from all liabilities and obligations with respect to such claim,
without prejudice except for payments that would be required to be paid by Buyer
representing the Deductible.

         9.08     Determination of Loss Amount.
                  ----------------------------

         The amount of any Loss subject to indemnification under Section 9.02 or
Section 9.03 shall be calculated net of (i) any Tax Benefit inuring to the
Indemnitee on account of such Loss and (ii) any insurance proceeds received by
the Indemnitee on account of such Loss. If the Indemnitee receives a Tax Benefit
after an indemnification payment is made to it, the Indemnitee shall promptly
pay to the Person or Persons that made such indemnification payment the amount

                                       44
<PAGE>

of such Tax Benefit at such time or times as and to the extent that such Tax
Benefit is realized by the Indemnitee. For purposes hereof, "Tax Benefit" shall
mean any refund of Taxes paid or reduction in the amount of Taxes which
otherwise would have been paid, in each case computed at the highest marginal
tax rates applicable to the recipient of such benefit. The Indemnitee shall seek
full recovery under all insurance policies covering any Loss to the same extent
as it would if such Loss were not subject to indemnification hereunder. In the
event that an insurance or other recovery is obtained by any Indemnitee with
respect to any Loss for which any such Indemnitee has been indemnified
hereunder, then a refund equal to the aggregate amount of the recovery shall be
made promptly to the Person or Persons that provided such indemnity payments to
such Indemnitee. Each Indemnitee shall have the obligation to mitigate any Loss
in accordance with general law.

         9.09     Non-Rescission.
                  --------------

         Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, no breach
of any representation, warranty, covenant or agreement contained herein or in
any document, certificate or other instrument delivered pursuant hereto shall
have rise to any right on the party of Buyer, the Company or any Seller to
rescind this Agreement, in whole or in part, or any of the transactions
contemplated hereby.

         9.10     Treatment of Indemnity Payments.
                  -------------------------------

         Any payments made to a Buyer Indemnified Party or a Seller Indemnified
Party pursuant to this Article IX shall be treated as an adjustment to the
Estimated Adjusted Purchase Price for tax purposes.

covenant breach, cured by Buyer within fifteen (15) days after written notice

                                       45
<PAGE>

thereof by Seller Representative (provided that neither a breach by Buyer of
Section 6.08 nor the failure of Buyer to deliver the consideration pursuant to
Section 2.03 at the Closing as required hereunder shall be subject to cure
hereunder unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Seller Representative); or

                  (d)      by Seller Representative or Buyer if the transactions
contemplated hereby have not been consummated by August 7, 2006; provided that
(i) Seller Representative shall not be entitled to terminate this Agreement

any Seller's knowing or willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and (ii) Buyer shall not be
entitled to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this Section (d) if Buyer's
knowing or willful breach of this Agreement has prevented the consummation of

included in such particular schedule to the extent that it is reasonably
apparent on its face that the disclosure in such other schedule (or updated

The inclusion of any information in any schedule (or updated schedule) shall not

                  -----------------------

independent investigation and verification of the financial condition, results
of operations, assets, liabilities, properties and projected operations of the
Company and the Company Subsidiary and, in making its determination to proceed
with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, Buyer has relied only on
the results of its own independent investigation and verification and the
representations and warranties of the Company and the Company Subsidiary
expressly and specifically set forth in this Agreement, including the schedules
(and updated schedules). SUCH REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES BY THE COMPANY AND
SELLERS CONSTITUTE THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE
COMPANY AND SELLERS TO BUYER IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY, AND BUYER UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT ALL OTHER
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND OR NATURE EXPRESS OR IMPLIED

         12.05    Release.
                  -------

                  (a)      Subject to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated by Section 2.01, for and in consideration of the amount to be paid
to each Seller under this Agreement, and the additional covenants and promises
set forth in this Agreement, each Seller, on behalf of itself and its assigns,
heirs, beneficiaries, representatives, agents and Affiliates (the "Seller
Releasing Parties"), hereby, effective as of the Closing, fully, finally and
irrevocably releases, acquits and forever discharges the Company and the Company
Subsidiary, and each of their officers, directors, partners, general partners,
limited partners, managing directors, members, stockholders, trustees,
shareholders, representatives, employees, principals, agents, Affiliates,
parents, subsidiaries, predecessors, successors, assigns, beneficiaries, heirs
and executors (collectively, the "Buyer Released Parties") from any and all

damages, demands, liabilities, obligations, costs, expenses, and compensation of
every kind and nature whatsoever, past, present, or future, at law or in equity,
whether known or unknown, contingent or otherwise, which such Seller Releasing
Parties, or any of them, had, has, or may have had at any time in the past until
and including the date of this Agreement against Buyer Released Parties, or any
of them, including but not limited to any claims which relate to or arise out of
such Seller Releasing Party's prior relationship with the Company or its rights
or status as a stockholder, officer or director of the Company (collectively,
for the purposes of this Section 12.05, "Buyer Causes of Action"); provided,
however, the term Buyer Causes of Action shall not include, and nothing
contained herein shall operate to release (i) any obligation of Buyer or any
Buyer Released Party under this Agreement or any agreement delivered in
connection herewith (including the Commitment Letters), (ii) any rights a Seller
Releasing Party may have (A) under this Agreement or any agreement delivered in
connection herewith or under any agreement with a Buyer Released Party with the
subject matter not related in any way to the Company or the Company Subsidiary,
or (B) any accrued salary, bonus, wages, benefits or other compensation earned
and unpaid through the date of the Closing or reimbursement of expenses arising
out of any Seller Releasing Party's employment with the Company or the Company
Subsidiary or (iii) any right of any Seller Releasing Party to be indemnified by
the Company or the Company Subsidiary according to the terms of the applicable
certificate of incorporation or bylaws, directors' and officers' liability
insurance and state corporate law.

                  (b)      Each Seller hereby represents to Buyer Released
Parties that such party (i) has not assigned any Causes of Action or possible
Causes of Action against any Released Party, (ii) fully intends to release all
Causes of Action against the applicable Released Parties including, without
limitation, unknown and contingent Causes of Action (other than those
specifically reserved above), and (iii) has consulted with counsel with respect
to the execution and delivery of this general release and has been fully

                                       48
<PAGE>

apprised of the consequences hereof. Furthermore, each Seller further agrees not
to institute any litigation, lawsuit, claim or action against any Buyer Released
Party with respect to the released Causes of Action.

         12.06    Nonsolicitation.
                  ---------------

         Subject to the consummation of the transactions contemplated by Section
2.01, each of the Sellers will not, and will cause each of their Affiliates not
to, for a period beginning on the Closing Date and ending on the date which is
three (3) years from and after the Closing Date (such period, the "Restricted
Period"), (i) recruit, solicit, lure or entice away any Person who is an
employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiary as of the date hereof to leave
the employ of the Company of any of its Subsidiaries, or hire any such Person,
or (ii) request or advise any Person who is a customer or supplier of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries to withdraw, curtail or cancel any such
customer's or supplier's business with the Company or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, that, the limitations set forth in clause (i) above with respect to
any non-key officer or employee of the Company or the Company Subsidiary shall
not apply to the portfolio companies of any fund managed by Lincolnshire
Management, Inc.; provided, further, that the foregoing shall not be construed
to prohibit the Sellers or any of their Affiliates after the Closing Date from
hiring or interviewing any Person who responds to any general advertisements
seeking for employees or consultants in newspapers, periodicals or other media
of general circulation (including through a recruiting firm) or any Person who
makes an unsolicited approach to any Seller or its Affiliates. If the final
judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction declares that any term or
provision of this Section 12.06 is invalid or unenforceable, the parties hereto
agree that the court making the determination of invalidity or unenforceability
will have the power to reduce the scope, duration, or area of the term or
provision, to delete specific words or phrases, or to replace any invalid or
unenforceable term or provision with a term or provision that is valid and
enforceable and that comes closest to expressing the intention of the invalid or
unenforceable term or provision, and this Agreement will be enforceable as so
modified after the expiration of the time within which the judgment may be
appealed.

         12.07    Confidentiality.
                  ---------------

         From the date hereof until the date that is three (3) years after the
Closing Date, each Party will treat and hold as confidential all of the
information, whether or not in writing, concerning the business, technology,
business relationships or financial affairs of the other Party (collectively,
"Proprietary Information") and refrain from using any of the Proprietary
Information except in connection with this Agreement; provided that LEF II and
its Affiliates may disclose to investors, potential investors, potential
portfolio companies and investment bankers or brokers the amount invested by LEF
II and its Affiliates in the Company, related investment return information, a
general description of the business of the Company and the Company Subsidiary
and describe in general terms the financial progress made by the Company during
their ownership and any strategies or enhancements implemented or suggested by
LEF II or its Affiliates (other than proprietary trade secrets). If any Party is
requested or required (by oral question or request for information or documents
in any Action) to disclose any Proprietary Information, that Party will notify
the other Party in writing promptly of the request or requirement so that such
other Party may seek an appropriate protective order or waive compliance with
this Section 12.07. If, in the absence of a protective order or the receipt of a
waiver hereunder, any Party is, on the written advice of counsel, compelled to

                                       49
<PAGE>

disclose any Proprietary Information to any governmental authority, arbitrator,
or mediator or else stand liable for contempt, that Party may disclose the
Proprietary Information to the governmental authority, arbitrator, or mediator;
provided, however, that the disclosing Party shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain, at the request and sole cost and expense of the
other Party, a court order or other assurance that confidential treatment will
be accorded to such portion of the Proprietary Information required to be
disclosed as such other Party shall designate; provided, further, any Party may
disclose any such Proprietary Information as follows: (i) to the extent that the
Proprietary Information is or becomes generally available to the public through
no fault of the Party or its Affiliates making such disclosure; (ii) to the
extent that the same information is already known by the Party making such
disclosure prior to receipt of such Proprietary Information; (iii) to the extent
that the Party that received the Proprietary Information independently develops
the same information without in any way relying on any Proprietary Information;
or (iv) to the extent that the same information becomes available to the Party
making such disclosure on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than
another Party or its Affiliates, which source, to the Knowledge of the
disclosing Party, is not prohibited from disclosing such information by a legal,
contractual or fiduciary obligation to the other Party. For purposes of this
Section 12.07 only, the term "Party" shall refer to the Sellers, on the one
hand, and Buyer (and, after the Closing, the Company and its Subsidiaries), on
the other hand.

depository institutions of the Company and the Company Subsidiary related to

by any Party hereto without the joint approval of Buyer and Seller
Representative, unless required by law (in the reasonable opinion of counsel) in
which case Buyer and Seller Representative shall have the right to review such
press release, announcement or communication prior to its issuance, distribution
or publication.

         13.03    Expenses.
                  --------

of any such breach, in addition to any other remedy they may have at law or in
equity, the Parties (including the Seller Representative (on behalf of any

defenses it may have to the remedy of specific performance provided for herein.

means, shall be treated in all manner and respects as an original agreement or
instrument and shall be considered to have the same binding legal effect as if
it were the original signed version thereof delivered in person. At the request
of any Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument, each other Party
hereto or thereto shall reexecute original forms thereof and deliver them to all
other parties. No Party hereto or to any such agreement or instrument shall
raise the use of a facsimile machine or other electronic means to deliver a
signature or the fact that any signature or agreement or instrument was
transmitted or communicated through the use of a facsimile machine or other
electronic means as a defense to the formation or enforceability of a contract
and each such Party forever waives any such defense.

Re:  Acquisition of Bankruptcy Management Solutions, Inc. (the "Company")

Gentlemen:

         [Charlesbank Equity Fund VI, Limited Partnership / Ocwen Financial
Corp.] ("[Charlesbank/Ocwen]") is pleased to confirm its agreement to purchase
(the "[Charlesbank/Ocwen] Investment") equity securities of [_______] ("Buyer"),
on the terms and subject to the conditions contained herein. Capitalized terms
used but not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings assigned to such
terms in the Stock Purchase Agreement, dated as of the date hereof, by and among
Buyer, the Company and the stockholders and warrant holder of the Company
parties thereto (as amended, restated or otherwise modified from time to time,
the "Purchase Agreement").

         1.       Investment. Subject to the terms and conditions herein,
[Charlesbank/Ocwen] agrees to purchase, immediately prior to the Closing,
securities of Buyer (the "Buyer Securities") for an aggregate purchase price
equal to $[Charlesbank and Ocwen shall commit to $80 million each] in cash
(reduced on a dollar-for-dollar basis by the value of shares of the Company's
capital stock contributed to Buyer by certain management stockholders of the
Company in exchange for equity securities of Buyer) (the "Purchase Price"). The
proceeds therefrom will be used by Buyer to pay at the Closing the Estimated
Adjusted Purchase Price and for Buyer to make all other payments required by it
under the Purchase Agreement and to pay all of Buyer's related fees and
expenses. The Purchase Price shall be paid by [Charlesbank/Ocwen] in cash by
wire transfer of immediately available funds. Buyer agrees to sell and issue
Buyer Securities to [Charlesbank/Ocwen] and to use the proceeds from the
[Charlesbank/Ocwen] Investment solely for the purposes described in this
paragraph 1. In no event shall [Charlesbank/Ocwen] be under any obligation under
any circumstances to contribute or cause to be contributed more than the
Purchase Price to Buyer.

         2.       Conditions to Consummation of the [Charlesbank/Ocwen]
Investment. The obligations of [Charlesbank/Ocwen] and Buyer to consummate the
[Charlesbank/Ocwen] Investment shall be absolute and not subject to any
condition precedent other than the satisfaction or waiver in writing by Buyer of
the conditions precedent to Buyer's obligation to consummate the transactions
contemplated by the Purchase Agreement set forth in Article III of the Purchase
Agreement.

         3.       Term of this Letter Agreement. This letter agreement shall
expire on the earlier to occur of (i) the Closing Date and (ii) the date on
which the Purchase Agreement is terminated in accordance with its terms.

         4.       Third Party Beneficiary. Each Seller (including the Seller
Representative in its capacity as a Seller and as the Seller Representative) is
an express third party beneficiary of the terms hereof and may enforce this
letter to the same extent as if it were a party hereto.
<PAGE>

         5.       Specific Performance. Each of [Charlesbank/Ocwen] and Buyer
recognizes and acknowledges that a breach by it of any covenant or agreement
contained in this letter agreement will cause the Company and the Sellers to
sustain damages for which they would not have an adequate remedy at law for
money damages, and therefore each of [Charlesbank/Ocwen] and Buyer agrees that
in the event of any such breach, in addition to any other remedy the Company or
any Seller may have at law or in equity, the Company or the Seller
Representative (on behalf of any Seller) shall be entitled to the remedy of
specific performance of this letter agreement without any requirement that a
bond or other security be posted. Each of [Charlesbank/Ocwen] and Buyer, to the
maximum extent permitted by law, hereby waives any defenses it may have to the
remedy of specific performance provided for herein.

         6.       Miscellaneous. This letter agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts each of which when so executed shall be an original, but
all of which together shall constitute one and the same agreement. This letter
agreement may be amended only by a written instrument signed by
[Charlesbank/Ocwen] and Buyer and only with the prior written consent of the
Company. This letter agreement may not be assigned by [Charlesbank/Ocwen] or
Buyer without the prior written consent of the Company. The provisions of this
letter agreement contain the entire understanding of [Charlesbank/Ocwen] and
Buyer with respect to the subject matter hereof and supersede any prior written
instruments executed by such parties. This letter agreement shall be construed
in accordance with and governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of
New York (without giving effect to any conflicts of law provisions thereof).


                                           Very truly yours,
